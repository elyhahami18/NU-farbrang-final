Tze'enah Ure'enah

Bereshit

“<i>When God began to create Heaven and Earth</i>” [1:1]. In the beginning of the creation of heaven and earth, the earth was desolate, empty and darkness was over the void.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 1:1. Rashi calls this the plain meaning of these words.</i> The Holy One’s <i>Throne of Glory</i> hovered in the air over the water.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 1:2.</i> Why did the Torah begin with [the letter] <i>bet?</i> It teaches us that the world is similar to the <i>bet</i> that has three sides and the fourth is open. So too is the world. The Holy One closed three sides and on the north side, the Holy One did not make a heaven. Why? The Holy One wanted to say to the nations of world, let your false gods come and let them close the fourth wall. Since you have chosen them as gods, let them see what they can do.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 1:1.</i>
Another interpretation is that the <i>bet</i> is <i>berakhah</i> (blessing) and the <i>aleph</i> is <i>arur</i> (cursed). Therefore, the Holy One began with the <i>bet.</i> The <i>aleph</i> flew before the Holy One and said, begin the Torah with me. I am the first <i>letter</i> of the <i>alphabet.</i> The Holy One said, I will give the <i>Ten Commandments</i> on Mount Sinai and I will begin with the <i>aleph.</i> “<i>I the Lord am your God</i>” [Exodus, 20:2].<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Genesis Rabbah,</i> 1.10. <i>Anokhi</i> [I] begins with an <i>aleph.</i></i> That is why the Torah begins with the word <i>bereshit.</i> This teaches us that the world was created for the sake of the Torah, which is called “<i>the beginning of His course</i>” [Proverbs, 8:22], and because of Israel, which is called “<i>the first fruits of His harvest</i>” [Jeremiah, 2:3].<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Genesis Rabbah,</i> 1.4. This is a word play on the words <i>bereshit</i> and <i>reshit.</i> Both verses cited contain <i>reshit</i> which can be translated as beginning or first depending on the context.</i>
<i>Rabbi Isaac</i> said: Why did the Torah write about how the world was created? Since the Torah is nothing but the Holy One’s commandments, and the Torah should only have discussed the Holy One’s commandments. However, the <i>nations of the world</i> will say later to Israel, why are you conquering and stealing the <i>land of Israel?</i> Then Israel will answer, the Holy One created the world and he can give it to whomever he wishes.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 1:1.</i>
Our sages said that the Holy One created the world in three ways: for the sake of the Torah, which is called “<i>the beginning of His path</i>” [Proverbs, 8:22], for the sake of the <i>sacrifices</i> that were offered in the <i>Temple</i>, which is called <i>first</i>, because the <i>Temple</i> was created before the world. The third is that the world was created for the sake of <i>charity</i> and <i>tithes</i>, which are called “<i>the first fruits of your new grain</i>” [Deuteronomy, 18:4].<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Genesis Rabbah,</i> 1.4.</i> Since the first verse of the Torah alludes to the <i>Temple</i>, it also shows us how it will be destroyed.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Genesis Rabbah,</i> 2.5.</i> That is why it says, “<i>and the earth was desolate and unformed</i>” [Genesis, 1:2]. The earth will be desolate, since the <i>Shekhinah</i> will depart after the destruction [of the Temple].<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Yoma,</i> 21b.</i> Therefore, God said, “<i>and the spirit of God hovered over the waters</i>” [Genesis, 1:2]. This shows us that when we will be in <i>exile</i>, the Torah will not leave us and we will also have the Torah in exile.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 1:2.</i> Therefore, it also says, “<i>God said, let there be light</i>” [Genesis, 1:3]. This shows us that at the end of the exile the Holy One will create light for us and will send us the Messiah, concerning whom it is written, “<i>Arise, shine, for your light has dawned</i>” [Isaiah, 60:1]. This means, come arise and illumine us with your light. This passage teaches us that the Holy One tells Israel what will happen and that the world was created for the sake of the Messiah.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Sanhedrin,</i> 98b.</i>
“<i>God said, let there be light and there was light</i>” [1:3]. The Holy One created two lights. One light is the sun and the other light is the moon. They illumine the world, and the Holy One created another light for the righteous for when the Messiah will come. That light is very great, but the world was not worthy of such a great light. Therefore, the Holy One hid the light for the righteous [in the world to come].<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Genesis Rabbah,</i> 12.6.</i> <i>Rabbi Simeon</i> said:<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Genesis Rabbah,</i> 3.5.</i> Light is mentioned five times in this [Torah] portion for the five books that comprise the Torah, since the Torah is compared to a light. The first, “<i>let there be light</i>,” relates to <i>the book of Genesis</i>, with which the Holy One created the world. The second time it says “<i>let there be light</i>” relates to <i>the book of Exodus</i>, when Israel left the <i>Egyptian exile</i>, from the darkness to the light, as it is written concerning the <i>redemption</i>, “<i>but all the Israelites enjoyed light in their dwellings</i>” [Exodus, 10:23]. The third time it says “<i>And God saw the light</i>” [1:4] relates to <i>the book of Leviticus</i> that is full of <i>laws and rules</i> that illumine like a light. The fourth time it says, “<i>God separated the light</i> [from the darkness]” [1:4]. This relates to <i>the book of Numbers</i> in which the Israelites were separated from their previous evil deeds. The fifth time it says “<i>God called the light day</i>” [1:5] relates to <i>the book of Deuteronomy</i>, which is nothing but commandments and laws that shine like a light. This shows us that there are five lights. One light is that the world was created. The second light is the redemption, which is compared to a light. The third light is the light of repentance. When one repented, he attained the light. This is <i>the book of Leviticus</i> that teaches about the sacrifices the person brought when he repented of his sins. The fourth light is the <i>Temple.</i> The fifth light is the Torah and its commandments. The verse “<i>let there be light</i>” [1:3] teaches us that God created the world from the light. As soon as the Holy One said, “<i>let there be light</i>,” the world began to be created. The word “<i>And it was</i>” has the numerical value of twenty-five, which shows that the world was created on the twenty-fifth of <i>Ellul.</i> As the Talmud says, the world was created in Tishrei.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Rosh Hashanah,</i> 27a.</i> That is to say, the creation was completed in Tishrei, since Adam was created on Rosh Hashanah, which is the same as <i>Rosh Hodesh Tishrei.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Pesikta de-Rab Kahana,</i> 23.1.</i> When Adam was created, the creation of the whole world had been completed, and everything had been created previously. <i>Adam</i> was created, in the expectation that the person should not be arrogant. He should think that the wild and domestic animals are better than the person, since they were created first.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Sanhedrin,</i> 38a.</i> Another explanation is that before the person was created, all of creation was created, so that the person would find everything prepared.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Sanhedrin,</i> 38a.</i>
“<i>God called the light Day and the darkness He called Night. And there was evening and there was morning, a first day</i>” [1:5]. And the Holy One called the light day, and the darkness He called night. And it was evening and it was morning, one day.
“<i>And God said, let there be an expanse, etc.</i>” [1:6]. God told the sky to strengthen itself between the waters. The first day the sky was still weak. The Holy One admonished them on the second day and the sky spread out of fear of the Holy One.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 1:6.</i>
“<i>Among the water</i>” [1:6]. The heaven made a separation between the waters above the heaven and the water that is on the earth. There are waters above the heaven like there are on the earth. The waters above the heaven are as high above the heaven as the distance between heaven and earth. The waters above the sky hang in the air by the command of God.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Genesis Rabbah,</i> 4.3.</i> The waters argued with the waters above heaven and said, why should we remain below on the earth? We also want to be above heaven. The Holy One promised the waters on the earth that no sacrifice will be brought on the altar, unless one has salt with it and the salt comes from the water.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Leviticus, 2:13. Bahya and Ramban also cite this concept in the name of Rashi. The midrashic source is not clear according to C.D. Chavel in his edition of Rashi’s commentary.</i>
Concerning each day, the Holy One wrote, “<i>it was good</i>,” but for the second day “<i>it was good</i>” is not written. This is because the creation of the second day was not completed. Therefore it is not written, “<i>it was good</i>” since the waters were not properly created on the second day, but the creation of the water was completed on the third day.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Genesis Rabbah,</i> 4.6.</i> That is why God said, “<i>it was good</i>” two times, once when the creation of the waters was completed. The second time because the earth was repaired on the third day. Some sages say, “<i>it was good</i>” is not mentioned on the second day because Gehenna was created on the second day.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Genesis Rabbah,</i> 4.6.</i> Some sages say that discord began on the second day because the waters were in conflict on that day.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Genesis Rabbah,</i> 4.6.</i> That is why “<i>it was good</i>” is not mentioned on the second day.
Nothing good comes from discord. As a result of discord being created on the second day, Gehenna was also created on the second day, because one who engages in discord falls into Gehenna, as happened to <i>Korah.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers, 16:32.</i> The Talmud writes in [tractate] <i>Baba Bathra chapter, five.</i> Rabbah Bar Bar Hana said: he was once walking in the desert. A merchant came and said to him. I will show you where <i>Korah</i> was swallowed up by the earth. He saw a split in the earth and smoke emerging from it. He took a spear and put some wool on it and placed the spear over the split, and the fire in the split singed it. He heard from the same split someone screaming, <i>Moses</i> is true and his Torah is true and we are false liars. Every thirty days the fires of Gehenna are changed for them so they should endure various troubles and they scream, <i>Moses</i> is true and his Torah is true.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Baba Bathra,</i> 74a.</i> Therefore, every person should be warned about not awakening discord.
Some sages also say that one should not begin any new work on Monday because “<i>it was good</i>” was not written concerning Monday.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Ginzberg, <i>Legends of the Jews</i>, 5: 39, believes this to be a medieval tradition.</i> There was discord every day after Monday. We find discord on the third day when the Holy One ordered that the earth should bring forth a tree that will taste like an apple. The earth did not do this. Instead, the tree was wood and the apple had a different taste.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Genesis Rabbah,</i> 5.9.</i> On the fourth day the discord was that the moon said, why should the sun shine, since it wanted to shine alone? The Holy One made it and its light smaller.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Genesis Rabbah,</i> 6.3.</i> The fifth day there was also discord. The wife of <i>Leviathan</i> was killed and pickled in brine for the righteous in the days of the Messiah.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Baba Bathra,</i> 74b.</i> On the sixth day, <i>Adam</i> sinned and was expelled from the <i>Garden of Eden.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis, 3.</i> Thus, we can see that discord was present from the second day on.
“<i>Let the waters be gathered</i>” [1:9]. On the third day, the Holy One said that all the waters should be gathered in one area so that the land may be seen. All the waters gathered in one area and this is the <i>great sea.</i> The Holy One then told the earth to sprout grass, vegetation and every sort of tree. When the Holy One told the earth to sprout trees that would have the <i>taste</i> of fruit, the earth did not do this. Therefore, it was cursed with <i>Adam.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Genesis Rabbah,</i> 5.9.</i>
“<i>Let there be lights</i>” [1:14]. On the fourth day God said there should be lights in the sky. Though the lights already existed on the first day, they were not hung in the sky until the fourth day when the Holy One hung the sun and the moon in the sky along with all of the constellations and stars.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Hagigah,</i> 12a.</i> When the sun will be eclipsed, this will be a sign that God will cause the <i>Ishmaelites</i><sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Ishmaelites originally referred to Arabs. After the rise of Islam it became a term for Islam or Muslims.</i> to be defeated.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Sukkah,</i> 29a.</i>
When <i>Israel, heaven forbid</i>, will be bad, the moon will be eclipsed to show that God is angry at Israel. The sun and moon are signs for when to pray. In the morning, the dawning of the sun is a sign that it is time to don the phylacteries and recite the Shema. In the evening, the emergence of the stars indicates it is again time to pray.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">M. <i>Berakhot,</i> 1:1–2.</i> The sun and the moon were given to the <i>festivals</i>, so that we should know when to celebrate the <i>festivals</i> that we calculate according to the moon. Also, to know when it is day and night and when the year ends.
<i>Rabbi Azariah</i> said: Only the sun was created to illumine. However, the Holy One said, the nations [of the world] will consider the sun an object of <i>idolatrous worship</i> if it were to be the sole illumination. Therefore, the Holy One created the moon so that they should not worship the sun as <i>an idol.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Genesis Rabbah,</i> 6.1.</i>
The sun and the moon had equal illumination, but the moon said: why should we both illumine? I should illumine by myself. The Holy One said: you must become small because you wanted to consider yourself important and illumine by yourself. Therefore, she must be small.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Hullin,</i> 60b.</i>
<i>Bahya</i> writes in <i>parshat Phinehas.</i> Why is it written: “<i>a sin offering to the Lord</i>” [Numbers, 28:15], regarding <i>the sacrifice for the New Moon</i> more than all the sacrifices?<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">The New Moon is the only festival that requires a sin offering in addition to the festival sacrifice and Bahya’s question is why is this so?</i> The Holy One created the sun and the moon equal in illumination, but the moon receives its light from the sun. The moon itself is dark, but it shines from the sun. The moon said to the Holy One. <i>Lord of the Universe</i>, did you not have the power that I should have my own illumination and the sun and I would be equal and equally useful in the world. Heaven forbid, that the <i>nations of the world</i> should say that you did not have the power to make me a separate light. The Holy One became angry and said: do you want to teach me? He said: your light must be diminished because you have spoken against me. Even the light that you have from the sun must be diminished. The moon said: <i>Lord of the Universe</i>, because I have spoken properly, my light should be diminished? The Holy One responded: I know well why I created your light so that it should be from the sun. However, because you have spoken properly, my children, Israel, will bring a sacrifice every <i>New Moon</i> when the moon shows itself and becomes renewed. The sun was to illumine the day and he moon illumines at night. If the sun was to illumine the day and the moon illumines the night equally, there would be no difference between day and night. The Holy One said that people must know when it is day or night. They need to know when to rest at night from their business or work. If it were light at night like during the day, people would work at night like during the day and would have no rest and would soon die from overwork. Furthermore, the Holy One said: one must have the night to study Torah. The people must have quiet so that they study well.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Avodah Zarah,</i> 3b.</i> The Holy One showed that when one repents, He is satisfied with the person, as we find with the moon. The Holy One told us to bring a sacrifice on the <i>New Moon</i> when the moon appears. The Holy One said; bring the sacrifice for my sake, for what I have done against the moon. That is why it is written regarding the <i>sacrifice for the New Moon,</i> “<i>a sin offering to God.</i>” This means, a sacrifice to God, that is to say, for God’s sake.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Numbers, 28:15.</i>
“<i>Let the waters bring forth swarms</i>” [1:20]. The Holy One said on the fifth day that living things should swarm and become created from the water, flying things and all the fish, also the great fish, <i>Leviathan</i> and his wife. The Holy One saw that if <i>Leviathan</i> would have relations with his wife and have children, they might destroy the world with their strength. That is why the Holy One killed the female and pickled her in brine for the righteous to eat in the days of the Messiah. The Holy One killed the female and not the male, because if the female remained alive, she would have relations with other fish and would have large children who would have overturned the world.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Baba Bathra,</i> 74b.</i> However, if the male would have relations with other fish, their offspring would not be large fish.
The Holy One blessed the fish more than other creatures in that though people catch fish, yet they are free and have no master. This is because the Holy One wrote them a blessing that they should multiply even if many of them are caught.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 1:22.</i> The wild animals also don’t have any masters, are free and many of them are caught, yet the Holy One did not write a blessing for the wild animals because the snake was also a wild animal and the Holy One wanted to curse it. That is why the Holy One did not write a blessing for any wild animal so that the snake should not be included in the same blessing.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Midrash Tadshe</i> 1, in A. Jellinek, <i>Bet ha-Midrash,</i> 3: 164.</i>
Several fish in this verse [1:21] are called “<i>great sea monsters.</i>” They are fish that are many hundreds of miles long, as the Talmud also discusses in [tractate] <i>Baba Bathra</i>, <i>chapter five. Rabbah Bar Bar Hana</i> said: “the sea cast up a fish so large that sixty cities ate from it and sixty cities pickled it in brine to eat from it. From one eye, three hundred measures of oil and fat were extracted. After a year I returned and people were sawing large pillars from the bones for buildings in the same city.”<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Baba Bathra,</i> 73b.</i>
Furthermore, the same <i>Rabbah Bar Bar Hana</i> said: “I was once in the ocean and saw a big fish whose back came out of the water and there was sand on its back. We left the boat and went on the back of this fish thinking it was a mountain and made a fire in order to cook. The fire was large, and when the fish felt the fire it turned over. If the boat were not near the fish we would have all drowned.”<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Baba Bathra,</i> 73b.</i> <i>Bahya</i> writes, because God blessed the fish, that is why they survived the Flood when all other things, except for the fish, were lost.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 1:22.</i>
“<i>Let us make man</i>” [1:26]. On the sixth day, the Holy One said, we will create a person. The Holy One teaches us that that a person should not be arrogant and should consult with and seek advice from other people when he wants to do something. Even if the other people are of lower status, he should ask them. Therefore, the Holy One also asked the angels, because the person’s face looks like that of an angel and the angels would be jealous of the person. That is also why the Holy One said to the angels, we will create a person. However, in no way did anyone assist Him in the creation, but the Holy One himself created him, as the verse says, “<i>And God created man</i>” [1:27]. This means, that God alone created the person. The Holy One said that if there would not be a figure on the earth similar to the angels in heaven, there would be envy among the creatures. Therefore, the Holy One created the equivalent of the angels, a person, with their understanding and form. The Holy One then said that the person should “rule over the fish in the sea, the birds in the air and the animals on the earth” [1: 26].<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 1:26–27. The verse at the end of the comment is in Yiddish.</i>
<i>Sefer Bahya</i> writes: since the verse says, “<i>God blessed them and God said to them, be fertile and increase</i>” [1:28], there were two blessings for the person. The first blessing was that his food and drink should be blessed in his body because the body is damaged every day and with the food it becomes whole. The person’s humors are dried out in two ways. The first is because the person has internal heat that dries out his humors and dampness. The second is the wind that blows on the person and dries his humors. Therefore, he makes his humors damp with the food and drink. The Holy One gave him blessings that the food should be disseminated through all of his organs and it should only replenish that which is expended every day by his humors, not more not less, in order that he should remain healthy.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">The theory of the four “humors” and their relation to health is a standard aspect of medieval science.</i> The second blessing was “<i>be fruitful and multiply</i>” [1:28], that the person should have sexual relations with his wife and should have many children to worship the Holy One and recognize their Creator.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 1:28.</i>
The Holy One said that the person should eat fruits and everything that is planted in the earth. However, the domestic and wild animals and birds should not eat the fruit, but what was planted, but [should eat] the grass. However, in no way should the person eat the meat of any creature, because they have a soul just like the person. Though they are not equal in many respects, there is a certain value in their souls. However, after the Flood, when domestic and wild animals and the birds became corrupted, the Holy One said that man was allowed to eat meat.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban, Genesis, 1:29.</i> <i>Noah</i> was righteous in <i>the generation of the Flood</i>, and through his merit the creatures survived. Therefore, God gave Noah permission to eat meat. That is why our Sages said that, “an ignoramus is not allowed to eat meat.”<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Pesahim,</i> 49b.</i> That is to say, because he is an ignoramus. Why should he be better than an animal? When a person does not study Torah, he is the same as the animal, since the soul of man was created for nothing other than to study Torah, to understand the greatness of the Holy One and to perform commandments.
The <i>Rabbati</i> writes in this portion.<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">The author uses the term “Rabbati” as a generic term for <i>Midrash Rabbah.</i> This is not a reference to a later Midrash known as <i>Genesis Rabbati.</i></i> <i>Rabbi Simon</i> says that when the Holy One wanted to create man, the angels separated into two groups. One group said that he should not be created because he is nothing but falsehoods. The other group said that he should be created because he does <i>charitable deeds and acts of loving-kindness.</i> Some said that he should not be created because he is not peaceful and he readily engages on quarrels. What did the Holy One do? He took truth and threw it down from Heaven to the earth.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">Daniel, 8:12.</i> That is to say, the Holy One said [to the angels] that the person is better than you are. You are nothing but reason and good inclination and have no evil inclination, so you must always be pious. However, the human on the earth has an evil inclination which incites him to evil and when he becomes pious, it is a greater novelty than you angels. Regarding what you say that he is full of falsehoods and will quarrel and sin, I will let him die so that he will fear death and will be pious. I will take back the holy soul and will purify it in Gehenna, and then it will again come to its place, to the Throne of Glory. Thus, I will not lose it.<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Genesis Rabbah,</i> 8.5.</i>
Therefore <i>Rabbi Simon</i> said: the <i>Holy One</i> threw <i>Truth</i> down from the heavens. This means that <i>Emet</i><sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">In Hebrew the word “<i>emet</i>” is spelled <i>Aleph</i>, <i>Mem</i>, <i>Tav.</i></i> [truth] is [an acronym for] A<i>ron</i> [coffin], M<i>itah</i> [bier], T<i>akhrikhim</i> [shrouds]. That is to say that the person must die and one lies in the coffin dressed in shrouds and he is carried on a bier to the grave. Therefore, the Holy One said that the person would be pious because he must die. Thus, he will not be arrogant. Concerning this, our sages said about this, “<i>and it was very good</i>” [1:31], meaning that death is very good for the person.<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Genesis Rabbah,</i> 9.5.</i> The righteous person has his true life after his death, when he comes under the <i>Throne of Glory.</i> Concerning this, the verse says, “<i>the death of His faithful is precious in the Lord</i>’<i>s sight</i>” [Psalms, 116:15]. This means, what He does to the pious is good in His sight. That is to say, the Holy One would not even have created the pious if there were no death. Even the pious have to sin, but death is good, for through it the righteous person will come to his rest.
Afterwards, the angels said to the Holy One, <i>Lord of the Universe</i>, why do you shame your treasure and seal and throw it to the earth where it will be lost? That is to say, the person is created in the form and seal of the Holy One<i>,</i> and now you want to destroy the same form. You want to kill him. It would be better if you hid your seal in the holy heavens. The Holy One responded: <i>raise up the truth from the earth.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Genesis Rabbah,</i> 8.5.</i> That is, through <i>emet</i>, coffin, bier, shrouds, through the person’s death he returns from the earth to Heaven. As the Gemara explains, “three have a share in a person, father, mother, and the Holy One.”<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Nidah,</i> 31a.</i> When the person dies, the Holy One says: Father and mother, take your share and I will take my share, the soul, so that my seal will return to me.
<i>Rabbi Huna</i> said: When the angels were quarreling with each other, some said that man should be created and some were opposed. The Holy One went and created man and said to the angels: Why are you quarreling? I have already reached a compromise. Rabbi Huna also said in the name of Rabbi: The Holy One created man with wisdom so that the angels should not be able to complain to God. He first created the domestic and wild animals and the birds and the sun and moon and everything on the earth. The angels said to God: for what reason do you wish to create this sinful person. The Holy One responded: what purpose will the domestic and wild animals and birds and all the rest of creation serve, without man? The angels could not respond. Therefore, the Holy One created everything before the person, so that the angels should not be able to respond to God against the creation of man. Concerning this, the verse says, “<i>Your justice like the great deep; man and beast You deliver, O Lord</i>” [Psalms, 36:7]. This means, because You know well that justice is on the side of the angels who are opposed to the creation of man. Therefore, You first created the world of domestic and other beasts that are in the category of animals, to await the creation of man, expecting that the person should not become evil. This means, “<i>man and beast You deliver, O Lord</i>” [Psalms, 36:7]. That is to say, you helped man with the animals since if you had not first created the animals, the angels would not have agreed to the creation of man. A parable. A king has many goods and wealth and much good wine and meat, but has no guests to honor. What does this help him, if he cannot show his glory and his wealth? It is the same if there had been many creatures in the world and the person would not be there. Who could recognize the glory and might of the Holy One?<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Genesis Rabbah,</i> 8.5–6.</i>
“<i>The sixth day</i>” [1:31]. The Torah wrote an extra “<i>Heh</i>” when the person was created. The Holy One stipulated that if Israel will study the Torah, which has <i>five parts</i> which includes, <i>Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy</i>, then the world will continue to exist. The extra “<i>Heh</i>” shows us this. The extra “<i>Heh</i>” further shows us that everything was created in fives. On the first day, five lights were created. On the second day, five heavens, and <i>water</i> is mentioned five times on the second day. On the third day five kinds of plants sprouted from the earth. On the fourth day,<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">It says the fourth day, but actually refers to the fifth day.</i> all living things that have five sorts of movement. Some that walk on two feet, some on four feet, some crawl on their stomach, some fly and some who swim. And on the fourth day, five types of lights, the sun and the moon and stars and the day which illumines and the constellations which also illumine. On the sixth day, the person was created whose soul has five names. It is called, <i>Nefesh, Ruah, Neshamah, Hayah, Yehidah.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 1:31.</i>
It is known that the person was created with something different from all other creatures. All other creatures have no conflict in their creation, but for the person, conflict is in his body. When he wants to perform a commandment, there is the evil inclination to oppose him. If he wants to commit a sin, the good inclination opposes him. Thus, he must have conflict all his life. Why did the Holy One create him so, with conflict, not with quietude? The Holy One did this to the person so that he will have honor, because he has the choice to do what he wants. However, the domestic and wild animals have no evil inclination and no good inclination. Their nature is that they must do evil to eat and drink and fulfill all of their desires. The angels also do not have the choice to do what they want because they have nothing but reason and a good inclination and they must always be good. Because no other creature in the world has free will, the Holy One wanted to create a creature that will have the choice to do what he wants. The person is like the Holy One in this respect. The Holy One has the choice to do what he wants. The person is the same in that the person can do what he wants. The person could do what he wanted before he ate from the apple. However, his nature was always good and not evil. As soon as he ate from the apple, he began to do evil and good. Therefore, the tree is called “<i>the tree of knowledge of good and bad</i>” [Genesis, 2:17]. This means, the one who eats from the tree has the understanding to do good and bad. Therefore, the Holy One did not say about any other creature, “<i>let us make it in our image</i>” [1:26]. This means, we will create a creature in our form, but concerning the person it is written, “<i>let us make man in our image</i>” [1:26]. This means, we will create man in our image. That is to say, he should have the choice to do everything I do and in his honor the Torah wrote concerning man, “<i>And God created man in His image, in the image of God He created him</i>” [1:27]. Therefore the angels wanted to sing praises to <i>Adam</i> and wanted to worship him when the Holy One told them that man has the free will to do what he wants, like the Holy One. What did the Holy One do? He put the person to sleep.<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Genesis Rabbah,</i> 8.10.</i> That is to say, you angels are better than the person. Though the person has the choice to do what he wants, but when sleep comes upon him he can do neither good nor evil. However, you angels are awake all the time and fulfill your tasks. That is why the angels are called <i>guardian angels</i>, because they are always awake. Why were the domestic and wild animals created on the sixth day along with man? The reason is that when the person will be pious, he will be better than all of the domestic and wild animals. However, when he will be bad, he will be worse than all the animals because he has the understanding to do good, but he was evil.<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Genesis, 1:26–27.</i>
“<i>On the seventh day God finished</i>” [2:2]. The Holy One completed all of creation on the seventh day. The word “<i>vayekhal</i>” [finished] in Yiddish is, desires, because the Holy One found everything he created on the sixth day desirable on the seventh day. Therefore, he said, “<i>on the seventh day God finished.</i>” This means, He found everything He had created desirable. That is, he was pleased and desired that it should remain this way eternally.<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Genesis, 2:1–3.</i>
“<i>And He blessed, and He sanctified</i>” [2:3]. The Holy One blessed the <i>Sabbath</i> so that the person has an additional soul, in addition to the one during the week.<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Bezah,</i> 16a.</i> Therefore, when the <i>Sabbath</i> ends we recite the <i>blessing</i> over <i>spices</i>, because a <i>soul</i> has departed.
“<i>And He sanctified</i>” [2:3]. The Holy One sanctified the <i>Sabbath</i> and did not work on the Sabbath.<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 2:3.</i> “<i>Because on it God ceased from all the work of creation that He had done</i>” [2:3]. That is to say, the six days are essentially related to the six thousand years that the world will exist. On the first day, the light was created, corresponding to the first thousand years that <i>Adam</i> lived. This was the light of the world through which he recognized his creator. On the next day He created the heaven between the waters and the heaven separated the waters. This corresponds to <i>Noah</i> who was separated from the evildoers who were in his generation. They were drowned in the waters during the Flood. “<i>It was good</i>” is not written for the second day because the Flood corresponds to the second day. On the third day, the earth was seen and trees and fruits grew. This corresponds to the third thousand years after the creation of the world and Abraham was born during this time. His children accepted <i>the Torah and commandments</i> that are equivalent to the fruits of the world. On the fourth day, two lights were created, one large and one small. These correspond to the fourth thousand years during which the two <i>Temples</i> existed and were a great light for Israel. On the fifth day, birds and fish in the water were created. They correspond to the fifth thousand years that we are in exile and we are free as birds among the nations and we are hunted like fish, without <i>mercy.</i> On the sixth day, the person was created. This corresponds to the sixth thousand years when the <i>Messiah</i> will come. Just as <i>Adam</i> was created in God’s image, so too the <i>Messiah</i> is anointed by God and the <i>spirit of the Holy One</i> will rest on him. Therefore one rests on the Sabbath corresponding to the <i>rest</i> we will have in the days of the <i>Messiah.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban, Genesis, 2:3.</i>
The <i>Rabbati</i> writes in this <i>Torah portion</i> that the Holy One blessed the <i>Sabbath</i> that one should honor it with good food and the Holy One will make him wealthy. <i>Rabbi Hiyya</i> the son of <i>Abba said:</i> one time <i>a householder</i> in the city of Lydda invited me to his house. He placed before us a table made of silver that was carried by sixteen men. On that table were all the things that were created during <i>the six days of creation.</i> A child sat in the middle of the table and called out, “<i>The earth is the Lord</i>’<i>s and all that it holds, the world and its inhabitants</i>” [Psalms, 24:1]. This means, everything belongs to God, the whole world and everything that is in it. That is to say, they called out this verse so that <i>the householder</i> should not boast and be arrogant. I said to him, what kind of merit did you have that you were worthy to have a great fortune. He answered that he was a butcher and every time that he had a good cow, he kept it for the Sabbath, from Sunday until the Sabbath. I said to him, I know well that the Holy One gives good fortune and blessing and similar things to those who honestly observe the festivals with food. God also rewards him in this world and makes him wealthy.<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Genesis Rabbah,</i> 11.4.</i>
The <i>Rabbati</i> also writes in this Torah portion. <i>Rabbi Tanhumah</i> said: a story happened to a <i>nobleman.</i> He sent his servant on <i>the eve of Yom Kippur</i> to buy fish. When the servant reached the fishmonger, a <i>Jewish</i> tailor also came there and competed with the nobleman for the fish and paid twelve ducats for it. The tailor took the fish and the <i>nobleman</i> was angry with the servant that he had no fish. The servant responded that a Jewish tailor purchased the fish for twelve ducats. The nobleman sent for the Jew. The nobleman asked him: why did you pay more for the fish than my servant? The Jew said to him, how could I not buy fish and other good things? Tomorrow, we have a day where the Holy One forgives our sins that we commit the whole year. How could I not be happy? The nobleman responded, you are right. The same tailor split the fish and found a pearl in it, from which he was able to live well for the rest of his life and he no longer had to be a tailor.<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Genesis Rabbah,</i> 11.4.</i>
<i>Rabbi Eliezer</i> said in the name of <i>Rabbi Yose.</i> The Holy One blessed the Sabbath with good taste, so that the food on the Sabbath tastes better than during the weekdays. Rabbi [Judah the Prince] invited the <i>emperor Antoninus</i> to a banquet on the <i>Sabbath.</i> He served the emperor cold food and it tasted very good to him. Later, he made another banquet during the week and served him warm food. The emperor said to Rabbi [Judah], give me the cold food since it tastes better. Rabbi [Judah] responded that there was the lack of spices in it. The emperor said: don’t I have enough spices in my treasury? Rabbi [Judah] responded, the spice is the Sabbath, the day that is blessed with good taste.<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Genesis Rabbah,</i> 11.4.</i>
<i>The evil Turnus Rufus</i> asked why is the Sabbath better than the other days of the week. <i>Rabbi Akiva</i> answered him: why are you more important than other people? He answered that the king made me important and wants that I should be respected. Rabbi Akiva said: the Holy One also wants that the Sabbath should be more respected than the other days. The evil one said: and with what do you want to prove that the Sabbath is better and that God ordered it? Rabbi Akiva said: the river Sambatyon, which is violent the whole week, rests on the Sabbath. The king said: this one wants to lie brings proofs from distant places, where none our people have visited. Rabbi Akiva responded: go and see if you can bring up a dead person [from the grave] by means of magic on the Sabbath. During the whole week one can bring up the dead, but on the Sabbath one cannot bring up any of the dead. The same evil person went and tried it and brought his father out of his grave and during the week he rose. On the Sabbath he did not want to rise and on Sunday, after the Sabbath, he again brought him up and asked him. My dear father, have you become a Jew since your death and observe the Sabbath, like the Jews? His father answered, those who don’t observe the Sabbath in this world must observe the Sabbath in the other world. The evil one then asked, and do you work during the week? His father answered that we are judged all week in Gehenna and on the Sabbath we have rest.<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Genesis Rabbah</i> 11.5.</i>
Some sages say that the Sabbath was blessed. Every day has a colleague; Sunday has a colleague, Monday. Tuesday has a colleague, Wednesday, and Thursday has a colleague, Friday. However, the Sabbath is alone without a colleague. <i>Rabbi Samuel the son of Nahman</i> says: the Sabbath was blessed that one does not postpone the Sabbath for any other <i>festival.</i> One even postpones <i>Yom Kippur</i> occasionally, so that it does not fall on Friday or Sunday. This is so that a dead person should not be required to lie two days [before burial], Friday and Saturday or Saturday and Sunday. However, the Sabbath is never postponed. Thus, the Sabbath said before the Holy One. <i>Lord of the Universe</i>, why don’t I have a colleague? The Holy One said to the Sabbath, Israel will be your colleague. Indeed, this happened at Mount Sinai. The Sabbath said: “<i>Remember the Sabbath day</i>” [Exodus, 20:8]. This means, remember what you promised me that Israel should rest on me and be my colleague.<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Genesis Rabbah,</i> 11.8.</i>
“<i>Such is the story of heaven</i>” [2:4]. Why is the word <i>toldot</i> written in the Torah with two <i>vav</i>’s in connection with Peretz,<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">Ruth, 4:18.</i> and <i>toldot</i> in connection with “<i>heaven and earth</i>” [2:4] is not written with two <i>vav</i>’s. When the Holy One created the world, the <i>Angel of Death</i> did not yet exist, but as soon as the person was created, the <i>Angel of Death</i> was also created and all of the <i>toldot</i> that were created were killed and diminished. However, regarding Peretz, from whom the <i>Messiah</i> will come, the Angel of Death will be removed from the world in the days of the <i>Messiah.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Exodus Rabbah,</i> 3.30.</i>
The <i>vav</i> is ruptured<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">I.e. one <i>vav</i> instead of two.</i> because it has the value of six. This teaches us that six things were taken from <i>Adam</i> when he committed his sin. The aura of brightness was taken away from him. His lifespan was diminished. His height was taken from him and he was shortened. The fruits of the earth were cursed and the fruits of trees were cursed. The good light was taken away. The same light had begun to shine on Friday morning to illumine that <i>Adam</i> was created. It happened two hours before the Sabbath that <i>Adam</i> ate from the apple. The Holy One wanted to take away this light since Adam was not worthy that he should have such a good light. However, He did not take away this light for the sake of the Sabbath and it illumined the whole Sabbath. It became dark as soon as the Sabbath ended. <i>Adam</i> became very fearful that the snake would bite him in the dark. Thus, the Holy One sent him two fire-stones and he hit one against the other; fire emerged from them and he had light. Then he recited the <i>blessing</i> “<i>who creates the lights of fire.</i>” This is the same time that the light was created. That is why we recite the <i>havdalah</i> over all lights every <i>Saturday</i> night.<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Genesis Rabbah,</i> 12.6.</i>
“<i>When they were created</i> (<i>Behibaram)</i>” [2:4]. This world was created with [the letter] “<i>heh</i>,” with one simple word. The <i>heh</i> has a door at the bottom. This teaches us that the whole world must pass through Gehenna, below in the grave. It also has a door in the side so that whoever was pious in this world, this person goes out through this door and into the Garden of Eden.

“<i>The Lord God planted a garden in Eden</i>” [2:8]. The Holy One himself placed and planted the garden. There were two good trees in the garden. One of them was called <i>the tree of knowledge</i> and whoever ate from its fruit would receive great knowledge and his evil inclination would be enhanced. The other tree was called <i>the tree of life</i> and whoever ate from it would live forever. Four rivers flowed from the garden to water the garden and the Holy One put Adam in the garden to watch over it and he should sow wheat and rye and good spices for his needs. The Holy One commanded Adam that he should not eat from the tree of knowledge of good and evil. Why did the Holy One also not forbid that he should eat from the tree of eternal life? The Holy One forbade eating from the tree of knowledge of good and evil because the Holy One desired that Adam should live forever, before he committed the sin. Therefore, He did not forbid eating from the tree of eternal life. However, when Adam ate from the <i>tree of knowledge</i> the Holy One then forbade him to also eat from the <i>tree of life</i> because he had violated the command of God. Thus, he was <i>deserving of the death penalty.</i> That is why the Holy One drove him out of the garden so that he should not eat from <i>the tree of life</i> and live forever.<sup class="footnote-marker">91</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Genesis, 2:17.</i>
Some sages say that the <i>tree of life</i> stood in the middle of the garden and <i>the tree of knowledge</i> was a fence around the <i>tree of life.</i> One could not touch <i>the tree of life</i> without [touching] <i>the tree of knowledge.</i> Therefore, as soon as Adam touched <i>the tree of knowledge</i>, the Holy One drove him out, since He thought that Adam would also understand that he could go further and eat of <i>the tree of life.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">92</sup><i class="footnote">Imre Noam, Genesis, 3:22.</i>
It was the nature of <i>the tree of knowledge</i> that whoever ate from it acquired <i>the inclination to do evil.</i> Before they ate from the tree, they went around naked, without clothes, and were not ashamed. As soon as they ate, they became ashamed and tore off leaves to cover their shame.<sup class="footnote-marker">93</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Genesis, 2:17.</i>
“<i>As soon as you eat of it you shall die</i>” [2:17]. The Holy One said to Adam, if you will eat then you will have to die the same day. How is it that the he did not die the same day? The Holy One as an act of lovingkindness gave him one of His days, since the length of the Holy One’s days is a thousand years. That is why he was supposed to have lived for a thousand years.<sup class="footnote-marker">94</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Genesis Rabbah,</i> 19.8.</i> However, <i>Adam</i> saw with prophetic powers that <i>King David</i> was destined to be stillborn.

That is to say, on the same day that you will eat, you will die. He ate it on Friday and after a number of years he died on Friday, on the same day that he ate it. Some other sages say, when the Holy One said, you must die the same day, He meant by this, if you don’t repent. We find concerning the city of Nineveh that the Holy One sent Jonah to that they should become pious and not remain evil. If not, He would destroy it in forty days. He did not destroy the city because they repented.<sup class="footnote-marker">96</sup><i class="footnote">Jonah, 3.</i> In the same way, the Holy One said to <i>Adam</i>, you must die the same day you will eat, but afterwards when <i>Adam</i> repented the Holy One extended the time of his death.<sup class="footnote-marker">97</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Genesis, 2:17.</i>
“<i>It is not good for man to be alone</i>” [2:18]. The Holy One said that if the creatures will see that <i>Adam</i> is alone on the earth, they will consider him <i>a strange god</i> and will want to worship him. Therefore, the Holy One said that it was not good that he should be without a wife. Thus, Adam must also have a wife. The creatures will then say that just like the Holy One is unique in heaven, similarly <i>Adam</i> is unique on the earth. It is necessary to create a wife so that the wife will help him work.<sup class="footnote-marker">98</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 2:18.</i>
“<i>Whatever the man called each living creature, that would be its name</i>” [2:19]. The Holy One let all the creatures come before <i>Adam</i> that he should give them names, so that the domestic and wild animals should have names. <i>Adam</i> was very smart and gave each one a name according to its <i>intelligence</i>, nature or habits. He saw that the donkey is the greatest fool and has no intelligence. Therefore, he called him by the name hamor. This means, he is nothing but a piece of clay, like a clay golem.<sup class="footnote-marker">99</sup><i class="footnote">This is a play on words, <i>hamor</i> (donkey) and <i>homer</i> (clay/earth).</i> The horse is very lively, so he gave him the name <i>sus</i>, which means lively and happy.<sup class="footnote-marker">100</sup><i class="footnote">Similarly, <i>sus</i> (horse) and <i>sas/sasson</i> (joy/happiness).</i> He saw that the eagle sheds the feathers of its body every ten years.

Adam said: your name should be <i>Lord.</i> This is because you are the Lord of the whole world. Regarding this the verse says, “<i>I am the Lord, that is my name</i>” [Isaiah, 42:8]. That is to say, God says, my name Lord is ancient; Adam gave me the name.<sup class="footnote-marker">103</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Genesis Rabbah,</i> 17.4.</i>
“<i>The Lord God cast a deep sleep</i>” [2:21]. God put Adam to sleep. This teaches us that the person should not argue with his wife if he sometimes sees something that does not please him. He should make himself as if he does not see it and is sleeping.<sup class="footnote-marker">104</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Genesis, 2:21.</i>
When the Holy One brought all the creatures before him so that he could give them a name, Adam saw each wild and domestic animal with its wife. Then Adam said, all the creatures have wives and I don’t have one. Therefore, it says, “<i>but for Adam no fitting helper was found</i>” [2:20]. That is to say, Adam did not find among all the creatures a <i>female</i> that suited him to take as a wife.<sup class="footnote-marker">105</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 2:20.</i> Some sages say that <i>Adam</i> lay with all the creatures, but none of them pleased him to take as a wife. Therefore, the Holy One brought a sleep over Adam and took a rib from his body and created a wife from it. That is why the Holy One made him sleep, so that it should not be repulsive to him that she came out of his body. If the person will be worthy, then God will give him a wife who will love him and be a helpmate. However, if the person is not pious then God sends him a wife who will cause him to lose this world and the next world. She is “<i>more bitter than death</i>” [Ecclesiastes, 7:26]. Similarly, she can bring him to the world to come. We find a story about a pious man who had a wife who was very <i>pious.</i> They did not have any children, so they divorced. She took a man who was an <i>evildoer</i> and she made him very pious. He took a woman who was very evil in all her deeds and she made an evil person out of him.<sup class="footnote-marker">106</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Genesis Rabbah</i> 17.7.</i>
“<i>And the Lord God formed</i>” [2:22]. <i>Rabbi Joshua</i> says in the name of <i>Rabbi Levi.</i> The Holy One sat and considered from which organ should she be created. He said, I will not create her from <i>Adam</i>’<i>s</i> head since she will be very arrogant and carry her head high. If I were to create her from the eye, she will want to see everything. From the ear, she will want to hear everything. From the mouth, she will want to speak much. From the heart, she will be <i>envious</i> of all people. From the hand, she will want to grab everything. From the feet, she will run around. Therefore, I will create her from an organ that is hidden. This is the rib that one doesn’t see, even when the person is naked. However, none of this helped. I did not create her from the head, yet she holds her head high, as the verse says, “<i>and walk with heads thrown back</i>” [Isaiah, 3:16], and they go with throats high.

<i>Rabbi Joshua</i> asks: why is it when the child comes out of the mother, if it is a boy its face is down to the earth, and a daughter, her face is up towards the mother. He answered: the son looks to where he was created, since <i>Adam</i> was created from the earth. Therefore, the son looks at the earth with his face when he comes out of the mother. However, <i>Eve</i> was created from the person. Therefore, the daughters look with their faces at the mother because they were created from a person.<sup class="footnote-marker">108</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Genesis Rabbah,</i> 17.8.</i>

Rabbi Joshua asks: why must the woman adorn herself with <i>perfumes</i> and good smelling things and clean clothes more than the man? He answered that <i>Adam</i> was created from the earth and earth never stinks. <i>Eve</i> was created from a rib bone. It is a parable. If you do nothing to meat for three days, it stinks. Therefore, the women must adorn themselves with perfumes and clean clothes. They might stink if they did not adorn themselves in this way. Why do women have good <i>voices?</i> It is a parable. Bang two bones together and it makes a sound and rings. Bang earth against earth and it makes no sound. Why can one not easily persuade a woman to commit a <i>sin</i> or dissuade her from her anger? He answered that the woman was created from a bone and if you poured water on a bone all day, the bone would not dissolve. However, pour a little water on earth, and it will soon dissolve. Therefore we say, “<i>as a father has compassion for his children</i>” [Psalms, 103:13]. The father is compassionate. Why does a man seek a wife and a woman does not seek a man? He responded: I will give you a parable. One who loses something must search for what he has lost. However, the woman has not lost anything. Therefore, she does not search. Why does the man have the hair on his head uncovered while the woman must cover the hair of her head? He answered, this is because Eve made <i>Adam</i> sin. Therefore, she must go covered, ashamed and with covered head. Why do women run to a dead person first? This is because they brought death into the world. Why did the Holy One give women <i>the commandment of nidah?</i><sup class="footnote-marker">110</sup><i class="footnote">The laws of ritual purity relating to menstruation. Cf.

“<i>The two of them were naked</i>” [2:25]. <i>Adam and Eve</i> were naked and were not ashamed, like the animals. The snake was wicked and saw how <i>Adam</i> and his wife <i>Eve</i> had sexual relations openly, like the animals. The snake desired to have sexual relations with Eve.<sup class="footnote-marker">119</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Genesis Rabbah,</i> 18.6.</i> It wanted that Adam should die and it wanted to make Eve its wife. The snake made up a rumor and asked: did the Holy One forbid you to eat from all the trees in the garden? That is to say, it knew well that the Holy One only forbade them to eat from the <i>tree of knowledge.</i> However, the snake made up the rumor in order to raise the issue to initiate a discussion between them. The woman answered that God not only forbade us to eat from the <i>tree of knowledge</i>, but we should not even touch the tree. Our sages say that one should not add what one was not commanded.<sup class="footnote-marker">120</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 3:4.</i> The Holy One did not forbid touching it, but the Holy One did forbid eating from it. Eve added [to what she was commanded] and lied. As a result, she came to commit a sin. The snake then went and pushed Eve’s hand into <i>the tree of knowledge</i> and said to Eve, just as you did not die from touching, similarly you won’t die from eating, but the Holy One forbade it to you. He knows that you will be like the angels if you will eat from the tree of knowledge. Eve saw that the snake was speaking correctly. She thought to herself that it is good that we will become like angels when we will eat and that eating it will open our eyes. Therefore she ate from the apple and also gave it her husband to eat. She thought that if I die then my husband Adam must also die so that he should not live and take another wife. She also gave the wild and domestic animals and the birds to eat so that they should also die. All the creatures ate, but one bird that is called <i>hol</i> did not want to eat from the apple. <i>Rabbi Yudin</i> says in the name of <i>Rabbi Simeon</i>, the <i>hol</i> lives for a thousand years and after a thousand years its body becomes corrupted and its feathers fall out and what is left is the size of an egg.

“<i>The eyes of both of them were opened</i>” [3:7]. And their eyes were opened and they knew that they were naked. They tore off leaves from a fig tree and covered their shame. They heard the voice of the Holy One in the garden in the evening, about two hours before nightfall, and they hid from the Holy One. The Holy One came and made himself as if He did not know where they were waiting, since He did not want to frighten them. He asked, where are you? Adam responded, I hear your voice in the garden and I was fearful because I was naked and I hid myself. The Holy One answered him, how did you know that there is shame? Who told you to eat from the tree? He answered, the woman who you gave me incited me to eat from the apple. Then the Holy One asked the woman, why did you eat from the apple? She said: the snake incited me. Then God said to the snake, because you did this you must be more cursed than all the wild animals in the field and all the domestic animals.<sup class="footnote-marker">122</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis, 3:7–14.</i>
A gentile wanted to know how long is a snake pregnant before it gives birth? He captured a female snake that recently had sexual relations with its mate and put it into a barrel and fed it until it gave birth. When the rabbis came to Rome, the same <i>gentile</i> asked <i>Rabban Gamaliel</i> how many months does it take for a snake to give birth? He did not have the answer, and as a result he became afraid and his face turned pale. <i>Rabban Gamaliel</i> encountered <i>Rabbi Joshua</i> who said to him: why is your face so pale? <i>Rabban Gamaliel</i> responded: somebody asked me something and I did not know the answer. The gentile asked me how many months is a snake pregnant? <i>Rabbi Joshua</i> said it was seven years. A dog is pregnant fifty-two days and the dog is an <i>impure wild animal.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">123</sup><i class="footnote">In Yiddish, “<i>behemah</i>” is the term used for a domestic animal and “<i>hayah</i>” for a wild or undomesticated animal. Dogs are normally considered domesticated, but in this case he uses the term “<i>hayah.</i>”</i> A horse is pregnant for twelve months and the horse is an <i>impure domestic animal.</i> The Holy One cursed the snake more than a domestic animal and a wild animal that carry their young in pregnancy. One can ask, how did the Holy One curse the snake more than the wild animal, when it is cursed more than domestic animals; both are pregnant for a full year? <i>Surely</i>, it is cursed more than the than the wild animal, and the verse teaches us that the dog is a wild animal that is pregnant for fifty days and the impure domestic animal is pregnant seven times as long, which is one year. A year is three hundred and sixty-five days and as the snake was cursed seven times as much as the impure domestic animal, so that it must be pregnant seven times as long, which is seven years. <i>Rabban Gamaliel</i> went and said to the gentile that she is pregnant with her children for seven years. The gentile hit his head out of anguish and he said: I exerted myself for a long time before I learned this and the Jew tells me this without any exertion.<sup class="footnote-marker">124</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Genesis Rabbah,</i> 20.4. In the midrashic text the “gentile” is a “philosopher.”</i>
<i>Toldot Yizhak</i> writes that one can ask two <i>questions</i> about this matter. The first is why did Eve lie and speak falsely to the snake saying that she was told not to touch. The Holy One only commanded not to eat, but he did not forbid touching. Secondly, when the snake pushed Eve’s hand against the tree and said: just as you did not die from touching it so you won’t die from eating it. Why did Eve believe the snake? “<i>She replied</i>” [3:2]. She would indeed die because of touching it before the end of the day, since the Holy One said that you would die before the end of the day. Eve ate of the tree immediately and did not attempt to see if she would die from touching it. She should have eaten from it afterwards when she did not die from touching it. One can ask another question. The Holy One said to Adam, why did you eat from the tree? He answered: my wife gave it to me. What did Adam think? Because my wife gave it to me, therefore he should exempt when the Holy One forbade it. Ramban writes: <i>Adam</i> said to the Holy One, because you gave me a wife as a helpmate, I thought to myself that what she tells me I must do, and therefore I ate from her hands.<sup class="footnote-marker">125</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban, Genesis, 3:12.</i> One can ask about this, was Adam such a fool that if the Holy One had indeed forbidden it that he would follow his wife? However, the explanation is that Adam and Eve thought that the reason the Holy One forbade eating from the <i>tree of knowledge</i> was because of where the <i>tree of knowledge</i> stood. It was <i>sacred</i>, in a very holy place, where the <i>Shekhinah</i> used to rest. The tree of knowledge stood in the middle of the garden because it was the custom of kings to dwell in the middle of the land and the Shekhinah dwelled in the middle of the garden. They thought that the Holy One forbade eating from it because of touching it. If one would eat from it, then obviously one would have to touch it. However, if an apple would fall off <i>the tree of knowledge</i> and roll outside the sacred area, then one would be allowed to eat the apple. The Holy One would not deny man a good thing like the tree of knowledge, from which one derives good understanding. However, Adam said that the Holy One forbade it because the tree of knowledge stands on a holy place that no person may walk on it. Adam was mistaken about the verse “<i>you shall not eat of it</i>” [3:17]. This means, you should not eat from it. That is to say, when the apple is on the tree, you should not eat from the tree, but when the apple falls off, then one may eat it when it rolls out of the sacred area. This is why the woman said to the snake, “<i>and from the fruit of the tree in the middle of the garden</i>” [3:3], from the tree that is in the middle of the garden. That is to say, it stands on a holy spot in the very middle. Just as a king has his dwelling in the middle of the land, similarly the <i>Shekhinah</i> dwelled in the middle of the garden. That is why the woman said to the snake that the Holy One forbade touching it. That is to say, the Holy One did not explicitly say that one should not touch it, but the woman herself assumed that this was the reason the Holy One said, “<i>do not eat from it</i>” [3:3]. Therefore, the woman did not tell a lie according to her opinion. The snake said to the woman: you spoke well, according to your opinion, but you are mistaken. The Holy One begrudged you the good that you should be like the <i>angels.</i> Therefore, the verse says, “<i>and the woman saw that the tree was good</i>” [3:6]. That is to say, the woman saw that the Holy One did not want to give such a good thing to people. However, <i>Adam</i> did not think this way, but that the Holy One considered this place as very holy. That is why Adam defended himself before God, saying that the woman gave it to me. That is to say, I did not touch the tree and I was not at the holy place, but the woman gave it to me and she tore it off from the tree. Therefore I am not <i>guilty of the death penalty.</i> Therefore, he did not die the same day because he did not deliberately commit the sin. He thought that one is allowed to eat, but one is not allowed to touch it. Since <i>Adam</i> did not die, Eve also did not die so that he should not be alone, without a wife.<sup class="footnote-marker">126</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Genesis, 3:3–4.</i>
<i>Toldot Yizhak</i> gives another explanation. Adam excused himself by saying, You forbade me from eating of the tree of knowledge before I had a wife because the tree of knowledge creates the desire and inclination to love women. Therefore, since I did not have a wife, You correctly forbade me from eating of the tree of knowledge, so that I should not have the desire or evil inclination for women. However, now that you have given me a wife and it is a mitzvah to have children, therefore I ate it because I have a wife. This is also why she gave it to me so that I should have desire for her. Another explanation is that Adam excused himself because the Holy One gave him a wife who should help her husband because the man is obligated to study Torah. The wife should cook for him and should provide the food for the house and the husband should not ask whether she is cooking kosher or not. He must believe her. That is why the verse says, “<i>the woman that you gave me as a helpmate</i>” [3:12]. She gave me to eat and I am not obligated to ask her what sort of apple she gave me. I thought that it was a different sort of apple.<sup class="footnote-marker">127</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Genesis, 3:3–4.</i>
“<i>The Lord said to the woman: What is this that you have done</i>” [3:13]. God asked the woman, why did you eat, even though it had not been forbidden to her. However, the woman was joined to <i>Adam</i> as if they were one body, since the Holy One had taken a rib from Adam’s body and made a wife out of it. That is why the Holy One asked Adam and Eve, why did you eat? That is why he punished and cursed both of them. However, He did not ask the snake, why did you do this? He did not want to hear any excuses from it and cursed it immediately.<sup class="footnote-marker">128</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Genesis Rabbah,</i> 20.2.</i> Our sages<sup class="footnote-marker">129</sup><i class="footnote">M. <i>Avot,</i> 5:18.</i> learn from this that one who causes his friend to sin is punished more than his friend.<sup class="footnote-marker">130</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Genesis 3:3–4.</i>
“<i>On your belly shall you crawl</i>” [3:14]. The snake walked on four feet, but now the Holy One sent angels who chopped off the snake’s feet.<sup class="footnote-marker">131</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Genesis Rabbah,</i> 20.5.</i>
“<i>And I will put an enmity</i>” [3:15]. I will create an enmity between the snake and the person. That is to say, before she ate of the apple, the woman had all of her dealings with the snake. Therefore, He said, I will remove the love between you.<sup class="footnote-marker">132</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Genesis, 3:15.</i> The snake thought that it would take Eve as a wife. Therefore, it began to persuade her to eat the apple, expecting that Adam would eat and die. The snake thought that Eve would certainly honor her husband and give him to eat from the apple first. As soon as I will see that Adam ate from the apple, I will pull away the apple from Eve so that she shouldn’t eat from it and I will take her as a wife. That is why it persuaded Eve and not Adam,<sup class="footnote-marker">133</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Genesis Rabbah,</i> 20.5.</i> because women are easier to persuade and would more quickly persuaded.
“<i>I will make most severe your pangs in childbearing; in pain shall you bear children</i>” [3:16]. The women were punished with three things. <i>Menstrual and virginal blood</i> is her pain. The second is that you will be with pain in pregnancy. The third is when she gives birth; she will have more pain.<sup class="footnote-marker">134</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Genesis, 3:16.</i> The curse that the woman was cursed with applies to all women. Even the wife of a <i>king</i> or a <i>lord</i> must have those three troubles and no amount of money will help her, because the woman committed the sin deliberately. However, the curse that Adam was cursed with only applies to peasants and ordinary people who must earn their bread by the sweat of their brow, but <i>nobles</i> and <i>kings</i> do not have the curse. We find the exact opposite among the wives of the <i>nobles</i> and <i>kings</i> or rich people that they have greater difficulties in childbirth. This is because they don’t have the curse of earning their bread by the sweat of their brow they suffer the curse of childbirth more severely. However, a woman who works has children more easily and because she has the curse of hard work the Holy One in His benevolence does not give her difficult childbirth.
“<i>Your urge shall be for your husband</i>” [3:16]. Even though the woman is subservient to her husband in that she must obey him like a servant obeys his master, it would be normal that the woman should have no desire for her husband. Nonetheless, the Holy One caused that she should have desire for her husband and desire that he should dominate her like a lord over his servant.<sup class="footnote-marker">135</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ramban</i>, Genesis, 3:16.</i>
“<i>Your food shall be the grasses of the field</i>” [3:18]. Before they committed the sin, they ate all the good vegetation of the garden. However, after the sin, the Holy One forbade them to eat from the garden, but only what grew in the fields.<sup class="footnote-marker">136</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Toldot Yitshak</i>, Genesis, 3:18.</i>
“<i>By the sweat of your brow shall you get bread to eat</i>” [3:19], with sweat and hard work should you eat your bread. If they had not committed the sin, they would have eaten unmilled wheat and it would have tasted like good bread.<sup class="footnote-marker">137</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Toldot Yitshak</i>, Genesis, 3:19.</i> <i>Bahya</i> writes that the woman must suffer five kinds of pain. <i>Menstrual blood, virginal blood</i>, difficult pregnancy, difficult childbirth and pain that she must yearn for her husband. She has pain that he has dominion over her because she gave him to eat from the apple and that is why the man has dominion over her.<sup class="footnote-marker">138</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 3:16.</i>
“<i>Your urge shall be for your husband</i>” [3:16]. The time that the woman will be in childbirth, she will say, why should I come to my husband again, since I have these troubles from him? Thus, the Holy One says, you will have an even greater urge than before. <i>Rabbi Berakhiah</i> and <i>Rabbi Simeon</i> say in the name of <i>Rabbi Simeon bar Yohai.</i> She makes a <i>vow</i> in her heart that she would not return to her husband because she has a difficult childbirth. That is why she must bring a sacrifice when she rises from the childbirth as expiation for her <i>vow.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">139</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Genesis Rabbah,</i> 20.7.</i> In the present time, her husband ascends to <i>the Torah Scroll</i> when she rises from the childbirth. This should be expiation for his wife and her vow that she had in her heart, but did not verbally express the <i>vow.</i>
“<i>The man named his wife Eve</i>” [3:20], because Eve was the mother of all people. That is why Adam called her Eve. This means, the life of the whole world.<sup class="footnote-marker">140</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Genesis Rabbah,</i> 20.11. Eve, <i>havah</i> in Hebrew, come from the same root as <i>hay</i>, life.</i> Even though he had given her a name Eve, and she was called woman,<sup class="footnote-marker">141</sup><i class="footnote">Woman, in Hebrew is <i>ishah</i>, the feminine form of <i>ish,</i> man.</i> but Adam thought that because his wife committed a sin and caused me to sin, I don’t want to be associated with her. Previously, she had been called <i>woman</i> because she had been taken from me. However, now I must give her another name and she must be called Eve because women talk a lot.<sup class="footnote-marker">142</sup><i class="footnote">“Women talk a lot.” B. <i>Berakhot,</i> 48b. For a proposed etymology of Eve and talking, see <i>Bahya</i>, Genesis, 3:21.</i> The word Eve means talking and from talking a lot she became the mother of the whole world. If she had not talked a lot with the snake, she would have not become the mother of the whole world.
“<i>And the Lord God made garments of skins for Adam and his wife</i>” [3:21]. The Holy One made shirts for <i>Adam</i> and his wife. The shirts were decorated with drawings and embroideries of all the animals and birds in the world. Adam later gave them to <i>Cain</i> and when Cain was killed they came into the hands of <i>Nimrod. Esau</i> killed <i>Nimrod</i> and Esau took these garments. When <i>Jacob</i> wanted to receive the <i>blessing</i> from <i>Isaac</i>, he put on these garments.<sup class="footnote-marker">143</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis, 27:15.</i> “<i>And clothed them</i>” [3:21].

“<i>The Lord God banished him from the Garden of Eden, to till the soil from which he was taken. So the Lord God banished him</i>” [3:23–4]. The Holy One had to trick Adam into leaving the <i>Garden of Eden</i>, because he did not want to leave, even if one were to kill him with every <i>death.</i> The Holy One did not want to kill him, so the Holy One said to Adam, you must work the earth outside the Garden of Eden, just like you work it in the Garden of Eden, since you were taken from earth that is outside of the Garden of Eden. Adam immediately left the Garden of Eden to work. He thought that he would return, but the Holy One locked the door of the Garden of Eden, so that he could not enter again.<sup class="footnote-marker">145</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Toldot Yitshak</i>, Genesis, 3:23.</i>
“<i>He stationed the cherubim east of the Garden of Eden</i>” [3:24].

“<i>And the man knew his wife Eve</i>” [4:1]. And Adam had sexual relations with his wife Eve. This because semen comes from the brain, where <i>intelligence</i> and <i>wisdom</i> emanate, and that is why the Torah use <i>the term</i> “<i>to know</i>” for sexual relations, the source of intelligence.<sup class="footnote-marker">147</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bahya</i>, Genesis, 4:1. The idea that the brain is the source of semen is a common belief of medieval science.</i> When Adam saw that the Garden of Eden was locked, he did not want to have relations with his wife. He said: my children won’t enter the Garden of Eden, but Gehenna. He saw Gehenna was open and he said, because Gehenna is open, it is certain that my children will enter Gehenna. However, after he saw that the Torah would be given to Israel after twenty-six generations, he again had sexual relations with his wife in order to have children.<sup class="footnote-marker">148</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Genesis Rabbah,</i> 21.9.</i> From this, the person should learn that he should have sexual relations with his wife to have children, so he can teach them Torah. <i>Rabbi Huna</i> and <i>Rabbi Jacob</i> said in the name of <i>Rabbi Abba the son of Kahana</i>, no creature knew how to have sexual relations with its mate until Adam had sexual relations with his wife. This is the reason the term “<i>to know</i>” is used for sexual relations in the verse “<i>and Adam knew his wife Eve</i>” [4:1].
This means that Adam informed [the other creatures] about how to have sexual relations. <i>Rabbi Eliezer the son of Azariah</i> said: three miracles happened that day. He was created that day. They had sexual relations on that day and they had children on that day. <i>Rabbi Joshua the son of Korha</i> says: Adam and his wife went to bed as the two of them, but seven arose from that bed, <i>Cain</i> and his sister, and <i>Abel</i> with two sisters, so that each one was born with his wife.<sup class="footnote-marker">149</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Genesis Rabbah,</i> 22.2.</i>
“<i>I have gained a male child with the help of the Lord</i>” [4:1]. Eve said, previously the Holy One created us alone, but now my husband and I have born a child with the Holy One. Three have a share in a person, father, mother, and the Holy One who gives the soul.<sup class="footnote-marker">150</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Nidah,</i> 31a.</i> She had another child who was called Abel, who watched the sheep in the field. <i>Cain</i> worked the land, and Cain brought fruit as a sacrifice to God. Abel brought good sheep as an offering and God sent a fire from heaven and took Abel’s sacrifice. However, the Holy One did not want to take Cain’s sacrifice. Cain’s sin was that he selected ordinary fruit as a sacrifice and he ate the best himself. Cain was angry and the Holy One said to Cain, why are you angry? If you will be pious and <i>repent</i>, I will forgive you. However, if you will not <i>repent</i>, then you will be ready for the door of Gehenna, and there you will rest. The evil inclination will desire to incite you to do evil things. This is the meaning of “<i>sin crouches at the door</i>” [4:7]. You will be ready for the door of Gehenna. <i>Rabbi Ami</i> says: the evil inclination only goes in the middle of the streets and roads. When he meets a person, he looks at him to see if he adorns himself and smoothes his hair and raises his eyes arrogantly. He immediately attaches himself to him and says to him, you are mine. I want to teach you and soon incites him to all the evil things. Therefore, the person should not pursue pride with jewelry and with excessively elegant clothes.<sup class="footnote-marker">151</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Genesis Rabbah,</i> 22.6.</i>
“<i>When they were in the field</i>” [4:8]. When they were in the field, the two brothers argued. They said, let us divide the world. One of them said, the earth on which you are standing is mine and the other one said: the earth where you are standing is mine. They began arguing and one of them said: <i>the Temple</i> will stand on my part of the earth and the other one said the same thing and they argued. Abel, the younger one, was born with two sisters. Cain said: I will take the extra one since I am the firstborn. Abel said: since she was born with me, I want to take her as a wife. They continued to argue in this way. Abel threw Cain to the ground and lay on him. Cain said to Abel: we are but two children to our father Adam and why do you want to kill me? Abel had compassion for him and let him get up. That is why the verse says, “<i>and Cain rose up</i>” [4:8]. This means to say that he was lying beneath him and he stood up. From this we learn that we should not do any good for an evil person, because Abel had compassion for Cain and Cain went and killed Abel. From where did Cain have the tradition of how to kill? The Sages say that Cain saw how Adam slaughtered the ox for a <i>sacrifice</i> and he also killed Abel at the throat. Who buried Abel? <i>Rabbi Eliezer the son of Pedat</i> says that the <i>kosher birds and kosher animals</i> buried him. The Holy One gave them a good reward that we recite a blessing when we slaughter them and again another blessing when we cover their blood with earth. The Holy One repaid them <i>measure for measure</i>, because they covered the blood of Abel, the Holy One ordered that their blood be covered.<sup class="footnote-marker">152</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Genesis Rabbah,</i> 22.7–8.</i>

This means, much blood. That is to say, the blood of your brother and the children who were to have issued from him. Some sages say that Cain wounded Abel many times because he did not know which spot would kill him.<sup class="footnote-marker">154</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Sanhedrin,</i> 37b.</i> He killed him because he thought that the bulk of the world would be built from Abel because the Holy One had accepted his sacrifice and had not accepted Cain’s sacrifice.

Therefore, when you will work the earth, she will give you less grain than she would have given, because you killed your brother.<sup class="footnote-marker">155</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Genesis Rabbah,</i> 22.10.</i> You should not rest in one place, but must be like <i>a penitent.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">156</sup><i class="footnote">On exile and wandering as a form of expiation of sin, see B. <i>Sanhedrin,</i> 37b.</i>
Cain said, “<i>my punishment is too great to bear</i>” [4:13]. That is to say, <i>Lord of the Universe</i>, are my sins so great that you cannot forgive me? “<i>Since you have banished me</i>” [4:14]. He said: you have banished me and where shall I hide? <i>Rabbi Judah</i> said: the <i>domestic</i> and <i>wild animals</i> and the <i>birds</i> came and wanted to take revenge on Cain. The Holy One said: “<i>if anyone will kill Cain</i>” [4:15], they will be brought to justice. That is to say, the Holy One screamed at all the animals and birds and the snake that they shouldn’t do anything to him. “<i>Sevenfold vengeance</i>” [4:15]. The vengeance against Cain will be done in seven generations when <i>Lamech</i> will come and kill <i>Cain.</i> “<i>The Lord put a mark on Cain</i>” [4:15] The Holy One made a sign on <i>Cain</i> so that one should not kill him. <i>Rav</i> said that the Holy One gave him a dog to protect him from <i>wild animals.

“<i>Lamech took to himself two wives</i>” [4:19]. It was the custom in those days that each man had two wives. One was to have children and the other one was given a drink so that she would not have any children. There are many herbs out of which one can make a drink that prevents one from having children. They did this so that this woman should remain beautiful. He would adorn this woman like a <i>bride</i> and the other woman went around like a widow. As soon as she became pregnant, he would separate from her and lie with the beautiful wife. One of them was called <i>Adah.</i> This means, separated and the other one was called <i>Zillah</i>, this means, that he always sat near her and lay with her.<sup class="footnote-marker">160</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Genesis Rabbah,</i> 23.2.</i> <i>Adah</i> had a son who was called <i>Jabal.</i> He was the first herder of domestic animals in the fields.<sup class="footnote-marker">161</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis, 4:20.</i> His brother was called <i>Jubal</i>, and he was the first one who made harps and violins.<sup class="footnote-marker">162</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis, 4:21.</i> <i>Zillah</i> also had children, even though Lamech had given her herbs to drink so that she should not have children.

“<i>And Lamech said to his wives, Adah and Zillah, hear my voice</i>” [4:23]. Lamech said to his wives. Listen to me dear wives and have sexual relations with me. His wives did not want to lie with him because he had killed Tubalcain. Lamech was blind and Tubal-cain led him around. Tubal-cain saw Cain in the distance in the field. He said to Lamech, there is an animal in the distance, take your bow and shoot. He took his bow and shot at Cain, his grandfather, and shot him to death. When Lamech became aware of this, he became frightened and clapped his hands together. He killed his son Tubal-cain between his hands. Thus, his wives did not want to have sexual relations with him. He begged them, but they would not listen to him. He continued to excuse himself saying, did I deliberately kill these people? My grandfather Cain killed deliberately and the Holy One let him live for seven generations. I did not kill deliberately, so the Holy One will surely wait longer. Lamech went to lament before Adam and said that his wives have separated from him. Adam said to the wives, you should not talk against the decree of the Holy One. You should fulfill your responsibility and have relations with him and do not separate from him. The wives said to Adam, why do you want to punish us and why do you not want to have sexual relations with your wife. It is one hundred and thirty years since you separated from your wife, since you ate from the apple.

Noach

“<i>These are the descendants of Noah</i>” [6:9]. <i>King Solomon</i>, <i>of blessed memory</i>, said: “<i>The righteous man lives blamelessly; happy are his children who come after him</i>” [Proverbs, 20:7]. That is, the person should fulfill commandments <i>for the sake of Heaven</i> and not from arrogance, like many people who give <i>charity</i> to someone. Afterwards, he goes and talks about it. He does two evil things. First, he pursued arrogance, that he told people. Secondly, he shamed the person to whom he has given it, by telling about him that he <i>accepted charity.</i> Therefore, King Solomon said here, “<i>The righteous man lives blamelessly.</i>” That is to say, the person who behaves like a simple person, and does not consider himself important, he is righteous. He is worthy that his children will also be pious. Concerning this, King Solomon said, “<i>He calls many a man his loyal friend, but who can find a faithful man</i>” [Proverbs, 20:6]. That is to say, one finds many people who shout out with their mouths the charity that they give and the acts of kindness that they do. However, who can find a pious truthful person? It is known that the righteous have three virtues. The first is that when he is pious, he is called righteous. If he is more pious, he is called <i>blameless.</i> The third virtue is called <i>conduct.</i> This means, he walks completely with God all the time. <i>Noah</i> had all three of these virtues. That is why the verse says, “<i>Noah was a righteous man; he was blameless in his age; Noah walked with God</i>” [6:9].<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Noah, Introduction.</i>
He was righteous with his deeds and was completely <i>blameless</i> in his heart. He did not talk against the deeds of the Holy One and it is written about him, “<i>Noah walked with God</i>” [6:9]. He walked in the service of the Holy One, and in the proper belief. Therefore, Noah is written three times in the first verse, because he first saw the world as it was built, with cities and people. Later, he saw the world destroyed in the Flood. The third time, he again saw the world rebuilt with cities and people.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanhuma</i>, Noah 5.</i>
The verse says, “<i>in his generation</i>” [6:9]. This means, he was righteous in his generation, which had nothing but evildoers. Even if he were among pious people, he would have been even more pious. Some sages say that if he had been in the time of Abraham, he would not have been righteous in comparison to Abraham, since Abraham was much more righteous. That is why it says, “<i>in his generation.</i>” <sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 6:9.</i> The Torah tells us how Noah was very righteous and the Holy One protected him from the Flood because of his great righteousness.

“<i>For all flesh had corrupted</i>” [6:12]. They pursued sexual infidelity. Even the wild and domestic animals had sexual relations with <i>species</i> other than their own, and they also worshiped false gods.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 6:12.</i>
The Midrash writes in the <i>Yalkut.</i> The people of [the generation of] the Flood worshiped false gods. It hurt the Holy One that He had created the people. Two angels by the names of <i>Shamhazi</i> and <i>Azael</i> came and said: <i>Lord of the Universe</i>, we had foretold that the people would do evil. The Holy One said: what will happen to the world if there won’t be any people? The angels responded: we will manage the world properly. The Holy One said: if you will live on the earth, the evil inclination might incite you and this might be worse than the people. The angels said: give us permission to go down. The Holy One said: go down to the earth. Very quickly, they were having sexual relations with the beautiful women. The <i>angel Shamhazi</i> saw a lovely young woman called <i>Ishtar.</i> He said to the young woman: sleep with me. The young woman responded: if you will teach me the <i>Ineffable Name</i> [<i>Shem ha-Meforash</i>], then I will obey you. The angel taught the young woman the <i>Ineffable Name</i> and the young woman said the <i>Name</i> and ascended to heaven, and did not have sexual relations with him. The Holy One said: because the young woman separated herself from the sin, the Holy One placed her among the seven <i>stars.</i> It is a star called <i>Kimah</i> [Pleiades]. <i>Shamhazi</i> and <i>Azael</i> took wives and had children in the world, who were called <i>Hiva</i> and <i>Hayya.</i> The angel <i>Metatron</i> notified the angels that the Flood would come and their children would be destroyed. The angels were very upset and said: our children who eat a thousand camels, a thousand horses, and a thousand oxen every day, when the Flood will come and everything will be destroyed, what will they have to eat? Once at night, each of them had a dream. One of them saw in his dream a large table and there was much written on it. An angel came with a sword and erased the writing, but he left four words untouched. The other one had a dream in which he saw a large garden with all sorts of good things before him. He saw angels coming down from heaven who destroyed the garden, but they left four trees standing. The next morning the children came to their fathers and asked their fathers what is the meaning of the dream? They responded: the Holy One will bring a Flood and will destroy the whole world, but Noah and three children will remain. These are the four words and the four trees. They began to cry and their fathers consoled them and said: your names will not be removed from the mouths of people, as long as the world will stand. When a person will chop wood and lift heavy stones, will pull a boat or drive a wagon with horses or oxen, he must say, <i>Hiva and Hayya.</i> They became silent. <i>Shamhazi</i> repented and hanged himself with his feet toward heaven and head to the ground, and is hanging to the present day. <i>Azael</i> remained in the world and incited the women to put on jewelry for the men in order to commit sins. That is why on <i>Yom Kippur</i>, a sacrifice is brought for the Holy One and one sacrifice for the <i>angel Azael</i>, that he should not incite people to do evil.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Bereshit, <i>Remez</i>, 44.</i>
“<i>For the earth is filled with lawlessness</i>” [6:13]. They stole much and the <i>Holy One</i> signed the <i>decree</i> because of the <i>robbery.</i> Even though the <i>adultery</i> and illicit sex was even more severe than the robbery yet the Holy One had signed the decree because of the robbery. The intellect itself realizes that one should not steal, even if the Torah had not forbidden it, but the Torah did not forbid illicit sex, so it was not so unjust. Another explanation is that illicit sex is not more evil, except against the Holy One, but robbery is evil against people and against the Holy One. That is why the Flood occurred, because the people did not want to believe that the Holy One could renew the world and also did not want to believe that the Holy One watches over people to pay a good reward to the righteous and an evil reward to the evildoers. They said that the Holy One is in heaven and does not watch over people. It is all the same if one is pious or evil. Therefore, the Holy One brought the Flood and <i>the righteous Noah</i> and his children survived. This shows us that the Holy One pays a good reward to the righteous and punishes the evildoers.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 6:12.</i>
“<i>Make yourself an ark of gopher wood</i>” [6:14]. The Holy One told him to make a large ark, like the large ships on the water and told him to cover it with pitch, on the inside and outside. Even though, the Holy One could have saved the righteous <i>Noah</i> and his children without the ship, but the explanation is that the Holy One told him to build the ark for one hundred and twenty years, in the hope that people would ask him, what are you making? He would respond: the Holy One will bring the Flood. Perhaps they will repent.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 6:14.</i>
<i>Rabbenu Bahya</i> writes: why did Noah not pray that the world should not be destroyed, as we find concerning Abraham? As soon as the Holy One notified him that He wanted to destroy <i>Sodom and Gomorrah</i>, Abraham prayed many times for the <i>complete evildoers</i> and all the prophets did the same. The explanation is that Noah saw that there weren’t ten righteous people in his generation. Therefore, he did not need to pray. Abraham saw that there were not ten in his generation and he did not pray for <i>Sodom</i> and <i>Gomorrah.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis, 18:32–3.

The <i>Toldot Yizhak</i> writes that he did not pray because Noah was good to the people, but not completely good to the Holy One, since Noah did not believe that the Holy One should bring the Flood.

“<i>And of all that lives, of all flesh, you shall take two</i>” [6:19]. The Holy One commanded that male and female of all creatures should be taken into the ark, even the demons.

The explanation is that the Torah wants to teach us that one should not speak evil with his mouth when one can speak positively. Thus, the Torah did not say unclean, since it is an evil term. Rather say, those that are not clean.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Pesahim,</i> 3a.</i> How much more so, a person should be warned not to speak <i>insulting words</i>, since he makes his soul unclean with speaking <i>insulting words.</i>
“<i>I will make it rain upon the earth, forty days and forty nights</i>” [7:4]. The rain was for forty days and forty nights, because they engaged in illicit sex. The child comes to life in the mother’s womb in forty days and because they caused the Holy One to exert himself to create the children of each prostitute at forty days, that is why the Holy One caused it to rain for forty days.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 7:4.</i>
“<i>Because of the waters of the Flood</i>” [7:7]. This means, Noah went into the ark because of high water.

“<i>That same day</i>” [7:13]. On that very day, at midday, Noah went into the ark. The evildoers said that when Noah will go into the ark, we will kill him. Let him die with us. The Holy One said: I will let him go into the ark in the middle of the day.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 7:13.</i>
“<i>And God shut him in</i>” [7:16]. The Holy One watched over him so that the water did not harm him. Some sages say that the Holy One did not let the sun, moon, and stars shine for twelve months. How did Noah see in the dark? The Holy One sent a precious stone that illuminated like a great light. When the evildoers saw that they would be destroyed, they wanted to overturn the ark with Noah. The Holy One sent large lions and bears that attacked the evildoers and other animals that wanted to get into the ark.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Noah, <i>Remez</i>, 57.</i> The Holy One first caused all the animals and birds to die and then the people.

The Talmud in [tractate] <i>Berakhot</i> says the opposite. <i>Rabbi Ammi</i> said: the person was created last, but in the Flood he was destroyed first, as the verse says, “<i>all existence on earth was blotted out, from man to cattle</i>” [7:23].

“<i>Only Noah was left</i>” [7:23]. Only Noah and everything that was in the ark with him remained. The sages said: <i>Og the king of Bashan</i> remained sitting on a board on the roof of the ark. Noah made a hole in the ark and gave Og food to eat. Og swore to Noah that he would do no harm to his children.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Pirke de Rabbi Eliezer</i>, chap. 23.</i> Therefore, it is written “<i>akh Noah.</i>”<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">The word <i>akh</i> means “<i>only</i>” and is also an expression of woe.</i> It means that Noah shouted, woe is me.

“<i>And the waters has swelled on the earth one hundred and fifty days</i>” [7:24]. The waters strengthened and increased for one hundred and fifty days.
“<i>God remembered</i>” [8:1]. The Holy One remembered Noah and the animals and cattle and caused the waters to be still. <i>Rabbenu Bahya</i> asked: why were the birds not remembered? The explanation is that the animals and cattle were created with the person on the sixth day. That is why He remembered the cattle and the animals along with the people.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 8:1.</i>

Ramban writes here: It first rained for forty days and during the forty days, the amount of water that fell became greater every day, until it was fifteen cubits over the tops of all the mountains. The wellsprings and the windows of the heavens were opened and the waters were at their full strength for one hundred and fifty days. Afterwards, the Holy One sent a strong wind and the wellsprings were stopped up and the windows of heaven from which the water had come were closed. The ark was still in water a number of cubits deep until the first day of <i>Tammuz.</i> Afterwards, the tops of the mountains were seen on the tenth day of <i>Ab.</i> Noah opened the window of the ark and after three weeks he sent the dove from the ark to see if the earth was dry. After thirty days, Noah removed the cover from the ark.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban, Genesis, 8:4.</i>
“<i>And he sent out the raven</i>” [8:7]. Noah sent the raven to see if the water had decreased and the raven did not want to go. It said: the Holy One hates me. The Holy One said to take seven of the clean birds into the ark and of me, the Holy One said to take one pair, my female and me, and now you want to send me from the ark. Perhaps I will be killed and how will my species exist in the world? The raven said to Noah: you want to have relations with my wife and that is why you are sending me away from the ark. Noah responded: you evildoer, I have not slept with my wife a whole year because we are in the ark, so how do you want to say that I want to sleep with your female? Noah did not want to let him back in. You are not worthy to be eaten and more so as a sacrifice. The Holy One said: let him in, he is prepared for a mission. In the days of <i>Elijah the prophet</i>, when <i>Elijah</i> was hidden because of king Ahab, and Elijah did not have food to eat, the ravens brought meat and bread from the house of <i>Ahab to Elijah</i> where he lay in hiding.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 8:7.

“<i>He sent out the dove from himself</i>” [8:8]. He sent the dove away. <i>Rabbenu Bahya</i> asks: Why is it not written “<i>from himself</i>” concerning the raven? This shows us that the <i>clean birds</i> lived in Noah’s room. However, the <i>unclean birds</i> lived separately. Therefore, it is not written “<i>from himself</i>” concerning the raven.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 8:8.</i>
“<i>In its bill was a plucked-off olive leaf</i>” [8:11]. The dove returned and brought a leaf from an olive tree in its mouth. Here one asks a question. From where did the dove take it, since all the trees in the world had been uprooted? The explanation is that in the <i>land of Israel</i> the rain did not fall, but the water from the other lands flowed to the <i>land of Israel.</i> Therefore, the trees of the <i>land of Israel</i> were not uprooted. Some say that she brought a leaf from the <i>Garden of Eden.</i> Here one can ask, how did Noah know that the water level had fallen if the leaf had come from the <i>Garden of Eden</i>, since there had been no Flood there? <i>Ramban</i> writes here:<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">The citation of the Ramban is found in the Bahya passage.</i> the gates of the <i>Garden of Eden</i> were locked so that the waters of the Flood should not flow into the <i>Garden of Eden.</i> When the water level receded, the gates of the <i>Garden of Eden</i> were opened. Thus, the dove flew in and took a leaf from the <i>Garden of Eden.</i> The dove could have bought a better leaf and brought an olive leaf that is bitter. With this she showed to Noah that it is better to eat a bitter leaf from the hand of the Holy One than the sweet food from the hand of people.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 8:11.</i>
“<i>The earth was dry</i>” [8:14]. Even though the earth was completely dry, Noah and his household did not leave the ark. Noah said: Since the Holy One told me to go into the ark, so I will also not leave without His permission. From here, <i>Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah</i>, learned when they were thrown into the furnace. The pit was very deep, and the three righteous men were in the same pit. The Holy One caused a miracle and made the pit the same level as the ground, yet the righteous ones did not want to go out without the <i>permission of Nebuchadnezzar.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 8:14.</i>
“<i>Come out of the ark, together with your wife</i>” [8:16]. The Holy One now told them that they should have relations with their wives. Therefore, the verse says, Noah with his wife and their children and their wives who went into the ark. The verse had mentioned the men separately and the women separately, since in the ark it was forbidden for all creatures to have sexual relations with their wives. There were three that had sexual relations with their wives in the ark.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 8:16.</i> The first was Ham, the son of Noah, who slept with his wife in the ark. Ham did this because the <i>angel Shamhazel</i> slept with Ham’s wife several days before they went into the ark. She became pregnant from him and had a son in the ark who was called <i>Sihon</i>, the brother of <i>Og, the king of Bashan.</i> If Ham had not slept with his wife in the ark, the people would have said that the child was a <i>bastard.</i> Therefore, Ham wanted to cover the shame of his wife.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Numbers, 21:34.</i> However, the Holy One punished all the children that were born from him that they should all be black, like the Moors.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Genesis Rabbah,</i> 36. 7.</i> The other one who had relations with his female in the ark was the dog.

“<i>The devisings of man</i>’<i>s mind are evil from his youth</i>” [8:21]. The Holy One said: I will no longer punish the people to destroy them all at one time, because the evil inclination is with the person from his youth. As soon as a person is born, the evil inclination comes to the person. However, the <i>good inclination</i> comes to the person when he is thirteen years old. Therefore, the person has great troubles with the evil inclination. It is implanted from childhood onwards and the good inclination is a guest. Therefore, the good inclination cannot prevail against the evil inclination.
“<i>As long as the earth endures, seedtime and harvest</i>” [8:22]. The Holy One said: There must be a time that the person must seed and harvest on the earth. Heat and warmth, winter and cold, should not be disturbed, and I will not kill all the people at one time, as I did with the Flood. However, in any event, some will be born and some will die. Therefore, the verse said, there will be harvest and seedtime. That is to say, people will be born and will die. Through what will they die, through cold and through heat. Therefore, the verse said, “<i>cold and heat</i>” [8:22].<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 8:22.</i> This means, cold and heat. When summer and winter change, there are many <i>illnesses</i> for the <i>enemies of Israel.</i> Therefore, we fast after <i>Sukkot</i> and <i>Passover</i>, <i>Monday, Thursday and Monday</i>, since the summer and winter have ended.<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">Concerning the history of this custom see Daniel Sperber, <i>Minahgei Yisrael.</i> Mosad Harav Kook: Jerusalem, 1990, vol. 1, pp. 192–199.</i> The explanation is that the Holy One also said: I will not bring another Flood, but I will punish the people with seeding and harvesting grain. The heat will burn the wheat and grain. I can also make it cold, so that the grain will not grow. So writes the <i>Toldot Yizhak.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Genesis, 8:22.</i>
One can ask why the Holy One said here: “<i>But for your own life-blood I will require a reckoning</i>” [9:5]. This means, whoever will kill you, I will take <i>vengeance</i> on him. The explanation is that the Holy One said to Noah that they should eat all the meat that was forbidden to Adam to eat. Therefore, also when Noah would chase animals to eat them, perhaps they would kill him. Therefore, the Holy One said: whoever will kill you, I will take <i>vengeance</i> on that one, whether it is a person that will kill another person or it would be an animal that would kill a person. That is why the verse also says, “<i>the fear and dread of you shall be upon all the beasts of the earth</i>” [9:2]. This means, the Holy One said to Noah: the fear of you will be upon all the animals. That is to say, you should not be afraid of the animals.<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Genesis, 9:1–6.</i>
“<i>So Noah came out, together with his sons, his wife, and his sons</i>’ <i>wives</i>” [8:18]. This means, Noah and his sons went out of the ark, his wife and his children’s wives. Here one can ask: the Holy One said to Noah that he should go out with his wife. That is to say, he should sleep with his wife in order to have children. Why did Noah not want to sleep with his wife to have children? The explanation is three reasons why Noah did not want to sleep with his wife. One is that Noah was afraid of the Flood that it would come again on his children. Therefore, he said: why should I have children? Therefore, the Holy One swore that He would never bring the Flood again. The second is that Noah was afraid that the <i>wild animals</i> would kill his children because people had sinned, from Adam onwards. The <i>wild animal</i> might kill them since the animal would say: I am as good as the person when he does not want to keep the Torah. Therefore, the Holy One said to Noah: you do not need to fear the animals, since I will give the fear of people onto the animals. That is why the Holy One said immediately, “<i>God blessed Noah and He said, be fruitful and multiply</i>” [9:1]. That is, do not fear the animals and sleep with your wives to have children. The third is that Noah thought that the people would be evil and one would kill another one. Therefore, the Holy One said to Noah, “<i>but for your own life-blood I will require a reckoning</i>” [9:5]. When one person will kill another person, then I will kill him. “<i>I will require it of every beast; of man, too, will I require a reckoning for human life, of every man for that of his fellow man</i>” [9:5]. The Holy One said: if an animal would kill a person, then I will kill the animal. One can ask: does the animal have intellect that one should kill it in revenge? The explanation is that the Holy One said that if the person will be evil, I have many messengers to pay his reward. I can easily send <i>wild animals</i> to devour him. This is the Yiddish translation of “<i>I will require it of every beast</i>” [9:5].<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Genesis, 9:1–6.</i>
One can further ask about the Torah portion. Why does it have to talk about one animal, about one person, and about one brother? The Torah teaches us that a person is killed in four ways. One is when the person kills himself, out of great troubles. Concerning this, He says here, “<i>but for your own life-blood I will require a reckoning</i>” [9:5]. This means, whoever kills himself, then I will punish him. The second is the person who kills his friend. He incites a vicious dog or a <i>wild animal.</i> Concerning this, the verse says, “<i>I will require it of every beast</i>” [9:5]. This means, whoever kills his friend through a wild animal, I will punish him. The third is the person who kills his friend or he sends his servant to kill him. Concerning this, the verse says, “<i>for human life, for that of his fellow man</i>” [9:5]. This means, whoever kills his friend through a <i>messenger</i>, I will also punish him. The fourth is one who kills his friend himself. He takes a sword and kills him. Concerning this, the verse says, “<i>whoever sheds the blood of man, by man shall his blood be shed</i>” [9:6]. This means, the one who spills his friend’s blood, his blood will also be spilled.<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Genesis, 9:1–6.</i>
“<i>Be fertile and increase</i>” [9:7]. Our <i>sages</i> say that the Torah wrote “<i>be fruitful and increase</i>” near “<i>shed the blood of man.</i>” This shows us that one who does not marry a wife to have children is like one who sheds blood. Some other sages say, one who does not marry a wife to have children, he causes the <i>Shekhinah</i> to remove itself from Israel, as the verse says, “<i>to be God to you and your offspring to come</i>” [Genesis 17:7].<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Yevamot,</i> 63b.</i> This means, the <i>Shekhinah</i> is with you when you have children.<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 9:6.</i>
“<i>I have set my bow in the clouds</i>” [9:13]. The Holy One said: I give you a sign that I will keep My <i>oath</i>, that I will not bring the Flood against you. When people will be evil, I will let it rain and I will place My rainbow in the sky. That is to say, you will be worthy that I should be at war with you and should create a great rain to frighten you, but I will keep My <i>oath.</i> Therefore, the rainbow stands on its ends where the string would be attached to the bow. These ends are towards the people. This shows that the Holy One made His peace with us and does not want to shoot at the people. That is why no rainbow stood in the days of <i>Hezekiah</i> and in the days of <i>Rabbi Simeon bar Yohai</i>, because they were righteous men who protected the people. There was also no rainbow in the days of <i>Rabbi Joshua, the son of Levi.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 9:13.</i>
“<i>Noah, the tiller of soil, was the first to plant a vineyard</i>” [9:20]. Noah planted a vineyard, since he had taken grape seeds into the ark in order to plant a vineyard.<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 9:20.</i> The Torah wrote about planting the vines near the rainbow. This shows us that whoever wants to drink wine should know that much evil could come from drinking too much. He can put his life in danger, as <i>King Solomon</i> said, “<i>who cries woe, who alas</i>” [Proverbs, 23:29]. To whom is woe, the one who drinks much wine, and not just wine, but also all the beverages from which one can get drunk. Therefore, when one wishes to recite the Grace After Meals over a goblet of wine, one must mix some water into it. In the past, the wine was not mixed with water. Therefore, one must mix water to recite the <i>blessing.</i> That is to say, it is not just to recite a blessing on wine, since much evil comes from wine, and that is why the verse says, “<i>Noah began</i>” [9:20]. This means, he became unholy.<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid. This is a play on words. One meaning of the root of the word is “<i>hol</i>” which means “not holy,” i. e., secular.</i> Even though he was righteous, he had protected the whole world with his piety and the whole world was descended from him, yet when he drank wine, he <i>uncovered his sexual organs.</i> He had uncovered himself and his children sinned through this and he cursed his children as a result. Therefore, the Torah wrote thirteen <i>vav</i>’<i>s</i> concerning wine.<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 9:20.</i> That is, when the person is worthy to come into the <i>Garden of Eden</i> as a result of his piety. The <i>Garden of Eden</i> is divided into thirteen parts and thirteen fragrant rivers flow into the Garden of Eden, and there are thirteen steps in the Garden of Eden for the righteous to sit upon. However, when he drinks a lot of wine, he is driven out of these thirteen steps. The Torah shows this with the thirteen <i>vav</i>’<i>s.</i>
This is also written in the [Midrash] <i>Rabbati.</i> When Noah wanted to plant the vineyard, a <i>demon</i> encountered him and said to him: be my partner to plant the vineyard. However, be warned that if you drink excessively, I will harm you.<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Genesis Rabbah,</i> 36.3.</i> Therefore, when the person is drunk, that same demon makes him very crazy and he does much evil. <i>Rabbi Hiyya the son of Abba</i> said: in the same day that Noah planted, and in the same day Noah drank from the wine.<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Genesis Rabbah,</i> 36.4.</i> In the same day he did many things because of wine. He was called unholy. “<i>He uncovered himself within his tent</i>” [9:21]. He uncovered himself because of the wine. That is to say, he had great lust to sleep with his wife because of the wine,<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 9:21.</i> and he <i>revealed his sexual organs</i> before his children. Therefore, it is written in the Torah portion, “<i>and he uncovered</i>” [9:21]. This means, he was exiled, because because he drank too much wine. Therefore, his descendants were sent into exile. The <i>ten tribes</i> were exile for no other reason from the <i>land of Israel</i>, because they drank much wine and did much evil as a result of drinking wine, as the verse says, “<i>they drink from the wine bowls</i>” [Amos, 6:6]. The tribes of Judah and Benjamin were also exiled because of wine, as the verse says in Isaiah 28, “<i>but these are also muddled by wine and dazed by liquor</i>” [Isaiah, 28:7].<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Genesis Rabbah,</i> 36.4.</i>
“<i>Ham, the father of Canaan, saw</i>” [9:22]. Canaan, the son of Ham, saw Noah lying with his shame uncovered. Canaan went and told his father <i>Ham</i>, and he also went and saw his father lying naked.<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 9:22.</i> He further told his brothers <i>Shem</i> and <i>Japhet.</i> They were having a big discussion about their father, but <i>Shem</i> immediately took a garment and covered the shame of his father. <i>Japhet</i> later also helped his brother <i>Shem</i> to cover his father. That is why <i>Shem was worthy</i> that his descendants received the <i>commandment of zizit</i>, which are on garments. <i>Japhet</i> also helped to cover his father. Therefore, his descendants will be covered with <i>shrouds and buried</i>, in the days of <i>Gog and Magog.</i> Gog and Magog were descended from Japhet and will wage war with Israel in the Messianic age. The Messiah will kill Gog and Magog. The Holy One will pay him his reward and they will be buried. From here we learn that when two people perform a positive act together and one of them is quicker and closer than the other one, the one who is quicker and closer, received a better <i>reward</i>, as we find concerning <i>Shem</i>, because he was quicker and closer and covered his father’s shame. Japhet came later to cover him; thus, Shem received a better reward than <i>Japhet.</i> The Holy One said to <i>Ham:</i> because you have shamed your father in that you did not cover him, therefore you must be shamed. Your children will fall into the hands of the <i>king of Assyria</i> and he will lead them naked and their shame will be exposed before people.<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 9:23; Bahya, Genesis, 9:25.</i>
Ham caused that his father Noah should not be able to have any more children He destroyed his shame so that he could not have relations with his wife.<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">The traditional explanation is that he castrated him.</i> <i>Ham</i> said to his brothers: you know well that <i>Adam</i> had two children and one of them killed the other one because they could not unite over dividing the inheritance. We are three brothers and our father wants to have a fourth son. How much more so, we will not be able to unite and that is why Ham caused that his father should not be able to have any more children. Noah had been very upset in the ark that he did not have a small son who would serve him. He said: when I will go out of the <i>ark</i>, I will have a small son. Ham heard this and quickly did to his father so that he could not have one. When Noah woke up from his wine and discovered what <i>Ham</i> had done, Noah cursed Canaan, the son of Ham, that he should be a servant eternally to his brothers, because Ham did not want that I should have a servant who would serve me.<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 9:25; <i>Genesis Rabbah</i> 36.5,7.</i>
Another explanation is that he cursed <i>Canaan</i> and not Ham, because the Holy One had blessed <i>Ham</i> when he went out of the <i>ark.</i> Therefore, it was not just to curse him and therefore Noah cursed his son Canaan.<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 9:24.</i>
<i>Rabbi Huna</i> said in the name of <i>Rabbi Joseph.</i> Noah said to Ham, you <i>prevented</i> me from doing what is done in the dark, that is, when one should sleep with one’s wife. There should not be any light, and also not during the day. Therefore, your children should be darkened and blackened. These are the <i>Ethiopians</i>, the black Moors who are descended from <i>Ham</i>, because of the curse. <i>Rabbi Hiyya the son of Abba</i> said: the black Moors came about because <i>Ham</i> slept with his wife in the <i>ark.</i> Therefore, his children were black Moors.<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Genesis Rabbah,</i> 36.7.</i>
“<i>Noah lived three hundred years after the Flood</i>” [9:28]. Noah lived for three hundred and fifty years after the Flood. He was nine hundred and fifty years old when he died.
“<i>These are the generations of the sons of Noah</i>” [10:1]. There are seventy people in the Torah portion who were considered the children of Noah. Seventy <i>languages</i> came from them and it tells us so that we will know from where <i>Abraham</i> came. It tells us that Abraham was descended from <i>Shem.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 10:1.</i>
<i>Ramban</i> writes. The Torah showed us that Abraham was one of those who testified that God alone created the world. Abraham was fifty-eight years old when Noah died. Abraham spoke with Noah, and Noah told him about his father, <i>Lamech</i>, who had seen Adam, who had been created by God, who created the world. Abraham told his children the story of the Flood and also about the ark. <i>Isaac and Jacob</i> saw <i>Shem</i>, the son of Noah who was in the ark. He told them the story of the Flood. Jacob told his children. That is why Scripture tells us the names of Shem and his children.<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban, Genesis, 10:5.</i>
“<i>Who was the first man of might on earth</i>” [10:8]? Nimrod was a very evil person.

That is to say, he captured people with his words to rebel against the Holy One.<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 10:9.</i> <i>Pirke de Rabbi Eliezer</i> writes in the name of <i>Rabbi Judah.</i> Noah took the shirt that the Holy One made for Adam with him into the ark. Later, he gave the shirt to Nimrod and when Nimrod put on the garment, all the <i>cattle and wild animals and birds</i> came and bowed down to him. All the animals and birds were depicted on it. People thought that <i>Nimrod</i> was a mighty <i>hero</i> and made him a king over them. He began, “<i>come let us build a city</i>” [11:4]. We will build a great tower up to the heaven. They built it twenty-seven miles high and had steps to the east and steps to the west. Whoever brought up bricks went up on the east side and down on the west side. When somebody fell and broke his neck, it did not bother them. There were many thousands of people who carried bricks. However, when a brick fell down, they were very anguished and cried. They said: when will a replacement brick come up? Abraham stood up and mocked them.<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Pirke de Rabbi Eliezer</i>, chap. 24.</i>
The <i>generation of the dispersion</i> said: why does the Holy One want to be a king in heaven, and we are on the earth. Let us go up and wage war and will be <i>kings</i> above. They placed a false god on the tower and a sword in its hand. The whole world thought that the false god was at <i>war</i> with the Holy One.<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Genesis Rabbah,</i> 38.6.</i>
The <i>Rabbati</i> writes: The <i>generation of the dispersion</i> was evil because they were too rich and they had everything good. <i>Rabbi Levi</i> said: a woman gave birth to a child after three days. The <i>Rabbis</i> said: they had a child in one day and the child walked and had the intellect on the same day to go where it was sent. If the child was born during the day, the mother sent the child to get a knife to cut its umbilical cord. If it was born at night, the mother sent the child for a torch with which to cut the umbilical cord. A story occurred that a woman sent her small child at night to get a torch to cut its umbilical cord. A <i>demon</i> encountered it and said to the child. Go and tell your mother that the rooster has crowed. If the rooster had not crowed, I would have killed you. The child responded: if my mother had cut my umbilical cord, I would have killed you. They were not afraid of a <i>demon.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Genesis Rabbah</i>, 36.1.</i> From this story we should learn that one should not wander at night until the roosters have crowed. As soon as the roosters crow, the <i>demons</i> have no power. We can also learn from this story that before one cuts the child’s umbilical cord, the child is in danger.
All of the people were killed in the Flood, but the people of <i>generation of the dispersion</i>, the people who built the Tower, remained alive and not all of them died. The people of the Flood engaged in robbery and theft and that is why they were all destroyed. However, the people of the <i>generation of the dispersion</i> loved each other and there was great peace among them, and therefore, they remained alive. Rabbi [Judah the Prince] said: what a great good is peace. Even when Israel worship false gods and they are at peace with each other, the Holy One says, I cannot do anything to them. The <i>generation of the dispersion</i> said: after one thousand and six hundred and fifty-six years, the heavens will become weak. We must make four tall pillars, made of bricks, and a pillar on each side of the heaven so that the sky should rest on them and not fall down.<sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Genesis Rabbah</i>, 38.6.</i>
They said: We will build the tower to heaven. We will go up and chop windows into it, so that water should flow to us. <i>Rabbi Jeremiah</i> said: they were divided into three <i>sects.</i> One <i>sect</i> said: we will go up and will live there. The Holy One dispersed that <i>sect</i> over the whole world. The second <i>sect</i> said: we will worship false gods there. The Holy One mixed up the speech of that <i>sect.</i> The third <i>sect</i> said: we will wage <i>war</i> in heaven. The Holy One cursed that <i>sect.</i> These same people became apes and cats, and all sorts of <i>demons. Rabbi Yohanan</i> said about the towers: one third of the tower was burned. One third collapsed into the earth and one third remained standing.<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Sanhedrin,</i> 109a.</i>
“<i>Confound their speech</i>” [11:7]. <i>Pirke de-Rabbi Eliezer</i> writes: The Holy One said to seventy <i>angels</i> that surround the <i>Throne of Glory.</i> Let us go down and we will confuse the language of the people into seventy <i>languages.</i> The Holy One threw lots with the <i>angels.</i> The Holy One’s lot fell on Abraham and his children, as the verse says, “<i>for the Lord</i>’<i>s portion is His people, Jacob</i>” [Deuteronomy, 32:9]. Because they committed a sin with their language, that they said, we will build a tower. Therefore, the Holy One punished them that their language was mixed up.<sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote">Pirke de Rabbi Eliezer, chap. 24.</i>
Until the <i>generation of the dispersion</i> they all spoke the <i>Holy Tongue</i> [Hebrew] with each other, since the world was created in the <i>Holy Tongue.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">83</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanhuma</i>, Noah 19.</i> Each of the seventy <i>angels</i> took a nation and taught them a language and the Holy One taught the <i>Holy Tongue</i> to Israel. The Holy One confused their language. One asked his friend, give me an ax and he gave him a shovel. He did not understand him and they could no longer build the Tower. Their goal was: we will go up and chop large windows and holes in heaven, so that the water will run out, in the hope that the Holy One will no longer bring the Flood upon us, as the verse says, “<i>will not be out of their reach</i>” [11:6]. This means, nothing prevents them from what they are doing. They had great luck in building. That is why the Holy One dispersed them, as the verse says, “<i>the Lord scattered them</i>” [11:8]. <i>Rabbi Nehemiah</i> said: The Holy One gathered all the lands in the land of Babylon and each land swallowed its nation. The <i>Rabbis</i> said: He caused the sea to flow over them and he drowned them, but the Holy One allowed thirty <i>families</i> to survive.<sup class="footnote-marker">84</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Genesis Rabbah.</i> 38.10.</i>
“<i>These are the generations of Shem</i>” [11:10]. Why is it written concerning the people, how long they lived and that they had sons and daughters? Also, it is not written that they died, as we find from Adam to Noah. The explanation is that <i>the house of David and the Messiah</i>, who will live forever were descended from Shem, as the verse says, “<i>he asked You for life, You granted it, a long life, everlasting</i>” [Psalms, 21:5].<sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 11:10.</i> Another explanation is that it is not written that they died concerning Noah and his children, because they built the world. However, the <i>generations from Adam</i> to Noah were all killed in the Flood. Another explanation is that the generations from Adam on lived for many hundred years or more. Therefore, it is written about them that they died. That is to say, they had lived enough, but the generations from Noah on did not live so long. Therefore, it is not written about them that they died.<sup class="footnote-marker">86</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 11:11.</i>
“<i>Haran died in the lifetime of his father, Terah, in the land of his birth, in Ur of the Chaldees</i>” [11:28]. Haran died before his father, <i>Terah</i>, in the land of <i>Ur of the Chaldees.</i> The verse teaches us that Abraham risked his neck for the sake of the Holy One. Therefore, he was worthy that the Holy One spoke with him. How should the Holy One speak with Abraham without letting us know that Abraham was righteous?<sup class="footnote-marker">87</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 11:10.</i> Therefore, the verse informs us that Abraham allowed himself to be thrown into the fire for the sake of the Holy One. His father, Terah, sold <i>images and false gods</i> and Abraham was standing there once when someone came and wanted to buy a <i>false god.</i> Abraham asked him: how old are you? He responded: fifty or sixty years. He said: you are sixty years old and you want to bow down to something that is a day old. He became embarrassed and left <i>ashamed.</i> Once a woman came and brought a bowl of fine flour. She said to Abraham: take this flour as a <i>sacrifice</i> for the <i>images.</i> Abraham took the bowl with fine flour and placed it before the images. He took a big stick and broke all the images, except for one big statue that he left standing. He put the big stick in its hand. Terah came and said to Abraham: who did this? Abraham said: a woman brought fine flour as an offering. The images fought with each other, each one wanted to eat first. The biggest statue took a stick and broke them all. Terah said: do they have intellect or do they have life in them? Abraham said: if they have no intellect, then why should we worship them? Terah, his father, took him and put him into the hands of <i>Nimrod. Nimrod</i> said to <i>Abraham:</i> do you want to bow down to the fire? If you want to it is good. If you do not want to, I will throw you into the fire. <i>Haran</i> was standing nearby and did not know whom he should follow, Abraham or Nimrod. He thought to himself; I will see if Abraham will go out. Then I will say that I worship Abraham’s God. However, if Abraham will remain inside, then I will worship what <i>Nimrod</i> worships. When Abraham came out whole from the fire, <i>Haran</i>, <i>Abraham</i>’s brother, was asked, whom do you worship? He answered: I worship what Abraham worships. They threw him into the fire and his organs collapsed and died in this way. An angel came and took him out and threw him before Terah, his father. This is the meaning of the verse “<i>Haran died in the lifetime of his father, Terah</i>” [11:28].<sup class="footnote-marker">88</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Genesis Rabbah,</i> 38.13.</i> That is to say, he lay dead before his father, and his father caused his death. Had his father, Terah, not accused Abraham, he would not have been thrown into the fire. From here we learn that a person should not rely on <i>miracles</i>, but he should think that he would give his body to God. He should not hope that God would do a miracle for him, since whoever relies on miracles does not give his body gladly to God. That is why God does not do a miracle for him, as we find with Haran who allowed himself to be thrown into the fire because he saw that a miracle happened for Abraham. Concerning this, the sages said: “<i>we do not rely on miracles.</i>”<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Pesahim,</i> 64b.</i> This means that one should not rely on a miracle.
“<i>Sarai was barren, she had no child</i>” [11:30]. Here one asks that <i>Sarah</i> was barren. One knows very well that she did not have any children. What should the verse “<i>she had no child</i>” mean? There are many women who cannot have children, but after many years they do have children. The verse says about <i>Sarah</i> that she could not have children, even after any number of years, for her whole life. Therefore, Abraham and Sarah made an <i>agreement</i> that they should leave the land and wanted to go to the <i>land of Canaan</i>, the holy land, thinking that because of the merit she would become pregnant. Even though the verse says, “<i>Terah took his son Abram and Lot, the son of Haran</i>” [11:31], it is well known that Abraham was the <i>primary one</i>, and the master of the household, even over his father Terah. However, Abraham honored his father and made him the master over his whole household, but Abraham was the one who began to go to the <i>land of Israel.</i> They all followed him and therefore the verse says, “<i>Terah took.</i>” That is to say, Abraham honored Terah and made him the master of his household.<sup class="footnote-marker">90</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 11:30.</i>
“<i>Terah died in Haran</i>” [11:32]. Terah died in Haran. One asks: why did the Torah not write until about the children of Shem that they died, but with Terah it did write that he died? The sages give an explanation: He had to write that he died so that people should not say, Abraham left his land, his father and mother, left everything, as the Torah portion later says, “<i>go forth from your native land</i>” [12:1]. Go from your land and from your <i>family.</i> How is it appropriate that he should not honor his father and throw him away? Therefore, the verse first writes, “<i>Terah died.</i>” That is to say, he died. Therefore it is written, “<i>go forth from your native land</i>” [12:1] immediately afterwards. That is why he is called “<i>dead</i>” in the verse. “The evildoer is called dead even in his lifetime.”<sup class="footnote-marker">91</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Berakhot,</i> 18b.</i> The verse later says, “<i>you shall go to your fathers in peace</i>” [Genesis, 15:15]. Our sages say that he had <i>a share in the world to come.</i> The explanation is that Terah benefited from the merit of his son Abraham in that he came into the <i>Garden of Eden.</i> The <i>fruit</i> had protected the tree. That is to say, Abraham was the fruit and Terah was the tree. The <i>Midrash</i> learns from here that all woods are acceptable for the altar to burn the sacrifices, except for the olive tree and grapevines. One should not take them for the fire on the altar, because they had oil in the <i>Temple</i> and wine for the altar. Therefore, the fruits protected their trees from the fire, like Abraham was the fruit of Terah and protected Terah from the fire of <i>Gehenna.</i> The sages explicitly said: “<i>the son protects the father, but the father does not protect the son.</i>”<sup class="footnote-marker">92</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Sanhedrin,</i> 104a.</i> This means, the son protects his father from Gehenna, but the father does not protect the son from Gehenna, as the verse says, “<i>none can deliver from My hand</i>” [Deuteronomy, 32:39]. That is to say, Abraham did not protect his evil son Ishmael.<sup class="footnote-marker">93</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 11:32.</i>

<i>King Solomon, of blessed memory</i>, said in <i>Proverbs, 13.</i> “<i>He who keeps company with the wise becomes wise, but he who consorts with dullards comes to grief</i>” [Proverbs, 13:20]. The verse teaches us that the person should keep company with and be <i>friends</i> with pious people, and should separate from evildoers, that he should not be with them. Therefore he said: “keep company with the wise.” That is to say, the one who follows them and learns from them will be pious. However, the one who consorts with evildoers will be broken, that is to say, he will be destroyed. So, he should consort with the wise and from this comes that he worships the Holy One properly and always thinks about God. So too, the one who consorts with evildoers forgets about the Holy One and learns evil <i>deeds</i> from the evildoers. This person should be severely warned that he should not consort with evildoers. It is said: “<i>woe to the evildoer and woe to his neighbor.</i>”<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">M. <i>Negaim,</i> 12.6.</i> So too, Abraham wanted to <i>fulfill</i> the <i>Torah</i> and serve the Holy One properly, as the Talmud said: Abraham practiced and learned through his intellect the whole Torah and the whole Talmud, even before the Torah or the Talmud were given.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Yoma,</i> 28b.</i> Therefore, Abraham had to leave his land, since there was nothing but evildoers there. Therefore, the Holy One said to him: “<i>go forth from your land, your birthplace</i>” [12:1]. This means, go from your land and from your <i>family.</i> Our sages said:<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanhuma, Lekh Lekha</i> 3.</i> Abraham was like a glass with a good smelling fragrance and it stood in an unclean place. They did not know about the pleasant fragrance. People came and took the glass out of the unclean place and they learned of the pleasant fragrance. So too was Abraham among nothing but evildoers who worshiped <i>false gods.</i> Therefore, the Holy One told Abraham to leave his land, to publicize the good deeds that he had. This was one of the ten trials with which Abraham was tested, if he would keep the commandment to leave his city, with which he was known and lived there his whole life. He should throw away his home and go to a strange land as a <i>returning penitent.</i> This was the first trial and the tenth trial was the <i>Akedah.</i> These two trials were compared to each other. Therefore, it is written, “<i>go forth from your land</i>” and at the <i>Akedah</i> it is written, “<i>go forth to the land of Moriah</i>” [Genesis 22:2],<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The common denominator of these two verses is that they both begin with the same phrase, “go forth,” <i>lekh lekha</i> in Hebrew.</i> and slaughter your son, <i>Isaac, as a sacrifice.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 12, Introduction.</i> This teaches us that one would rather allow himself be killed rather than he should be driven out of his city where he was born and he sees his <i>family</i> before him.
“<i>I will make you a great nation</i>” [12:2]. Our sages said: the road causes a person to lose three things. He has few children, he loses money because he cannot engage in commerce, and he loses his <i>good name,</i> and he is not known in foreign lands. Therefore, the Holy One promised Abraham that even though he will go into a foreign land, he would not lose these three things. This is the meaning of “<i>I will make you a great nation.</i>” I will make you a great nation. In this land you do not merit to have children, but you must go to another land.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 12:2.</i>
“<i>I will make your name great</i>” [12:2]. I will make your name great in foreign lands. With regard to, that one loses much money, in recompense I will bless you. “<i>I will bless you and you will be a blessing</i>” [12:2]. This means, the Holy One said: I blessed Adam and Noah, and from now on, you will bless whomever you want.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 12:2.</i>
“<i>I will bless those who bless you and curse him that curses you</i>” [12:3]. I will bless those who bless you and curse those who curse you. That is to say, I will first bless those who want to bless you in the hope that the <i>blessing</i> will be stronger and better for you. The one who wants to curse you, I will curse him first, in the hope that his curse will not happen.
The Tanhuma writes: the verse says, “<i>go forth</i> [<i>lekh lekha</i>]” [12:1]. With this, the Torah tells him that you will have children at the age of one hundred years, since the numerical value of the words, <i>lekh lekha,</i> is equal to one hundred.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanhuma</i>, Lekh Lekha, 3.</i>
The Talmud writes in the first chapter of [tractate] <i>Rosh Hashanah.</i> Rabbi Isaac said: there are four things that <i>abrogate evil decrees</i> against a person. Giving charity, as the verse says, “<i>charity saves from death</i>” [Proverbs 10:2]. The second is calling to God, as the verse says, “<i>they cried to the Lord, and He saved them from their troubles</i>” [Psalms 107:28]. The third is when one gives a person a name, that one changes his name, as the verse says, “<i>you shall not call her Sarai, but her name will be Sarah</i>” [Genesis 17:15]. This means, she should not be called Sarai, but Sarah, a different name, then she would have children. The fourth is <i>changing deeds</i>, that he changes his <i>deeds.</i> If he was evil and he becomes pious, he <i>abrogates the evil decree.</i> Some sages say that when one moves out of one city where he had no luck and moves to another city, his luck can change for good.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Rosh Hashanah,</i> 16b.</i>
The Talmud says in [tractate] <i>Berakhot, chapter nine.</i> Rabbi Judah said: there are three things that shorten a person’s life. When he is called up to the <i>Torah Scroll</i> and does not go up, as the verse says, “<i>for you shall have life and long endure</i>” [Deuteronomy 30:20]. The second is when one is handed a goblet to recite the Grace after Meals and he does not recite it, the verse says, “<i>I will bless those who bless you</i>” [Genesis 12:3]. The third is the one who is arrogant, as we find concerning <i>Joseph the Righteous</i> who made himself important. That is why he died early, before his brothers.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Berakhot,</i> 55a.</i>
“<i>Abram went forth as the Lord had commanded him</i>” [12:4]. He was seventyfive years old when he left Haran. The Holy One said: you are seventy-five years old and you are plodding along in the land like a <i>penitent.</i> Because of this merit, I will cause a redeemer to be descended from you. This is <i>Queen Esther</i>, who was seventy-five years old when she went from the house of <i>Mordecai to Ahasuerus.</i> This is the meaning of <i>Hadassah</i>, the numerical value of which is seventy-five years.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Genesis Rabbah,</i> 39.13.</i>
“<i>The persons they acquired in Haran</i>” [12:5]. <i>Abraham</i> had gathered many goods and many slaves in Haran and took everything with him. Even though he still had to choose a city to live, he should not have taken everything with him. However, Abraham relied on the Holy One to give him a good land and went with all of his goods and household.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Genesis, 12:5.</i>
The explanation is “<i>that they made in Haran</i>” [12:5]. <i>Abraham</i> converted the men and Sarah converted the women. They took these people with them. Isaac did the same, as the verse says, “<i>Jacob was settled in the land where his father sojourned</i>” [Genesis 37:1].<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew term for sojourned is “<i>megurei</i>” which is similar to the word for convert “<i>ger.</i>”</i> This means, Jacob lived in the city where his father, Isaac, had done conversions. Jacob did the same, as the verse says, “<i>Jacob said to his household and to all who were with him, rid yourselves of the alien gods</i>” [Genesis 35:2]. This means, remove the false gods from yourselves.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 12:5.</i>
The Talmud says in [tractate] <i>Sanhedrin, chapter ten. Resh Lakish</i> said: The verse teaches us that whoever teaches his friend Torah, it is as if he created him, as the verse says, “<i>The persons they acquired in Haran</i>” [12:5]. <i>Rabbi Abahu</i> said: whoever brings his friend to fulfill a commandment; it is as if he created him.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Sanhedrin,</i> 99b.</i>
“<i>Abram passed through the land as far as the site of Shechem</i>” [12:6]. He prayed in Shechem that his descendants should not lose the battle in Shechem. Abraham came to the “<i>terebinth of Mamre</i>” [Genesis 14:13], where Israel will swear to God that they will keep the Torah and commandments.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 12:6.</i>
The <i>Toldot Yizhak</i> writes: Abraham went from city to city and said to the people that God was in Heaven and He created heaven and earth. Therefore, the Holy One promised Abraham, “<i>I will make you a great nation and I will bless you</i>” [12:2]. This means, I will make your name important, famous, and will make you rich, since when somebody has no <i>reputation</i> and is not rich, then people would not accept his words and they would not follow him to worship God. With this, a <i>question is explained.</i> God said to Abraham: go from your land and from your birthplace. I will make your name important and I will make you rich as a reward. One can ask question. How is it appropriate that Abraham should worship the Holy One for the sake of a reward and for money? The explanation is that Abraham did not worship for the sake of money. However, the Holy One said to Abraham: because you want to say to people that they should worship Me and if you would be poor, then your words would not be accepted. In particular, because you came from a foreign land, I must bless you with a <i>good name</i> and with money, so that you will be able to speak freely with kings and ministers. When someone is rich, they speak freely. One asks another question. Why did the verse say, “<i>I will bless those who bless you</i>” [12:3]. This means, I will bless those who bless you. That is to say, many blessings. Concerning curses, it is written, “<i>curse him who curses you</i>” [12:3]. I will curse the one who curses you. The explanation is that many people blessed Abraham and this brought them to <i>the world to come.</i> Therefore, he said that there were many who blessed you, because I will bless them all. However, there were not many cursers, only Nimrod, who considered you lowly and cursed you. I will curse that one. Since it was Abraham’s thought that he wanted to <i>convert</i> the <i>kings and ministers</i>, but he was afraid of kings that that they would kill him, as happened with Nimrod, who had him thrown into the fire. Therefore, the verse says, “<i>the Canaanites were then in the land</i>” [12:6]. That is, there was a strong king in the land of Canaan. Therefore, Abraham was afraid to call out the name of the Holy One, but he built an altar. Therefore, it is written concerning the <i>land of Canaan</i>, “<i>he built an altar</i>” [12:7], and it is not written, “<i>he invoked the Lord by name</i>” [12:7]. This means, he called on the name of God. This teaches us that he did not shout out the name of God. However, when Abraham went further and came to the mountain where the <i>king</i> was not there, it is written, “<i>he invoked the name of the Lord</i>” [12:8]. That is to say, he called out that one should worship the name of God.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Toldot Yizhak</i>, Genesis, 14:13.</i>
Later in the Torah portion, Abraham again said, “<i>the Canaanites were then in the land</i>” [13:7]. This teaches us that Abraham said to Lot. Your shepherds are arguing with my shepherds, because we have many cattle. The king is strong in the land and will expel us. Therefore, let us end the arguments. That is why the verse must say, “<i>the Canaanites were then in the land.</i>” Abraham was afraid of the <i>Canaanite king</i>, to call out the name of the Holy One. The second time shows us that Abraham was afraid to argue with Lot, so that the <i>king</i> should not expel them from the land.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid.</i>
The <i>Toldot Yizhak</i> asks another question. Why did Abraham leave the <i>land of Canaan</i>, the Holy Land, because of famine, when the Holy One had told him to go to the <i>land of Canaan?</i> The explanation is that Abraham was afraid that the gentiles would say that <i>Abraham</i> has come in to our land and has <i>converted the gentiles.</i> Therefore, the famine came to the land. Thus, <i>Abraham</i> needed to leave the land because of the famine. In particular, since this was the first famine in the world, and the gentiles would say that this happened because of the faith of Abraham.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid.</i>
“<i>I know what a beautiful woman you are</i>” [12:11]. Abraham said to Sarah. I now see that you are a beautiful woman. It is customary that when someone travels, they become <i>disheveled</i> from the journey, but you are still beautiful and this shows that you are beautiful. Another explanation is that Abraham and Sarah were very <i>modest.</i> Abraham never saw Sarah’s body all his days, but now they passed through a large body of water and he saw her bare feet. Abraham had to see her body and therefore he said: you are beautiful. We are coming to Egypt, which has nothing but dark people and they are not used to seeing a beautiful woman. They will want to take you and will kill me. Therefore, say in all the cities where you will come that you are my sister, in the hope that when they will want to take you, they will <i>at least</i> let me live and will act kindly with me. It is customary that one acts with kindness toward the brother of the <i>bride.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi and Bahya, Genesis, 12:11–13.</i>
Rabbenu Bahya writes in the name of the Ramban. Abraham <i>sinned</i> in that he brought his wife Sarah to commit a sin. Because he feared that they would kill him because of his wife, he caused that Sarah would be taken as a wife and would be <i>another man</i>’<i>s wife.</i> He should have relied on God who can protect every person. He committed another sin when he left the Holy Land, <i>the land of Canaan</i>, because of famine. As a result of this sin, Israel were in <i>the exile of Egypt</i> for four hundred years, in the very city where Abraham had sinned and this was Egypt. However, our sages say that the <i>exile of Egypt</i> was not because of the transgression, but because he said to the Holy One, how will I know that I will inherit the land of <i>Canaan?</i> This is the same as he said, “<i>how shall I know that I am to possess it</i>” [Genesis 15:8]. In any event, it was as it was. Was the exile in Egypt was the result of his sin of speaking evil? Therefore, because the exile in Egypt was the result of speaking evil against the Holy One, it lasted for four hundred and thirty years. However, the exile that we are in the present day is the result of three things, evil <i>thoughts, deeds, and envy.</i> Therefore, our exile will last three times as long as the <i>exile of Egypt.</i> This is three times four hundred and thirty years; this is twelve hundred and ninety years, and more.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 12:13.</i>
The <i>Ramban</i> writes: Abraham said to Sarah that she should say that Abraham was her brother, but Sarah did not want to do so. She would have lied about her husband, but when she came to Egypt they praised Sarah’s beauty. She was worthy for the king and they did not ask if she had a husband. Sarah was silent and she did not say that she was the wife of Abraham. Abraham himself said that she was his sister. That is why the king’s ministers and the king did much good for Abraham because of Sarah. That is why it says in the verse, “<i>what is this that you have done to me, why did you not tell me that she was your wife</i>” [12:18]. This means, the king said to Abraham: what have you done to me, that you did not tell me that she was your wife? As soon as you saw that Sarah was taken to me, you should have said that she is your wife, as it says in the verse. However, not that Pharaoh should have said something to Sarah. Why did you not say that you are married? Sarah was silent. She did not contradict her husband, since this is appropriate for every pious wife.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban, Genesis, 12:11.</i>
One can ask. Why was Abraham afraid that they would kill him? All the nations were commanded that they should not spill blood. Similarly, we find that one is commanded concerning <i>someone else</i>’<i>s wife.</i> We find that <i>Pharaoh</i> said: why did you not tell me that she is your wife? I would not have touched her. Why was Abraham afraid? The explanation is that Abraham said: the <i>Egyptians</i> engage in illicit sexual relations and they will kill me so that they should not violate the prohibition of <i>another man</i>’<i>s wife</i> with Sarah as long as I am alive, even though <i>murder</i> is as great a sin as another man’s wife. However, the <i>illicit relations</i> that they would engage in with Sarah would be for a long time and many people would sin with her. Therefore, Abraham thought to himself, they will certainly want to kill me. This is a one-time transgression. Furthermore, they will be afraid to sleep with Sarah because of me, as long as I am alive.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 12:11.</i>
One can ask another question. One should not cause people to sin, so how did <i>Abraham</i> say that she is my sister? With that he caused people to sin. The explanation is that he gave Sarah a <i>divorce</i> for the time. He thought that if they take her, she wouldn’t be a <i>man</i>’<i>s wife</i>, in any event.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Imre Noam, Genesis, 12:13.</i>
“<i>When Abram entered Egypt</i>” [12:14]. When Abraham arrived in Egypt. We hear in this verse that Abraham came to Egypt alone. It is <i>difficult</i>, where was Sarah? The explanation is that Abraham had hidden Sarah in a chest. It happened that they wanted the <i>taxes</i> from Abraham. The <i>tax collector</i> said: open the chest. I want to see what kind of <i>merchandise</i> you have in there. Abraham had to open it. A light emerged that illumined the whole city with her great beauty.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Genesis Rabbah,</i> 40.5.</i>
“<i>The woman was taken into Pharaoh</i>’<i>s palace</i>” [12:15]. The woman was taken into the house of <i>Pharaoh.</i> The <i>Pirke de Rabbi Eliezer</i> writes: Abraham was tested with ten trials. The first was that he was born. The <i>nobles</i> and <i>magicians</i> wanted to kill him, since they knew that he would bring a new religion into the world. He was hidden in a cave for thirteen years and he did not see the sun or the moon. When he went out, he spoke <i>Hebrew</i> and spoke ill of all the false gods. The second trial was that he was imprisoned for ten years, seven years in the land of <i>Kutah</i> and three years in <i>Bardo.</i> Afterwards, he was thrown into the furnace and the Holy One helped him. The third trial was that he had to wander from his land and <i>family</i> to a foreign land like a <i>penitent.</i> The fourth was the famine that was in the land of Canaan and he had to wander to the land of Egypt. The fifth was that his wife was taken from him. This was on <i>Passover.</i> The Holy One brought a plague on <i>Pharaoh</i> and his household. This was a <i>hint</i> that the Holy One would later bring plagues on Pharaoh and his household, as the verse says, “<i>I will bring one more plague upon Pharaoh</i>” [Exodus 11:1]. <i>Pharaoh</i> wrote Sarah a marriage contract, with all of his silver and gold, male and female slaves, and the <i>land of Goshen.</i> Therefore, the Israelites were in the <i>land of Goshen</i> in Egypt when they dwelled in Egypt. <i>Abimelech</i>, who had also taken Sarah, the <i>angel Michael</i> came with a drawn sword and wanted to kill <i>Abimelech.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Pirke de Rabbi Eliezer</i>, chap. 26.</i>
The sixth <i>miracle</i> was that great <i>kings</i> came to kill him and they began with <i>Lot.</i> The <i>angel Michael</i> came and said to Abraham, as the verse says, “<i>a refugee came and told Abraham</i>” [Genesis 14:13]. This means, a refugee came and told Abraham. Why is <i>Michael</i> called a <i>refugee?</i> This means, refugee, because <i>Michael</i> was running away. The Holy One threw <i>the evil angel Samael</i>, the angel of Esau, down from heaven. <i>Samael</i> grabbed <i>Michael</i> and wanted to take him with him. The Holy One saved him, and that is why <i>Michael</i> is called refugee. As soon as Abraham saw that they had captured Lot, his brother’s son, he pursued them, killing the <i>kings</i> and ministers and Lot was rescued. Abraham said: <i>Lord of the Universe</i>, I praise You that You helped me. The <i>angels</i> said about this, <i>Praised are You, O Lord, the shield of Abraham.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid., chap. 27.</i>
“<i>Because of her, it went well with Abram</i>” [12:16]. They did great favors for Abraham. They gave him sheep, cattle and other kinds of domestic animals. Concerning this, the Talmud says in [tractate] <i>Baba Mezia, chapter four.</i> A person should be accustomed to honor his wife since the <i>blessing</i> comes into the house for the sake of the wife, as the verse says, “<i>because of her, it went well with Abram</i>” [12:16]. They did great favors for Abraham, for the sake of Sarah. Raba said to the people. Honor your wives and you will have great wealth.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Baba Mezia,</i> 59a.</i>
“<i>The Lord afflicted Pharaoh</i>” [12:17]. <i>Pharaoh</i> kept Sarah in order to sleep with her. The <i>angel</i> came and brought <i>leprosy</i> on <i>Pharaoh</i> and he could not sleep with any woman. Sarah <i>prayed</i> the whole night and said: <i>Lord of the Universe</i>, you promised <i>Abraham</i> to do good and on the basis of this word I went with <i>Abraham.</i> The <i>angel</i> had a drawn sword in his hand and wanted to kill Pharaoh.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Genesis Rabbah,</i> 41.2.</i> Sarah said to <i>Pharaoh</i> that she had a husband. How is it <i>appropriate</i> that he should sleep with her? <i>Pharaoh</i> called <i>Abraham</i> and said: what have you done to me? Why did you not tell me that she is your wife? He said to Abraham: take your wife.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis, 12:17–18.</i> That is to say, he wanted to learn if she was his wife. However, Abraham was afraid to say that she was his wife. He thought they would kill him. <i>Pharaoh</i> very much wanted to know the <i>truth.</i> He thought that Sarah did not desire to have him as a husband and that is why she said that she was Abraham’s wife, hoping that Pharaoh would let her go. Therefore, <i>Pharaoh</i> said: I wanted to take her as a wife. That is to say, she should be a <i>queen</i> and not a concubine by me. Therefore, tell me if she is your sister. However, Abraham was silent and did not respond. Pharaoh understood that she was his wife and therefore said: take your wife and go.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban, Genesis, 12:18–19.</i>
<i>Bahya</i> asks a question. Why did Abraham not respond to <i>Pharaoh?</i> Later in the <i>portion</i>, with regard to <i>Abimelech</i> when he took Sarah, <i>Abimelech</i> asked: why did you not say that she is your wife and said that she is your sister? Abraham did respond to him. The explanation is because <i>Pharaoh</i> shouted to Abraham, take your wife and go. That is to say, do not tarry. Therefore Abraham feared to respond and left immediately. Since <i>Pharaoh</i> had become <i>leprous</i> because of him, he was afraid that he might kill him. However, <i>Abimelech</i> did not say that Abraham should go. Therefore, he had to respond to <i>Abimelech</i> why he had said that she was his sister.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 12:19.</i>
“<i>They sent him</i>” [12:20]. The verse teaches us that <i>Pharaoh</i> did not take away the great presents that he had given to Abraham on account of Sarah, even though it would have been justified for <i>Pharaoh</i> to take away the presents because Abraham had lied to him when he said that she was his sister. The Holy One made a miracle that it was not taken away from him.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban, Genesis, 13:1.</i> <i>Pharaoh</i> allowed Abraham to be <i>escorted</i> and he himself accompanied him for four steps.

“<i>He proceeded by stages</i>” [13:3]. The <i>Toldot Yizhak</i> writes: Abraham was righteous. Therefore, he did not think about the money. If this had happened to someone else, that he had received great <i>presents</i> through <i>trickery</i> like Abraham, he would have left very quickly and would have gotten far away from Pharaoh, in the hope that he should not have regret and take away the presents.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Genesis, 13:3.</i> Therefore, the verse says, “<i>He proceeded by stages</i>” [13:3].

Our sages say. Abraham borrowed money in all the inns on the road when he went from <i>the land of Canaan to the land of Egypt</i>, because he did not want to show his money in the inns because of thieves. Therefore, Abraham returned to the same inns to repay his debts.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis Rabbah, 41.3.</i> The sages learn from here that each person should stay in the same inn that he previously stayed at, in order not to embarrass the first <i>innkeeper.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Arachin,</i> 16b.</i>
“<i>The land could not support them</i>” [13:6]. Abraham and Lot had many cattle and they did not have enough pasture for their cattle. Therefore, there was a great war between the herdsmen of Abraham and Lot.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 13:6.</i>
The <i>Canaanites</i> and the <i>Perizzites</i> were two nations in the land of Canaan. The <i>Ramban</i> writes: Many nations had a share in the land of Canaan, but the custom was that every year a different nation lived in the land and then left. This year the Canaanites and the Perizzites lived there. In the previous year the Jebusites and Amorites lived there. They could not all live in the land of Canaan together because they did not have enough pasture for their cattle. Therefore, there was war between Abraham and Lot. Thus, Scripture tells us, “<i>There was quarreling between the herdsmen</i>” [13:7].<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban, Genesis, 13:7.</i>
“<i>The Canaanites and the Perizzites were then dwelling in the land</i>” [13:7]. That is to say, they said: the <i>Canaanites</i> and the <i>Perizzites</i> are living alone that year in the land because of the scarcity and how will we strangers be able to survive with our cattle? Another explanation is that the quarrel was between the herdsmen, because the herdsmen of Lot were nothing but evildoers and allowed their cattle to eat in stranger’s fields. The herdsmen of Abraham had no <i>respect</i> for them and said to them: you are stealing from strangers. Lot’s herdsmen responded: Abraham will inherit this land and Abraham has no son, except for Lot who is the closest heir and he will inherit this land after Abraham. That is why the verse says, “<i>the Canaanites and the Perizzites were then dwelling in the land</i>” [13:7]. That is to say, it was not yet the time to inherit. The <i>Canaanite</i> was still in the land.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis 13:7.</i> Abraham said to Lot: why should we quarrel in a foreign land? Let us separate. Lot went and selected the plain of the Jordan, which had good pasture for his <i>cattle.</i>
“<i>Lot journeyed eastward</i>” [13:11]. Lot said: I will not have anything from Abraham and also not from his God. He joined with Sodom and Gomorrah. They were very evil with their bodies and their money. Lot did not separate himself from them and remained dwelling in Sodom and Gomorrah among evildoers like himself. Our sages say: we learn from her that when an evildoer is mentioned, one should say, “<i>the fame of the wicked rots</i>” [Proverbs 10:7].<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis 13:11–13.</i>
The Talmud writes in [tractate <i>Sanhedrin</i>], <i>chapter ten.</i> The people of <i>Sodom</i> were only evil because the Holy One gave them much bread, silver and enough gold. They said: we will close the roads so that no guests should come into our land, since they only come to take our gold and silver. They also gave false <i>judgments.</i> When someone crossed a bridge, he had to give four golden gulden. When someone crossed the water near the bridge, he had to give eight golden gulden. If someone assaulted his friend’s wife so that she aborted the child, the <i>judges</i> ordered that he should sleep with that woman until she would again become pregnant. The sin of <i>adultery</i> was not observed among them. If someone wounded his friend so that blood flowed, the <i>judges</i> ordered that the person from whom the blood flowed should pay his friend who caused the blood to flow, just like [he would pay] a barber. It once happened that <i>Eliezer</i>, the servant of Abraham, came into <i>Sodom.</i> They caused him a wound to that blood flowed from him. He immediately went to the judges and took along that person. The judges ruled that Eliezer should pay him because he had caused blood to flow as a remedy, since he now did not need a barber. What did the good <i>Eliezer</i> do? He took a large stone and threw it at the <i>judge</i>, who received a grave wound, and was very bloodied. Eliezer said: give me four thaler to pay for the remedy and I will pay the other person who caused my blood to flow. Similarly, with regard to a wedding and a great <i>banquet. Eliezer</i> went to a wedding uninvited and sat at the end of the table. His neighbor asked Eliezer: who invited you to the <i>banquet?</i> Eliezer said: you invited me. The neighbor immediately grabbed his cloak and ran away from the meal. He was afraid that people would hear that <i>Eliezer</i> said about him that he had invited him to the meal. <i>Eliezer</i> sat near someone else. He also asked him the same thing. Eliezer also said, you invited me. He also immediately ran out. Eliezer did the same with the whole table until nobody else remained sitting there. <i>Eliezer</i> then made himself comfortable at the table and ate up the whole meal. They had a bed for guests. If the guest was too tall, they chopped off his feet. If he was too short, they stretched out the guest until he was as long as the bed. They said to <i>Eliezer:</i> lie down in the bed. He responded: I have made a <i>vow</i> that I will not lie in any bed since the time that my mistress Sarah died. When a <i>poor person</i> came begging, they gave him no bread. Rather, each one gave him a penny and each one had his name on his penny. When the pauper died, each one took his penny back. One time a girl gave a pauper bread and water. She went for water carried the water for the <i>pauper</i> in a jug. The people learned about this and smeared the girl with honey and tied her up for the bees and flies. The bees and flies came and ate the girl. The great outcry came before the Holy One. The Holy One said to his <i>court:</i> we must see what is this outcry, as the verse says, “<i>the outrage of Sodom and Gomorrah is so great [rabah]</i>” [18:20]. This means, the outcry of the girl. The meaning of the word “<i>rabah</i>” is a girl in <i>Hebrew.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Sanhedrin,</i> 109 a-b.

“<i>And the Lord said to Abram, after Lot had parted from him</i>” [13:14]. The verse teaches us that the Holy One did not speak with Abraham as long as he associated with <i>Lot.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 13:14.</i>

“<i>It was in the days of Amraphel</i>” [14:1]. It was in the days of <i>Nimrod</i>, who was called <i>Amraphel.</i> This means that he was called <i>Amraphel</i> because he ordered Abraham thrown in the furnace.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 14:1.</i>
Five kings waged war with four kings and the four kings were very strong and defeated the five kings. Soon after, Abraham came and waged war with the four kings.

“<i>The fugitive came</i>” [14:13]. The refugee who came was <i>Og, the king of Bashan</i>, who was called the <i>refugee</i> because he was a refugee from the war of the four kings, and told Abraham how Lot, his nephew, had been captured. <i>Og</i> did this because he wanted to take Sarah as a wife. When <i>Abraham</i> would pursue in the war, Abraham might be killed, and I will marry Sarah. Some sages say that he was called a refugee, because he was a refugee from the Flood.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 14:13.</i> He was called <i>Og</i> because he came to Abraham on the eve of Passover, when <i>matzot</i> were being baked. That is why he was called Og. This means, <i>matzot.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Genesis Rabbah,</i> 42.8. Og is derived from “<i>ugah</i>” which like <i>matzah</i> means cake.</i> The verse tells us about the great war that Abraham won against the strong kings.
“<i>Now the valley of Siddim was dotted with bitumen pits</i>” [14:10]. There were large pits with clay where the battle was and the kings fell into the pits and were killed. However, the Holy One caused a <i>miracle</i> for the <i>king of Sodom</i> and helped him out. The Holy One did this because He wanted to show that the Holy One could help a person out of his troubles and out of deep pits. There were many nations who did not want to believe that Abraham had been thrown into the fire, but now the nations saw that the Holy One helped the <i>king of Sodom</i> out of a deep pit. The nations said, indeed Abraham may have been thrown into the fire and come out alive.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 14:10.</i>
“<i>He was dwelling at the terebinths of Mamre the Amorite</i>” [14:13]. Abraham was sitting when he was told that Lot had been captured. He was sitting in <i>the terebinths of Mamre.</i> This means, in the place of <i>Mamre the Amorite</i>, who was the friend of Abraham. He advised Abraham that he should circumcise himself. Mamre said to Abraham: if the Holy One would desire from you your whole body, you can even more so give your <i>foreskin.</i> The One who saved you from the kings, from hunger and from the fire of <i>Ur of the Chaldees</i>, He will also protect you now. That is why he was called Mamre. This points to from what the Holy One had protected him. The first <i>Mem</i> points to the kings [<i>malakhim</i>]. The second <i>Mem</i> refers to circumcision [<i>Milah</i>]. The Resh refers to hunger [<i>ra</i>’<i>av</i>]. The Aleph refers to <i>fire</i> [<i>esh</i>].<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 14:13.</i>
“<i>He mustered his retainers, born in to his household, numbering three hundred and eighteen</i>” [14:14]. Abraham prepared the strong youths of his household, three hundred and eighteen men, to pursue and take Lot and his household from the kings. Our sages say that he only went with Eliezer alone, as the verse says, three hundred and eighteen. This refers to Eliezer whose name is equal to three hundred and eighteen.<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Genesis Rabbah,</i> 43.2.</i>
<i>Bahya</i> asks: how is it possible that it explicitly says three hundred and eighteen and would not explicitly say that Eliezer alone went. The explanation is: Eliezer at first took along three hundred and eighteen men and when he came to the battle, he first examined them to see that they did not have any transgressions, as is the custom in war. Abraham called out that whoever has committed any transgressions should turn back. They all turned back and Eliezer remained standing with Abraham. Therefore, it is written, “<i>he mustered his retainers</i>” [14:14]. This has two meanings. One is that he armed his men and it also means that he reduced his men and let them go home. Abraham went alone with Eliezer.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 14:14.</i>
“<i>That his brother had been taken captive</i>” [14:14]. Abraham heard that Lot had been captured and pursued. Here one can ask: why was he called <i>his brother?</i> He was not his brother. The explanation is that Abraham was righteous and Lot was an evildoer. Nonetheless, he have avenged himself and pursued them as if he was his real brother.<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid.</i>
“<i>In pursuit as far as Dan</i>” [14:14]. Abraham pursued them as far as the city of Dan. Since Israel would worship <i>false gods</i> in the city of <i>Dan</i>, Abraham’s strength dissipated in that place.<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 14:14.</i>
“<i>At night he divided them</i>” [14:15]. That is to say, it got dark. Nonetheless, Abraham continued to pursue them. Our sages say<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">Quoting <i>Genesis Rabbah,</i> 43.3; <i>Targum Jonathan,</i> Genesis, 14:15.</i> that the night was divided.

<i>Melchizedek</i>, the king of Jerusalem, brought wine and bread to Abraham and <i>honored</i> him, even though Abraham had killed the children of <i>Melchizedek.</i> The <i>Midrash</i> writes that <i>Melchizedek</i> was the son of <i>Shem</i>, the son of <i>Noah.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 14:18.</i>
“<i>He said, blessed be Abram of God Most High</i>” [14:19]. This means that Abraham should be blessed and praised be God, the Most High, who has placed Abraham’s enemies in his hands. <i>Melchizedek</i> committed a transgression in that he first blessed Abraham before he gave praise to the <i>Holy One.</i> Therefore, the Holy One punished <i>Melchizedek</i> and took away the <i>priesthood</i> and the Holy One made Abraham a <i>priest.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 14:19.</i> Abraham gave a tithe to Melchizedek since he was still a priest at that time.<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 14:19.</i>
The king of Sodom said to Abraham. Give me back the people that you captured and keep the money and goods.

You should say that you have made Abraham rich.<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis, 14:21–23.</i>
“<i>From a thread to a sandal strap</i>” [14:23]. Our sages say that the Holy One said to Abraham. As a result of the merit that you said, “<i>from a thread</i>,” I will give my <i>commandment</i> of the threads to your children. This is the <i>commandment o</i>f <i>zizit.</i> Also, because you said, “<i>to a sandal strap.</i>” This means that you did not even touch a strap of the shoe of the <i>king of Sodom.</i> Therefore, your children will have the <i>commandment of tefillin</i> that are made of straps. They will also have the <i>commandment of halizah</i>, which is done with the strap off a shoe.<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 14:23.</i>
“<i>Fear not Abram, I am a shield to you</i>” [15:1]. The Holy One said to Abraham: you will have three things. The first is, do not fear the children of the kings that you killed will take revenge on you. The second is that He told him: you will have a son. Therefore, the verse says, “<i>your reward will be great</i>” [15:1]. He said much [<i>harbeh</i>] with two <i>heh</i>’<i>s.</i> That is to say, when a <i>heh</i> will be given to Sarah She was previously called Sarai, and later, the Holy One gave her the name <i>Sarah</i>, with a <i>heh.</i> That is to say, when Sarah and Abraham will each have a <i>heh</i> [in their name], they will have children. Concerning <i>Rachel</i>, she said that she did not have a <i>heh</i> in her name. Therefore, she gave <i>Bilhah</i>, her maid who had two <i>heh</i>’<i>s</i> in her name, to Jacob so that one <i>heh</i> should come to Rachel so that she should have children.<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 29:35.</i> The third thing that the Holy One promised Abraham: you will have [a place in] the <i>world to come.</i> Abraham did not understand why the Holy One did not explicitly say that He would give him children and the <i>world to come.</i> That is why he says, what will you give me if I will not have children?

“<i>He took him outside</i>” [15:5]. The Holy One led Abraham out of his house, showed him the stars in the sky and said: just as you cannot count the stars in the sky, so many will be your children. You will not be able to count them. Our sages say: The Holy One took Abraham above the sky and the world and said to him: You are above the <i>constellations</i> and even though your <i>star and constellation</i> knows that you should have no children, you can change the <i>mazal</i> <sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">The term “<i>mazal</i>” refers both to a constellation and to fortune.

“<i>And because he put his trust in the Lord, He reckoned it to his merit</i>” [15:6]. Abraham counted it as a <i>charitable act to God</i> that He promised him to give him children. The Holy One did this for His sake and not because of <i>Abraham</i>’<i>s merit.</i> So writes the <i>Ramban.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban, Genesis, 15:6.</i> <i>Bahya</i> writes that the Holy One reckoned it to Abraham as a great thing that Abraham believed what God said. The Holy One considered this as if Abraham did a deed with a commandment, even though he did not have in mind to fulfill a commandment.<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 15:6.</i>
The <i>Toldot Yizhak</i> asks a question. Why did Abraham ask the Holy One: give me a sign that I will inherit the land? The Holy One had promised Abraham that he would have children, and he immediately believed and did not desire any sign. The explanation is that <i>Abraham</i> only desired, give me a sign that my children will inherit the land. When you will show me a sign that my children will inherit the land, then I will certainly believe that you will give me children, since who will inherit if I will not have children? The <i>Toldot Yizhak</i> asks another question. Why did Abraham say: “<i>I shall die childless</i>” [15:2]? This means, I will go alone without children. The Holy One had said to Abraham, “<i>for I give all the land that you see to you and your offspring forever</i>” [13:15]. “<i>I will make your offspring as the dust of the earth</i>” [13:16]. This means, I will give you and your children the whole land and you will have as many children as the dust of the earth. The explanation is: Abraham thought that the Holy One had promised to give his <i>descendants</i> the land. This means, that He would give the land to his <i>family</i>, but not to his own son that was descended from him. That is why Abraham feared that Eliezer was also part of his household and would be Abraham’s heir. Eliezer was like a son, the chief of his household. Therefore, the Holy One said to Abraham, the one who will be your heir will come from your loins, from your flesh. Therefore, the Torah had to say, “<i>your very own issue shall be your heir</i>” [15:4]. This explains why the Torah said, from your loins, more so than anywhere else in the whole Torah. He asks another question. “<i>He put his trust in the Lord</i>” [15:6]. This means, he believed what God had told him. This was heard as, he would now believe, but previously he did not, <i>heaven forbid</i>, believe. The explanation is that Abraham now believed that the Holy One would give him children, because he had explicitly heard that the children who would be his heirs would come from Abraham’s loins. However, previously Abraham had thought that his <i>family</i> would inherit, or his servant Eliezer would inherit.<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Genesis, 15:1–6.</i>
“<i>I am the Lord who brought you out of Ur of the Chaldees</i>” [15:7]. The Holy One said: it was my intent to give you the land from the time that I took you out of <i>Ur of the Chaldees</i> and performed a miracle for you. Abraham thought: when my children will sin or the <i>gentiles</i> will repent, the Holy One would give the land to his children. Therefore, Abraham asked: let me know if my children will certainly have the land even if they will sin or if the gentiles will repent. The Holy One answered him that they will certainly inherit the land.<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban, Genesis, 15:7.</i>
<i>Bahya</i> writes. The <i>Midrash</i> writes that when Abraham was born a star arose in the sky from the <i>east</i> and swallowed up four stars, from all four corners of the world. The <i>wise men</i> said to Nimrod: a son is born to <i>Terah</i> now and from him will come descendants who will inherit <i>this world</i> and <i>the world to come.</i> Our <i>advice</i> is that you should give Terah much gold and silver. Let him give you his son and you should kill him. <i>Nimrod</i> immediately sent to <i>Terah</i> and said: Give me your son and I will give you much silver and gold. <i>Terah</i> responded to <i>Nimrod</i> with a <i>parable.</i> One says to a horse. I will give you much oats to eat, but let me chop off your head. Who will eat the oats when you want to chop off my head? Similarly, who will inherit the gold and silver when you want to kill my son? <i>Nimrod</i> said: I understand from your words that a son was born to you yesterday. <i>Terah</i> responded: He died as soon as he was born. Nimrod responded: I want the live one that was born to you yesterday. <i>Terah</i> went and immediately hid Abraham in a cave for three years. The Holy One sent him two boulders. From one of them flowed oil and from the other one, honey and fine flour. When he was three years old he went out of the cave. He thought: who created heaven and earth and also me? He prayed for a whole day to the sun. At night the sun set in the west and the moon rose in the east and he saw stars along with it. He prayed to the moon and said that the moon is the lord and the stars its servants.<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 15:7.</i>
“<i>How shall I know that I am to possess it</i>” [15:8]? With what merit will I inherit the land? The Holy One responded: with the <i>merit</i> of the <i>sacrifices.</i> That is why the verse says, “<i>bring me a heifer</i>” [15:9]. This means, take me a calf, a goat, a ram, a turtledove and a young pigeon. With this, the Holy One showed that his children would bring <i>sacrifices</i> from the <i>animals and birds. Abraham</i> cut the <i>animals</i> in half and put one half on one side and one half on the other side and he walked between the two pieces. <i>Abraham</i> swore that he would serve the Holy One forever, and if he would transgress and not serve the Holy One, he should be chopped up like the animals were chopped up. The Holy One also swore to Abraham that He would give him the land and sent His <i>messenger.</i> This was the fire and He let the fire go between the two halves of the animals. That is to say, it was as if the Holy One himself passed through and swore that He would give him the land. Abraham had chopped up all the animals and he did not chop the birds in half. The animals are an <i>allusion</i> to the nations that will disappear from the world. However, <i>Israel</i> is compared to the birds that he did not chop in half. With this he showed that <i>Israel</i> would always exist in the world. Birds of prey came and flew on the pieces of meat. Abraham chased them away. He showed that the nations would not be destroyed soon. However, in the days of the <i>Messiah</i> the nations will be destroyed.<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 15:9–11.</i>
“<i>A great dark dread descended upon him</i>” [15:12]. A great darkness and dread came over Abraham, and the Holy One showed him that his descendants would be in exile. The Holy One also swore that when <i>Israel</i> will be evil, they would be exiled from their land.<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban, Genesis, 15:12.</i>
“<i>Know well that your offspring shall be strangers</i>” [15:13]. The Holy One said to Abraham: your children will be strangers for four hundred years and they will have to serve and work. The exile of Egypt began when Isaac was born. Even though they were not yet in Egypt, they did not have a land and were like strangers in foreign lands from the time that Isaac was born.<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 15:13.</i>
<i>Bahya</i> writes that the exile was four hundred years. That is, because they had an evil eye to give <i>charity</i> to the poor. That is why they were called <i>evil eye.</i> It has the numerical value of four hundred. From here we can learn that our exile for our <i>sins</i> becomes longer because we do not give <i>charity</i> properly.<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 15:13.</i>
“<i>I will execute judgment on the nation they shall serve</i>” [15:14]. The Holy One said that the nation for whom Israel will serve and work hard, I would also repay them their pay that they made Israel work hard. In Egypt, I will give them ten <i>plagues</i> and I will repay the other kings, and pay each one their pay separately, in all the <i>exiles</i> when they will leave. I will also make <i>Israel</i> rich with great <i>wealth</i>, just like they left Egypt with so much gold and silver that they emptied out all of Egypt.<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 15:14.</i>
“<i>You shall go to your fathers in peace</i>” [15:15]. However, you Abraham will not see any exile. You will come to your <i>grave in peace.</i> However, the verse teaches us that <i>Terah</i>, the father of Abraham, <i>repented</i> before he died. If he had still worshiped false gods and died that way, as an evildoer, then the verse would not have said to Abraham, you will come to your father. Abraham was <i>righteous</i> and how is it appropriate that he should come to the <i>world to come</i> to an evildoer.<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 15:15.</i>
The <i>Ramban</i> writes. The Holy One said to Israel. When I commanded that you should be in the <i>exile of Egypt</i> and you should be tormented with work for the people of Egypt, nonetheless I will similarly punish the same people. One asks a question here. When the <i>decree</i> of the Holy One was on <i>Israel</i>, that they should be slaves in Egypt, so why are the Egyptians guilty? The explanation is that the <i>Egyptians</i> thought up much evil. They threw the children in <i>Egypt</i> into the water and made them do heavy labor. Their <i>intention</i> was to hurt them and not about work. They wanted to extirpate Israel from the world more than the decree allowed.<sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban, Genesis, 15:15.</i>
“<i>You shall be buried at a ripe old age</i>” [15:15]. The Holy One had promised Abraham that he would die and he would not see anything evil in his children, that they should worship false gods during his lifetime. This teaches us that <i>Ishmael repented</i> during his lifetime and <i>Esau the evildoer</i> did not yet worship false gods, because Abraham was still alive. That is why Abraham had to die five years earlier than his time, in the expectation that he would not see Esau worshipping false gods. On the very day that Abraham died, <i>Esau</i> began to worship false gods and committed <i>murder.</i> The anguish is very great when one sees evil in one’s children. The Holy One said: it is better that you should die five years earlier so that you should not see evil in your children.<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 15:15.</i>
“<i>They shall return here in the fourth generation</i>” [15:16]. The Holy One said: you will have to be in the <i>exile of Egypt</i> for three generations and in the fourth generation you will again return to the land of Canaan. This is the same as the <i>land of Israel.</i> The nations of the world who now live in the <i>land of Israel</i> are not yet full of sins. That is to say, their time has not yet come that they should be driven out from their land. The Holy One first pays when the measure is full of sins.<sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 15:16.</i>
“<i>A smoking oven and a flaming torch</i>” [15:17]. God sent smoke and fire and this went between the chunks of meat. That is to say, this was the messenger of the Holy One, that He had sworn to Abraham that he would keep everything, to give him the <i>land of Israel.</i>
“<i>Sarai, Abram</i>’<i>s wife, had borne him no children, she had an Egyptian maidservant whose name was Hagar</i>” [16:1]. Sarah did not have children and she had a maid who was the daughter of the <i>king of Egypt. Pharaoh</i> said: let my daughter be a maidservant for Abraham since many <i>miracles</i> were done for Abraham. Sarah took the maid Hagar and gave her to Abraham that he should sleep with her in order to have children, since she saw that she was not able to have children in ten years. Abraham did the will of Sarah.<sup class="footnote-marker">83</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 16:1–3.</i> He came to Hagar, but his <i>intention</i> was that his primary child should not come from Hagar, but Sarah had desired that Abraham should have children with the maid. This was a <i>source of satisfaction</i> because it was her maid. Or, Sarah’s thought was that for the merit of her giving her maid to her husband perhaps the Holy One would also give her children. That is why it is written, “<i>Abram heeded Sarai</i>’<i>s request</i>” [16:2]. That is to say, Abraham did this to please Sarah, and he came to the maid. Therefore, it is written, “<i>Sarai, Abram</i>’<i>s wife, took</i>” [16:3]. That is to say, Abraham did not want to come to her, but he became angry and Sarah had to accompany her, like one accompanies a bride.<sup class="footnote-marker">84</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban, Genesis, 16:2–3.</i>
Here one asks a question. Why does the verse have to say, “<i>Sarai, Abram</i>’<i>s wife took</i>” [16:3]? Don’t we know that Sarah was the wife of Abraham? The <i>Ramban</i> gives the explanation. The verse shows us that Sarah accompanied her maid, as if Sarah said, Abraham is my husband and I am his wife. I will not divorce him. Therefore, the verse says here, “<i>Sarai, Abram</i>’<i>s wife took</i>” [16:3]. That is to say, when she accompanied Hagar to Abraham, she was still Abraham’s wife. It is written and she <i>took?</i> That is to say, Hagar did not want to sleep with Abraham. She was ashamed before Sarah that she should sleep with her master.<sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban, Genesis, 16:3.</i>
The verse also teaches us that when a person has a wife for ten years and has no children with her, then he should <i>divorce</i> her, as the verse says, “<i>after ten years</i>” [16:3]. When Abraham did not have children for ten years, <i>Sarah</i> took the maid Hagar and gave her to <i>Abraham.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">86</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 16:3.</i>
“<i>He cohabited with Hagar and she conceived</i>” [16:4]. <i>Abraham</i> slept with <i>Hagar</i> and she became pregnant. <i>Hagar</i> said about <i>Sarah</i> that she must not be properly pious; <i>Abraham</i> had been married to <i>Sarah</i> for many years and she did not have any children. I slept with <i>Abraham</i> once and became pregnant, and <i>Hagar</i> held her mistress in contempt. <i>Sarah</i> said to <i>Abraham:</i> you listen to my shame, how my maid shames and insults me and you are silent. God should pay you for this. <i>Sarah</i> further said to <i>Abraham:</i> you should have <i>prayed</i> for me and for you, that we should have children together. You only <i>prayed</i> for yourself. You said, “<i>I shall die childless</i>” [15:2], I go alone without children and you did not <i>mention</i> me.<sup class="footnote-marker">87</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 16:4–5.</i>
“<i>The Lord decide between you and me</i>” [16:5]. God should judge between you and me and the child that the maid is carrying. With these words she caused the maid to abort the child. She cast an evil eye on the child in the womb.<sup class="footnote-marker">88</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 16:5.</i>
Our <i>sages</i> learn from here that whoever desires a <i>judgment</i> from the Holy One; it does not end well for him. <i>Sarah</i> also sinned with her words and she had to die forty-eight years before her time had come. She should have lived as long as her husband, Abraham.<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 16:5.</i>
Abraham said to Sarah: take your maid and do with her what you want. Sarah immediately began to torment her with all sorts of heavy labor and forbade her from coming to Abraham’s bed.<sup class="footnote-marker">90</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Genesis Rabbah,</i> 45.6.</i>
<i>Ramban</i> writes. Because Abraham allowed the maid to be tormented and Sarah tormented her, this is why the children of Hagar rule over the children of Abraham and cause them pain.<sup class="footnote-marker">91</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban, Genesis, 16:6.</i>
The maid ran away from the house of Sarah. An <i>angel</i> came and found her in the field. “<i>He said, Hagar, slave of Sarah, where have you come from</i>” [16:8]. Bahya asks a question. Why did the angel have to say, Hagar, the maid of Sarah? We know very well that she was Sarah’s maid. The verse teaches us that the <i>angel</i> appeared to her because of her merit in being the maid of Sarah. He also showed that <i>Hagar</i>’<i>s</i> children would be servants and maids to Sarah’s children in the future.<sup class="footnote-marker">92</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 16:8.</i>
The angel said to Hagar: go back home to the house of Sarah and be tormented by the hand of Sarah. Later, another angel came and said to Hagar. You will have a son and you will call him <i>Ishmael</i>, because God has heard your cry. This son will be a wild man. He will beat all the people and all the people will beat him. She had a son and Abraham called him Ishmael, since prophecy rested on him that he guessed the name that the angel had told Hagar.<sup class="footnote-marker">93</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 16:15.</i>
<i>Ramban</i> writes that Hagar did not want to give the child a name, since she was ashamed because she was not a proper wife to Abraham. Thus, Hagar told Abraham what the angel had said, that he should be called <i>Ishmael</i>, and Abraham listened to her.<sup class="footnote-marker">94</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban, Genesis, 16:11.</i>
Abraham was eighty-six years old when Hagar gave birth to Ishmael. The verse lets us know how old Abraham was, in the expectation that we should know that Ishmael was thirteen years old when he allowed himself to be <i>circumcised</i> and he did not rebel against his father.<sup class="footnote-marker">95</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 16:16.</i>
“<i>Abram was ninety-nine years old</i>” [17:1]. Abraham was ninety-nine years old when God appeared to him and said to Abraham. I am God over the whole world and am called <i>El Shaddai</i> because I am eternal and can make you fresh and strong. Do not think that the <i>circumcision</i> will make you weak.<sup class="footnote-marker">96</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 17:1.</i>
“<i>Walk before Me and be whole</i>” [17:1]. The Holy One said to Abraham: be whole for Me. That is to say, do not be divided in your body, that your heart should not be the same as your mouth.<sup class="footnote-marker">97</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid.</i> Another explanation is when you will be <i>circumcised</i>, then you will be whole before Me, since the foreskin is a <i>defect</i> before Me.<sup class="footnote-marker">98</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 17:1.</i>
Another explanation is that as long as you have the <i>foreskin</i>, you have damaged five organs. Your two eyes cannot see the correct belief in the Holy One. Your two ears cannot hear the commandments of the Holy One, and the foreskin is a <i>defect</i> in you. Therefore, the Holy One said: I will now give your name a <i>heh</i>, so that you should not be called <i>Abram</i> but <i>Abraham</i>, with the <i>heh.</i> With the <i>circumcision</i>, you have received five organs to properly serve the Holy One.
“<i>And you shall no longer be called Abram, but your name shall be Abraham</i>” [17:5]. You shall no longer be called <i>Abram</i>, but Abraham. This means that you are a father over all the nations.<sup class="footnote-marker">99</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 17:5.</i>
“<i>My covenant shall be marked in your flesh as an everlasting pact</i>” [17:13]. The circumcision should be a sign in your flesh that you should serve the Holy One eternally and the sign should not be removed. The <i>circumcision</i> is better than a <i>sacrifice</i>, since the sacrifice is bought from his money, but the circumcision is in his flesh. <i>Pirke de Rabbi Eliezer</i> writes: Abraham <i>circumcised</i> himself on Yom Kippur and every year the Holy One sees the blood on Yom Kippur and forgives our sins.<sup class="footnote-marker">100</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Pirke de Rabbi Eliezer</i>, chap. 29.</i> <i>Ramban</i> writes. Circumcision was commanded because when one cuts off the <i>foreskin</i>, that organ becomes weak and does not have so much power.<sup class="footnote-marker">101</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban, Genesis, 17:9.</i>
<i>Toldot Yizhak</i> asks a question. Why does Scripture have to say that Abraham was ninety-nine years old when he was commanded to circumcise himself? The reason is because Abraham was very old and did not have any children. Thus, it was correct that the Holy One should not have commanded Abraham to cut off his foreskin, because he was old and weak and could not have children. How much more so, would he make himself even weaker to have children, with the circumcision? Especially since the place of circumcision is the place where one has children. That is why the verse says that Abraham was very old. God said to Abraham. I am God who can make the whole world strong. Therefore, do not be afraid to circumcise yourself even though you are too old and weak to have children. I will give you many children after the circumcision and will give the <i>land of Israel</i> to your offspring because of the <i>merit of circumcision.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">102</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Genesis, 17:1.</i>
“<i>Abraham threw himself on his face</i>” [17:17]. Before Abraham was circumcised, he could not stand before the <i>Shekhinah.</i> As soon as the Holy One appeared to Abraham, Abraham fell on his face because Abraham still had the foreskin, he could not see the Holy One. That is to say, the splendor of the Holy One. However, after the circumcision it is written, “<i>Abraham remained standing before the Lord</i>” [18:22]. This means, Abraham still stood before the Holy One.<sup class="footnote-marker">103</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 17:17.</i>
“<i>You shall not call her</i>” [17:15]. This means, you should not call her <i>Sarai</i>, but <i>Sarah</i>, since <i>Sarah</i> means, a mistress of the whole world.<sup class="footnote-marker">104</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 17:15.</i>
“<i>Abraham fell on his face and laughed</i>” [17:17]. Abraham could not keep himself from laughing, but he was ashamed to laugh openly, so he lay on his <i>face</i> and laughed. He was so old and Sarah also, and they should have children?<sup class="footnote-marker">105</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Genesis, 17:17.</i>
The Holy One said: I will bless Sarah and she will menstruate again, like the young women and I will bless Sarah that she will have milk in her breasts. The whole world did not believe that Sarah should have a child and that she had Isaac. Sarah made a banquet and invited all the important people and nobles, with their wives, to the banquet. The women said that Sarah had taken a stranger’s child and she says that she had given birth to the child. Therefore, they took their children and did not bring their wet nurses. The children cried at the banquet and they asked Sarah that she should nurse their children. Sarah took all the children and nursed them. The Holy One had blessed Sarah with much milk. The women saw explicitly that she had much milk and they said that it is indeed true that Sarah had given birth to a child.<sup class="footnote-marker">106</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Baba Mezia,</i> 87a.</i>
The Midrash writes that the Holy One took the <i>yud</i> from Sarah and divided it into two parts. He gave half to Abraham and half remained with Sarah.<sup class="footnote-marker">107</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yud</i> has the numerical value of ten. <i>Heh</i>, which he added to the names of both Abraham and Sarah, has a numerical value of five. That is the basis of this statement.</i> The <i>yud</i> complained before the Holy One. Why did you take me a way from a <i>righteous woman?</i> The Holy One responded: I will give you to a righteous man who will first be called <i>Hoshea</i> and then later he will be called <i>Yehoshua</i>, with the <i>yud.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">108</sup><i class="footnote">A reference to Joshua.

“<i>Can a child be born to a man a hundred years old</i>” [17:17]. <i>Abraham</i> said: I am one hundred years old, and <i>Sarah</i> is ninety years old, should she have children? Here one asks a <i>question.</i> How is it that <i>Abraham</i> should wonder about having children when God promised him that he would have children? Furthermore, we find that each old person, also ninety years old, can have children, even in our times. Abraham had children with <i>Keturah</i> forty years after he was told this. However, the <i>explanation</i> is that <i>Abraham</i> said: I was young and strong and had no children with Sarah. Now, <i>Sarah</i> and I are old and we are supposed to have children? This must be a miracle from God and I believe that God can do this.<sup class="footnote-marker">110</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban, Genesis, 17:17.</i>
Abraham rejoiced and was very happy. Therefore, the Holy One said, “<i>you shall name him Isaac</i>” [17:19]. You shall call the name of your son, Isaac. This means, happy. This teaches us that Abraham was not mocking, but Abraham was full of joy. That is why the Holy One also called the name of the son Isaac. This means, joy. Because the name of Isaac came from the Holy One, therefore the name remained forever. The name Abraham was changed. At first he was called Abram and later he was called Abraham. Jacob also first called Jacob and later God called him Israel, but Isaac’s name came from the Holy One. That is why it remained so forever. <i>Bahya</i> writes another explanation. Abraham changed his name because he became the father of many nations. The name of Jacob was changed because an angel had struggled with him and Jacob had subdued the angel. However, nothing happened to Isaac, so his name remained the same.<sup class="footnote-marker">111</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 17:19.</i>
Isaac was called this for the following: The <i>yud</i> alludes to the ten <i>miracles</i> that occurred to <i>Abraham.</i> The <i>zadi</i> alludes to the ninety years that Sarah was old. The <i>het</i> alludes to the circumcision that takes place on the eighth day. The <i>kuf</i> alludes to the hundred years that Abraham was old, when he became the father of Isaac.<sup class="footnote-marker">112</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 17:19. This is a play on the numerical value of the letters in Isaac’s name in Hebrew.</i>
“<i>As for Ishmael, I have heard you</i>” [17:20]. The Holy One said: I have heard your prayer that you have prayed for Ishmael. I will give Ishmael twelve princes, important nobles for Ishmael. That is why the Holy One said, “<i>twelve princes</i>,” twelve nobles and did not say twelve children. However, He said that Ishmael would have important children and kings, more than the kings of [the nations of] the world. They were called princes. This means, clouds. That is to say, they will be important at first, but in the end their kingdom will disappear from the world, like a cloud, as it says, “<i>I will make him a great nation</i>” [17:20]. I will make him a great nation.<sup class="footnote-marker">113</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 17:20.</i>
“<i>He circumcised the flesh of their foreskins</i>” [17:23]. Abraham first circumcised the three hundred and eighteen men, the slaves of his household. Then he circumcised himself. Had he circumcised himself first, he would have been too weak and would not have been able to properly circumcise those in his household.<sup class="footnote-marker">114</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 17:23.</i>
“<i>Shall be a sign of the covenant</i>” [17:11]. The circumcision should be a sign and a testimony that you have begun the faith in Me. There are three commandments in the Torah that are called <i>sign.</i> This means, it is a sign and testimony about the Holy One that He is one. These are <i>Sabbath</i>, <i>tefillin</i> and circumcision. Therefore, the person must have two testimonies on himself that testify about the Holy One.<sup class="footnote-marker">115</sup><i class="footnote">In Jewish law, the testimony of two witnesses is required. The testimony of one witness is insufficient.</i> During the week the person has circumcision and <i>tefillin</i>, and on the Sabbath he does not need tefillin because the Sabbath is itself a <i>sign</i> and a <i>testimony.</i> Thus, he has Sabbath and circumcision, as two <i>witnesses.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">116</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 17:24.</i> The Midrash writes that circumcision is a great commandment.

“<i>And the Lord appeared</i>” [18:1]. The <i>Shekhinah</i> appeared to Abraham, who had done the will of God and circumcised himself. Therefore, the Holy One appeared to Abraham and that is why it is written, “<i>and the Lord appeared to him</i>” [18:1]. God appeared to him. That is to say, to Abraham. Therefore, he did not need to name to whom He appeared.

“<i>By the terebinths of Mamre</i>” [18:1]. He appeared by the <i>terebinths of Mamre</i>, in the city of <i>Mamre</i>, who was a friend of Abraham. He had <i>advised</i> Abraham that he should <i>circumcise</i> himself publicly. Abraham had asked for his advice, if he should circumcise himself publicly. <i>Mamre</i> gave him the <i>advice</i> that he should circumcise himself publicly. Therefore, Mamre was worthy that the <i>Shekhinah</i> appeared in his city.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Tanhuma, Vayera, 3.</i> It is known that the <i>Shekhinah</i> appears with fire, with water, in the wind, and on the earth. This is explicitly written concerning all the <i>prophets</i>, but with Abraham the <i>Shekhinah</i> appeared on a tree, as the verse says, in the <i>terebinths of Mamre.</i> This means, there were many trees and much wood in the city of <i>Mamre.</i> The Holy One appeared to Abraham near a tree. This teaches us that the Holy One appeared to <i>Abraham.</i> How is a tree when it becomes old? It still grows and gives fruit. So too is Abraham, he will also have children in his old age.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 18:1.</i>
“<i>He was sitting at the entrance of the tent as the day grew hot</i>” [18:1]. Abraham sat by the door in the sun, which was a <i>remedy</i> for his circumcision. Another explanation is that he wanted to see if guests were coming. However, what did the Holy One do? He made it very hot in the world so that no guests should come, so that they should not disturb him, since he was weak. The Holy One saw that Abraham was anguished that no guests were coming. The Holy One caused three angels to come, like three guests. One of the three angels was <i>Michael</i>, who was to tell Sarah that she would have a son and <i>Michael</i> would protect Lot from <i>Sodom.</i> The second was <i>Raphael</i>, to heal Abraham’s circumcision. The third one was the <i>angel Gabriel</i>, to overturn the cities of <i>Sodom and Gomorrah.</i> One asks a question. Could not one angel have done it all? The explanation is that one angel cannot do good and evil, since an angel who does good and is nothing but <i>grace and mercy.</i> On the other hand, another angel only does <i>judgment.</i> That is why <i>Michael</i> is placed over <i>grace and mercy.</i> He told Sarah the good news and protected Lot. Here one asks another question. Why did <i>Michael</i> also not heal <i>Abraham?</i> The explanation is that <i>Raphael</i> is placed over <i>healing</i>, and no other angel should encroach on his realm. Therefore, <i>Raphael</i> had to come to heal Abraham.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">A combination of Rashi and Bahya, Genesis, 18:1–2.</i>
“<i>He saw them and he ran toward them</i>” [18:2]. Abraham first saw the three <i>angels</i> standing together and he saw that they were thinking and did not want to go into Abraham’s house, because they did not want to trouble Abraham. He understood this and immediately ran toward them and asked them to come and eat.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 18:2.</i>
The Talmud in [tractate] <i>Baba Mezia</i> asks a question. It is written here, “<i>standing over him</i>” [18:2]. This means, the angels were standing near Abraham. Why did he have to run when they were standing near him? The explanation is that the angels were standing near him at first, but when they saw that Abraham was binding the circumcision wound, they immediately left him. Therefore, Abraham had to run to them. That is why it is written, “<i>he ran toward them.</i>” He ran toward them and bowed to them.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Baba Mezia,</i> 86b.</i>
“<i>He said, my Lord</i>” [18:3]. Abraham said to the senior one, I ask you my lord, remain here with me and eat with me. If the senior one would remain, then the other two would also remain. Thus, this <i>explains</i> why it says, “<i>he said, my Lord</i>” [18:3]. This means that he said to one angel, remain. That is to say, the senior one.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 18:3.</i>
One asks a question. How did Abraham recognize the senior one? The explanation is that the one in the middle was the senior one.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 18:3.</i>
Another explanation is that Abraham said, “<i>he said, my Lord</i>” [18:3] to the Holy One, who had appeared. That is to say, he said, <i>Lord of the Universe</i>, wait with me until I bring the guests into my house.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 18:3.</i>
The <i>Toldot Yizhak</i> also asks this question. Why did Abraham speak to the one; there were three of them. The explanation is that the angel who came to tell Sarah that she would have a son would certainly remain. The one who would heal Abraham would also certainly remain. Thus, Abraham said to the third one, I also ask you to remain, even though you were not sent to do something here. Since your colleagues are remaining here to fulfill their tasks, remain here also <i>for the sake of collegiality.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Genesis, 18:3–4.</i>
This explanation also explains another good question. The verse says, “<i>he said, my Lord</i>” [18:3]. This means, as if there was one angel. He should have said, “<i>he said to them, do not pass by</i>” [18:3], like he later said [in the plural], “<i>wash your feet, refresh yourselves; then go on</i>” [18:4–5]. This means, he said to all of them, wash your feet, eat and then you will all go. However, the explanation is that at first he only spoke to the angel of Sodom that he should remain for the <i>sake of collegiality.</i> Afterwards, he asked all of them, eat and drink. Even though Abraham was weak from the circumcision, yet he still ran toward them and made himself strong and fresh before his guests. Therefore, one should not make oneself appear sick or in pain when guests come, since the guest thinks that he makes himself weak or sick because of him.
Abraham thought that they were important people, <i>righteous ones and prophets</i>, because they came unexpectedly to Abraham. He did not see them walking in the distance. It is normal that when someone comes from a distance, one sees him in the distance and then he comes closer. However, here <i>Abraham</i> did see them walking, but they were standing near <i>Abraham</i>, as if they had fallen down from heaven. That is why it is written, “<i>standing near him</i>” [18:2]. That is to say, they were standing near him unexpectedly. “<i>He ran toward them</i>” [18:2]. Here one asks a question. It should have said; <i>he ran after them.</i> This means, he ran after them. However, the explanation is that the angel has no back. He has a face on all four sides. Abraham thought that they were <i>prophets</i> who could make themselves appear to have <i>faces</i> and eyes on all four sides, by means of <i>magical names.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Genesis, 18:2.</i>
“<i>Let a little water be brought and bathe your feet</i>” [18:4]. Abraham said that a little water should be brought to wash your feet. Abraham thought that they were <i>Arabs</i>, a nation that worships the dust of their feet. Therefore, Abraham did not want to allow any false gods to be brought into his house. Our <i>sages</i> learn from here that because Abraham ordered his youths should give the water and did not go himself; therefore, the Holy One paid his children in the <i>desert</i> when they needed water. The Holy One did not want to give them water himself from heaven, but they received water through Moses. He had to bring them water out of the rock. The Holy One repays everything, <i>measure for measure.</i> However, Abraham said, “<i>let me fetch a morsel of bread</i>” [18:5]. I will get some bread and you shall eat. Therefore, because he brought the bread himself, his children <i>merited</i> in the desert that the Holy One also gave bread from heaven. The Holy One himself caused the <i>manna</i> to go down from heaven. From here we learn that the <i>righteous</i> say little and then do much. Abraham said, I will give you a piece of bread and he brought three calves.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Baba Mezia,</i> 86b-87a.</i>
“<i>Then go on</i> – <i>seeing that you have come your servants way</i>” [18:5]. Eat with me first and then go. <i>Ramban</i> writes: since my house is on you way, therefore I ask you to come into my house.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban, Genesis, 18:5.</i>
“<i>They replied, do as you said</i>” [18:5]. The angels said: you should do as you said. Here one asks a <i>question.</i> How appropriate is it that the guests should say to the <i>host</i>, do so, feed us. This is not <i>civilized behavior.</i> However, the explanation is that the guests blessed Abraham and said: you should <i>merit</i> that you should do so again to make a <i>banquet</i>, also that Sarah should have a son and you will eat at the <i>circumcision.</i> This is what the <i>Toldot Yizhak</i> wrote.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Genesis, 18:5.</i> However, <i>Ramban</i> writes that the guests said: do for us as you said. You want to feed us under the tree, so that we should not tarry in the house and stay overnight, since when a guest comes into the house, one cannot leave immediately.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban, Genesis, 18:5.</i> <i>Bahya</i> writes: They said, you should do as you said, to give us a piece of bread and do not make a big <i>meal.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 18:5.</i> Another explanation is that they said to Abraham. Do not delay us for long. Do it soon, so that we can speak. Make our meal as soon as you can.
“<i>Quick, three seahs of choice flour</i>” [18:6]. Abraham said to Sarah. Go quickly and take three measures of choice flour. Why did he order that three measures be taken? This was so that each one could be given a loaf, and there should not be any <i>jealousy</i> at the meal.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 18:6.</i> <i>Ramban</i> writes: He told Sarah to take three measures of choice flour and sift it, so that it should be very fine.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban, Genesis, 18:6.</i>
“<i>Abraham ran to the herd</i>” [18:7]. Even though Abraham had many servants in his house, yet he went himself to the barn for the calf, out of <i>respect</i> for his guests.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 18:7.</i> He took three calves and immediately took out the tongue of each calf and cooked them immediately. Why did he take three calves? He wanted three tongues, to <i>honor</i> each one equally.

“<i>He took curds and milk</i>” [18:8]. He took curds and milk, but he did not take bread. Sarah had her period at that time and became ritually unclean. That is why Abraham did not bring the bread, because Sarah had made it ritually impure.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 18:8.</i>
The <i>Talmud</i> writes in [tractate] <i>Shabbat</i>, <i>chapter eighteen: Rabbi Johanan</i> said: The merit is greater for one who has a guest into his house than study in the <i>House of Study.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Shabbat,</i> 127a.</i>
The <i>Yalkut</i> writes: From the merit that Abraham gave his guests water, his children merited to have a well of water for forty years in the desert and it followed Israel wherever they rested. When Israel committed sins in the desert, the well tarried and did not come immediately, until the <i>scholars</i> had to go with their students and prayed, saying, <i>arise well, for the merit of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.</i> This means, arise well, for the merit of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. It immediately arose.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Vayera, <i>Remez</i>, 18.</i>
<i>Bahya</i> writes: He didn’t give them any bread because Sarah was working on the bread and she became ritually impure in the middle of this. She immediately removed her hands from the dough, and because she took her hands away the dough became leavened. It was the <i>eve of Passover</i> and that is why Abraham did not bring any bread to the meal.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 18:8.</i>
“<i>And they ate</i>” [18:8]. They made themselves as if they were eating. From here we learn that no person should change the custom of the times. Even though the angels did not eat, yet they made themselves appear as if they were eating.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 18:8.</i>
“<i>They said to him, where is your wife Sarah?</i>” [18:9]. The angels asked, where is your wife Sarah? Abraham answered: she is in the tent. This teaches us that the guest should ask the <i>host</i> where his wife is and should ask the wife where her <i>husband</i> is. The angels knew well that Sarah was home, but they asked about Sarah. They wanted to praise her to her husband that she was <i>modest</i> and was sitting in the house. Or, they asked because they wanted to send the [cup of] blessing after they had eaten.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 18:9. It is customary to recite the Grace after meals over a cup of wine when three or more are reciting it together.</i>
“<i>Then one said: I will return to you next year, and your wife Sarah shall have a son</i>” [18:10]. The angel who was sent to tell Sarah that she will have a son said: I will come in a year and Sarah will have a son. This was on Passover and Sarah bore Isaac on the next Passover.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 18:10.</i>
Bahya writes. “<i>Next year.</i>” This means that Sarah will have a son in the time that a child is born. This is not longer than a year. That is, the nine months that a woman normally gives birth, more or less, but Sarah will not tarry more than twelve months to have a son.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 18:10.</i>
“<i>Sarah was sitting at the entrance of the tent, which was behind him</i>” [18:10]. Sarah was sitting inside the house and when the angels said this, Sarah stood up from her place and wanted to hear near the door. The door was behind the angel and he did not see Sarah.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid.</i>
“<i>Abraham and Sarah were old</i>” [18:11]. They were very old and she no longer had her period, as women would have, when they see blood. Here one asks a question. Sarah became unclean when she was kneading the dough and it became leavened because she moved away from it, because of the blood. The <i>Devek Tov</i> writes. She only found a spot of blood, but she did not have her period like younger women.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Devek Tov<i>,</i> Genesis 18:11.</i>
“<i>And Sarah laughed to herself</i>” [18:12]. Sarah mocked and laid her hands on her belly and said: this belly is withered and shrunken. This should carry a child? She also said: the breasts are also shrunken. Will they still give milk to nurse a child?<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 18:12.</i>
“<i>My husband is old</i>” [18:12]. She said: my husband is old and how should I have children with an old man? The Holy One said to Abraham: why did Sarah mock that she said: how should she have children when she is old? The Holy One said something different before Abraham than what Sarah had said. Sarah had said: how will I have children when my husband is old. The Holy One said to Abraham that Sarah said that she was too old to have children. The explanation is that the Holy One did not want to create any <i>hostility</i> between <i>Abraham and Sarah. Abraham</i> would have been offended had <i>Sarah</i> said about Abraham that he was too old to have children. Every man, even when he is old, makes himself young for his wife and the wife also for her husband. Therefore, the Holy One did not want to tell <i>Abraham</i> that <i>Sarah</i> said about Abraham that he was too old to have children. From here, our sages learn that for the sake of <i>peace</i>, one may tell a <i>lie.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Genesis Rabbah</i>, 48.18.</i>
“<i>Is anything too wondrous for the Lord?</i>” [18:14]. The Holy One said: is there anything hidden from Me that I should not be able to do it.
“<i>Sarah lied</i>” [18:15]. Sarah lied, saying that she did not mock and Abraham said, you did lie. Abraham came to Sarah and said to her: why did you mock? Cannot God do wonders that we should have children? Sarah thought to herself. How does Abraham know that I laughed? He must have noticed that I laughed or perhaps because I was silent and did not praise God for the good <i>news?</i> Abraham did not tell Sarah that the Holy One complained about Sarah that she was mocking, but Sarah thought that Abraham knew on his own that Sarah mocked. Therefore, Sarah lied to Abraham and said: I did not mock. Then Abraham again strongly said to Sarah: you did mock. Sarah then understood that Abraham must have heard it from the Holy One that she mocked. That is why she was silent. If Sarah had known that the Holy One had complained about Sarah, she would not have denied the words of the <i>Holy One, heaven forbid.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban, Genesis, 18:15.</i>
<i>Ramban</i> writes another explanation. The Holy One said to Abraham: “<i>nevertheless, Sarah your wife shall bear your son</i>” [17:19]. In truth, your wife Sarah will have a son. Abraham did not tell Sarah. He thought to himself. The Holy One would certainly send an angel separately to tell Sarah the good <i>news.</i> In the midst of this, he <i>circumcised</i> all in his household. He was very tired and he sat down by the door. The <i>angels</i> came and told the good <i>news</i> before Abraham told it. This is what <i>Ramban</i> writes.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid.</i>
However, the <i>Hizkuni</i> writes in the Torah portion “<i>next year</i>” [18:10]. The angels said: we will come in a year, since we will live next year, like we are living now. The angels said that they live eternally, not like a person who dies.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 18:10.</i>
“<i>Which was behind them</i>” [18:10]. This means, Ishmael was behind the angel and he was the <i>guardian</i> of Sarah, that she should not be alone with the angels, since they thought that they were people and not angels.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid.</i>
“<i>Old, advanced in years</i>” [18:11]. From [the beginning of] <i>Genesis</i> until here it is not mentioned that there were old people in the world, until Abraham came and said: <i>Lord of the Universe</i>, a person goes with his son in the city and the people do not know who is old or young. They cannot honor the father. It is correct that the father should have white and gray hair. The Holy One said: this is good; I will begin with you and He made Abraham gray. <i>Isaac</i> said to the Holy One: <i>Lord of the Universe</i>, a person dies without <i>travails.</i> Is this the <i>attribute of justice</i> that in the next world he will have <i>travails?</i> The Holy One said: you speak appropriately. I will begin with you, as the verse says, “<i>his eyes were dim</i>” [27:1]. This means, Isaac’s eyes became dark and he could not see well. <i>Jacob</i> said: <i>Lord of the Universe</i>, a person who dies without being sick cannot leave a <i>will</i> for his children. The Holy One said: I will begin with you, as the verse says in the <i>Torah portion Va-Yehi</i>, “<i>Joseph was told, your father is ill</i>” [48:1]. This means, it was told to Joseph, your father Jacob is sick.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 18:11.</i>
“<i>And Sarah laughed</i>” [18:12]. It was the <i>New Moon of Tishrei</i> when the angels came to tell her that she would have a son, and the <i>month of Tishrei</i> came and Sarah was not pregnant. She mocked the words of the angels. She thought it was only six months, until <i>Passover.</i> However, Abraham did believe it, because he had explicitly heard from the Holy One that <i>Sarah</i> would have a son. However, <i>Sarah</i> thought that the <i>angels</i> were ordinary people, and therefore Sarah did not believe them. Even though Abraham had also laughed when the Holy One said to Abraham, your wife Sarah will have a son with you, but <i>Sarah</i> went before the people where she continued mocking, as the verse says, “<i>and Sarah laughed to herself, saying</i>” [18:12]. This means, Sarah mocked and said it to other people. That is why it is written, “<i>saying.</i>” That is to say, continued to say. However, <i>Abraham</i> fell on his <i>face</i> and did not want to laugh in front of people.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 18:12.</i>
<i>Hizkuni</i> gives another explanation. It is a <i>parable.</i> A clever woman wanted to rebuke her daughter-in-law. The clever woman rebuked her own daughter in the hope that the daughter-in-law would also hear and would become good and pious. So too, the Holy One said to Abraham: why did Sarah mock? That is to say, Abraham should also understand that he had done wrong, that he had mocked.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 18:13.</i>
“<i>Sarah lied</i>” [18:15]. From here we learn that women are <i>ineligible to give testimony.</i> Because she was afraid, therefore she lied.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 18:15.</i>
“<i>Abraham walked with them to see them off</i>” [18:16]. Abraham <i>accompanied</i> his guests. Because of this merit, he was worthy that the Holy One should appear to him. How far is the <i>appropriate distance to accompany?</i> A friend to the edge of the city; a teacher his disciple to the <i>Sabbath limit</i>; a disciple his teacher for three miles; a householder his guest, for a mile.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 18:16.</i>
“<i>Shall I hide from Abraham</i>” [18:17]. The Holy One said: How can I not tell Abraham what I want to do with <i>Sodom and Gomorrah?</i> Abraham is pious and commanded his children the <i>Torah and commandments.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 18:17.</i>
Abraham heard how the Holy One praised him, and he made himself very humble and said, “<i>I who am but dust and ashes</i>” [18:27]. I am earth and ashes. From here we should learn that when a person is praised, he should not become arrogant, but should make himself <i>humbler</i> than before.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 18:17.</i>
“<i>For I have singled him out</i>” [18:19]. This means, the Holy One said: I love him because he is pious.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 18:19.</i> <i>Bahya</i> writes. This means that the Holy One said: I watch over Abraham more than the other <i>righteous ones.</i> This means “<i>singled him out</i>,” I want to make myself known to him to always protect him.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 18:19.</i>
“<i>The Lord said, the outrage of Sodom and Gomorrah is so great</i>” [18:20]. The Holy One said: I will see the outcry of <i>Sodom</i> and if they have all committed sins or not. I want to see who has sinned. Their sins were evil, with their bodies and with their money, but their judgment has been completed in heaven, because of their sin of not giving charity to the poor. In <i>Sodom and Gomorrah</i>, a young girl carried a piece of bread in a jug to give it to a pauper. The people of Sodom saw this and stripped the girl naked. Then they smeared the naked girl with honey and bound her hands and feet and laid her in front of the bees and flies until the bees ate the girl. This was the outcry that came before the Holy One, as the verse says, “<i>the outrage of Sodom and Gomorrah is so great.</i>” This means, the outcry of <i>Sodom</i>; a girl is calling out to Me, since the word <i>rabah</i> [great] means a young girl.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 18:20.</i>
“<i>They have acted together</i>” [18:21]. The Holy One said: I will judge the people of Sodom. If they have sinned greatly, I will destroy them. If they have not sinned greatly and will repent, then I will know what sort of travails I will impose on them.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 18:21.</i>
“<i>Abraham came forward and said, will you sweep away the innocent along with the guilty?</i>” [18:23]. <i>Abraham</i> approached the Holy One and said to Him: would You destroy the righteous one with the evildoer?
“<i>Perhaps there are fifty in the city</i>” [18:24]. He said: perhaps there will be fifty <i>righteous ones</i> in the five cities, that each city will have ten righteous ones to protect a city. Abraham said: will the Holy One, not protect the evildoer because of the righteous one. <i>At least</i> protect the righteous one himself for the sake of his <i>merit.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 18:23–24.</i>
<i>Ramban</i> asks a question. Why does he have to say that there are righteous ones in the city? Don’t say more than there will be righteous ones in the city. However, Abraham showed that if there were righteous strangers that came to the city, then You, Holy One, should also save it. That is to say, Lot recently came to live in <i>Sodom</i> and similarly, other righteous ones.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban, Genesis, 18:26.</i>
“<i>Far be it from You to do such a thing</i>” [18:25]. Far be it from You to do such a thing, to kill the righteous ones with the evil ones.<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 18:25.</i>
“<i>Shall not the Judge of all the earth deal justly?</i>” [18:25]. If the judge of the whole world should not give proper <i>judgments</i>, “<i>far be it from You</i>” [18:25]. The people will say that it is the <i>custom</i> of the Holy One. He destroys the righteous one along with the evildoer, like during the <i>Flood</i> and the <i>generation of the Tower of Babel.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid.</i>
“<i>The Lord answered, if I will find fifty righteous ones, I will forgive the whole place for their sake</i>” [18:26]. The Holy One said: if I will find fifty righteous ones in the city, I will not destroy it.
“<i>Abraham responded</i>” [18:27]. Abraham responded: I ask you, <i>Lord of the Universe</i>, I am humble and earth. Perhaps there will be five less than the fifty and there will only be forty-five. Will you destroy them because of five? That is to say, Abraham said, there are five cities. Thus, there will be forty-five and each city would only have nine righteous ones. You, Lord of the Universe, will join the nine righteous ones, giving each city ten. So spoke Abraham. Perhaps there will be forty <i>righteous ones</i>, so <i>at least</i> allow four cities to live.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 18:28.</i>
God responded: “<i>I will not do it for the sake of the forty</i>” [18:29]. I will not do it because of the merit of the forty. Then Abraham said: perhaps there will be thirty? The Holy One responded: I will not do it for the sake of the thirty. Then Abraham said: perhaps there will be twenty? The Holy One responded: “<i>I will not destroy for the sake of the twenty</i>” [18:31]. Then Abraham said: perhaps there will be ten; <i>at least</i> allow one city to remain?<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 18:29.</i> The Holy One responded: “<i>I will not destroy for the sake of the ten</i>” [18:32]. I will not destroy because of ten righteous ones. However, Abraham did not ask for less than ten, since when there are not ten righteous ones, the Holy One does not <i>save</i> the world. That is why the <i>generation of the Flood</i> was destroyed, since there was only <i>Noah</i>, his wife, his three sons and their three wives. There were only eight and not ten and that is why the world was destroyed.<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 18:32.</i>
<i>Rabbenu Bahya</i> asks a question. Why did Abraham have to pray so long? The Holy One had promised Abraham that forty righteous ones would protect four cities. He should have understood that thirty would protect three cities and twenty would protect two cities and ten would protect one city. The explanation is that Abraham thought that when there are many righteous ones, like forty, there is great merit. That is why God answered him that he would protect four cities for the sake of the righteous ones. However, for less than forty he would not save. Therefore, Abraham had to ask for thirty, for ten and for twenty. From here we learn that the <i>primary prayer</i> is where there are many people together. The merit of many people together is heard more. The Talmudic sages said: <i>it is not the same when a few fulfill the Torah.</i> This means, it is not the same when a few study the Torah as when many study the Torah. However, the Holy One was compassionate and He answered Abraham that He would forgive, even for a few righteous ones.<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 18:24.</i>
“<i>The two angels arrived</i>” [19:1]. The two <i>angels</i> arrived <i>in Sodom.</i> The third angel who told Sarah that she would have a son returned to heaven. Here one asks, why did the Torah call them angels by Lot and by Abraham the Torah called them <i>people.</i> The explanation is that by Abraham there were angels every day. That is why the Torah called them men. That is to say, around Abraham, they were accustomed to them, like they were people. However, by Lot it was uncommon for angels to be there and that is why Scripture calls them angels. Here one asks: why did the angels tarry so long from Hebron to Sodom? The explanation is that they were <i>angels of mercy.</i> They thought they would wait until Abraham could find some <i>merit</i> before the Holy One for Sodom.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 19:1.</i>
“<i>Lot was sitting in the gate of Sodom</i>” [19:1]. Lot was made a <i>judge</i> in Sodom on that day.<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid.</i>
“<i>When Lot saw them, he rose</i>” [19:1]. Lot had <i>learned</i> from Abraham to honor guests. Therefore, <i>Lot</i> stood up for the angels. He thought they were people.<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid.</i>
<i>Bahya</i> and <i>Toldot Yizhak</i> ask. Why is it not written concerning Lot, <i>he ran toward them?</i> Concerning Abraham, it is written. This means, he ran toward them. The explanation is that with Abraham, the angels came quite early, at sunrise. He saw the angels coming from a distance because it was light. Therefore, Abraham ran from a distance to call the angels. However, with <i>Lot</i> it was late and dark. Thus, Lot did not see the angels until they were quite close to Lot. That is why he stood up when they were quite close to him.<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya and Toldot Yizhak, Genesis, 19:1.</i>
“<i>Please my lords, turn aside</i>” [19:2]. Lot said to the angels. I ask you, my lords, come to my house, but enter at the side, so that the evildoers in the city should not notice that I have guests. It would cost me my life if I had guests.<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 19:2.</i>
“<i>Spend the night and bathe your feet</i>” [19:2]. Lot said to the guests: go quickly into the house before the evildoers recognize that you are guests. Though Abraham had said, “<i>bath your feet</i>” [18:4], wash the dust from your feet and then he said, come into the house.<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid.</i>
<i>Hizkuni</i> gives an explanation. Lot did it this way because he said to the angels. If you would wash your feet first, the evildoers will see that you have clean feet and they will say that the guests are with Lot for a long time and Lot did not tell us about them.<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 19:2.</i>
“<i>They said, no, we will sleep in the square</i>” [19:2]. The angels said: we will not do as you say, but we will spend the night in the street. With Abraham, the angels said, “<i>do as you have said</i>” [18:5]. This means, yes, we will eat with you. From here we learn that one should not say to an important person, I do not want to do as you say. However, to an ordinary person one can say, I will not do as you say.<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 19:2.</i> The angels said: we will spend the night in the street in the hope that we will cause them to change. Perhaps, they might repent.<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 19:2.</i>
“<i>He urged them strongly</i>” [19:3]. Lot pleaded with them and the angels went to Lot’s house. He made a meal and he baked <i>matzot</i>, since it was Passover, and they ate. The angels asked Lot, what kind of people were there in the city, good or evil? He answered that there were only evildoers. As they were talking, the whole city came, from young to old, since there was no righteous person to hinder them. They called to Lot, where are the guests who have come? Give them out and we will sleep with them. That is to say, they wanted to have <i>homosexual relations</i> with them.<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 19:3–5.</i>
Lot went out and locked the door behind him and spoke with the evildoers. My brothers, what do you desire? I have two daughters who are still virgins, “<i>who have not known a man</i>” [19:7]. This means, they have not slept with a man. <i>Hizkuni</i> asks a question here. It should say, “<i>whom a man has not known.</i>” This means, no man slept with them and the verse says, the daughters had not slept with any man. The explanation is that Lot’s daughters were <i>insolent and licentious</i> and they used to induce men to sleep with them, like they induced their father to sleep with them, and he slept with them.<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 19:8.</i>
<i>Lot</i> said: I will give my daughters to you. Do with them what you want, but don’t do anything to the men. Do this for me because the guests have come to my house. The <i>evildoers</i> answered him: stand aside; you are also a guest and a <i>stranger</i> and you want to judge us?<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 19:8–9.</i> We will judge you and will do you and them evil. The evildoers reached out to Lot and wanted to break down the door. The angels came and pulled Lot in and locked the door. The angels made the evildoers blind and they could not see to find the door. The angels said to Lot: do you have any more children or sons-in-law in the city? Go and tell them to leave here.
The angels said, “<i>whom else have you here</i>” [19:12]. That is to say, do you have another advocate for the city, since <i>Lot</i> defended the city for the whole night, that they should not kill them?<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 19:12.</i>
“<i>We are about to destroy this city</i>” [19:13]. We will destroy the city. <i>Bahya</i> asks a question here. Why did the angels say that they are destroyers? They should have said: the Holy One will destroy the city. Therefore, the Holy One punished the angels and they were forbidden from coming before the Holy One in heaven. For one hundred and thirty-eight years they were expelled from their place and the Holy One did not send them on any <i>mission</i>, until Jacob came. God sent the same angels again on a <i>mission.</i> They were with Jacob and Jacob sent them on a <i>mission</i> to <i>Esau.</i> From here one should learn that no person should make themself important with someone else’s <i>honor.</i> The <i>honor</i> is only the Holy One’s, as the verse says, “<i>His glory fills all the earth</i>” [Isaiah 6:3]. However, later the angels state that they were sent by the Holy One, “<i>the Lord has sent us to destroy it</i>” [19:13]. This means, God sent us to destroy.<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 19:13.</i>
“<i>Lot went out</i>” [19:14]. <i>Lot</i> went out of the city and called his sons-in-law who had taken his daughters as wives. He said: go with me since the Holy One will destroy the city. The sons-in-law laughed and mocked him. As the morning star rose, the angels urged him and said: take your wife and your two daughters who are ready, to protect them. Perhaps you will disappear because of the sins of this city. Lot tarried because of the money that he had in the city.<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 19:16.</i> The angels grabbed Lot’s hand, the hand of his wife and the hands of his daughters because of the mercy of the Holy One on them. They took them out of the city, but the angels did not want to let him take his money with him. That is why the verse says, “<i>when they brought them outside</i>” [19:17].
Here one asks a question. Why does it have to say, “<i>when they brought them outside</i>” [19:17], instead of <i>they brought outside?</i> This means, take them out, but the verse tells us that they took out only Lot, his wife and daughters, but the money they did not take out.<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 19:17.</i>
The angels said: be warned not to look back since you are also an evildoer, but were protected only because of the <i>merit of Abraham.</i> Therefore, you should not see how the other evildoers in the city are destroyed, and you were protected.<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 19:17.</i>
The <i>Midrash</i> writes: The angel said: you should not look behind you since the <i>Shekhinah</i> was standing with the <i>ministering angels</i> over the city of Sodom to cause fire and sulfur to rain down. However, <i>Idit,</i> Lot’s wife, was concerned about her daughters, the two who had remained with their husbands in the city. She looked back to see if her daughters were following them out of the city. She saw the <i>Shekhinah</i> and that is why she became a pillar of salt.<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Pirke de Rabbi Eliezer</i>, chap. 25.</i> She had sinned with salt in that she did not want to give the paupers salt and that is why she became salt.<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 19:26.</i>
Lot asked the angel: I cannot run quickly. Perhaps the evil will catch up to me. Therefore, let me rest in the city of <i>Zoar</i>, since that city, <i>Zoar</i>, had recently been built, its sins are not that great, and let me live there. The Holy One did this and allowed the city to remain and did not destroy it.<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 19:20.</i>
The angel said: run quickly to the city, since I cannot do anything until you come to the city of <i>Zoar.</i> Therefore, the angels were punished because they made themselves important and said: we came to destroy the city. They should have said: the Holy One will destroy the city of Sodom. The angels had to say here, “<i>for I cannot do anything</i>” [19:22]. This means, I cannot do anything without the Holy One.<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 19:22.</i>
“<i>As the sun rose upon the earth</i>” [19:23]. As the sun, and the moon also remained since it was mid-<i>month, on Passover</i>, and the moon remained along with the sun for several hours. That is why the Holy One allowed fire and sulfur to rain when the sun and the moon [were visible], because they were evildoers. Some of them said that the sun was their god and some said the moon was their god. If the Holy One had allowed the fire and sulfur to descend when the moon alone [shone], the evildoers who believed the sun to be their god would have said, this would not have happened during the day. The sun would not have allowed it. The evildoers would have said the same thing if the sun alone was shining. That is why the Holy One let it rain down when both the sun and the moon were visible.<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 19:24.</i>
“<i>Sulfur and fire from heaven</i>” [19:24]. When the Holy One wants to pay the evildoers their due, He sends fire and sulfur from heaven. When He wants to do good to the righteous, He sends down good <i>manna</i> from heaven.<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid.</i>
“<i>And his wife looked back</i>” [19:26]. And Lot’s wife turned back and looked behind Lot. Lot was walking last, chasing his household that they should quickly leave the city.<sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban, Genesis, 19:26.</i>
“<i>Looking toward Sodom</i>” [19:28]. Abraham looked at the city and he only saw smoke and steam, like from a furnace.
“<i>God was mindful of Abraham</i>” [19:29]. The Holy One thought about the good that Lot had done for Abraham that he did not reveal that Sarah was his wife, since Lot was always with Abraham. Lot had heard how Abraham asked Sarah that she should not say that she was Abraham’s wife, and Lot did not reveal it.<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 19:29.</i>
“<i>Lot went up from Zoar</i>” [19:30]. Lot went out of the city of Zoar. He was afraid that the city was close to Sodom and it might also be destroyed. <i>Hizkuni</i> writes. Lot said: the city of Zoar was only protected because I could not immediately flee from Sodom. However, now that I have time to flee, perhaps the city of Zoar will also be destroyed. Therefore, he must leave it.<sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 19:30.</i>
“<i>The older one said to the younger</i>” [19:31]. Lot had two daughters who did not yet have husbands. The older daughter said to the younger one, our father is old and may die soon or he will not be able to have children and there is no person in the land who can sleep with us so that we will have children. The daughters thought that the whole world had been destroyed, like during the Flood.<sup class="footnote-marker">83</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 19:31.</i>
<i>Bahya</i> writes here. The daughters were <i>modest</i> and were embarrassed to ask their father to sleep with them. The children of Noah were allowed to sleep with the daughters of their father. That is why they made their father drunk with wine. The Holy One had sent wine to their cave, in the expectation that they should get their father drunk and he should not know that he had slept with them. Our sages say that their intention was for <i>the sake of heaven</i>, because they had seen their mother killed. They said: how will the world be built? That is why there is no <i>language of illicit sex</i> mentioned in this portion. The daughters were <i>modest</i> and were not <i>whores.</i> That is why they were worthy that <i>Ruth</i> was descended from the older daughter. She <i>converted</i> and <i>king David</i> was descended from her. <i>Na</i>’<i>amah</i> was descended from the younger one, and <i>king Rehaboam</i>, the son of <i>king Solomon</i> was descended from her.<sup class="footnote-marker">84</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 19:30.</i>
“<i>Come let us make our father drink wine</i>” [19:32]. The older daughter said to the younger daughter, let us make our father drink wine, to sleep with him. That is why the verse says, “<i>she lay with her father</i>” [19:33]. She lay with her father openly. Concerning the younger one it is written, “<i>she lay with him</i>” [19:35], and it is not written, “<i>she lay with her father</i>” [19:33], but she lay with him. This is because the older one began to convince her sister. Therefore, the Torah writes, “<i>she lay with her father</i>” [19:33]. She lay with her father openly, but with the younger sister it says, “<i>she lay with him</i>” [19:35], she did not think of him as her father.<sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 19:33.</i>
“<i>He did not know when she lay down or when she rose</i>” [19:35]. Lot did not know that his daughter had slept with him, because he was very drunk. However, after she got up, he did notice something. That is why he got drunk the next night.<sup class="footnote-marker">86</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Nazir,</i> 23a.</i>
“<i>They got pregnant</i>” [19:36]. The two daughters got pregnant from their father even though they had been <i>virgins</i>, and a <i>virgin</i> cannot become pregnant from the first night. The daughters tore their virginity with their hands, so that they should become pregnant from sleeping the first time with their father.<sup class="footnote-marker">87</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 19:36.</i>
The older daughter bore a son and named him <i>Moab.</i> This means that the daughter had him with her father. That is why the Holy One wrote concerning Moab in the time of <i>Moses Our Teacher</i>, you should not wage <i>war</i> with <i>Moab.</i> However, Israel may cause Moabites other problems because they did not speak <i>modestly</i> about their father and openly said that she had a son with her father. However, the younger daughter called her son <i>Ben Ami.</i> This means, a son of my people, and she did not openly say that she had a son with her father. That is why the Holy One rewarded her and commanded <i>Israel</i> not to afflict the nation of <i>Ammon</i> in any way.<sup class="footnote-marker">88</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 19:37.</i>
“<i>He journeyed from there</i>” [20:1]. Abraham saw that the cities of <i>Sodom</i> had been destroyed. He moved away because no people came now like they used to come before. Abraham said: I cannot have any guests to honor. Also, Lot, his relative, acquired a bad reputation because he had slept with his daughters. That is why Abraham was ashamed and moved away from Lot.<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 20:1.</i>
He came to live in the city of <i>Gerar.</i> Abraham said about his wife that she was his sister. Here one asks a question. Why did Abraham not ask Sarah that she should not say that she was Abraham’s wife as she did with Pharaoh? The explanation is because Sarah was taken once into the house of Pharaoh, therefore Abraham said that she was his sister.<sup class="footnote-marker">90</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 20:2.</i>
<i>Bahya</i> asks a question. What did Abraham think that he came again to <i>Gerar?</i> He had previously had great troubles and his wife Sarah was taken from him and the Holy One had to perform great miracles to bring Sarah out of the house of Pharaoh. The explanation is that Abraham gave his wife a divorce, but the Holy One did not let the righteous one be without his wife for long. The Holy One said that the <i>divorce</i> is no divorce because this was a result of fear. That is why the angel said to <i>Abimelech</i>, “<i>she is a married woman</i>” [20:3]. That is to say, the <i>divorce</i> is no divorce because it was the result of fear.<sup class="footnote-marker">91</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 20:2.</i>
“<i>King Abimelech of Gerar had Sarah bought to him</i>” [20:2]. The king of Gerar sent for and took Sarah. The angel came to <i>Abimelech</i> in a dream at night and said to him. You will die because of wanting the woman that you have taken. She has a husband. The <i>Toldot Yizhak</i> asks a question. Why is it written concerning Pharaoh that he took Sarah? “<i>The woman was taken into Pharaoh</i>’<i>s palace</i>” [12:15]. This means, the woman was taken into the house of Pharaoh and here with <i>Abimelech</i> it is written, “<i>he took Sarah</i>” [20:2], he took Sarah. It is not written that he took her into his house. The explanation is that <i>Pharaoh</i> was a great <i>king</i> and an <i>evildoer. Abimelech</i> was righteous and not such a great king as Pharaoh. That is why it is written concerning Pharaoh how beautiful Sarah was and the ministers praised her highly because she was very beautiful and Pharaoh took her. Here, with <i>Abimelech</i> it is written, “<i>Abraham said of Sarah his wife, she is my sister, so king Abimelech of Gerar had Sarah brought to him</i>” [20:2]. That is to say, because Abraham said that Sarah was his sister. Therefore, he sent and took her to himself, because she was <i>related</i> to Abraham and not because of beauty. She was now older than she was with Pharaoh. Because Pharaoh was a great king, he did not want Sarah as a wife so quickly, but he gave Sarah to a noble in his household. He wanted to make a big <i>wedding</i> before he would come to Sarah and wanted to display his great wealth. That is why it is written, “<i>Sarah was taken into Pharaoh</i>’<i>s palace</i>” [12:15].<sup class="footnote-marker">92</sup><i class="footnote">The Biblical text has “the woman” instead of “Sarah.”</i> This means, she was taken into Pharaoh’s household. That is, into the house of the noble. However, by <i>Abimelech</i> it is written, “<i>he took Sarah.</i>” That is, he wanted to take Sarah as a wife immediately and did not desire to make a big <i>wedding.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">93</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Genesis, 20:3.</i>
“<i>Abimelech had not approached her</i>” [20:4]. The <i>angel</i> did not allow <i>Abimelech</i> to approach Sarah. Concerning Pharaoh it is not written that Pharaoh approached Sarah. It did not need to say that Pharaoh did not approach Sarah, since Sarah had not yet come into his house, but Sarah was with one of Pharaoh’s nobles. The <i>Toldot Yizhak</i> writes another explanation. With Abimelech, Scripture had to say that he did not come to Sarah because Sarah became pregnant soon after this incident. People might say that Sarah became pregnant from <i>Abimelech.</i> He asks another question. Why did an <i>angel</i> come to <i>Abimelech</i> and not to Pharaoh? The explanation is that Pharaoh was an evildoer and the Holy One did not want to allow an <i>angel</i> to go to the evildoer. However, <i>Abimelech</i> was righteous. He asks another question. Why did the Holy One bring <i>leprosy</i> on Pharaoh and the Holy One did not bring <i>leprosy</i> on <i>Abimelech?</i> The explanation is that the Holy One brought it all on the household of <i>Abimelech</i> that they could not give birth to children, could not <i>urinate</i> or defecate. All of their bodily orifices were stopped up. Even a hen could not lay an egg. It was hoped that <i>Abimelech</i> would understand and notice that his <i>sin</i> was because he had taken Sarah as a wife. However, Pharaoh was an evildoer. He caused that people talked evil about Sarah and how Pharaoh was sleeping with her. Therefore, the Holy One brought <i>leprosy</i> on <i>Pharaoh</i>, since the one who speaks <i>slander</i> is punished with leprosy. Even though <i>Abimelech</i> caused people to talk about Sarah that she became pregnant from him. However, if <i>Abimelech</i> had known that she was Abraham’s wife, he would not have touched her. Pharaoh, if he knew that Sarah had a husband, he still would have taken Sarah. Therefore, God punished him with leprosy. The <i>Toldot Yizhak</i> asks another question. Why did Pharaoh not desire from Abraham an explanation of why he made him sin and <i>Abimelech</i> desired from Abraham that he should tell him why did he say that Sarah was his sister? Pharaoh said to Abraham, take you wife and leave my land. Abimelech said: remain and settle in my land, wherever you want. The explanation is that Pharaoh was an evildoer. He thought that Abraham would answer him; you Pharaoh are an evildoer that you should take my wife. Therefore, he did not want to hear any explanations from Abraham and said; go immediately with your wife out of my land. He knew well that all of his servants would want to have illicit sexual relations with Sarah. The way that the master is, so too are his servants. However, Abimelech said: why did you say that Sarah is your sister? Abraham answered: I thought that you are obviously a righteous person, but I feared for your servants and city people. Abraham said: if you want to ask me, how probable is it that the servants would be evil? When I am their master, then I must also be evil, as the verse says, “<i>a ruler who listens to evil, all of his ministers will be wicked</i>” [Proverbs 29:12]. This means, his means, when the master is an evildoer, then his servants are also all completely evildoers. Therefore, Abraham responded: do not think that I recently started to say that Sarah is my sister, but I have done this for a long time, since I left my father’s house. I consider you and all of your servants all to be completely righteous. That is why <i>Abimelech</i> said to <i>Abraham</i>; remain here in my land. <i>Abimelech</i> thought that the <i>angel</i> came to destroy his land, like Sodom. That is why <i>Abimelech</i> said to <i>Abraham:</i> I ask you, remain in my land. Perhaps you will <i>rescue</i> me. That is why the verse says, “<i>early next morning Abraham arose and called to his servants</i>” [20:8]. Abraham was very afraid of the angel and therefore he called all of his servants and told them the whoe story and they were all afraid.<sup class="footnote-marker">94</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Genesis, 20:3.</i>
“<i>He said, O Lord, will you slay a people even though they are righteous?</i>” [20:4]. Abimelech said: If someone is righteous, do you want to kill him also, like You did during the <i>generation of the Tower of Babel?</i><sup class="footnote-marker">95</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 20:4.</i> <i>Bahya</i> writes. <i>Abimelech</i> said, “<i>a people.</i>” If You, Holy One, want to kill the king, then my people will also kill the righteous Abraham.<sup class="footnote-marker">96</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 20:4.</i> Abimelech said: why am I at fault because Abraham said that Sarah was his sister and Sarah also said that he is her brother?
“<i>My heart was blameless</i>” [20:5]. I did not intend to commit a sin. “<i>My hands were clean</i>” [20:5]. I am innocent of this sin. I did not touch her. The angel responded: I know well that you had no intention to commit the sin, and I caused that you did not commit a sin and did not sin by touching her.<sup class="footnote-marker">97</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 20:6.</i>
“<i>Restore the man</i>’<i>s wife</i> – <i>since he is a prophet</i>” [20:7]. The angel said to <i>Abimelech:</i> give Abraham his wife back because he is a <i>prophet.</i> He knows well that you, A<i>bimelech</i>, did not touch her. She will not be <i>despicable</i> in Abraham’s eyes and he will pray for you.<sup class="footnote-marker">98</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 20:7.</i>
<i>Bahya</i> writes. Abimelech said: since I have given your brother, Abraham, much money, all the people will say that I had to placate him. Thus, it was shown that <i>Abimelech</i> feared God and certainly did not touch Sarah. Abimelech had previously hated Abraham and now he gives Abraham much money. This must be a <i>miracle</i> from God. If he had given Sarah money, the world would have said that he rewarded her because he slept with her.<sup class="footnote-marker">99</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 20:16.</i>
“<i>You are cleared before everyone</i>” [20:16]. With this you, Sarah, will be able to say before all the people that you went out of my house clean and pure.<sup class="footnote-marker">100</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 20:7.</i>
“<i>You are cleared before everyone</i>” [20:16]. This means, you will be punished by God before the whole world that you would say that Abraham is your brother, when people will take you to wife.<sup class="footnote-marker">101</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Genesis, 20:16.</i>
The <i>Midrash</i> writes in <i>Rabbati.</i> He made Sarah an expensive dress; like that a <i>queen</i> would wear. <i>Abimelech</i> said: “<i>this will serve you as vindication</i>” [20:16]. That is to say, they will all look at the beautiful dress and will be afraid to look at you.<sup class="footnote-marker">102</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Genesis Rabbah,</i> 52.12.</i>
“<i>Abraham then prayed to God, and God healed Abimelech and his wife and his slave girls, so that they bore children</i>” [20:17]. <i>Abraham</i> prayed that <i>Abimelech</i> should be healed, since the Holy One had caused that no person could have children and nobody could <i>urinate</i> or defecate, man or woman. Abraham prayed and they were all healed.<sup class="footnote-marker">103</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 20:18.</i>
“<i>The Lord took note of Sarah</i>” [21:1]. The Torah wrote the story of Sarah getting pregnant near the <i>story</i> of <i>Abraham</i>’<i>s praying for Abimelech</i> that they should be able to get pregnant. What does the Torah show us? The explanation is that the Torah teaches that when one prays for his friend and he also needs the same thing about which he prayed, then the Holy One gives it to him before his <i>friend.</i> When Abraham had prayed that the household of Abimelech should be able to have children, The Holy One first gave children to Abraham before He gave them to <i>Abimelech.</i> This is the meaning of “<i>The Lord took note of Sarah</i>” [21:1]. The Holy One first thought of Sarah that she should have children.<sup class="footnote-marker">104</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 21:1.</i>
The <i>Midrash</i> writes, what did He take note about Sarah? The explanation is, the Holy One said that Sarah was in the house of <i>Pharaoh</i> and in the house of <i>Abimelech</i> and she went out in <i>purity.</i> How can I not remember her for good that she should have children?<sup class="footnote-marker">105</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Genesis Rabbah,</i> 53.6.</i>
<i>Toldot Yizhak</i> asks a question. Why does scripture have to say, “<i>the Lord did for Sarah as he had spoken</i>” [21:1]. This means, God did to Sarah as he had said. It would have been enough that he had previously said, “<i>The Lord took note of Sarah</i>” [21:1]. The explanation is, a man and a woman, both of whom were old who could not have children. That is to say, the wife cannot get pregnant from an old man. Therefore, the verse first says, “<i>The Lord took note of Sarah</i>” [21:1]. That is to say, God made a miracle for Sarah and caused her to become pregnant. The offspring of an old man and woman cannot be born, even when she is pregnant. Therefore, the verse says, “<i>the Lord did for Sarah as he had spoken</i>” [21:1]. That is to say, the Holy One caused that Sarah had a child and caused that she had much milk.<sup class="footnote-marker">106</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Genesis, 21:1–2.</i>
Sarah was embarrassed to uncover her breasts since she was very <i>modest.</i> Abraham said to Sarah. You must put the <i>modesty</i> aside and do not be ashamed. Everyone saw her breasts uncovered and that milk flowed from them like two fountains. The wives of the nobles came and gave their children to be nursed.<sup class="footnote-marker">107</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Genesis Rabbah,</i> 53.9.</i>
“<i>Sarah said, God has brought me laughter</i>” [21:6]. God has made me a joyous occasion. There were many women who were remembered on that day along with Sarah. Also, many sick people were healed on that day.<sup class="footnote-marker">108</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 21:6.</i>
“<i>She said: who would have said to Abraham that Sarah would suckle children?</i>” [21:7]. Sarah said: who would have said that Sarah would suckle children? <i>Toldot Yizhak</i> writes. Who could speak with Abraham, since his wife Sarah was nursing children? That is, he would become <i>arrogant.</i> That is why the verse says about Sarah, “<i>laughter</i>,” a joy and laughter, since it is a greater novelty that an old woman should have children than an old man. When an old man takes a young wife, he has children with her.<sup class="footnote-marker">109</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Genesis, 21:7.</i>
“<i>The child grew up and was weaned, and Abraham held a great feast</i>” [21:8]. When the child grew up and was weaned, Abraham made a <i>feast</i> and many nobles attended and <i>Og</i> also attended. Someone said to <i>Og:</i> you liar, you said that Sarah would not have any children. He said: how is Isaac like a fly? If I would put my small finger on him, I would kill him. The Holy One responded: his children will be like the sand of the sea and you will fall into the hands of his children.<sup class="footnote-marker">110</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Genesis Rabbah,</i> 53.10.</i>
“<i>On the day that Isaac was weaned</i>” [21:8]. He made a <i>feast</i> when Isaac was weaned. <i>Bahya</i> writes. Why did Abraham not make a <i>feast</i> when he <i>circumcised</i> him? The explanation is that He waited until he was weaned. He took him then to his <i>teacher</i> and made a <i>feast.</i> He wanted to <i>rejoice</i> with his son and with the <i>joy of the Torah.</i> It is known that a person loves his children very much, more when they are weaned than when they are born. The child has intelligence then and can talk at the same time. Therefore, he made a feast when Isaac was weaned. The <i>Midrash</i> writes: “<i>the day he was weaned</i>” is two words. This means <i>heh</i>“<i>gimel</i>, which has the numerical value of eight. That is at eight days he made a <i>feast.</i> From here we learn that we make a <i>feast</i> for the <i>circumcision.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">111</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 21:8.</i> <i>Shem, Eber</i> and <i>Abimelech</i> were at the <i>feast.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">112</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 21:8.</i>
“<i>Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian playing</i>” [21:9]. Sarah saw Ishmael engaging in illicit sexual relations, murder and <i>idol worship.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">113</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 21:9.</i>
Sarah said to Abraham: expel the maid and her son. <i>Toldot Yizhak</i> writes that <i>Ishmael</i> mocked at the feast that Abraham made for Isaac. Also, what is the <i>joy</i> that they made a <i>feast</i> for Isaac and not for me? I am the firstborn and will inherit two shares. Therefore, Sarah said: expel the maid. She will not inherit with her son. <i>Toldot Yizhak</i> asks another question. How is it that a lord like Abraham should not give his son good hens for the road and only gave him bread and a jug of water? The answer is that the Holy One had said to Abraham: do what Sarah will tell you do with the maid. Sarah had said: expel her with her son. Therefore, Abraham did not have the power to give good food. When one is expelled, he is given bread and water. Here the Holy One said: “<i>As for the son of the slave-woman, I will make a nation of him also</i>” [21:13]. This means, I will make <i>Ishmael</i> a nation because he is your seed. “<i>Early next morning Abraham took some bread and a skin of water</i>” [21:14]. Early in the morning, Abraham took bread and a jug of water and gave them to the maid on her shoulder and the child on her other shoulder, since the child was weak.<sup class="footnote-marker">114</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Genesis, 21:8–15.</i> Sarah had given him the evil eye and the child could not walk.<sup class="footnote-marker">115</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 21:14.</i>
<i>Toldot Yizhak</i> writes that <i>Ishmael</i> did not want to leave Abraham’s house. He was wild and did not want to listen to his father. That is why Abraham had to tie him to Hagar’s shoulder. That is why it is written, “<i>he sent her.</i>” This means, Abraham sent her, that is to say, Hagar alone. One can ask here, it should have said, <i>he sent them</i>, meaning, he sent them both, the maid and the youth. However, the explanation is that <i>Ishmael</i> was tied to Hagar, and when he sent Hagar, he also sent the youth.<sup class="footnote-marker">116</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Genesis, 21:8–15.</i>
<i>Bahya</i> writes. Abraham only gave bread and water to Ishmael, since Abraham saw prophetically that Ishmael would be a great <i>enemy</i> of Israel in the future.<sup class="footnote-marker"> 117</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 21:14.</i>
“<i>When the water was gone from the skin</i>” [21:15]. The water from the jug was drunk up, since Ishmael was sick and a sick person drinks more than a healthy one.<sup class="footnote-marker">118</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 21:15.</i> Hagar threw her child under a tree and Hagar seated herself opposite him at the distance that one can shoot an arrow. She thought, let me not see the anguish of the youth dying and she cried much.
“<i>God heard the cry of the boy</i>” [21:17]. The Holy One accepted the cry and <i>prayer</i> that the youth had done. Our <i>sages</i> learn from here that the <i>prayer</i> of a sick person is more quickly accepted than when another person <i>prays</i> for the same sick person.<sup class="footnote-marker">119</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 21:17.</i>
“<i>God has heeded the cry of the boy where he is</i>” [21:17]. The angel said to Hagar, do not be afraid. The Holy One has accepted the cry of the youth. “<i>Where he is.</i>” That is to say, even though he will be an <i>evildoer</i> and will hurt <i>Israel.</i> The angels said: <i>Lord of the Universe</i>, how can you have <i>pity</i> on <i>Ishmael?</i> He will pursue and kill <i>Israel</i> by [withholding] drink. The Holy One responded: “<i>Where he is.</i>” That is to say, now <i>Ishmael</i> is righteous. The Holy One judges each person the way they are at that time and not for the evil that they will do later.<sup class="footnote-marker">120</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid.</i>
“<i>I will make a great nation of him</i>” [21:18]. The <i>angel</i> said to Hagar: take your child. I will make him a great nation. Here <i>Toldot Yizhak</i> asks a question. Why did the <i>angel</i> have to speak so much with Hagar, that the youth would be a great nation? If the Holy One had only shown them a well with water, Hagar would have given the child enough water to drink. The explanation is that Hagar <i>intended</i> to allow <i>Ishmael</i> to die. She said that because Abraham, his father, did not have any <i>pity</i> on his son <i>Ishmael</i>, why should I have <i>pity?</i> She threw her son angrily under the tree. That is why it is written, “<i>she threw the child</i>” [21:15]. She threw him angrily. It is not written, <i>and she placed the child</i>, which would mean that she slowly laid him down. Therefore, the <i>angel</i> thought that she would let the child die. That is why the <i>angel</i> said to Hagar: this son will be a great nation and therefore, I am telling you, take him and give him water to drink. There is a well with water where you are. She filled her jug with water and the Holy One helped the youth and was with the youth.<sup class="footnote-marker">121</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Genesis, 21:17–18.</i> His mother went with him to Egypt and got him a wife.
“<i>At that time Abimelech said</i>” [21:22]. Abimelech said that Abraham had great luck. He had been protected from Sodom, from the great kings and his wife had a child in her old age. Abimelech was afraid of Abraham and said to Abraham: swear to me that you will not do evil to my children, just as I have done kindness with you. Abraham swore to Abimelech.<sup class="footnote-marker">122</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 21:22–23.</i>
<i>Toldot Yizhak</i> writes. <i>Abimelech</i> had an idol on his heart. Abimelech wanted <i>Abraham</i> to swear by the idol on his garment. Abraham responded: “<i>I swear it</i>” [21:24]. That is to say, by “<i>I the Lord am your God</i>” [Exodus 20:2], I will swear and not by your god.<sup class="footnote-marker">123</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Genesis, 21:23–24.</i>
The <i>Yalkut</i> writes that one should be warned not to establish fraternal relations with gentiles, since one who becomes friends with a gentile, in the end it happens that the gentile mocks him. Abraham became friends with <i>Abimelech.</i> The <i>angels</i> said: <i>Lord of the Universe</i>,You have chosen Abraham from the seventy nations, and now he has become friends with the gentile, Abimelech. The Holy One said: I gave him a son in his old age. If he will be willing to bring him as a <i>sacrifice</i>, then it is good. However, if he will not be willing to bring him as a sacrifice, then you are correct.<sup class="footnote-marker">124</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, <i>Vayera</i>, <i>Remez</i> 95.</i>
The <i>Rabbati</i> writes. The Holy One said: you, Abraham, gave <i>Abimelech</i> seven sheep. Therefore, seven of your descendants, <i>seven righteous ones</i>, will be killed by the hands of the descendants of <i>Abimelech</i>, who are the <i>Philistines.</i> They killed <i>Samson</i>, and the children of <i>Eli the priest</i>, <i>Hofni</i> and <i>Phinehas</i>, and <i>King Saul</i>, along with his three sons. The Holy One said: because you, Abraham, gave seven sheep to <i>Abimelech</i>, the descendants of <i>Abimelech</i> will destroy seven <i>holy sanctuaries</i> of Israel: <i>The Tent of Meeting</i>, [the sanctuaries at] <i>Nob</i>, <i>Galgal</i>, <i>Gibeon</i>, <i>Shiloh</i>, and the <i>two Temples.</i> Therefore, the <i>Philistines</i> captured the <i>Ark</i> of the Holy One for seven months.<sup class="footnote-marker">125</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Genesis Rabbah,</i> 54.4.</i>
From here we learn that we should have no fellowship with a gentile.
The shepherds of Abraham quarreled with the shepherds of Abimelech. For whose sheep the water will rise, we will leave the water. Abraham brought his sheep and the water rose for his sheep.<sup class="footnote-marker">126</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Genesis Rabbah,</i> 54.5.</i>
“<i>And he planted a tamarisk at Beer-sheba, and invoked there the name of the Lord, the Everlasting God</i>” [21:33]. Abraham made a nice garden with fruit to give his guests.<sup class="footnote-marker">127</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 21:33.</i> Our <i>sages</i> say that Abraham built a house with four sides in the hope that guests would come in, wherever they wanted. Through the house, the name of the Holy One was revered. When the guests had eaten, they wanted to praise Abraham. Abraham said to the guests: you think that you have eaten what is mine. No, you should praise the Holy One, since the food and drink are from the Holy One. Therefore, the verse says, “<i>he invoked there the name of the Lord, the Everlasting God</i>” [21:33]. That is to say, they should praise the God of the world.<sup class="footnote-marker">128</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Genesis Rabbah,</i> 54.6.</i>
<i>Bahya</i> writes. The house was called <i>Eshel.</i> The <i>aleph</i> stands for <i>eating.</i> The <i>shin</i> stands for <i>sleeping.</i> This means that he had good beds for the guests to sleep. The <i>lamed</i> shows that he <i>accompanied</i> each guest. Abraham also informed each guest that God is the <i>only one</i> in all the <i>worlds.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">129</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 21:33.</i>
“<i>Some time afterwards, God put Abraham to the test</i>” [22:1]. Satan said: Abraham made a big <i>feast</i> and brought no sacrifice. The Holy One responded: the <i>feast</i> was for his son’s sake. If I were to tell him to bring his son as a <i>sacrifice</i>, he would slaughter his son for Me. It is called “<i>some time afterwards</i>,” that is to say, after the words of the <i>Satan</i>, the Holy One said, slaughter your son for Me. Another explanation is that <i>Ishmael</i> had boasted before <i>Isaac.</i> He said: I was circumcised at thirteen years old and I did not protest. You, <i>Isaac</i>, were circumcised at eight days. You didn’t have the intelligence to protest. Isaac responded: you boast about an organ of your body. If the Holy One would want my whole body, I would give it to Him.<sup class="footnote-marker">130</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 22:1.</i>
“<i>Take your son</i>” [22:2]. The Holy One said: I ask you, my dear Abraham, do not refuse me what I will ask of you, so that people should not say that the first trial was not properly fulfilled by Abraham. The Holy One said: take your son to <i>sacrifice</i> him as a sacrifice. Abraham responded: I have two sons; which one should I take? The Holy One responded: “<i>your favored son</i>” [22:2]; that is to say, your only son. Abraham responded: <i>Isaac</i> is an <i>only son</i> to Sarah and <i>Ishmael</i> is an <i>only son</i> to Hagar. The Holy One responded: “<i>the one you love</i>” [22:2]. Abraham said: I love them both. The Holy One said: “<i>Isaac</i>” [22:2]. That is to say, take Isaac as a sacrifice. The Holy One did not tell him all at once that he should take Isaac as a sacrifice. He did not want to frighten him. He also wanted to give him great rewards for each word that he said to him. “<i>Offer him there as a burnt offering</i>” [22:2]. Ascend Mount <i>Moriah</i> and offer up your son as a sacrifice. The Holy One did not say that he should slaughter <i>Isaac</i>, but he should bring <i>Isaac</i> up to the mountain to make him a <i>burnt offering.</i> Afterwards, he should bring him down, but Abraham did not understand this.<sup class="footnote-marker">131</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 22:2.</i>
“<i>Abraham awoke in the morning</i>” [22:3]. He woke up early to fulfill a <i>commandment</i>, and he saddled the donkey himself. He took <i>Ishmael</i>, <i>Eliezer</i> and two servants. Why two servants? When one servant would go into the field, to take care of his needs, there would always remain one servant with his master, Abraham.<sup class="footnote-marker">132</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 22:3.</i>
“<i>He split the wood for the burnt offering</i>” [22:3]. He prepared the wood in his house. He thought that perhaps there would not be any wood in the place where I will bring the <i>burnt offering.</i> He carried the wood with him, a journey of three days.<sup class="footnote-marker">133</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban, Genesis, 22:3.</i>
<i>Bahya</i> gives another explanation. He selected wood that was fresh, and was not worm eaten. That is why he took wood from his house that would be <i>kosher</i> for a <i>sacrifice.</i> Because of the merit that he split wood, the Holy One split the <i>sea</i> for his children.<sup class="footnote-marker">134</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 22:3.</i>
“<i>He saw the place from afar</i>” [22:3]. <i>Bahya</i> writes. Abraham said to Isaac: what do you see? Isaac responded: I see a beautiful mountain and over it is a beautiful cloud. Abraham asked the youths: what do you see? They said: we see nothing. Abraham said: “<i>you stay here with the ass</i>” [22:5]. You youths sit with the ass, since you are like the ass.<sup class="footnote-marker">135</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 22:4.</i>
The <i>Pirke de Rabbi Eliezer</i> writes. The youths quarreled with each other. Ishmael said: <i>Isaac</i> will be slaughtered and I will inherit everything. <i>Eliezer</i> responded: you were expelled with the maid; you will not inherit. A <i>Heavenly Voice</i> was heard: you will not inherit.<sup class="footnote-marker">136</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Pirke de Rabbi Eliezer,</i> chap. 31.</i>
The Midrash states. Abraham thought to himself: if I do not tell Sarah about the <i>Akedah</i> and her son is sacrificed, and she will not see her son, she will kill herself. If I do tell her that I will slaughter <i>Isaac as a sacrifice</i>, women are <i>frivolous</i> and she might oppose it. Abraham responded and said to Sarah; make a big <i>feast</i> to rejoice. I was three years old and recognized the Holy One. Isaac is thirty-seven years old. I will allow him to begin to fulfill commandments. I want to bring a <i>sacrifice</i> on Mount <i>Moriah.</i> Let him go with me. Sarah gave him <i>permission</i> that he should take <i>Isaac</i> with him. Abraham woke up very early. He thought to himself: I will go because Sarah is still sleeping. Perhaps she will regret sending Isaac with me. Therefore, he went early. He thought to himself: the people are still sleeping, who might try to dissuade me from slaughtering Isaac. Satan made himself to appear as an old man and stood before Abraham and said to him. Where are you going? Abraham responded: to pray. Why do you need the wood and fire and the slaughtering knife? Abraham responded: I might tarry for a few days. I might want to cook some food with the wood and the fire. The Satan said: an old man like you who has no more than one son in his old age and should slaughter him? How could God not punish you? Abraham responded: the Holy One is the one who told me. The Satan then came to <i>Isaac.</i> Where are you going? He responded: I am going to learn how to fulfill commandments. The Satan said to Isaac: will you learn after your death or during your life? They want to slaughter you. Isaac responded: if God wants to have it, I will allow myself to be slaughtered. The Satan went to Sarah and said: where are Abraham and Isaac? You will not see him again. Sarah responded: let God do what he will.<sup class="footnote-marker">137</sup><i class="footnote">Satan’s encounter with Sarah is not found in <i>Midrash Tanhuma.</i></i> The Midrash says that the Satan made himself into a great river. Abraham and Isaac walked into it up to their necks. Abraham <i>prayed</i> and said: Lord of the Universe, You said that I should bring my son as a sacrifice. Now I ask You, help me to make a proper <i>sacrifice</i> of my son. The water immediately disappeared.<sup class="footnote-marker">138</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanhuma</i>, Vayera, 22.</i>

Bind my hands and feet so that I should not flinch when you will slaughter me.<sup class="footnote-marker">139</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanhuma</i>, Vayera, 23.</i> Abraham immediately bound <i>Isaac</i> and placed him on the wood. As the slaughter knife reached his throat, <i>Isaac</i>’<i>s soul</i> left him. When he heard the voice from the <i>Throne of Glory</i>, saying that he should not touch <i>Isaac</i>, <i>Isaac</i>’<i>s</i> soul returned to his body.

Hizkuni and <i>Imre Noam</i> ask: Why did the Holy One test Abraham? Did the Holy One not know that Abraham would do what the Holy One would tell him to do? The explanation is that the <i>angels</i> said: how is Abraham better than other <i>righteous people?</i> The Holy One responded: I will tell you and show you what is Abraham. If I would order him to slaughter his son, he would not refuse Me.<sup class="footnote-marker">141</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 22:1; Imre Noam, Genesis, 22:1.</i>
<i>Hizkuni</i> asks a question. What did Abraham think about slaughtering his son? The Holy One did say, “<i>for it is through Isaac that offspring shall be continued</i>” [21:12]. This means, Abraham will have descendants from Isaac. If he will slaughter Isaac, how will he have descendants? The explanation is that Abraham thought to himself, perhaps Isaac has slept with a woman and she became pregnant from <i>Isaac.</i> After all, Isaac was thirty-seven years old at the time.<sup class="footnote-marker">142</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 22:8.</i>
“<i>We will return to you</i>” [22:5]. Abraham said to the youths: you remain here with the donkey. We will go to God and we will return to you. <i>Rashi</i> writes: he prophetically said that both of them would return. That is to say, Isaac would not be slaughtered.<sup class="footnote-marker">143</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 22:5.</i>
<i>Bahya</i> writes. Abraham thought that he would return the bones of <i>Isaac</i> after he would be burned on the <i>altar.</i> That is why he said, “<i>We will return to you</i>” [22:5]. That is, we will both return.<sup class="footnote-marker">144</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 22:5.</i>
“<i>The two walked off together</i>” [22:6]. They went side by side. Abraham who knew that he should slaughter his son, <i>Isaac</i>,was as happy as Isaac who did not know about the matter.<sup class="footnote-marker">145</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 22:6.</i>
“<i>Isaac said to his father Abraham, Father</i>” [22:7]. Here one asks a question. Why does the verse have to say, “<i>to his father Abraham</i>”? We know very well that Abraham is his father. Then, he says again, “<i>my father.</i>” Why does it have to say that he is his father? <i>Bahya</i> writes. He called him father, father. That is to say, he should have <i>compassion</i> on him, like a father for his son.<sup class="footnote-marker">146</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 22:7.</i>
Another explanation is that people said, Isaac said to Abraham: now people will say that Sarah became pregnant from <i>Abimelech</i> and gave birth to him. If Isaac had been Abraham’s son, he would have had compassion on his son, “<i>as a father has compassion on his children</i>” [Psalms 103:13]. Therefore, the verse says, “<i>Isaac said to his father Abraham, Father</i>” [22:7]. That is to say, are you my father? Abraham again responded, “<i>he said, my son</i>” [22:7]. That is to say, you are my son. Isaac said: if I am your son, where is the <i>sacrifice</i> to be offered? Abraham responded: the Holy One will show the sacrifice. Isaac then understood that he would be brought as a sacrifice. That is why the verse again says, “<i>the two of them walked on together</i>” [22:8]. That is to say, even though Isaac knew well that he would be the sacrifice, yet they went on together, joyfully and wholeheartedly.<sup class="footnote-marker">147</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 22:8.</i>
<i>Bahya</i> asks. Was Abraham’s <i>merit</i> greater because he wanted to slaughter his son with his own hands, or did Isaac have greater <i>merit</i> because he was ready to allow himself to be slaughtered? Some rabbis say that Abraham had more merit, since it is easier for a person to allow himself to be slaughtered than a father should slaughter his son with his own hands. Some <i>sages</i> say that Isaac’s merit was greater. Abraham had heard directly from the Holy One that he should slaughter his son, but Isaac only heard this from Abraham and not from the Holy One, yet he was ready to allow himself to be slaughtered. <i>Bahya</i> writes that the merit of Abraham was greater, since Isaac was required to obey what his father said.<sup class="footnote-marker">148</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 22:8.</i>
“<i>Abraham built an altar there</i>” [22:9]. Abraham built an <i>altar</i> on the spot where Adam had made an altar.<sup class="footnote-marker">149</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 22:9.</i> The <i>Hizkuni</i> asks: Why didn’t Isaac also help build it? The explanation is that Abraham hid Isaac so that Satan should not throw a stone at Isaac in order to make him unfit; that is, a <i>defect</i> in Isaac. A <i>sacrifice</i> should be properly <i>kosher.</i> Therefore, Isaac could not help build it.<sup class="footnote-marker">150</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 22:9.</i>
“<i>He bound</i>” [22:9]. Abraham bound Isaac’s hands and feet, and laid him on the wood. Isaac asked: do not let me see the <i>knife</i> so that I will not flinch, so that you will slaughter me <i>properly.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">151</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 22:9.</i> He also asked his father that he should not tell Sarah. Sarah might be standing on a roof or near a pit and she would fall, out of great fright.<sup class="footnote-marker">152</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 22:10.</i>
Abraham took the knife in his hand. A great shout came down from heaven: Abraham, Abraham, do not touch Isaac or slaughter him. Abraham said: let me at least cause a little blood to flow.<sup class="footnote-marker">153</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 22:12.</i> The <i>angel</i> responded: “<i>do not do anything to him</i>” [22:12]. This means, you should not cause any <i>wound</i> to Isaac.
<i>Bahya</i> writes. Abraham said to the shout, who are you? The shout answered that he was an angel. Abraham said: previously, the Holy One Himself told me to slaughter my son. Let Him also now talk to me Himself. Immediately, “<i>the angel of the Lord called to him a second time from heaven</i>” [22:15]. He swore himself that the Holy One would bless your <i>descendants</i> from Isaac, like the stars in the sky and the sand in the sea.<sup class="footnote-marker">154</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 22:10.</i>
Abraham said to the Holy One: previously, You said that Isaac will be my <i>descendant</i> and You told me to slaughter him, and now again You have again told me not to slaughter him. The Holy One responded: I am not <i>rescinding</i> and I did not lie. Rather, I said, “<i>take your son</i> … <i>and offer him there as a burnt offering</i>” [22:2]. This means, bring him instead of the sacrifice, but I did not say that you should slaughter him, but you can bring him up and again bring him down.<sup class="footnote-marker">155</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 22:12.</i>
Abraham said: You have sworn and I also swear. I will not descend until You promise me that You will remember when Israel will commit sins, this should be expiation for my children, as if I had caused his blood to flow and as if his ashes had lain on the <i>altar.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">156</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 22:10.</i>
<i>Imre Noam</i> asks a question. Why is it written here, “<i>the angel called from heaven</i>” [22:15]? Also, why did the angel not come down to Abraham, as occurred with Hagar? An angel came and said: take Ishmael, and here it says “<i>from heaven.</i>” This means, the angel spoke to Abraham from heaven. The explanation is, here the angel had to shout immediately since Abraham was very quick to slaughter Isaac.<sup class="footnote-marker">157</sup><i class="footnote">Imre Noam, Genesis, 22:11.</i>
“<i>Now I know that you fear God</i>” [22:12]. That is to say, the Holy One said: now I can answer the <i>angels</i> and the <i>nations of the world</i> why I am <i>compassionate</i> to Abraham more than to other people.<sup class="footnote-marker">158</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 22:12.</i>
“<i>He looked and beheld a ram that was caught in the thicket by its horns</i>” [22:13]. Abraham saw a <i>sheep</i> caught in a tree. It could not run away. This had been prepared from <i>the six days of creation.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">159</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 22:13.</i>
<i>Hizkuni</i> writes. Abraham understood that the Holy One had sent it as a <i>sacrifice</i>, because it was tied down. If it had not been tied down, Abraham would have said that the sheep belongs to someone else and how can I take it for a sacrifice?<sup class="footnote-marker">160</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 22:13.</i>
<i>Bahya</i> writes. “<i>Caught in the thicket</i>” [22:13]. When Israel are covered in sins for the whole year, they stray with great <i>troubles.</i> They take the <i>horn</i> of a ram on <i>Rosh Hashanah</i>, blow it, and the Holy One forgives their sins.<sup class="footnote-marker">161</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 22:13.</i>
“<i>Bethuel had Rebecca</i>” [22:23]. Abraham went from the <i>binding</i> of Isaac and thought. If I had slaughtered Isaac, how would he have children? It would be better if Isaac took a wife from the daughters of <i>Anar, Eshkol and Mamre.</i> Therefore, the Holy One notified him that <i>Bethuel</i>, his nephew, had had a daughter called <i>Rebecca</i>, who would be more <i>appropriate</i> for Isaac.<sup class="footnote-marker">162</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 22:20.</i>

Chayei Sarah

“<i>The span of Sarah</i>’<i>s life</i>” [23:1]. The sages said about Sarah that as long as she lived, there was a light from the <i>eve of Sabbath</i> until the next <i>Sabbath.</i> The <i>blessing</i> was in the dough and a cloud hovered over her tent. As soon as Sarah died, these three things stopped, since these three things were seen as a result of her <i>merit.</i> She had the <i>merit</i> to die in the <i>land of Israel</i> and was buried in the land of Israel and lived the fullness of her days. This is the meaning of “<i>The span of Sarah</i>’<i>s life came to one hundred and twenty-seven years</i>” [23:1]. It says that Sarah lived a long time. “<i>And Sarah died</i>” [23:2]. Then Sarah died. It was appropriate for the Torah to write about Sarah’s death immediately after the story of the <i>binding of Isaac</i>, because Sarah died when she heard someone say that her son Isaac was to be slaughtered. However, the Torah immediately wrote that <i>Rebecca</i> was born and Sarah died. This shows us that when one righteous person dies, another righteous person comes into the world. They were written near the <i>binding of Isaac</i>, because Sarah was told how Isaac was bound to be slaughtered. She became very frightened and her <i>soul</i> left her.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, <i>Hayye Sarah</i>, Introduction.</i>
<i>Hizkuni</i> writes. Sarah did not need to adorn herself with makeup or other jewelry. People used to adorn themselves at the age of twenty years. However, Sarah did not need to adorn herself with jewelry, but as like a seven year old who is beautiful without any jewelry.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 23:1.</i>
<i>Bahya</i> and <i>Hizkuni</i> write that the verse “<i>the span of Sarah</i>’<i>s lifetime</i>” [23:1] shows us that the word “<i>and they were</i>” has the numerical value of thirtyseven. That is to say, Sarah truly lived from the time that Isaac was born, which is thirty-seven years. However, the years she lived without Isaac were not called really living, since she was without children. Whoever does not have children, it is as if they are dead.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya and Hizkuni, Genesis, 23:1.</i>
<i>Ba</i>’<i>al ha-Turim</i> also writes “<i>in Kiryat Arba</i>,” Sarah died in <i>Kiryat Arba.</i> It was called <i>Kiryat Arba</i>, because four pairs were buried there: Adam and his wife, Abraham and Sarah, Isaac and Rebecca, Jacob and Leah. Another explanation is that there were four giants there.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">This comment is not found in the Ba’al ha-Turim, but is found in Rashi, Genesis, 23:2.</i>
“<i>Abraham came to mourn Sarah and to bewail her</i>” [23:2]. Abraham came from <i>Beer Sheva</i> to mourn and bewail Sarah.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 23:2.</i> Bahya asks a question. Why does it have to say, “<i>to mourn Sarah</i>”? He had already mentioned her with her name, “<i>and Sarah died.</i>” The explanation is that when a person mourns and cries over the deceased, they would mention and repeat the name many times. <i>Bahya</i> asks another question. Why did Isaac also not mourn and cry over his mother? Scripture only says that Abraham mourned. The explanation is that they did not want to tell Isaac that his mother had died, in the hope that Isaac should not be anguished that his mother had died because Sarah had heard how Isaac was bound to be slaughtered, and her soul left her. That is why Isaac is not mentioned in the <i>eulogy</i> and burial of Sarah. Isaac is also not mentioned from the time that he was bound on Mount Moriah, since he spent three years on Mount Moriah, until he was forty years old and married Rebecca. This is why the verse says, “<i>Abraham returned to his servants</i>” [22:19]. This means, Abraham came back alone from Mount Moriah to his servants, but Isaac remained on Mount Moriah.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 23:2.</i>
<i>Toldot Yizhak</i> asks a question. Why did Abraham not purchase a place to bury himself and his wife, since they were already old? The explanation is that Abraham did this with wisdom. He thought to himself. I know well that Adam and his wife are buried in the cave, and it is an important place. Therefore, I will not offer to buy the cave from him. He may not know that Adam and Eve are buried there and may consider the cave to be unimportant. However, if I offer to buy it before Sarah dies, <i>Ephron</i> would think about it. Why does Abraham desire to bury his dead in that cave? There must be something there and he would ask people about this and might learn that Adam and Eve are buried there, making it very expensive. That is why Abraham sent Sarah to Hebron, since she was very old. Perhaps she will die in Hebron, in <i>the land of Canaan</i> and the cave of Adam and Eve is there. Perhaps Sarah will die in <i>Hebron</i>, in the <i>land of Israel.</i>
The cave of Adam and Eve is there, and when Sarah will die I will easily receive the cave from Ephron, since the cave is not worth much. If someone will ask, why does Abraham desire this cave? He will say that he wants a burial place. Therefore, Abraham was clever and did not say explicitly that they should give him the cave. Rather, he said: give me a grave so that I can bury my dead that is lying before me on the ground. Therefore, the verse says, “<i>that I will bury my dead before me</i>” [23:4]. That is to say, my dead is before me. It is just that you should give me a burial place. Therefore, the verse says, “<i>bury your dead in the choicest of our burial places; none of us will withhold his burial place from you for burying your dead</i>” [23:6]. That is to say, you must have a burial place, since your dead lies before you, even if it is our best one.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Genesis, 23:2.</i>
“<i>Abraham came to mourn Sarah and to bewail her</i>” [23:2]. The <i>Toldot Yizhak</i> asks a question. Previously, they used to cry and then to mourn. The explanation is that Abraham was full of joy that he had been protected at the binding of Isaac. He first had to <i>praise Sarah</i> that she was very pious. That is why he had to cry, even though he was very happy and had heard the good news that Rebecca had been born, who his son would marry someone of <i>good family.</i> Thus, he was full of joy, and he could not cry. Therefore, he had to first mention her <i>good deeds</i> and then he cried. That is why the letter <i>kof</i> of “<i>bewail her</i>” [23:2] is smaller than normal. He cried little because she had done <i>good deeds</i> and he was full of joy.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid.</i>
<i>Ba</i>’<i>al ha-Turim</i> writes. He cried little because she died at an old age and one should cry little. Another explanation is that Sarah caused her own death by being overly <i>anxious</i> over the binding of Isaac and that is why Abraham did not want to cry excessively.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Ba’al ha-Turim, Genesis, 23:2.</i>
“<i>Then Abraham rose from his dead</i>” [23:3]. Abraham stood up from his dead and asked the children of <i>Heth.</i> The <i>Ba</i>’<i>al ha-Turim</i> writes. One should not speak before a deceased person, and that is why he stood up from the corpse and went to the side and spoke with the children of <i>Heth.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Ba’al ha-Turim, Genesis, 23:3.</i>
“<i>I am a resident alien among you</i>” [23:4]. I am a <i>stranger</i> from a foreign land. I have settled among you. If you will give me a grave out of good will, then it is good. If you will not give it to me, then I will win it legally. I will consider myself a <i>stranger</i>, since the Holy One has promised this to me.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 23:4.</i>
<i>Hizkuni</i> writes. Why did the <i>Torah</i> write about Sarah in which city she died? However, concerning <i>Abraham</i>, <i>Rebecca</i>, <i>Rachel</i>, and <i>Leah</i>, the <i>Torah</i> did not write where they died. The explanation is that Abraham had sent Sarah to <i>Hebron</i> in the hope that she would be far from Mount <i>Moriah</i>, so that she should not quickly learn about her son Isaac who would be slaughtered. The Midrash says that the <i>angel Samael</i> came to Sarah and told her how <i>Isaac</i> was slaughtered. Her <i>soul</i> left her and she died. Some say that Sarah became sick and Abraham sent her to <i>Hebron</i>, since the air of <i>Hebron</i> was good, and she died when she heard about her son.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 23:2.</i>
“<i>Sell me a burial site among you</i>” [23:4]. Abraham said: give me a field for a <i>grave</i> with you. <i>Bahya</i> asks a question here. Why did he have to say, give me a <i>grave</i> with you? Rather, give me a grave. The explanation is that the <i>custom</i> was that each family had its own <i>cemetery</i> and when a guest died among them, they buried him separately in a field. Therefore, Abraham said: give me a field for a <i>cemetery</i> with you.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 23:4.</i>
“<i>You are the elect of God among us</i>” [23:6]. The children of <i>Heth</i> responded to Abraham: you are an important lord among us. Do not make yourself humble, like a <i>stranger.</i> Choose for yourself the best field, nobody will deny it to you.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid.</i>
“<i>Intervene for me with Ephron son of Zohar. Let him sell me the cave of Machpelah</i>” [23:8–9]. Abraham said to the children of Heth. Ask Ephron that he should give me the two-story cave. It was called Machpelah; This means, two-story. That is, it had two levels, one on top of the other. Another explanation is that only couples lay in the cave, Adam and Eve, Abraham and Sarah, Isaac and Rebecca, Jacob and Leah.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 23:9.</i> It was also called <i>Machpelah</i> because of the height of Adam, who was doubled over in the cave.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 23:9.</i> Abraham said: I will give good silver for the cave. <i>Ephron</i> responded: four hundred weight of silver. What is that between us? Bury your <i>dead.</i>
“<i>Abraham paid over to Ephron</i>” [23:16]. Abraham weighed the silver. The <i>evildoers</i> promise to do much good, but do very little. So too, <i>Ephron</i> first promised that he would give him the field, but later Abraham had to give good weight and a hefty price.
“<i>At the going merchants rate</i>” [23:16]. Abraham had to give coins that were used by merchants in commerce.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 23:16.</i>
“<i>Abraham was old, advanced in years</i>” [24:1]. He was very old with many days. That is to say, there are many old people who soon become aged and have white hair from troubles and exile. However, Abraham had <i>wealth and honor</i> and he had a son. He was not old, but the years came upon him.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Genesis, 24:1.</i> He thought that he would die before his son, Isaac, found a wife. Therefore, he made his servant swear that he should only give his son a wife from his family. He did not make Isaac swear, since Abraham thought that if he only made Isaac swear and not the servant, perhaps the servant might be a <i>deceiver</i> and convince my son, Isaac, that he should take a <i>Canaanite.</i> Therefore, I must make the servant swear. The <i>Midrash</i> talks about four ways in which a person becomes old and gray. When a person is frightened, then old age comes upon him; when one has evil children; when someone goes to <i>war</i>; when someone has an evil wife.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 24:1.</i>
“<i>The Lord had blessed Abraham in all things</i>” [24:1]. The Holy One blessed Abraham with <i>wealth and honor</i>, but he didn’t care about it. He very much desired to find a wife for his son. <i>Rabbi Meir</i> said: the Holy One blessed Abraham that he did not give him a daughter, since if he would have had a daughter, Abraham would not have been able to give her a good husband. She would have had to take a husband who was an <i>idol worshipper.</i> Each wife is under the authority of her husband and if the husband is an <i>idol worshipper</i>, then the wife must also worship idols. <i>Rabbi Judah</i> said: Abraham did have a daughter. The person desires to have daughters and sons, particularly when he is rich.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid.</i>
“<i>Senior servant of his household, who had charge of all that he owned</i>” [24:2]. Eliezer was the chief of Abraham’s household. <i>Hizkuni</i> said. Abraham sent Eliezer because he was the oldest of his servants and an old man does not go after <i>illicit sexual relations</i>, as does a young one. That is why he sent Eliezer for a maiden for his son, Isaac. That is why the verse says, “<i>oldest of his household.</i>” That is, he was old.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 24:2.</i> Nonetheless, he was <i>suspected</i> of sleeping with <i>Rebecca</i>, as we will write below.
“<i>Put your hand under my thigh</i>” [24:2]. Abraham said to his servant, place your hand under my thigh and swear to me by the <i>circumcision</i> that you will not take a wife from the daughters of the <i>Canaanites</i>, for my son, Isaac.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 24:2.</i>
The commentaries, <i>Bahya</i>, <i>Toldot Yizhak</i>, and <i>Hizkuni</i> write. The custom was that the servant placed his hand under his master’s foot. That is, he showed that he was subservient to his master and would serve him properly.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Toldot Yizhak, and Hizkuni, Genesis, 24:2.</i>
<i>Rashi</i> writes. <i>Circumcision</i> was the first <i>commandment</i> given to Abraham that he found difficult to accomplish. The <i>custom</i> was that when someone wants to swear, he takes a <i>Torah scroll</i> in his hands. Abraham did not have a <i>scroll.</i> Therefore, he held his <i>circumcision</i> in his hand and swore on it.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 24:2.</i>
“<i>I will make you swear by the Lord, the God of heaven and the God of the earth</i>” [24:3]. I make you swear by God in heaven and earth. <i>Rashi</i> asks a question in this verse, “<i>The God of heaven, who took me from my father</i>’<i>s house</i>” [24:7]. Here he only says, God of heaven and not God of the earth. The explanation is that when God first led him out of the house of <i>Terah</i>, he did not yet recognize that the Holy One was God over all gods. However, they knew the Holy One in heaven, but later Abraham came and caused them to recognize that the Holy One is God over all gods. He then said, the God of heaven and earth.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 24:7.</i>
However, <i>Bahya</i>, the <i>Toldot Yizhak</i>, and the <i>Ramban</i> write. Abraham was in the <i>land of Israel.</i> He said: God of heaven and of earth. The Holy One is the Lord in the land of Israel and Abraham said his words about God who is over all gods. <i>Outside the land</i>, the gentiles worship idols. Therefore, Abraham said in the verse, “<i>who took me from my father</i>’<i>s house and from my native land</i>” [24:7]. God in heaven; since outside the land God is only recognized in heaven and not on the earth.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 24:2; Toldot Yizhak, Genesis, 24:7; and Ramban, Genesis, 24:3.</i>
“<i>You will not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites</i>” [24:3]. You should not take a wife from the daughters of the Canaanites. The Torah portion also teaches us that one should take a wife from his family, as Amram, as the verse says, “<i>a certain man of the house of Levi went and married a Levite woman</i>” [Exodus 2:1]. Abraham did this for his son, Isaac, when he also took [a wife] from his family. When people take from their own family, there is peace between them. One cannot accuse the other; you are inferior to me.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 24:3.</i>
<i>Ibn Shuaib</i> asks a question. Why did Abraham take a <i>maidservant</i> and a concubine from the <i>nations</i>, but he forbade his son to take a <i>maidservant</i> and none of the <i>Canaanites?</i> The explanation is that Isaac was like a holy <i>sacrifice</i> on Mount <i>Moriah.</i> That is why Abraham did not pray for Sarah when she had no children. Abraham took a maidservant to have children. He thought to himself. I will not exert myself much to pray for Sarah, because I can take a maidservant. Then, the <i>righteous ones</i> will not trouble the Holy One when it is not completely necessary. However, Isaac had to <i>pray</i> for Rebecca that she should have children, since he did not to take a maidservant because he was holy.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Ibn Shuaib, <i>Derashot</i>, Hayyei Sarah, I: 43.</i>
<i>Ibn Shuaib</i> asks another question. Why did Abraham not ask Isaac if he should send for a wife? The explanation is that Abraham knew well that Isaac would obey him. Another explanation is that Isaac was in the <i>Garden of Eden</i> at the time. He was being healed for what his father had done to his throat. Abraham had wanted to slaughter Isaac and he hurt Isaac in the throat. He was being healed in the <i>Garden of Eden</i> for three years.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid.</i>
<i>Hizkuni</i> writes. Abraham did not want that his children should take wives from the daughters of <i>Canaan.</i> The Canaanites had said that Abraham’s children could not come into the <i>land of Israel</i>, but they should <i>intermarry</i> with us and through that, they will have the land, since the Holy One does not want to keep His <i>promise</i> to give them the land. Therefore, Abraham ordered his servant that he should not take any wife for his son Isaac from the daughters of <i>Canaan.</i> I know well that the Holy One will give the <i>land of Israel</i> to my children without their daughters.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 24:3.</i>
“<i>And the servant said to him, what if the woman does not consent to follow me</i>” [24:5]. Eliezer said to Abraham: and if the woman will not want to come to this land? Abraham responded: if the woman will not want to follow you, then you are absolved from my <i>oath</i> and give my son a wife from the daughters of <i>Anar, Eshkol, and Mamre</i>, my <i>friends.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 24:8.</i>
“<i>The Lord, the God of heaven, who took me from my father</i>’<i>s house</i>” [24:7]. Abraham prayed: <i>Lord of the Universe</i>, God of heaven who led me out of my father’s house and from the land of my birth, send an <i>angel</i> to go with Eliezer to take a wife for my son Isaac. <i>Toldot Yizhak</i> asks a question. Why does Abraham have to mention in his prayer that God took him out of his father’s house and out of the land of his birth? The explanation is, Abraham said in his prayer, because You took me out of my father’s house and the land of my birth, how should I take a wife for my son from my homeland? Therefore, Abraham said: it is just that You, God, must <i>at least</i> send an angel so that my son should take a wife from my birthplace, because I have fulfilled your commands and left my homeland.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Genesis, 24:7.</i>
“<i>The servant took ten of his master</i>’<i>s camels and all the bounty of his master</i>” [24:10]. Eliezer took ten camels from Abraham and also took a letter in which Abraham had willed all of his goods to Isaac, in the hope that he should do a good match for Isaac, when they will see that he is very rich. The mouths of Abraham’s camels were bound so that they should not eat from the fields of strangers.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 24:10.</i>
“<i>He made the camels kneel down by the well outside the city</i>” [24:11]. Eliezer came to the city of <i>Nahor</i> and made the camels kneel down by the well in order to water the camels. It was at sunset when the water would be drawn.
“<i>He said, O Lord, God of my master Abraham, grant me good fortune</i>” [24:12]. Eliezer prayed at the well and said; dear Lord, God, cause the maiden to come to the well among the other maidens and I should say to that maiden, give me to drink, and she will say, drink and I will also water your camels. This maiden should be for my master’s son, Isaac. With this I will know that God does kindness with my master’s son.
“<i>The one whom You have decreed for Your servant Isaac</i>” [24:14]. He said: when the maiden will act with <i>kindness</i> at the well, then she is proper for the house of Abraham, since great kindness is done there for guests.
<i>Hizkuni</i> asks a question. Why did <i>Eliezer pray</i> that he should recognize if the maiden does acts of <i>kindness</i> at the well? He could have recognized if the maiden is pious and clever in her house. The explanation is that Eliezer thought that in her father and mother’s house one couldn’t recognize what the maiden is. Her father and mother tell her everything. That is, present yourself before the guest as clever, in the hope that you will please him. Sometimes, many girls are foolish and evil at home, but their father and mother emphasize the cleverness. Therefore, Eliezer prayed that he should learn the cleverness of the maiden when she will be at the well alone, that she should be able to respond with <i>wisdom</i> by herself.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 24:13.</i>
<i>Hizkuni</i> also writes. He took ten camels for ten men to ride, for the <i>blessings</i> of the <i>wedding</i>, so that there should be a <i>minyan.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 24:10.</i>
“<i>He had scarcely finished speaking</i>” [25:15]. Before he finished speaking, Rebecca, the daughter of <i>Bethuel</i>, came and was carrying a jug on her shoulder. <i>Bahya</i> asks a question. Why does the verse have to say, “<i>it was he</i>” [24:15]? Rather, say, “<i>before he could finish</i>” [24:15]. The explanation is, the word “<i>he</i>” points to the Holy One, who is called, “<i>He made us and we are His</i>” [Psalms 100:3]. That is to say, the Holy One sent his <i>angel</i> with <i>Eliezer</i> to make sure that Rebecca would come to the well soon. As soon as Eliezer saw Rebecca and that the water was rising toward her, Eliezer immediately went to the maiden and said, give me a little water to drink. Our sages learn from here that it is written, “<i>she filled her jug and came up</i>” [24:16]. She filled her jug, and it is not written, <i>and she drew.</i> That is, she did not need to draw up the water, since the water came up to meet her, and she filled her jug.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 24:16.</i>
<i>Toldot Yizhak</i> writes. The verse teaches us, “<i>she filled her jug and came up</i>” [24:16]. She filled her jug and went. It is customary that the girls would chat and joke with each other at the well. However, Rebecca was very modest and left immediately.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Genesis, 24:16.</i>
“<i>The maiden was very beautiful, a virgin whom no man had known</i>” [24:16]. The virgin was very beautiful and no man had slept with her. That is to say, there were many of the nations who engaged in illicit sexual relations, but protected their virginity, that their virginity should remain intact. However, Rebecca did not sleep with any man and that is why the verse says, “<i>a virgin whom no man had known</i>” [24:16]. That is, she was a virgin and no man slept with her at all.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 24:16.</i>
<i>Toldot Yizhak</i> writes. This verse teaches is that the Holy One had accepted Eliezer’s prayer and caused Rebecca to come to the well. She was a beautiful maiden who did not normally go to the well, because she was afraid of the <i>young men.</i> Not only that, but she did not even normally go to the well in her house. One could not see her since she was very modest. No man could see her, as the verse says, “<i>no man knew her.</i>”<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Genesis, 24:16.</i>
<i>Hizkuni</i> asks a question. What is new in Scripture telling us that Rebecca was a virgin, if she was three years old? The Talmud says that if one sleeps with a three year old, her virginity grows back.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Nidah,</i> 44b.</i> What does the verse tell us when it says that Rebecca was a virgin? That is, that she did not have <i>sexual relations</i> and even if she did have sexual relations, she could still be a virgin, since she was three years old at the wedding.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 24:16.</i>
<i>Hizkuni</i> gives no explanation to the question, but one can say that the verse teaches us that Rebecca was pious and modest, and was a virgin. Do not think that she could be a virgin even if she did have illicit sexual relations, since her virginity would come back because she was only three years old. That is why the verse says, “<i>no man knew her.</i>” That is, she was a virgin and that no man had slept with her. That is to say, do not think that she slept with someone and was called a virgin because her virginity returned. Therefore, the Torah <i>testifies</i> about Rebecca that she was more honest and pious. Other maidens, who were more than three years old, were recognized by their virginity, that they had kept themselves honest. However, concerning Rebecca, one could say that she might have had sexual relations and her virginity had come back. Therefore, the Torah testifies, “<i>and no man knew her</i>,” about Rebecca.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 24:16.</i> God testified about Rebecca.
“<i>When had let him finish drinking</i>” [24:19]. She finished giving him drink, she said: I will also water you camels.
“<i>The man stood gazing at her</i>” [24:21]. Eliezer was wondering that God was already helping him succeed.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 24:21.</i>
“<i>The man took a nose-ring weighing a half shekel, and two gold bands for her arms, ten shekels in weight</i>” [24:22]. Eliezer took a gold nose-ring and two gold bands for her hands, ten shekels in weight. <i>Hizkuni</i> writes. It is written in the verse, “<i>and he took</i>” [24:22]. This means, Eliezer prepared himself and took all of this in his hand and wanted to give it to the maiden. That is why it is not written, <i>and he gave to the maiden.</i> He did not give it to the maiden, but asked her first, “<i>whose daughter are you?</i>” [24:23]. This means, whose daughter are you? He first wanted to know who she was. Another explanation is that Eliezer first gave the maiden, before he asked the maiden, whose are you, in the hope that he would acquire a <i>reputation</i> that he was rich. However, later Eliezer gave <i>the news to Bethuel and Laban</i>, Eliezer did not want to say that he first gave the jewelry to Rebecca before he asked. That is, he said: I asked about her father and mother and for the sake of their honor, I gave the <i>jewelry</i> to Rebecca.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 24:22.</i> That is to say, he said: I asked about her father and mother, and for their honor I gave the jewelry to Rebecca.
<i>Rashi</i> writes. He first gave her, since Eliezer relied on the merit of Abraham and that is why he gave her a gold nose-ring, weighing a half shekel. This was an allusion to Israel, each of whom would give a half <i>shekel.</i> The two bracelets allude to the two tablets that Israel would receive from the Holy One. Ten gulden in weight alludes to the Ten Commandments from God, that is to say, the <i>Ten Statements.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 24:22–23.</i>
“<i>Is there room in your father</i>’<i>s house for us to spend the night</i>” [24:23]. Eliezer asked Rebecca: is there room in your father’s house to spend the night. That is why “<i>to spend the night</i>” is written with a <i>yud.</i> This means that Eliezer desired a place for one night. Rebecca responded with “<i>a place to spend the night</i>,” meaning to spend many nights. That is to say, for your sake you can stay for many nights. Therefore, to <i>spend the night</i> is written with a <i>vav</i>, that is to say, for many nights.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 24:23. The interpretation is based on Eliezer using the singular form of the term, while Rebecca uses the plural form</i>
<i>Toldot Yizhak</i> asks a question here. Eliezer asked for “<i>a place to spend the night.</i>” Is there a place in your house for us to spend the night? Rebecca responded: “<i>there is also place to spend nights.</i>” There is a house to spend the night and did not say, <i>there is also a place for you to spend the night.</i> This means, there is place to sleep for you for many nights. The explanation is that Rebecca thought to herself. How can I say that there will be place to sleep many nights? Perhaps my father will not want them to stay. This was a wise thing on her part.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Genesis, 24:23.</i>
“<i>The man bowed low in homage to the Lord</i>” [24:26]. Eliezer bowed down to God and praised Him that He had guided him properly.
“<i>The maiden ran and told all this to her mother</i>’<i>s household</i>” [24:28]. The maiden ran and told her mother. It was the custom that the daughter told her mother everything she knew first.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 24:28.</i>
“<i>Laban ran out to the man</i>” [24:29]. When Laban saw that Rebecca had received much money from the guest, he quickly ran and stood before Eliezer at the well and said to Eliezer: come into our house. We have cleared out all the <i>idols.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 24:31.</i> He came into the house and he gave the camels feed and water to wash the feet of Eliezer and his men.
“<i>Food was set before him</i>” [24:32]. Food was placed before him. Eliezer said: I will not eat until I will speak. <i>Bahya</i> and the <i>Baal ha-Turim</i> write. They gave him <i>poison</i> in the bowl, expecting that Eliezer would eat and die. They wanted to inherit and they hurried him and said, eat soon. He responded: I am the servant of Abraham. I must first <i>wash my hands and recite the blessing over the bread.</i> He thought the Holy One would save him because of the <i>blessings.</i> An <i>angel</i> came and moved the <i>poison</i> before <i>Bethuel.</i> Bethuel ate the <i>poison</i> and he died immediately. That is why the verse says, “<i>then he and the men who were with him ate and drank</i>” [24:54]. Eliezer and his men ate and drank. However. It is not written that the household of Bethuel ate, since they had become <i>bereaved</i>, because Bethuel died at the table.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya and Baal ha-Turim, Genesis, 24:33.</i>
The Yalkut writes. Why did Bethuel die so quickly? Bethuel was a king in <i>Aram Naharaim</i> and each virgin who would get married came before Bethuel and slept with him, and he would take her virginity. That is why his name was Bethuel because he took each maiden’s virginity [<i>betulim</i>]. On the night that his daughter Rebecca became a bride, all the evildoers gathered and said to Bethuel. If Bethuel would take Rebecca’s virginity, then it would be good. If not, they would kill both Bethuel and Rebecca. That is why the Holy One caused Bethuel to die the same night. Eliezer and Rebecca left <i>Haran</i> two hours after sunrise and the angel caused that they came to Hebron in one day. It was a seventeen-day journey from <i>Hebron</i> to <i>Haran.</i> This was like when he left Abraham’s house and wanted to go to Haran for Rebecca. He was also on the way for three hours, in a journey that normally took seventeen days, as the verse says, “<i>I came today to the spring</i>” [24:42]. That is, <i>I left today</i>, and today I came to the well. Eliezer woke up in the morning and he saw the <i>angel</i> standing. Eliezer said: do not delay me and let me go with Rebecca. Eliezer came with Rebecca and she saw Isaac in the forest. He was going out of the <i>Garden of Eden.</i> When Rebecca saw <i>prophetically</i> that the <i>evil Esau</i> would come from her, she fell off the camel and caused her virginity to disappear. The Holy One sent the <i>angel Gabriel</i> to protect her virginity in the field in the place where she fell, and that the blood should not stink and thereby be recognized. When Isaac slept with Rebecca and did not find her a virgin, he <i>suspected</i> that Eliezer had slept with her. Isaac asked: tell me the truth. Rebecca said: I fell off the camel and lost my virginity. He said to Rebecca: you are lying, but Eliezer slept with you. Rebecca swore that Eliezer did not touch her. Isaac went with Rebecca and found a tree root smeared with blood. Isaac immediately recognized that Rebecca had told the truth. The Holy One said: what good should we do for Eliezer, since he was suspected, but was innocent in the matter. The Holy One said to the angels that Eliezer should be brought into the <i>Garden of Eden</i> alive. Here we can see how great a sin it is when one suspects someone and he did not commit the transgression. God repaid him with a good reward. We find that Isaac was in the Garden of Eden alive and left. However, Eliezer came into the Garden of Eden alive and remained there in that state forever.<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Hayyei Sarah, <i>Remez</i>, 109.</i>
“<i>The Lord has greatly blessed my master, and has become rich: He has given him sheep and cattle, silver and gold, and slaves</i>” [24:35]. Eliezer behaved like a matchmaker and praised his master, how he had much cattle, silver, gold and slaves.
<i>Hizkuni</i> asks a question. Why is <i>slaves</i> written without a <i>yud?</i> The explanation is that Abraham had only one slave, Eliezer himself. However, for Abraham he was the equivalent of many slaves.<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 24:35.</i>
“<i>In her old age</i>” [24:36]. Eliezer said that Sarah, my master’s proper wife, gave birth in her old age and Abraham willed everything to him.
<i>Hizkuni</i> writes that Eliezer said, she had given birth in her old age. That is, she would not have any other children.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 24:36.</i> The son will <i>inherit</i> everything. He is very beloved, because he was born in their old age.
<i>Toldot Yizhak</i> writes. Eliezer praised his master, Abraham, since the people thought, if Isaac is a fine <i>young man</i> and Abraham had his fortune, why did he have to send so far from his land to take a wife for his son? He could certainly have found a wife at home. The explanation is that this is why Eliezer had to speak so long. He said: my master Abraham is still very rich. Do not think that he has become impoverished. Isaac is a fine <i>young man</i> and not an evildoer or an idler. He was born through a miracle when Sarah was ninety years old. You can well understand that the Holy One will send a good son. Therefore, do not be afraid. Isaac is good and pious. That is why Eliezer said, “<i>the Lord has greatly blessed my master</i>” [24:35]. That is, do not think that the goods and camels that I am showing you belong to strangers. It is customary that often one takes money, silver and gold and displays it for the sake of a match. Therefore, he said: my master Abraham was blessed by God with this wealth and had no need to borrow. Rather, I have been sent to you because my master did not want to take a wife for his son from the daughters of the <i>Canaanites.</i> My master made me swear that I should not take a daughter of the <i>Canaanites</i>, but from his <i>family.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Genesis, 24:35–37.</i>
“<i>I said to my master, what if the woman does not want to follow me?</i>” [24:39]. Eliezer said: I said to my master, perhaps the woman will not want to follow me. Abraham said: the Holy One will send his angel for this.<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 24:15.</i>
<i>Rashi</i> writes. Why is <i>perhaps</i> written without a <i>vav?</i> This teaches us that Eliezer said to Abraham: give my daughter to your son Isaac. Abraham responded: my son Isaac was blessed by God and you and your daughter are cursed.<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 24:39.</i> That is why <i>perhaps</i> is written without a <i>vav.</i> That is to say, Eliezer said: your son Isaac should come along.
<i>Hizkuni</i> writes. The Torah showed here that Eliezer desired that Isaac should take his daughter and did not show this above in the Torah portion, when Abraham said to Eliezer, take a wife for my son from my family. The explanation is that Eliezer was like a matchmaker and praised Isaac before Rebecca’s father and mother. He said: I would have gladly given my own daughter to Isaac, but Abraham did not want it.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 24:39.</i>
“<i>I inquired of her, whose daughter are you</i> … <i>and I put the ring on her nose</i>” [24:47]. Eliezer told everything that he did on that day. Also, how he traveled for three hours and came from Hebron. This was a seventeen-day journey, as the verse says, “<i>I came today</i>” [24:42]. This means, I left today and today I came to the well.<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 24:42.</i> I asked Rebecca, whose daughter are you? Later, I gave her the <i>presents.
Rashi</i> asks here. Why did Eliezer say something different before her father and mother from what he did? He first gave the <i>presents</i> to Rebecca first and then asked Rebecca, whose daughter are you? Eliezer did this so that they should not ask him, what kind of fool are you, to give such precious <i>presents</i> to a maiden that you do not know. Therefore, <i>Eliezer</i> said to her father and mother, I asked her, whose daughter are you?<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 24:47.</i>
“<i>Now, if you mean to treat my master with true kindness</i>” [24:49]. Eliezer said: if you will do kindness and truth, tell me. The <i>Imre Noam</i> asks a question. Why did he have to ask so much for <i>kindness and truth?</i> Did they not want to give Rebecca to a rich house? The explanation is that they heard that the children of Abraham would be in the <i>Egyptian exile.</i> Therefore, they did not want to give Rebecca to Isaac. That is why <i>Eliezer</i> had to ask, do <i>kindness</i> with my master.<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">Imre Noam, Genesis, 24:49.</i>
Rabbi Isserlein asks. What is the meaning of kindness and truth [<i>hesed veemet</i>]? One only speaks of <i>truth</i> when one does something for a deceased person, since he does not desire to be repaid. The explanation is that <i>Eliezer</i> was clever and said: I ask you, do <i>kindness and truth.</i> That is to say, do not desire that I should repay the kindness that you are doing. You should not desire money for this kindness, but do me a kindness without payment, not for the sake of a reward.<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">Be’ure Maharai, Genesis, 24:49.</i>
“<i>That I may turn right or left</i>” [24:49]. Eliezer said: if you will not give me Rebecca, then I will take a wife for Isaac from the daughters of <i>Ishmael</i> or the daughters of Lot.<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 24:49.</i>
“<i>Laban and Bethuel answered, the matter was decreed by the Lord; we cannot speak to you good or bad</i>” [24:50]. They said: this thing went out from God. We are not allowed to speak good or evil. The verse says that Laban answered before his father, since he was an evildoer to speak before his father.<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 24:50.</i> He was very smart in speaking, and therefore they let him speak. This shows that he was an evildoer. He said: we cannot say good or evil. He had an evil mouth. First he spoke about doing evil and then he spoke of doing good; his intention was to do more evil than good.<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 24:50.</i>
<i>Bahya</i> writes. From here we learn that each match comes from God, as the sages also said. Forty days before the person is born, a shout goes out in heaven that a person should take this person’s daughter to wife.<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 24:50.</i>
“<i>Here is Rebecca before you; take her</i>” [24:51]. They said: Rebecca is before you. Take her and go with her to your master, as God had said. When Eliezer heard these words, he bowed down and praised God. He took out gold and silver jewelry and betrothed her with the silver and gold and also gave silken garments to Rebecca. He gave good fruits to her brother and sister. They ate and drank and went to sleep. The next morning they woke up and the angel came to Eliezer and wanted to accompany him to his home. Eliezer said to the household: send me home. The brother and mother responded, but Bethuel had eaten the <i>poison.</i> That is why her brother and mother had to answer. They said: let the maiden stay with us for a year or ten <i>months</i> and afterwards she will go.<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 24:53–55.</i>
<i>Hizkuni</i> asks a question here. Did they not say at first, “<i>here is Rebecca before you; take her and go</i>” [24:51]. This means, take Rebecca and go. Now they were saying, the maiden wants to sit for several <i>months</i> with us. The explanation is: Laban and his mother did not know that Eliezer was a <i>messenger to betroth</i> Rebecca. Therefore they said: take Rebecca and go, expecting that Isaac would <i>betroth</i> her and it is not proper to delay. However, afterwards they saw that Eliezer was a messenger to <i>betroth</i> her and that Eliezer <i>betrothed</i> her himself, on behalf of Isaac. They said: as long as she is <i>already betrothed</i>, let her sit a while with us to make her clothes and adornments.<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 24:55.</i>
<i>Toldot Yizhak</i> writes. Laban was very devious. Therefore, he did not say at first, let the maiden stay with us. He was afraid that Eliezer would agree that she should remain, but she should be given to him at a later time. Laban said at first, “<i>the matter is from God, take her and go</i>” [25:50 –51]. That is to say, take her there, since it was concluded this way from God, in the hope that Eliezer would respond, it is good. I will take her. He was very happy that he wanted to take her and he did not ask for a dowry. When Laban heard that Eliezer had praised God that the match had gone through, he got up before Eliezer and said. Let the maiden stay with us. We will buy her clothes and give her a dowry. Eliezer was not ashamed to say that he did not want any dowry. He said: because it happened through God and you promised me that I could take her. Let me go. Laban knew well that Eliezer would not leave the maiden because of the dowry, for even one day.<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Genesis, 24:55.</i>
“<i>They said, let us call the girl and ask for her reply</i>” [24:57]. They said: we will call Rebecca and ask her if she wants to go. From here our sages learn that one must ask an orphan if she wants to have the man as her husband.<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Genesis Rabbah</i>, 60.12.</i>
“<i>She said, I will go</i>” [24:57]. Rebecca said: I will go, even if you tell me not to go, I will go by myself.
Bahya asks a question. In the Torah portion, Eliezer is sometimes called a servant and sometimes he is called a <i>man.</i> That is to say, important. The explanation is that at first, before he came to the well and had not yet seen the angel, he is called a servant. However, when Eliezer came to the well and saw that the angel was with him, Scripture called him a <i>man.</i> That is, he is important because the angel appeared to him. The angel is also called a <i>man.</i> Eliezer also received honor because of the angel. Therefore, as soon as Rebecca was given into the hands of Eliezer, the <i>mission</i> of the angel ended and Scripture again calls him servant, as the verse says, “<i>the servant brought out objects of silver and gold</i>” [24:53]; “<i>the servant took Rebecca</i>” [24:61].<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 24:15.</i>
“<i>The servant told Isaac</i>” [24:61]. This means, in his status as servant. That which Laban and his mother said, “<i>will you go with this man?</i>” [24:58]. This means, if you want to go with this man. He is called <i>man</i> in this verse. The explanation is that they were ashamed to call Eliezer, <i>servant</i>, to his <i>face.</i> Also, because of <i>Rebecca</i>’<i>s honor</i> the called him <i>man</i>, that is to say, important. Later Scripture says, “<i>she followed the man. So the servant took Rebecca</i>” [24:61].
Here the verse says that she followed the angel who is called <i>man</i>, and the servant took Rebecca and went.
“<i>Then Rebecca and her maids rose, mounted the camels, and followed the man. So the servant took Rebecca and went on his way</i>” [24:61]. <i>Ramban</i> writes. The verse means that Rebecca, her nurse, and the servant Eliezer, with his men, were told to go. Rebecca stood up and called her maids and they rode on the camels and followed the man, Eliezer. He showed them the way. One asks a question. What is the meaning of “<i>the servant took Rebecca</i>”? Why does he have to say that he took Rebecca when she was coming along? The explanation is that the women went behind Rebecca to see her off. When they came into the fields, Eliezer took Rebecca by the hand. He wanted to protect her very well and walked near her.<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban, Genesis, 24:61.</i>
“<i>And she followed the man</i>” [24:61]. This means, the angel, who is called man, went in the lead. And “<i>the servant took Rebecca</i>” [24:61]. This means, Eliezer was called servant.<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 24:15.</i>
“<i>Isaac had just come back from Beer-Lahai-roi</i>” [24:62]. Isaac came from the Garden of Eden. He had been there for three years to be healed, because his father had hurt him in his neck when he bound him in Mount <i>Moriah.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 24:63.</i>
“<i>Isaac went out walking in the field</i>” [24:63]. He prayed the afternoon prayer, before evening. He saw camels coming and Rebecca saw Isaac walking back and forth in the distance. She thought that he must be important.<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 24:63.</i>
<i>Rabbi Isserl</i> writes. Rebecca saw Isaac walking from a distance and Isaac appeared to be shy and fearful before the bride. He had seen Eliezer going with the bride. He was walking back and forth, and Rebecca remarked that one should be bashful before the bride. The custom is that the people run to the bride to see her. Therefore, Rebecca thought that this must be the groom and that is why she was bashful.<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Be</i>’<i>ure Maharai</i>, Genesis, 24:64.</i>
“<i>And she fell off the camel</i>” [24:64]. And she slid off the camel and her virginity was damaged out of fright. The deer of the [kosher] <i>animals</i> came and covered the blood. Thus, the Holy One commanded that the blood of the deer should be covered when they are slaughtered.<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">Ibn Shuaib, <i>Derashot</i>, <i>Hayyei Sarah</i>, I: 45.</i>
“<i>She said to the servant, who is that man walking in the field toward us? The servant said: that is my master</i>” [24:65]. Rebecca asked: who is he that is walking in the field? Eliezer responded: That is my master, Isaac. Rebecca immediately took her veil and covered herself. The <i>Toldot Yizhak</i> asks a question. Why did <i>Eliezer</i> now say, “<i>he is my master</i>”? This means, Isaac is my master. In the Torah portion until now, Eliezer said that Isaac was the son of his master, Abraham, but he did not call Isaac his master. The explanation is that because Isaac did not have a wife, he did not call him master. As soon as Rebecca came to Isaac, he began to call him master. When one is without a wife, he is not a master.<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Genesis, 24:65.</i>
“<i>Isaac brought Rebecca into the tent of his mother Sarah</i>” [24:67]. Isaac brought Rebecca into Sarah’s tent. It seemed to Isaac that this was Sarah’s tent and it was just like his mother Sarah was still alive. When Sarah was alive, there was a light in her tent that was lit from <i>Sabbath</i> to <i>Sabbath.</i> The blessing was in the dough that Sarah had made. A cloud stood over Sarah’s tent and as soon as Sarah died, these three things disappeared. As soon as Rebecca came, these three things returned. Thus, it appeared to Isaac that his mother was still alive.<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 24:67.</i>
<i>Ibn Shuaib</i> writes. Sarah came after her death into the tent of Rebecca to see the <i>joy</i> of her son Isaac.<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">Ibn Shuaib, <i>Derashot</i>, <i>Hayyei Sarah</i>, I: 45.</i>
“<i>Isaac found comfort after his mother</i>’<i>s death</i>” [24:67]. Isaac was comforted after his mother’s death.

“<i>Abraham took another wife</i>” [25:1]. <i>Bahya</i>, <i>Toldot Yizhak</i>, and <i>Hizkuni</i> write. From here we learn that when a person’s wife dies and he has children, he should not marry again until he marries off his children. If he would marry before he marries off his children, then his children will have to make bad <i>matches.</i> People will say that he will have children with the other wife and they will inherit everything. Therefore, Abraham first gave his son a wife, since it is not just that the old one should take a wife and the youth should be without a wife.<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 24:67; Toldot Yizhak, Genesis, 25:1; Hizkuni, Genesis, 25:1.</i>
“<i>Her name was Keturah</i>” [25:1]. Abraham took a wife who was called <i>Hagar</i>, his first <i>servant</i>, and had another name, and was called <i>Keturah.</i> This means, bound. That is to say, she did not allow any other man to sleep with her while she was separated from Abraham. Many kings and nobles wanted to take <i>Hagar</i> as a wife, since she was the daughter of <i>Pharaoh, king of Egypt.</i> She waited and took no man. She had many children with Abraham, but they were all of little <i>significance.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 25:1, 6.</i>
Bahya writes. <i>Keturah</i> was Hagar. That is why the verse says, “<i>Abraham again took a wife</i>” [25:1]. Abraham again took a wife. Why does it have to say <i>again,</i> but could say, <i>he took a wife.</i> The explanation is that it says <i>again</i> because he had her as a wife previously and he was taking her again.<sup class="footnote-marker">83</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 25:6.</i>
Another explanation is that it had to be Hagar, since how appropriate would it be that Abraham should give all of his money to Isaac and not give an inheritance to the children of Hagar, as the verse says, “<i>Abraham willed all that he owned to Isaac</i>” [25:5], and did not give to the children of Hagar. The <i>Talmud</i> says that one may not take away from one son and give it to another son, even from an evil one to a good son. They should inherit equally.<sup class="footnote-marker">84</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Baba Bathra,</i> 130a.</i> The explanation is that Hagar was the maid of Sarah and she was from <i>Egypt.</i> A <i>servant</i> and her children are equal in that the servant does not inherit.
Another explanation is that Hagar was called <i>Keturah</i> because her <i>deeds</i> were beautiful, like the <i>incense.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 25:1.</i> Even though <i>Rashi</i> writes above in the <i>Torah portion</i> that Hagar again returned to idol worship, but the explanation is that she again repented and that is why she was called Keturah.<sup class="footnote-marker">86</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 25:1.</i>
“<i>Abraham willed all that he owned to Isaac</i>” [25:5]. He gave Isaac a letter that he should inherit everything.<sup class="footnote-marker">87</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 24:10.</i> The plain meaning cannot be that Abraham would have given Isaac in his hand all of his goods during his lifetime. How could Abraham know that he would die first? Perhaps he would live longer. Then he would have to depend on Isaac, that he should feed him.
“<i>To Abraham</i>’<i>s sons by the concubines, Abraham gave gifts</i>” [25:6]. Abraham gave <i>gifts</i> to the children of the concubines. The Torah wrote the word <i>concubines</i> without a <i>yud.</i> This shows that he had only one concubine and she was called <i>Keturah.</i> Abraham took her because she was pious. <i>Rabbi</i><sup class="footnote-marker">88</sup><i class="footnote">Most likely, this is a printing mistake and it should say Rashi. In Hebrew the difference is changing the letter <i>bet</i> to <i>shin.</i> The context also supports this view.</i> asks a question. Why does the verse call her wife, as the verse says, “<i>he took a wife</i>” [25:1]. Later Scripture calls her a <i>concubine.</i> This means, a concubine. The explanation is that a concubine has no <i>marriage contract</i>, but Hagar did have a marriage contract, but she was like a concubine. That is why the verse calls her a <i>wife</i>, that is to say, an important woman. For her children to inherit, she was like a concubine.<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 25:6.</i>
<i>Rashi</i> asks another question. If Abraham had given everything to Isaac, what presents did he give to the children of the concubines? The explanation is that he gave them an <i>impure name.</i> That is, he taught them the names of <i>demons and magic.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">90</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid.</i>
Another explanation of <i>impure name</i> is that Abraham taught them to be able to utilize the <i>name</i> even when they were <i>impure</i>, since they did not maintain a state of purity.<sup class="footnote-marker">91</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 25:6.</i>
<i>Debek Tov</i> asks a question. Why did Abraham do this? The explanation is that Abraham knew well that they would come among the nations and they would <i>worship idols.</i> That is why he taught them the name of the Holy One. Even when they will be <i>impure</i>, they should not commit sins.<sup class="footnote-marker">92</sup><i class="footnote">Devek Tov, Genesis 25:6, note 30.</i>
<i>Rashi</i> asks a question. Abraham had given a letter to Isaac that he would inherit everything when Eliezer went for Rebecca. Why did he give it again here? <i>Rabbi Nehemiah</i> gives an explanation. He gave the blessings into his hands. He should bless whomever he wants and whomever he will bless will be blessed.<sup class="footnote-marker">93</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 25:5.</i>
“<i>Old and contented</i>” [25:8]. Abraham died old and contented. <i>Bahya</i> asks a question here. Why does the verse not say, <i>full of years.</i> This means, with many years and many days. The explanation is that Abraham did not go after the <i>desires of the world</i> that he should have desired to have an excess of money. Many die who do not have half the money that is enough. If he would have ten thousand gulden, then he would desire twenty thousand gulden, as the verse says, “<i>a lover of money never has his fill of money</i>” [Ecclesiastes 5:9]. One who loves silver is never satisfied. Our sages said: “<i>no person leaves the world with half of his desires gratified.</i>”<sup class="footnote-marker">94</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ecclesiastes Rabbah,</i> 1.13.</i> That is why the verse says about Abraham that he was content with everything. He was satisfied.<sup class="footnote-marker">95</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 25:8.</i>
“<i>Isaac and Ishmael buried him</i>” [25:9]. Here one asks a question. Why does the verse name Isaac first? He was younger than Ishmael. <i>Ramban</i> and <i>Bahya</i> write the explanation. This teaches us that Ishmael repented and honored Isaac with going first, because Isaac was more righteous than Ishmael. Thus, Ishmael honored him. If Ishmael had not repented, God would not have allowed him to come to bury Abraham, because he was an evildoer.<sup class="footnote-marker">96</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban, Genesis, 25:9; Bahya, Genesis, 25:9.</i>
“<i>Abraham breathed his last and died</i>” [25:8]. He died. The word, <i>geviah</i>, means died easily, without anguish, and quickly. This is only written about the righteous. So says Rashi.<sup class="footnote-marker">97</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 25:17.</i> Here one asks a question. <i>Geviah</i> is written about those who died in the Flood. <i>Toldot Yizhak</i> gives an explanation. <i>Geviah</i> is written concerning the evildoers; because of their evil they die quickly and cannot leave a <i>will</i> for their children, like the <i>generation of the Flood</i>, which perished quickly. Concerning the righteous, geviah is also written, for their benefit, that they die quickly without anguish, but they make a will beforehand.<sup class="footnote-marker">98</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Genesis, 25:17.</i>
“<i>After the death of Abraham, God blessed Isaac</i>” [25:11]. The Holy One blessed Isaac with the <i>blessing</i> of the <i>mourners</i>, to comfort him. Another explanation is that Abraham did not give the blessing into the hands of Isaac because he saw that the <i>evil Esau</i> would come from Isaac. Abraham said: let the Holy One come and let Him do with Isaac what He will.<sup class="footnote-marker">99</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 25:11.</i>

Toldot

“<i>This is the story of Isaac</i>” [25:19]. These are the births of Isaac. That is to say, the children that will be discussed later in the Torah portion. These are Jacob and Esau.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 25:19.</i>
“<i>Isaac, son of Abraham. Abraham begot Isaac</i>” [25:19]. Here one asks a question. Why does it have to say that Isaac was the son of Abraham and that Abraham gave birth to Isaac. It is obvious; if he was his son, then he gave birth to him. The explanation is that the verse tells us that people said that Sarah became pregnant through Abimelech and gave birth to Isaac. Because Sarah became pregnant from Abimelech is why Isaac had one son, Jacob, who was righteous and took after Sarah, who was <i>righteous.</i> Esau took after Abimelech, who was an evildoer. That is why in the Torah portion where Esau and Jacob were born, people said that it must be true that Abimelech had slept with Sarah, since half of Isaac took after Sarah and half after Abimelech. That is why his offspring are also half good and half evil. That is why the Holy One caused that the appearance of Isaac was like the appearance of Abraham. Thus, they testified that Abraham had given birth to Isaac.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 25:19; Devek Tov, Genesis, 25:19, note 1.</i>
<i>Toldot Yizhak</i> asks a question. The custom is that when one has illicit sexual relations with a woman, she is afraid at the time that her husband should not come, and her thoughts are on her husband. The child that she will have with that <i>adulterer</i> will look like her husband. So what did it help that Isaac looked like Abraham? They would say that Sarah slept with Abimelech and that is why Isaac looks like Abraham. This is the custom among those who engage in adultery.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Genesis, 25:19–26.</i>
However, <i>Devek Tov</i> gives an explanation. A woman who engages in <i>adultery</i> willingly is very worried about her proper husband that he should not come. She thinks about her husband and that is why the child looks like the proper husband. However, Sarah was not afraid, since the whole world knew that she was taken by force to Abimelech. Sarah was not afraid of Abraham since she was taken by force. When Isaac looked like Abraham, they would not say that she had relations, and that is why Isaac looked like Abraham. Sarah did not need to be afraid, since Abraham knew about it.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Devek Tov, Genesis, 25:19, note 1.</i>
<i>Hizkuni</i> writes. “<i>Abraham begot Isaac</i>” [25:19]. That is to say, He called him Abraham with the <i>heh.</i> This was when he circumcised himself and after that time Isaac was born, unlike <i>Ishmael</i> who was born when Abraham was uncircumcised. The verse says that Isaac was worthier, since he was born kosher and not from someone uncircumcised. <i>Toldot Yizhak</i> writes this explicitly.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">This explanation is actually found in Toldot Yizhak, Genesis, 25:19–26 and not in Hizkuni.</i>
“<i>Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebecca</i>” [25:20]. Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebecca to wife. <i>Rashi</i> asks a question here. How is it Isaac should go for so long without a wife? Our sages said that one should marry at eighteen. <i>Rashi</i> asks another question. What does the verse teach us that Isaac was forty years old? The explanation is that he could not take a wife before the age of forty. He had to wait until Rebecca was three years old, when she was appropriate for him to sleep with her.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 25:20.</i> Isaac could not take a kosher wife except Rebecca, who was his wife from God. Therefore, the verse tells us that he was forty years old. That is, he waited until Rebecca was ready for him to sleep with her. From here we learn that anyone who lies with his sister or someone who is not permitted to him and she is three years old, he has committed a sin, since when she is three years old, she is a proper woman.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">I could not find this discussion in the Toldot Yizhak.</i>
“<i>Daughter of Bethuel the Aramean of Paddan-aram, sister of Laban</i>” [25:20]. Here <i>Rashi</i> asks a question. Why does the verse have to say that Rebecca was the daughter of Bethuel and the sister of Laban? We already know this. The explanation is that the verse says another time that Rebecca was Bethuel’s daughter and the sister of Laban because they were both evildoers, just like Rebecca was pious and did not learn from the deeds of the evildoers.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 25:20.</i>
“<i>On behalf of his wife</i>” [25:21]. Isaac prayed opposite his wife. That is to say, Isaac stood in one corner and prayed and Rebecca, his wife, stood in the other corner and prayed.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 25:21.</i>
“<i>The Lord responded to him</i>” [25:21]. The Holy One accepted Isaac’s prayers. He was a righteous person and the son of a righteous person. However, Rebecca was a righteous woman and her father was an evildoer.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid.</i>
“<i>The children struggled in her womb</i>” [25:22]. The children struggled in her womb. <i>Jacob and Esau</i> argued in their mother’s body. When Rebecca walked past the door of a <i>house of study</i>, Jacob wanted to get out. When Rebecca passed the door of a <i>place of idol worship</i>, Esau wanted to get out and the two <i>nations</i> struggled with each other. Rebecca said: if it is such a great trouble to be pregnant, why did I ask to have children.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 25:22.</i>
“<i>She went to inquire of the Lord</i>” [25:22]. Rebecca went to ask of God why the children were struggling? Here <i>Rashi</i> asks a question. Where did she go to inquire? The explanation is that she went to the <i>house of study</i> and asked <i>Shem</i>, who was the <i>rabbi</i> that he should tell her. He told Rebecca: you will have two important children, as it is written, “<i>two nations are in your womb</i>” [25:23]. This means, two lords will come from you. That is, from Jacob will come <i>Rabbi</i> [Judah the Prince], who will be as important as a king. From Esau will come <i>Antoninus</i>, the king of Esau.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 25:23. Esau is identified with Rome in Rabbinic literature. Antoninus was an emperor of Rome.</i>
<i>Bahya</i> writes. <i>Antoninus</i> was a great king of Esau and studied Torah from Rabbi [Judah the Prince] secretly, and was very afraid that his servants and ministers should not learn about this. The Talmud in [tractate] <i>Avodah Zarah</i><sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Avodah Zarah,</i> 10b.</i> says that there was a large cave under the earth. King Antoninus could easily go from his castle to the house of Rabbi [Judah] through that cave. Every day the king went to study <i>Torah</i> with <i>Rabbi</i> [Judah] through that cave under the earth and took along two servants. The king placed one at the door of his house, and the other one he put at the door of Rabbi [Judah’s] house. He did this every day. He told them that no person should come to Rabbi [Judah] when he would come. Once the king came to Rabbi [Judah] and found <i>Rabbi Haninah</i> sitting before Rabbi [Judah]. The king said: I asked you that no person should be here when I came. Rabbi [Judah] responded: this is not a person. The king said: if this is not a person, let him go and call in the one who is sleeping at the door. <i>Rabbi Haninah</i> went and found that the one at the door had been killed. <i>Rabbi Haninah</i> thought; what should I do? Should I tell him that he had been killed? One does not tell bad news easily. If I will go away, then it is <i>degrading</i> to the king that I would not answer him. He prayed and brought him back to life and sent him to the king. The king said: I know well that every Israelite can bring someone back to life. Nonetheless, I ask you, let no person be with you when I come to you. The king served Rabbi [Judah]; he poured his cup and stood before him like a servant. When Rabbi [Judah] wanted to sleep in his bed, the king bowed down to the earth before the bed so that Rabbi [Judah] would step on him, to more easily let him get into his bed. Rabbi [Judah] said: you are a king and it is not just that a king should do this. The king responded: I wish that I would be the bed under you in the next world. He asked Rabbi [Judah]: will I come to the <i>World to Come?</i> Rabbi [Judah] answered him: you will come. The king said: the verse says, “<i>no survivor shall be left of the House of Esau</i>” [Obadiah 1:18]. Rabbi [Judah] responded: whoever does the <i>deeds of Esau.</i> He asked: the verse says, “<i>Edom is there, her kings and all her chieftains</i>” [Ezekiel 32:29]. There in <i>Gehenna</i> is <i>Edom</i>, the king and his ministers. Rabbi [Judah] answered: except for <i>Antoninus</i> and <i>Ketia the son of Shalom</i>, who will not come to Gehenna.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 25:22.</i>
<i>Rashi</i> writes. Good food that aids digestion, like lettuce and radish, was never absent from the table of <i>Rabbi</i> [Judah]. These always used to be at the king’s table.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 25:23.</i> That is to say, Rabbi [Judah] did not desire <i>delicacies</i>, but he was so wealthy and had so many servants in his household that there was much cooking and there was enough that his household had lettuce and radish with which to rejoice. This was the custom among <i>ministers and kings.</i> However, Rabbi [Judah] before he died, he raised his ten fingers toward heaven and said: <i>Lord of the Universe</i>, I had no pleasure from this world, even with my small finger.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 25:22.</i>
“<i>When her time to give birth was at hand, there were twins in her womb</i>” [25:24]. The nine <i>months</i> of pregnancy ended and there were twins in her womb. <i>Toldot Yizhak</i> writes. Why did Isaac not <i>pray</i> immediately for Rebecca and waited for ten years? The explanation is that he prayed immediately. The Holy One said: it would be good if the evildoer should not be immediately born into this world. Rebecca said: if an evildoer is to be born, let him not be born immediately. That is why it is written, “<i>When her time to give birth was at hand.</i>” The nine months had been completed. That is, the Holy One caused the evildoer to tarry in his mother’s womb, that he should not leave early. However, <i>Moses Our Teacher</i>, <i>the righteous one</i>, left his mother’s womb when he was only six <i>months</i> and several days in his mother’s womb.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Genesis, 25:19–26.</i>
That is why it is written, “<i>there were twins</i>” [25:24], without an <i>aleph</i>, because one was an evildoer and the other one was righteous. However, concerning <i>Tamar</i>, they were both righteous, <i>Peretz and Zerach.</i> Therefore, it is written concerning <i>Tamar</i>, <i>twins</i>, with an <i>aleph.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 25:24.</i>
Some ask why Rebecca did not ask Isaac, what is the meaning of the children struggling with each other, since Isaac was also a prophet? The explanation is that Rebecca did not want to say that she was having trouble with her pregnancy. Isaac would say that she had more anguish than other women because she had more sins than other women and Isaac would <i>divorce</i> her. Therefore, she did not want to tell him.
“<i>The first one emerged red</i>” [25:25]. The first one came out red and was full of hair and they called him, Esau, because he was hairy. Then his brother emerged and his hand grabbed his brother’s heel. They called him Jacob, because he grabbed the heel. Jacob had held on to Esau so that he should not emerge first. Jacob was Isaac’s firstborn. He was the first drop of Isaac. A parable. If some one puts two small stones into a pipe that is tight, the stones follow each other and the one that was put in first into the pipe will emerge last. So too, Jacob was first into the mother’s womb and therefore he emerged last.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 25:26.</i>
<i>Imre Noam</i> writes. Esau destroyed his mother’s womb when he went out first violently. That is why he was red, smeared with blood. However, Jacob had mercy for his mother, even in the womb. He said: I will hold on to Esau’s foot in the hope that I will go out together with him. My mother’s womb should not be damaged for my sake. <sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Imre Noam, Genesis, 25:26.</i>
“<i>Isaac was sixty years old when they were born</i>” [25:26]. Isaac was sixty years old when Jacob and Esau were born. <i>Rashi</i> asks a question. Why did <i>Isaac</i> wait for twenty years and prayed after twenty years. One prays after ten years when one’s wife does not have children. The explanation is that Isaac first waited until Rebecca was thirteen years old when she could have children. From thirteen years, he waited another ten years, as is the custom to wait when a woman has no children and then one prays.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 25:26.</i>
“<i>When the boys grew up, Esau became a skillful hunter</i>” [25:27]. It cannot be recognized when people are children if they will become pious or evil. However, when they became thirteen years old, Esau went to the <i>house of idols</i> and Jacob went to the <i>house of study.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 25:27.</i>
“<i>A skillful hunter</i>” [25:27]. Esau was a deceiver and he deceived people with his mouth. He asked his father how one tithed salt and straw. Isaac thought that Esau was very pious. He even tithed salt and straw.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid.</i>
“<i>Jacob was a mild man who stayed in camp</i>” [25:27]. Jacob was not a scoundrel and he could not deceive. He studied Torah day and night. Isaac loved Esau because he brought him meat from the hunt, and Rebecca loved Jacob.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 25:27–28.</i>
“<i>Jacob was cooking a stew</i>” [25:29]. Jacob was cooking lentils and Esau was very tired. He had committed many murders that day. Esau said to Jacob: feed me the red lentils since I am very hungry. That is why he was called Edom. He was cooking lentils because they were mourning. Abraham had died on that day, in the hope that Abraham should not see that his grandson Esau had committed many sins and <i>worshipped idols.</i> Therefore, the Holy One let him die five years before his time. That was why lentils were being cooked. When someone dies, just like a lentil is round, so too death goes around and wanders from one person to the other person.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 25:29–30.</i>
Esau committed five sins on that day. He slept with a bride who was married to her groom. He killed a person. He denied the resurrection of the dead. He denied the Holy One, and he shamed the birthright.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 25:29.</i>
“<i>Esau said, I am at the point of death, so what use is my birthright to me?</i>” [25:32]. Jacob said: sell it to me, as clear and certain is the day, so certainly sell me your <i>birthright.</i> Jacob said: it is not just that the evildoer Esau should bring the offerings, because the <i>offering of sacrifices</i> was done by the <i>firstborn.</i> Esau said to Jacob: a person can be killed through the <i>offering of sacrifices</i>, like when he goes bareheaded or when he is drunk and brings his offerings, he is <i>worthy of the death penalty.</i> Therefore, Esau said: I do not want the birthright.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 25:32.</i>
<i>Bahya</i> writes. Esau said: what will the birthright do for me? The custom was in ancient times that after the father’s death, the <i>firstborn</i> had great honor from the other children and sat in his father’s place. Esau said: what good is the honor if I have to wait for the honor to come only after my father’s death. Who knows who will die first, particularly since I go every day to hunt <i>wild animals</i> that might kill me first?<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 25:31.</i>
“<i>There was a famine in the land</i> … <i>the Lord had appeared to him and said, do not go down to Egypt</i>” [26:1–2]. There was a famine in the land and Isaac went to <i>Abimelech</i>, king of the <i>Philistines</i>, in <i>Gerar.</i> The Holy One appeared to Isaac and said to him, do not go to <i>Egypt.</i> You are not like your father who went to <i>Egypt</i> out of hunger, but you were a <i>sacrifice</i> on the altar. Therefore, you should not go to <i>Egypt</i>, which is <i>outside the land of Israel.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 26:2.</i>
“<i>Reside in this land</i>” [26:3]. Remain in this land, as this land will be your children’s. I will bless your descendants like the stars of the sky, because your father Abraham was pious.
“<i>Inasmuch as Abraham obeyed Me</i>” [26:5]. Our sages learn from here that Abraham was three years old when he recognized the Holy One. Abraham lived for one hundred and seventy-five years and <i>ekev</i> has the numerical value of one hundred and seventy-two. That is to say, for one hundred and seventytwo years Abraham recognized the Holy One, minus the three years that he did not recognize God. He was a child of three years. Abraham observed the whole Torah on his own before the Torah was given. Bahya asks a question. The <i>Patriarchs</i> observed the whole Torah, so why did Jacob marry two sisters? The Torah forbade this, or why did <i>Amram</i> marry his aunt and the Torah forbade this? The Ramban gives an explanation. The primary aspect of fulfilling the commandments was in <i>the land of Israel.</i> Therefore, Jacob married two sisters <i>outside the land</i>, and Amram married his aunt <i>outside the land.</i> Joseph observed the Sabbath in Egypt even though he was <i>outside the land.</i> This is because the Sabbath is the greatest commandment in the Torah. It was compared to the whole Torah.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 26:5.</i> The <i>Toldot Yizhak</i> also writes this.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Genesis, 26:5.</i>
Rabbi Isserl gives another explanation. Jacob married two sisters because Jacob thought that the <i>reason</i> was that one is not allowed to marry two sisters, because when a person has two wives, there is jealousy and hatred between them. Therefore, the Torah forbade marrying two sisters. However, Jacob thought, I know well that there would be no jealousy or hatred between them.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Be’ure Maharai, Genesis, 26:5.</i>
Amram married his aunt. He thought that one is not allowed to marry her is because he was not allowed to hit his wife and it is customary for the husband to hit his wife. However, a woman can marry her uncle because if the uncle would hit his wife, it is no transgression. <i>Amram</i> thought, I will not hit my aunt and therefore I can marry her.
“<i>Isaac stayed in Gerar</i>” [26:6]. Isaac stayed in Gerar and the people of the city asked about Rebecca. Who was she? He said: she is my sister. She was very beautiful and he feared that they would take her and kill him.
“<i>When some time had passed, Abimelech looked out</i>” [26:8]. Isaac had been in Gerar for a number of days and the king was looking through his window and saw Isaac playing with Rebecca, his wife. Here one asks a question. How is it possible that Isaac should lie with his wife publicly, that the king should have seen that, and particularly during the day? Another question. Why does Scripture have to say that he saw it through the window? The explanation is that Isaac closed the window during the day and slept with Rebecca. Thus, the king asked, what is it that Isaac closed the window during the day? He must be sleeping with his wife. Another question is asked. How was Isaac allowed to sleep with Rebecca; there was a famine? The explanation is that there was no famine where Isaac lived.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 26:8.</i>
“<i>Abimelech said, what have you done to us</i>” [26:10]. <i>Abimelech</i> said: what have you done to us that you said she is your sister? Perhaps someone had slept with Rebecca? Abimelech immediately commanded that whoever would touch Isaac and his wife should be put to death. <i>Toldot Yizhak</i> asks a question here. Why did Abimelech say to Isaac: what have you done to us? <i>Pharaoh</i> said to Abraham: what have you done to me, alone? Concerning Abimelech, it is written, “<i>what have you done to us</i>” [25:10]. This means, what have you done to us? The explanation is that Pharaoh said that all the Egyptians engaged in illicit sexual relations. Therefore, I am not upset that you consider my people to be evildoers. If you had said that she was your wife, they would still try to have sexual relations with her. However, with regard to me, Pharaoh said, you are unjust, that you should say that she is your sister. I would have slept with her. If you had said that she is your wife, I would not have touched her. Abimelech said to Isaac: my people and I are righteous. Therefore, what have you done to us? You have done ill to us. If you had told us that she was your wife, we would not have touched her. However, Abimelech ordered them to announce that whoever would touch her would be put to death, and they all became fearful.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Genesis, 26:10 –11.</i>
<i>Ramban</i> asks a question. Did <i>Abimelech</i> not see that Isaac had two children with him, Jacob and Esau? How could <i>Abimelech</i> not know that Rebecca was his wife? The explanation is that he thought that Isaac had the children with another wife.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban, Genesis, 26:7.</i>
“<i>Isaac sowed in that land and reaped a hundredfold</i>” [26:12]. Isaac sowed the same field and had a hundred measures of grain. <i>Rashi</i> asks a question. How is it appropriate that one counted the blessing? It is not like counting something or measuring it. The explanation is that it was counted because they wanted to give a tithe and they counted it to know how much to tithe. From the merit that one gave a tithe, the blessing came that from one measure came a hundred measures.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 26:12.</i>
“<i>He grew richer and richer until he was very wealthy</i>” [26:13]. Isaac was so rich that it was said that the manure of his mules was worth more money every year than the gold and silver of Abimelech.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 26:13.</i>
One asks a question. Why did the people say that the manure from his mules and not from other animals? The explanation is that this was a novelty. No blessing came from mules, but from the mules of Isaac a blessing came to Isaac, more than the silver of Abimelech.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Devek Tov, Genesis, 26:13, note 6.</i>
“<i>The Philistines stopped up the wells, filling them with dirt</i>” [26:15]. The Philistines stopped up all the wells that Abraham had dug. They said: when a people will come to besiege the city, they will not have any water and will have to leave the city. Therefore, they stopped up all the wells.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 26:15.</i> Isaac dug them again and the Philistines stopped them up again. Later, he found a well and called it <i>living waters</i>, that is spring water. The shepherds of Abimelech argued about that well. Isaac called it, <i>esek</i> that is to say, war. Isaac dug another well and called it <i>sitna</i>, that is to say enmity. The third time he found a well that they did not fight over and he called it, <i>rehovot</i>, that is to say expansion.
“<i>From there he went up to Beer Sheva. The Lord appeared to him</i>” [26:23–24]. Isaac went up to <i>Beer Sheva.</i> The Holy One appeared to him and said to him. Do not fear; I am with you. I will bless you and your children and will increase them, for the sake of my servant Abraham. Isaac built an altar and praised God. He erected his tent and dug a well. Abimelech went with his ministers to Isaac. Isaac said: why are you coming here? You are hostile to me and have driven me away from you. Abimelech responded: we have seen many miracles by your father and also by you, and they made peace with him.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 26:28.</i>
“<i>When Esau was forty years old, he took a wife</i>” [26:34]. Esau was just like a pig that sticks out its foot and shows it, that is to say, I am also kosher like an ox or a cow; they have cloven hooves on their feet. The pig also has cloven hooves, but the pig does not <i>chew its cud.</i> That means, it does not regurgitate its food from its stomach. So too, Esau said: I want to compare myself to my father Isaac who took a wife at forty years; I will also take a wife at forty years old. Until forty, he took women from their husbands by force, and now he made himself out to be righteous.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 26:34.</i>
“<i>Judith the daughter of Beeri</i>” [26:34]. He married wives from the nations and gave them Jewish names. That is to say, he had pious wives, but they were all sinners as was Esau himself. Isaac and Rebecca were not happy with these wives.
“<i>His eyes became dim</i>” [27:1]. Isaac’s eyes became dark. Bahya writes about the midrash that Isaac became blind because he took bribes from Esau, as the verse says, “<i>bribes blind the eyes</i>” [Deuteronomy, 16:19]. Bribery makes blind. Another explanation for why he became blind was so that Isaac should not recognize Jacob and should bless him. Another explanation for why he became blind was that the smoke that Esau’s wives made before their <i>idols</i> destroyed his eyes. Isaac was not used to this, but Rebecca was used to this smoke because Laban did it before his idols. Another explanation why he became blind was that he would not walk in the streets, so that people should not curse Isaac, since he had an evildoer [as a son]. From here our sages learned that whoever has a son or a disciple that is an evildoer, the father or the teacher becomes blind. Another explanation is that Isaac was blind because when he was bound on the altar he saw the <i>Shekhinah</i> and that is why he became blind.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 27:1.</i>
“<i>I am old now and I do not know how soon I may die</i>” [27:2]. Isaac said to Esau: I am very old. I do not know when I will die. <i>Hizkuni</i> writes. Isaac said to Esau. When I will die, you will not have the money and the leadership and the respect, because you sold your birthright. Therefore, I will give you during my lifetime. Then Jacob will not be able to take it away from you.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 27:2.</i>
<i>Rashi</i> writes. “<i>I do not know how soon I may die</i>” [27:2]. This means that when a person comes to the age of their father or mother, he should be afraid that he should not die [at the age] his mother or father died.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 27:2.</i>
“<i>Take your gear, your quiver and bow, go out into the open and hunt me some game</i>” [27:3]. Take your utensils and your sword and hunt some game. That is why Isaac said: sharpen your knife so that there should not be any nicks in your knife, in the hope that I will not eat <i>improperly killed</i> meat.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 27:3.</i>
<i>Hizkuni</i> asks a question and <i>Imre Noam</i> also asks this question. How did Isaac eat what Esau had slaughtered? He was an apostate and if Isaac did not know that Esau was an apostate, then this is difficult. Also, how is it appropriate that God should cause such a righteous person to eat non-kosher meat? The Holy One watched over the animals of the <i>righteous</i> that they should not eat what they should not eat. How could God not watch over the righteous person himself? The explanation is that from the time that Esau became an <i>idol worshiper</i>, the Holy One protected Isaac so that he did not eat what Esau slaughtered. This time, when Isaac desired that Esau should bring him game that he slaughtered, to eat, the Holy One protected Isaac that he should not eat from what he slaughtered. Rather, the Holy One sent Jacob who brought two goats that Isaac ate. The Holy One had protected the righteous person that he did not commit a sin, and did not eat non-kosher food.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 27:3; Imre Noam, Genesis, 27:3.</i>
<i>Ba</i>’<i>al ha-Turim</i> writes. “<i>Hunt me some game</i>” [27:3], is written in the Torah with an extra <i>heh.</i> It shows us that Isaac ordered Esau that he should be careful about the five things that a slaughterer must know: <i>interrupting, tearing, thrusting, moving the knife, and plucking.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">Ba’al ha-Turim, Genesis, 27:3. These five things, if done, would make the animal being slaughtered non-kosher.</i>
“<i>Bring it to me to eat</i>” [27:4]. Isaac said: bring me something good to eat and I will bless you. Hizkuni writes. You Esau sold your birthright for the sake of food. I will bless you and give you back your rulership through eating.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 27:4.</i>
Bahya writes. Isaac said: bring me food so that I will be happy and through joy I will be able to bless you. Our sages said that prophecy does not rest on a person when he is sad, but only when he is full of joy. <i>Bahya</i> asks a question here. Why did he desire to eat in order to be happy? Why did he not desire harps or violins to make him joyous as other prophets used to do when they were sad? The explanation is that Isaac wanted to be happy through the thing with which he would bless Esau, since the blessing of Esau was, “<i>of the dew of heaven and the fat of the earth, abundance of new grain and wine</i>” [27:28].<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 27:4.</i> This means, from the dew of heaven, oil, wheat and wine.
“<i>Esau had gone out into the open to hunt game to bring home</i>” [27:5]. Esau though that he would hunt <i>game</i> in the field. However, if he could not find any <i>game</i>, Esau thought he would steal some cattle, in any event, something to eat.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 27:5.</i>
Rebecca said to Jacob: your father desires food from Esau and wants to bless him. You go to the herd and take two good goats. I will make good food for your father that he loves, in the hope that he will bless you. <i>Rashi</i> asks a question here. Why did Rebecca say, “<i>take for me</i>” [27:9]? This means, take for me. That is to day, Rebecca said: take from my goats, since Isaac had written into the marriage contract for Rebecca, to give her two goats every day.<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 27:9.</i>
“<i>Esau is a hairy man and I am smooth skinned</i>” [27:11]. Jacob said to his mother: Esau is hairy and I am smooth skinned. Perhaps my father will touch me and will recognize that I am not Esau and will curse me?
“<i>His mother said to him, your curse, my son, is upon me</i>” [27:13]. Rebecca said: your curse should be upon me. <i>Hizkuni</i> writes. We do not have to be afraid since the Holy One had said: “<i>the older shall serve the younger</i>” [25:23]. This means, the older one will serve the younger one. That is to say, Esau is the older one who will serve Jacob. <i>Hizkuni</i> gives another explanation. Rebecca said: Isaac will think that I gave you the advice, because I am accustomed to everything concerning Isaac. Thus, I must have heard from Isaac how he wants to bless Esau. Therefore, Isaac will curse me. <i>Hizkuni</i> gives another explanation. “<i>Your curse be upon me.</i>” I should justly curse you because you do not want to obey me to go to your father to take your <i>blessing.</i> However, Isaac will not curse you because you have done good and brought him good things to eat.<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 27:13.</i>
<i>Imre Noam</i> also gives these explanations and gives another explanation. “<i>Your curse be upon me.</i>” That is to say, if your father will not want to allow you to inherit, I will give you my marriage contract. I will fulfill for you that you will have enough.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">Imre Noam, Genesis, 27:13.</i>
Rebecca took Esau’s clothes that he used to wear when he went out to the field. She dressed Jacob and Rebecca laid the hide of the goats on Jacob’s throat and hands, that Isaac should think that it is Esau. Esau had given the clothes to Rebecca to hold, even though he had many wives. He did not want to trust the clothes to his wives. He knew that they were all promiscuous.<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 27:15.</i> Jacob came with the good food to Isaac, his father.
Isaac asked: who are you my son? “<i>Jacob said, I am Esau, your firstborn</i>” [27:19]. <i>Ibn Shuaib</i> writes. Jacob, the righteous one, had no intention to go and lie to his father. He cried and did not want to make food, but his mother made the food herself, as the verse says, “<i>his mother prepared</i>” [27:14]. Afterwards, he did not want to take the food, until his mother forcefully put the food in his hands. He did not want to go. Rebecca said: the <i>angels</i> will be with you there, before your father. When he came to the door, Jacob became faint. The <i>Holy One</i> sent him <i>Michael</i> and <i>Gabriel</i> and led him by both hands before his father, Isaac. Rebecca did not give Jacob wine, because she did not want to show red before Isaac, at the blessing of Jacob. Esau is called Edom, which means red. <i>Michael</i> brought wine from the <i>Garden of Eden.</i> When Jacob went out the door, Esau came to the door and <i>Michael</i> hid Jacob, so Esau did not see Jacob. The Holy One did this, because Esau had previously sold the <i>birthright</i> in the expectation that Jacob should be able to take the blessings. Now, he said, “<i>I am Esau your firstborn.</i>” That is to say, Isaac asked Jacob, who are you? He said: I am Esau, your firstborn. That is to say, he did not lie. He was the substitute for Esau who had sold him the <i>birthright.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">Ibn Shuaib, <i>Derashot</i>, I: 49–50.</i>
<i>Bahya</i> and <i>Hizkuni</i> write that Jacob told no lie when Jacob said, “I have done as you told me” [27:19]. This means, Jacob said: I have done as you have told me to do.<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 27:19; Hizkuni, Genesis, 27:19.</i>
<i>Bahya</i> asks here: Did Jacob lie? Isaac did not order Jacob. The explanation is that Jacob said: as you said for my sake. That is, as you said that food should be brought to you. Rebecca heard this and told me to bring it.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 27:19.</i>
<i>Rashi</i> gives an explanation. Jacob did not lie when he said <i>I</i>, I am who I am, but Esau is your <i>firstborn.</i> I have done what you have asked. That is to say, I have done many times what you have asked.<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 27:19.</i>
<i>Hizkuni</i> writes. One is sometimes allowed to lie when it is necessary. As when Abraham said, Sarah was his sister and not his wife. We also find many <i>prophets</i> who something other than the <i>truth.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 27:19.</i>
“<i>He said, because the Lord your God granted me good fortune</i>” [27:20]. Isaac asked Jacob. Why have you come back so quickly from the field? He said: the Holy One prepared it for me as soon as I came. In these words Isaac noticed something, that this couldn’t be Esau, because he mentioned the <i>name of God.</i> Esau never mentioned the name of the Holy One.<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 27:21.</i>
One asks a question. Isaac considered Esau to be righteous, so what kind of novelty is it that he mentioned the name of God all the time? A righteous person would always mention the name of the Holy One. The explanation is that Isaac considered Esau to be righteous. Since he often went into the field and in unclean places, he became unaccustomed to think about the name of the Holy One all the time, even at home. Therefore, Isaac thought that because he said, “<i>because the Lord your God granted me good fortune</i>” [27:20]. This means, the Holy One caught it for me. This must certainly be Jacob, since Jacob does not go to unclean places and he must certainly remember the name of the Holy One.<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">Devek Tov, Genesis, 27:25, note 5.</i>
“<i>He felt him and he said, the voice is the voice of Jacob and the hands are the hands of Esau</i>” [27:22]. Isaac touched Jacob. Isaac said: the <i>voice</i> is the <i>voice</i> of Jacob and the hands are the hands of Esau. He thought that this must be Jacob because he speaks very quietly and not haughtily. However, Esau speaks with haughty words.<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 27:22.</i>
The Midrash says. Jacob will war in the <i>exile</i> with the <i>voice</i> of prayer and Torah, as the verse says, “<i>the voice is the voice of Jacob and the hands are the hands of Esau</i>” [27:22]. That is to say, when Esau will do something with his hands to <i>Israel</i>, <i>Israel</i> will war with their voices.<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Genesis Rabbah,</i> 65.16; Bahya, Genesis, 27:22.</i>
<i>Hizkuni</i> writes. Isaac could not properly understand his voice. Sometimes a person can speak thinly and sometimes his voice is very thick. However, from the hands he understood that this must be Esau because they were full of hair. Therefore, he blessed him.<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 27:22.</i>
“<i>He brought him wine and he drank</i>” [27:25]. <i>Hizkuni</i> writes. Wine <i>confuses</i> a person and therefore Isaac could not properly recognize Jacob.<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 27:25.</i>
“<i>He smelled the scent of his clothes</i>” [27:27]. Isaac smelled the scent of his garments, a very fine scent. <i>Rashi</i> asks. The goat’s hide stinks badly, so how did it have a very fine scent? The explanation is that Jacob had Esau’s garments. He took the garments from <i>Adam</i>, who wore these same garments in the <i>Garden of Eden.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 27:27.</i> These garments had a nice scent from the <i>Garden of Eden.</i> All the animals were depicted on these garments and when Esau went out into the field with these garments, all the animals came running to these garments and he caught those that he wanted.<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Pirke de Rabbi Eliezer</i>, chap. 24.</i>
“<i>Let your mother</i>’<i>s sons bow to you</i>” [27:29]. The children of your mother will bow down to you. The <i>Devek Tov</i> asks a question here. They had a father; why did it not say the children of your father? <i>Hizkuni</i> gives an explanation. Isaac thought: Rebecca is still young. She would take another husband after his death and would have children. That is why Isaac says in the blessing, all of your mother’s children should bow down to you, even those that she will have with another husband.<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 27:29; Devek Tov, Genesis, 27:29, note 9.</i>
“<i>Cursed be they who curse you, blessed be they who bless you</i>” [27:29]. Whoever curses you shall be cursed, and the one who blesses you will be blessed. <i>Rashi</i> asks a question here. Concerning Balaam, it is written first, the one who blesses you will be blessed, and then the one who curses you will be cursed. The explanation is that the lives of the righteous are first bad and afterwards are good. Here, Isaac first said, the one who curses you should be cursed and afterwards he said, the one who will bless you will be blessed. However, <i>the evil Balaam</i> first said, the one who blesses should be blessed, since it first goes well for the evildoers. Afterwards he said, the one who curses you should be curses, since the <i>evildoers</i> have a bad end.<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 27:29.</i>
<i>Hizkuni</i> writes. Even though Isaac thought that Esau was pious, yet Isaac knew well that Esau was argumentative and that many people hated him and cursed him. Therefore, Isaac first cursed those who would curse Esau, since there were more cursers than blessers.<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 27:29.</i>
“<i>Let my father sit up</i>” [27:31]. <i>Hizkuni</i> writes. Isaac fell asleep after eating Jacob’s food. Therefore, Esau said: my father should get up and should eat of my food.<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 27:31.</i>
“<i>Who are you? He said, I am your son, Esau, your firstborn</i>” [27:32]. Isaac asked: who are you? He said: I am your firstborn son, Esau.
“<i>Isaac was seized with violent trembling</i>” [27:33]. Isaac became very frightened. The Midrash writes.<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanhuma</i>, Toldot, 13.</i> Isaac was frightened when he was bound on the altar and now he was even more frightened. Therefore, it is written here, <i>very much.</i> This means, very much. Isaac was very frightened. He saw <i>Gehenna</i> coming with Esau and the walls of the house trembled. Thus, Isaac said: “<i>who was it</i>” [27:33]? Who was the man who will be baked and roasted in the fire, me or my children? The Holy One responded: not you nor your children, but “<i>the one who hunted game</i>” [27:33]. That is to say, Esau who hunted <i>game</i> and the people who will be caught in the fire.<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 27:33.</i>
“<i>I ate of it before you came, and I blessed him; now he must remain blessed</i>” [27:33]. I ate it before you came and it tasted very good. I blessed him and he should be blessed. Isaac said: he should remain blessed. That is to say, people should not say that if Jacob had not acted deceitfully, he would not have been blessed. Therefore, Isaac said: he should remain blessed.<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 27:33.</i>
<i>Hizkuni</i> writes. Isaac said: I made a mistake between Jacob and Esau. This is <i>nothing new</i>, since I am blind. However, the Holy One knew everything very well, how is it that He would take away the blessing from the <i>firstborn</i> and give it to the younger one. “<i>He will remain blessed</i>” [27:33]. He will be blessed since I blessed him with the agreement of the Holy One. Jacob bought the blessing from you and therefore it is rightful that he should be blessed. <i>Hizkuni</i> gives another explanation. Isaac said: “<i>he will remain blessed</i>” [27:33]. He must be because I have blessed Jacob that all those who blessed him should be blessed and those who curse him should be cursed. If I will now curse Jacob, then I will be cursed. If you want to say that I should not curse, but not bless, therefore Isaac said, “<i>he will remain blessed</i>” [27:33]; he should be blessed. When I bless him, then I bless myself, since I have already blessed him that the one who blesses him should be blessed.<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 27:33.</i>
“<i>He burst into wild and bitter sobbing</i>” [27:34]. He cried out a great and bitter cry. “<i>He said to his father, bless me too, father</i>” [27:34]. Esau said to his father, bless me also. Isaac said: your brother came with <i>wisdom</i> and took away your blessing. Esau said: he is called Jacob because he has deceived me twice. He also took away my birthright. Esau said: have you not put aside a blessing for me also? Isaac said to Esau: I have made Jacob a lord over you and all of his brothers should be servants to him. I have also given him grain and wine. What should I do further? Esau said: do you have only one blessing? He cried greatly and Isaac blessed him.<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 27:35–36.</i>
“<i>Your abode shall enjoy the fat of the earth</i>” [27:39]. Your abode will be from the fatness. <i>Toldot Yizhak</i> asks a question. Why was Isaac so frightened that he could not bless Esau? Also, are there no more blessings in the world? He asks another question. Isaac first said: he has taken away your blessing. That is to say, there is nothing left. Afterwards, he said: “<i>from the fatness of the land</i>” should be your abode. Isaac did indeed find a blessing. The explanation is that Isaac was frightened because he had blessed Jacob that he should be a master over his brother. With that, Esau and his children would be servants to Jacob. Therefore, Isaac was frightened. I will not be able to give Esau a blessing like Jacob’s Therefore, Esau said: “<i>bless me too, father</i>” [27:38]. That is to say, bless me like Jacob was blessed. However, Isaac said: I blessed Jacob that he should be a lord over you. Therefore. I cannot give you a blessing like the one I gave him. Esau responded: I know well that I cannot have the blessing that you blessed Jacob with, because he is a lord over me. However, you blessed Jacob with another blessing, that he should have grain and wine. Give me some of the same blessing. Isaac blessed Esau, “<i>your abode shall enjoy the fat of the earth</i>” [27:39]. That is to say, I will also bless you with the blessing that I blessed Jacob. You should also have much grain and wine. Esau said: what does it help me if I will have much grain and wine, since I am a servant to Jacob and everything that the servant has belongs to his lord. Therefore, Esau asked that he should be a lord at times. Isaac responded: “<i>by your sword shall you live</i>” [27:40]. You have some rule with your sword that hangs by your side. Also “<i>when you grow restive, you shall break his yoke</i>” [27:40]. You shall rule over Jacob when they will not keep the Torah, then Esau has power over Jacob.<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Genesis, 27:33–40.</i>
Rabbi Isserlein writes. Esau said that he should be blessed with much grain and wine, in the expectation that he should be able to properly serve his lord, Jacob. That is to say, it is customary that the servant brings presents to his lord. Therefore, let me alone have the blessing of grain and wine and not Jacob. That is to say, Esau said: let me have a separate blessing that Jacob would not have. Isaac responded: I have given him the blessing previously with grain and wine. He does not need yours, so what shall I do?<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote">Be’ure Maharai, Genesis, 27:37.</i>
<i>Imre Noam</i> writes. “<i>By your sword shall you live</i>” [27:40]. Abraham had a sword on which the <i>Ineffable Name</i> was written. Abraham gave this sword to Isaac. Isaac gave the sword to Jacob. When Esau was supposed to fight with <i>Nimrod</i>, he came to Jacob that he should sell him that sword and he gave him the birthright in return. They ate the bread and lentils, since it was the custom that when someone sells some merchandise, the merchants drink wine on the sale. When Esau said that Jacob had taken away his birthright, Isaac said to Esau, “<i>by your sword shall you live</i>” [27:40]. That is, keep your sword that you took for your birthright.<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">Imre Noam, Genesis, 25:34.</i>
“<i>Esau harbored a grudge against Jacob because of the blessing</i>” [27:41]. Esau hated his brother Jacob because of the birthright. <i>Hizkuni</i> writes. He hated Jacob because he had the blessing of the sword. He relied on the blessing, “<i>by your sword shall you live</i>” [27:40], that it would help him kill Jacob.<sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 27:41.</i>
“<i>Let but the mourning period of my father come</i>” [27:41]. Esau said: I will not trouble my father, but as soon as my father will die, I will take <i>revenge</i> on Jacob. So writes Rashi,<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 27:41.</i> but <i>Hizkuni</i> writes. Esau said: I will wait until my father will die and if he will not have children, nobody will defend Jacob, since he will not have a brother. At that time I will take <i>revenge.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 27:41.</i>
“<i>It was told to Rebecca</i>” [27:42]. The <i>Holy Spirit</i> came upon Rebecca and informed her that Esau wanted to kill Jacob.<sup class="footnote-marker">83</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 27:42.</i> Therefore, Rebecca said to Jacob: go to Laban and hide there from Esau and I will send for you to come here again.
“<i>Let me not lose you both in one day</i>” [27:45]. Rebecca said: go to Laban. Why should I be bereft of both of you? That is to say, Esau had said: when my father will die, I will take my <i>revenge</i> on Jacob at that time. Therefore Rebecca said: I will lose you both in one day. Therefore, go to Laban until his anger subsides, as <i>Hizkuni</i> writes.<sup class="footnote-marker">84</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 27:45.</i>
Rashi writes: Rebecca said: if you will want to kill him, his children will rise up and will kill you. Thus, I will lose you both in one day. In fact, both of them died on the same day.<sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 27:45.</i>
“<i>If Jacob marries a Hittite woman</i>” [27:46]. <i>Hizkuni</i> writes. Rebecca said to Isaac: you must forbid Jacob from marrying a wife from the <i>daughters of Heth</i>, who are in our area. Jacob will want to marry a daughter of an important chieftain that he should help him fight against Esau. Isaac called Jacob and said to him: go to Laban and marry his daughter.<sup class="footnote-marker">86</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 27:46.</i> “<i>May El Shaddai bless you</i>,” God will bless you.
“<i>The Isaac sent Jacob off, and he went to Paddan-aram, to Laban the son of Bethuel the Aramean, the brother of Rebecca, mother of Jacob and Esau</i>” [28:5]. <i>Hizkuni</i> writes. The verse tells us that Rebecca was the mother of Jacob and Esau. Even though we have long known this, but the Torah teaches us, how is it that Isaac and Rebecca were both pious and had a son who was an evildoer? Therefore, the verse says, <i>Laban the brother of Rebecca.</i> That is to say, because Laban was Rebecca’s brother, and the children take after the mother’s brother. That is to say, because Laban was Rebecca’s brother, therefore, she was the mother of Jacob and Esau. Another explanation is that Rebecca sent away Jacob so that Jacob should not kill Esau and Jacob would also get killed. Therefore, she sent Jacob away. The verse tells us this; Rebecca was the mother of Jacob and Esau. She had pity on Esau and Jacob.<sup class="footnote-marker">87</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 28:5.</i>
<i>Toldot Yizhak</i> and <i>Bahya</i> write. How was Rebecca not afraid to send Jacob from the area of <i>Beer Sheva</i> to <i>Paddan-aram?</i> Perhaps Esau would pursue him. That is why the verse tells us, “<i>the mother of Jacob and Esau</i>” [28:5]. That is to say, she sent Jacob to <i>Paddan-aram</i>, because in <i>Paddan-aram</i> they knew that Rebecca had higher regard for Jacob and they would protect Jacob from Esau’s hands. She was the mother of Jacob and afterwards, the mother of Esau. That is, she loved Jacob more than Esau. Some sages say that all the twins were created in two membranes. However, Jacob and Esau were in one membrane in the womb, and that is why it calls her the mother of Jacob and Esau.<sup class="footnote-marker">88</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Genesis, 28:5; Bahya, Genesis, 28:5.</i>
“<i>Jacob obeyed his father</i>” [28:7]. Jacob obeyed and went to <i>Paddan-aram. Bahya</i> asks a question. If Isaac and Rebecca had told Jacob to go to <i>Paddanaram</i>, why did the Holy One punish Jacob that he tarried in the house of Laban and did not honor his father? We find that <i>Joseph the Righteous One</i> was lost to his father for twenty-two years and Jacob did not receive any honor from Joseph, because Jacob did not <i>honor</i> Isaac for twenty-two years, because he was in the house of Laban. The explanation is that Isaac sent Jacob that he should marry <i>Laban</i>’<i>s</i> oldest daughter, who was <i>Leah</i>, and should not tarry there long. Jacob liked <i>Rachel</i> and tarried because of Rachel and that is why the Holy One punished him.<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 28:6.</i>
The <i>Imre Noam</i> gives an explanation. Jacob was hidden for fourteen years in Shem’s house of study. Esau’s anger subsided and Rebecca heard from Esau that he did not want to do anything to Jacob. <i>Rebecca</i> sent <i>Deborah</i> to Jacob that he should come home. Deborah found Jacob in the house of Laban, the first year that he had come to the house of Laban. Jacob tarried in the house of Laban for twenty-two years and did not <i>honor</i> his father and mother. Therefore, the Holy One punished him that Joseph also did not <i>honor</i> Jacob for twenty-two years. The Holy One punished him, <i>measure for measure.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">90</sup><i class="footnote">Imre Noam, Genesis, 27:44.</i>

“<i>Jacob left Beer-Sheva and set out for Haran</i>” [28:10]. Jacob left <i>Beer-Sheva</i> and went to Haran. <i>Rashi</i> asks a question here. Why does it have to say that he went out to Haran? The explanation is that the Torah teaches us that when a righteous person leaves a city, then the beauty and the light from the city leaves with him, since the righteous one is the light and beauty of the city.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 28:10.</i>
<i>Hizkuni</i> writes. It says this, that he left <i>Beer-Sheva.</i> They used to swear there all the time. That is why the city is called <i>Beer-Sheva</i>, because of the swearing. Jacob was afraid that they would make him swear that he did not take away the blessing through deceit. Therefore, Jacob left <i>Beer-Sheva</i> quickly.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 28:10.</i>
“<i>He set out for Haran</i>” [28:10]. He went from <i>Beer-Sheva</i> to <i>Haran</i> in one day. Our sages said that it is a seventeen-day journey to go from <i>Beer-Sheva</i> to <i>Haran</i> and Jacob made this journey in twelve hours.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid.</i>
That is why it is written here, “<i>He came upon a certain place</i>” [28:11]. He encountered the place. That is to say, as if the place came to meet him. Our sages also said about “<i>He came upon</i>” that this means, he prayed and “<i>at a certain place</i>” means, the Holy One, who is Lord of the whole world, is called <i>makom</i> [place].<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 28:11.</i> Jacob prayed to the Holy One.
Our sages say that when Jacob came to Haran, he became frightened that he had passed Mount <i>Moriah</i> and had not prayed at the place where his ancestors had prayed.

“<i>Stopped there for the night, for the sun had set</i>” [28:11]. <i>Rashi</i> asks a question here. It should first say, “<i>the sun had set</i>,” the sun had set, and afterwards, it should say, “<i>stopped there</i>,” that he spent the night there. The explanation is that it was still early. The Holy One caused the sun to set before the proper time, in the expectation that he should remain there in order to pray.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 28:11.</i> If it had not been night, he would have gone on further in the hope that he would get far away from Esau.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 28:11.</i> From here we learn that a person should not travel at night when it is not necessary, as our sages said: “<i>a person should enter a town by day and set out by day.</i>”<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Pesahim,</i> 2a.</i> This means, the person should come to the inn before night and should leave when it is already light.
“<i>He took the stones of that place</i>” [28:11]. He took many stones to place around himself. <i>Rashi</i> asks a question here. It is written here that he took many stones and later in the Torah portion it is written, “<i>he took the stone</i>” [28:18]. He took a stone. The explanation is that Jacob took many stones and lay them as a wall around himself, that the <i>wild animals</i> should not harm him at night when he would sleep. The stones argued with each other. Each stone said: let the righteous one place his head on me. The Holy One made peace among the stones and made one stone from all the stones.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 28:11.</i>
“<i>He lay down in that place</i>” [28:11]. He lay down in that place. <i>Rashi</i> asks a question here. It should say, “<i>he lay down.</i>” This means, he lay down and slept, “<i>in that place.</i>” The explanation is that the Torah shows that he was hidden for fourteen years in the <i>house of study</i> of <i>Ever</i> and he studied day and night and did not sleep, but now on this night he slept.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid.</i>
“<i>He dreamed that there was a ladder</i>” [28:12]. He had a dream in which a ladder extended from the earth to the heaven.
“<i>Angels of God were going up and down on it</i>” [28:12]. Angels were going up that ladder to heaven and they went down again. <i>Rashi</i> asks a question here. The angels live in heaven. It should say that the angels came down and it should say that they went up again to heaven. The explanation is that the angels accompanied him <i>outside of Israel</i> had no power in the <i>land of Israel.</i> Therefore, that night Jacob was on the boundary of the <i>land of Israel.</i> The angels from <i>outside of the land</i> went up and other angels came down to accompany him in the <i>land of Israel.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 28:12.</i>
<i>Hizkuni</i> writes. The angels who accompanied him went up to other angels and called them down to see the visage of Jacob, since Jacob’s visage was engraved on the <i>Throne of Glory.</i> The angels went up and saw the visage on the <i>Throne of Glory</i> and again went down and saw if the visage was the visage of the <i>Throne of Glory.</i> So writes Bahya.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 28:12; Bahya, Genesis, 28:12.</i>
“<i>He said, I am the Lord, the God of your father Abraham and the God of Isaac</i>” [28:13]. The Holy One appeared to Jacob and said to him. I am the God of Abraham your father and the God of Isaac. <i>Ba</i>’<i>al ha-Turim</i> asks a question. Why does the verse say that He is the God of Abraham his father and with Isaac he does not say that he is the father of Jacob? <i>Ba</i>’<i>al ha-Turim</i> gives no answer.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Ba’al ha-Turim, Genesis, 28:13.</i> However, Rabbi Isserl gives an explanation. Jacob was afraid that the blessing of Isaac would not remain, because he had taken the blessing with tricks, but Isaac had intended to bless Esau and not Jacob. Therefore, the verse comes and says that the Holy One had said to Jacob, Abraham is your proper father. That is to say, Abraham thought of you like a father. Abraham did not want to bless Isaac because he had seen that he had two children, Jacob and Esau. Abraham was afraid that if he blessed Isaac, he would also be blessing Esau. Therefore, Abraham said: I will not bless Isaac; let God himself bless him. Abraham did not intend to bless Esau, but Isaac did intend to bless Esau. Therefore, the verse says, Abraham is the father of Jacob and Isaac is not similarly mentioned as a father, because he had intended to bless Esau.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Be’ure Maharai, Genesis, 28:13.</i>
<i>Rashi</i> asks a question. Why does it say, “<i>the God of Isaac</i>”? One does not say the “<i>God of</i>” about a person when they are alive. That is, there are many righteous people previously, but it often happens when he becomes older, he often denies God. Therefore, the person should not believe in himself before his death. The explanation is that Isaac was blind and a blind person is like a dead person. The <i>evil inclination</i> had left Isaac. Therefore, it says, “<i>the God of Isaac</i>” even during his lifetime.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 28:13.</i>
“<i>The ground on which you are lying I will assign to you</i>” [28:13]. <i>Rashi</i> asks a question here. What kind of novelty was it that the Holy One promised to give Jacob the earth on which he was lying? How big is the place on which one can lie? The explanation is that the Holy One folded the whole <i>land of Israel</i> under Jacob and said: the earth on which you are lying I will give to your children in order that the land will be easier to conquer.
“<i>Your descendants shall be as the dust of the earth</i>” [28:14]. <i>Bahya</i> asks a question here. He should have said: your children will be like the stars in the heaven. Why does He say that they will be like the dust of the earth? The explanation is that He shows us that that Israel will be low like dust in the exile among the <i>nations</i> and afterwards they will attain a <i>high level</i> and will defeat the nations. Just like the dust which one steps on jumps up against those who step on it, so too, the nations step on Israel. So too, will Israel vanquish the nations.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 28:14.</i>
“<i>What I promised you</i>” [28:15]. <i>Rashi</i> asks a question. The verse said that the Holy One promised Jacob; I will not leave you until I will do what I promised you. We do not find that the Holy One had promised something to Jacob. The explanation is that “<i>I promised you</i>” means, what I promised for your sake. That is, I knew well that <i>Esau the evildoer</i> would come from Isaac. Therefore, I said, “<i>through Isaac that offspring shall be continued</i>” [21:12]. This means that a part of Isaac’s descendants will have the blessing, but not all the children of Isaac. That is, Jacob will be blessed and not Esau.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 28:15.</i>
“<i>Jacob awoke from his sleep</i>” [28:16]. Jacob woke up from his sleep and said: God is certainly here and I did not know. However, had I known this, I would not have slept on this holy place.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 28:16.</i> He was very afraid and said: this is the gateway to heaven through which all prayers ascend. Jacob woke up early and took the stone that was at his head, made an <i>altar</i>, poured oil on it, and made a vow. If God will be with me and will protect me as He said to me, then God will be my God. Here one asks a question. How appropriate is it that Jacob should conclude that when God will be his helper, then he would accept Him as a God. However, if He would, <i>heaven forbid</i>, not help him, then he would not have Him as his God. The explanation is, Jacob feared that he would commit sins, then God would not keep what he promised him. In any event, he would worship the Holy One, but not at that place.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Genesis, 28:12–22.</i>
“<i>Gives me bread to eat and clothing to wear</i>” [28:20]. He will give me bread to eat and clothes to wear. <i>Rashi</i> asks a question. Where did the Holy One promise to give Jacob bread? The explanation is the Holy One promised, “<i>I will not leave you</i>” [28:15]. I will not leave you. That is to say, when someone does not have bread, he is abandoned by God. Therefore, Jacob said: if He will continue to give me bread.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 28:20.</i>
<i>Rabbi Isserl</i> asks a question here. Where did the Holy One promise to give Jacob clothes? The explanation is that <i>the Holy One</i> said to the righteous that He would give them that they should have <i>dignity.</i> Everything that Jacob desired from <i>the Holy One</i>, <i>the Holy One</i> gave him everything that he desired on the way.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Be’ure Maharai, Genesis, 28:20.</i>
Jacob had desired, “<i>Bread to eat and clothes to wear</i>” [28:20]. This means, bread to eat and clothes to wear. He received this when he was with Laban. He received wives from Laban. This is called “<i>bread to eat.</i>” The verse compares wives to bread. One cannot be without a wife, like [one cannot be] without bread. He also gave him clothes. That is to say, he had many sheep from Laban, out of which one makes clothes from the wool of the sheep.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 28:21.</i>
“<i>If God remains with me</i>” [28:20]. That is to say, God should be my God and I will give a tithe of everything that is mine. He even gave a tithe of his children to God. This is the <i>tribe of Levi.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Genesis, 28:12–22.</i>
“<i>There before his eyes was a well in the open</i>” [29:2]. Jacob saw a well in the field and three shepherds at the well and a large stone was on the well. All the shepherds had to gather to roll the stone off the well to water the sheep.
“<i>He said to them, do you know Laban the son of Nahor</i>” [29:5]. Jacob asked the shepherds if they knew <i>Laban the son of Nahor. Hizkuni</i> and <i>Bahya</i> ask a question. Why does the verse say that Laban was the son of Nahor? He was the son of Bethuel. The explanation is that Bethuel was a weak man. Therefore, Laban did not call himself after Bethuel, but after Nahor, his grandfather. Grandchildren are like children. Nahor was the brother of Abraham and all of them <i>prided themselves</i> as members of <i>Abraham</i>’<i>s family.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 29:5; Bahya, Genesis, 29:5.</i>
“<i>There is his daughter Rachel, coming with the flock</i>” [29:6]. As he was speaking with the shepherds, Rachel came with the sheep.
“<i>He said, it is still broad daylight, too early to round up the animals</i>” [29:7]. Jacob said to the shepherds. Are you hired day laborers? It is still too early to bring the sheep home. The day has not ended. If you are watching your own flocks, it is not yet time to gather your flock.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 29:7.</i> Jacob dragged on his conversation with them in order to speak with Rachel and so that the shepherds should not go away.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 29:7.</i> Jacob said: therefore, why don’t you water your sheep and take your sheep to pasture. The shepherds responded: we cannot water them until all the shepherds gather, since the stone on the well is very heavy. At that moment, Rachel came with her sheep to the well.
<i>Hizkuni</i> writes. Why was Leah not with the sheep? The explanation is that Leah had bad eyes and the wind hurt her eyes. Therefore, she could not go out into the fields with the sheep. Also, Rachel was younger and she honored her older sister.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 29:9.</i>
<i>Ramban</i> also writes this and therefore Jacob kissed Rachel, because she was small and young. That is why Laban let her go out into the field, because it was not yet time for her to marry a husband.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban, Genesis, 29:9.</i>
“<i>When Jacob saw Rachel, the daughter of his uncle Laban, and the flock of his uncle Laban, Jacob went up and rolled the stone</i>” [29:10]. When Jacob saw Rachel standing with the flock, Jacob wanted to show that he was strong and skillful before the <i>bride Rachel</i>, and took the stone off at once by himself. He did not roll the stone as the shepherds, who used to gather and roll it, since it was too heavy to lift. That is why it is written, “<i>the stone was rolled</i>” [28:8]. This means, they used to roll the stone. However, concerning Jacob, it says, “<i>he rolled the stone</i>” [29:10], which means, uncovered and removed the stone from the well, but he did not roll it.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 29:10.</i>
<i>Bahya</i> asks a question here. Why does Scripture say, “<i>Laban, his mother</i>’<i>s brother</i>” three times, that Laban was his mother’s brother? The explanation is that the Torah wants to show us that Jacob would not do a <i>favor</i> for the <i>evildoer Laban</i>, to water his sheep, if it were not that Laban was his mother’s brother. Rebecca, his mother, <i>advised</i> him that he should go to Laban. Therefore, Jacob always thought that he is my mother’s brother.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 29:10.</i>
“<i>Jacob kissed Rachel and broke into tears</i>” [29:11]. Jacob kissed Rachel and cried because he saw <i>prophetically</i> that Rachel would not be buried with him in the cave. He cried because he did not have a <i>gift for the bride.</i> He said: Eliezer, the servant of Abraham, gave two presents to Rebecca and I cannot give anything to Rachel. Here one asks a question. How is it that Rebecca should send Jacob with nothing? The explanation is that she certainly gave him much to take, but <i>Eliphaz, the son of Esau</i>, pursued Jacob on the road, in order to kill him, since Esau had sent Eliphaz. Eliphaz encountered Jacob on the way. Jacob said: take all of my money and then I will be as dead, and tell your father that you killed me. Eliphaz did so and that is why Jacob had nothing to give Rachel.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 29:11.</i>
“<i>Jacob told Rachel that he was her father</i>’<i>s kinsman</i>” [29:12]. He said to Rachel that he was her father’s relative. That is why I have kissed you, because you are my <i>relative. Rashi</i> writes that the Midrash stated that Jacob said to Rachel: if your father is a <i>deceiver</i> and a scoundrel, then I am his brother. That is, regarding deceit I am his brother. I also know how to be <i>deceitful.</i> If he is pious, then I am descended from a pious mother, that is, Rebecca.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 29:12.</i>
“<i>She told her father</i>” [29:12]. She ran and told her father that a relative, Jacob, had come. <i>Rashi</i> asks a question here. Why did Rebecca tell her mother and Rachel told her father. When Eliezer came to Rebecca and wanted to take her to Isaac, Rebecca ran and told her mother. The explanation is that here by Rachel, her mother had died.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid.</i>
<i>Hizkuni</i> gives a different explanation. Since Jacob had said here that he was a <i>relative</i> of her father, therefore Rachel said to her father, your <i>relative</i> has come, but Jacob was not related to Rachel’s mother. However, Rebecca ran to her mother when Eliezer came to her, since Eliezer did not say from which <i>family</i> he was sent. Therefore, Rebecca told her mother, since girls tell everything to their mother, <i>particularly</i> when she had received beautiful <i>jewelry</i> from Eliezer. Therefore, she told her mother.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 29:12.</i>
“<i>He ran toward him</i>” [29:13]. Laban ran toward him. He thought that Jacob certainly had much money with him. He said: Eliezer was a servant and he came with ten camels. <i>How much more so Jacob</i> who is from his parents. When Laban saw no camels, Laban thought that he must have much money on himself and that is why he embraced him. That is to say, he wanted to see if he did not have money under his clothes. He also kissed him to see if he had a <i>precious stone</i> in his mouth.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 29:13.</i>
“<i>He told Laban</i>” [29:13]. Jacob told Laban that he barely escaped from Esau and that is why he came with nothing.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid.</i>
<i>Hizkuni</i> writes. Jacob told Laban how he had taken the <i>birthright</i> and the <i>blessing</i> from Esau, expecting that Laban would give him his daughter.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 29:13.</i>
“<i>Laban said to him, you are truly my bone and flesh</i>” [29:14]. Laban said to Jacob: I should justly not allow you into the house because you have nothing, but you are my bone and flesh, that is to say, a relative. Remain with me for a <i>month</i>, and even that <i>month</i> not for nothing. He must guard the sheep for his bread.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 29:14.</i>
<i>Hizkuni</i> also said. Laban said to Jacob: Because you deceived your brother with the <i>birthright</i> and the <i>blessing</i>, then I should not take you in, but you are my blood and flesh. That is, you will not be able to deceive me; I am smart enough.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 29:14.</i>
“<i>He stayed with him a month</i>’<i>s time</i>” [29:14]. He stayed with Laban for a <i>month</i>, since Laban was afraid to hire Jacob until he knew what Jacob was.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid.</i>
<i>Imre Noam</i> asks a question. How did Jacob go into Laban’s house? There were idols in Laban’s house. The donkey and camels of Abraham did not want to go into Bethuel’s house until the <i>idols</i> were removed. The explanation is that Jacob wanted to check if Rachel and Leah were idol worshipers. In the course of the month he saw everything and at the end of the month he separated himself. Therefore, it is written, “<i>he stayed with him a month</i>’<i>s time</i>” [29:14]. That is to say, Jacob stayed only one month in Laban’s house.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">Imre Noam, Genesis, 29:14.</i>
“<i>Just because you are a kinsman, should you serve me for nothing?</i>” [29:15]. Laban said: since you are my brother, you will serve me without a salary?<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 29:15.</i>
<i>Toldot Yizhak</i> writes here. Laban was a deceiver. He thought: if Jacob serves me without a salary, then he wouldn’t have to pay me if any damage occurs. Therefore, I will make Jacob take a salary from me. Then he will have to pay for the damage, since he will not be an <i>unpaid guardian.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Genesis, 29:15.</i> Laban said to Jacob: tell me what is your salary?
“<i>Leah had weak eyes</i>” [29:17]. Leah had cried a great deal. People had said that Leah was Laban’s oldest and she would marry Esau. Rachel was the younger one, and she would marry Jacob. Therefore, Leah had weak eyes from crying a great deal.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 29:17.</i>
<i>Devek Tov</i> said: <i>Rashi</i>’s [explanation] is difficult. Since the verse shows us that Leah had a defect, how is it that the Torah should speak about the shame of a <i>righteous woman?</i> The explanation is that the Torah tells us that Leah was righteous. She cried her eyes out, because she was supposed to marry <i>Esau the evildoer.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Devek Tov, Genesis, 29:17.</i>
<i>Rabbi Isserlein</i> gives an explanation. The Talmud says that if a bride who has nice eyes, one does not need to look at the whole body. However, those that have bad eyes, one has to see if she doe not have other defects.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Ta</i>’<i>anit,</i> 24a.</i> Therefore, Jacob did not want to enter into any doubts, because Leah had bad eyes. Perhaps she had some other defects in her body? The Torah also tells us that <i>Jacob our Patriarch</i> said: I was commanded by my father and mother. They told me to marry a wife from the daughters of Laban. I will follow this and if Laban only had one daughter and she was blind, I would have also married her. However now, “<i>Leah had weak eyes; Rachel was shapely and beautiful</i>” [29:17]. That is to say, why should I want to marry Leah with bad eyes? I would rather marry Rachel who is beautiful and without defects.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">Be’ure Maharai, Genesis, 29:17.</i>
“<i>I will serve you seven years</i>” [29:18]. Jacob said to Laban: I will serve you seven years for Rachel your younger daughter. <i>Rashi</i> asks here. Why did Jacob have to say so much; Rachel your daughter and your younger one? We know very well that <i>Rachel</i> was the younger daughter. The explanation is that Jacob knew very well that Laban was a deceiver. Thus, Jacob thought, if I would say that I would serve for Rachel, he would take a strange maiden whose name was Rachel and give her as a wife. Therefore, he said: you should give me Rachel your daughter. Jacob was afraid that he would give Leah the name Rachel. That is why he said: Rachel your daughter, the younger one. Yet, none of this helped him in the end.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 29:18.</i>
<i>Hizkuni</i> writes. Jacob said: I will marry Rachel, because she is the younger one. If I married the older one, then he [Esau] would say that I took away his <i>blessing</i> and his <i>birthright</i> and now I also want to take away his wife. He is the oldest and thus it is just that he should marry Leah, the older one. <i>Hizkuni</i> asks a question. Why did <i>Jacob</i> himself say that he would serve for seven years? He should have said: I will serve for two or three years for Rachel. The explanation is that <i>Jacob</i> thought that he would not get such a beautiful maiden for two years.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 29:18.</i>
However, <i>Bahya</i> writes. <i>Jacob</i> had to say seven years, since Rachel was five years old at this time. Jacob wanted to wait for seven years so that <i>Rachel</i> would be twelve years old, so that she would be old enough to have children. He did not want to sleep with <i>Rachel</i> if she could not have children.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 29:15.</i>
“<i>Laban said, better that I should give her to you</i>” [29:19]. It is better to give her to you than to another one.
“<i>They seemed to him but a few days</i>” [29:20]. The seven years of service were like a few days, because <i>Jacob</i> loved <i>Rachel.</i> Here one asks a question. It is customary when someone loves a woman very much, he longs for her; a few hours are like a year. Why does the verse say about Jacob that the seven years went by very quickly because he loved her? The explanation is that when the seven years ended, Jacob thought that it was like one day because he loved her.<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 29:20.</i>
“<i>My time is fulfilled, that may cohabit with her</i>” [29:21]. Jacob said: the days that my mother told me to stay with you have come to an end. Also, I am eightyfour years old. It is time to take my wife and have a child, since I will have twelve children.<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 29:21.</i> That is why he says, “<i>that I may cohabit with her</i>” [29:21]. I will sleep with her. That is to say, Jacob was righteous, so how is it appropriate that he should speak openly I will sleep with her. An empty-headed person would not speak like that, but Jacob’s <i>intention</i> was to have children and that is why he spoke that way.
However, <i>Ramban</i> asks a question. Why did Jacob say to Laban, the days of my mother have ended? Therefore, give me Rachel before the seven years have ended. Why would Laban care that the days of his mother had ended, when the seven years of service had not ended? The <i>Ramban</i> said that the explanation is “<i>for my time is fulfilled</i>” [29:21]. This means, the seventh year has come. He said: since the seventh year has started, I will finish my service. I will do everything for you and will not run away now. I will complete my service. Therefore, he said: “<i>I will cohabit with her</i>” [29:21]. That is, since I will marry her, then I will certainly not run away.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban, Genesis, 29:27.</i>
“<i>Laban gathered all the people of the place</i>” [29:22]. He gathered the whole city, made a <i>feast</i> and said to them. Do not betray me by telling Jacob that I will give him Leah this night. They said: it is good. Laban said to them: give me <i>pledges</i> that you will keep your word. They immediately gave him their garments as a <i>pledge.</i> Laban went and pawned the clothes for wine and he <i>honored</i> them with their own money. They were very happy and led Leah to sleep with Jacob and sang <i>songs of praise.</i> They gave to understand with their singing that this was Leah. The word, <i>songs of praise</i> [<i>hilulah</i>], consists of two words, that is, she is Leah [<i>hi Leah</i>]. Jacob did not understand this.<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Genesis Rabbah,</i> 70.19.</i>
“<i>When evening came, he took his daughter Leah and brought her to him</i>” [29:23]. Evening came and Laban took Leah, his daughter, and brought her to Jacob. Laban the deceiver took Zilpah, the maid who was very young, and gave her to Leah as a servant. That is to say, Jacob should see that Zilpah was in the room. Jacob should think that since Zilpah was in the room, then Rachel must be in the bed, since Zilpah was young and Rachel was also young. However, <i>Bilhah</i>, the other maid, was old and appropriate for Leah.<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 30:10.</i>
“<i>When morning came, there was Leah</i>” [29:25]. Jacob slept with Leah and spoke with her the whole night and did not understand that this was Leah. Jacob had made up certain <i>signs</i> with Rachel that she should answer when he would call her in bed, so that he should know that this was Rachel. Rachel saw that Leah would be led to the bed. Rachel thought to herself, Leah my sister would be <i>embarrassed</i> when Jacob will call Leah with the <i>signs</i> and she would not answer. Therefore, Rachel taught Leah all the <i>signs</i> that she should respond to Jacob in the bed. That is why it is written, “<i>When morning came, there was Leah</i>” [29:25]. That is, in the morning he saw that it was Leah. However, the whole night Jacob thought that Rachel was sleeping with him.<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 29:25.</i>
<i>Bahya</i> interprets the midrash that the Holy One repays everything <i>measure for measure.</i> Jacob had sent <i>gifts</i> to Rachel. That is, <i>jewelry</i> that the groom sends before the wedding to the bride. Laban went and took these <i>presents</i> and gave them to Leah. Rachel was silent and did not <i>inform</i> about it. Thus, <i>Benjamin</i> was descended from her and he was silent that <i>Joseph</i> had been sold and did not <i>inform</i> on his brothers. <i>King Saul</i> was descended from <i>Benjamin</i> and he also did not say that he had been made a king. Also, <i>Queen Esther</i> was descended from Benjamin. She did not tell <i>Ahasuerus</i> about her <i>family</i> and the <i>redemption of Purim</i> came through her.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 29:25.</i>
“<i>He said to Laban</i>” [29:25]. Jacob said to Laban. Why did you give me Leah when I served you for Rachel? Laban responded that it is not the custom in our city to marry off the younger one before the older one. If you want something different, “<i>when the bridal week is over</i>” [29:27], let Leah’s <i>bridal week</i> end these seven days, and then I will give you Rachel. That is to say, he should not mix up one joyous occasion with other joyous occasions.<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 29:27.</i>
“<i>Jacob cohabited with Rachel also; indeed, he loved Rachel more</i>” [29:30]. <i>Ramban</i> writes. It is customary that the wife that the person sleeps with for the first time that he ever slept with a woman, that woman is his most beloved. So too, the woman who sleeps with a man first, that man is the most loved. However, here the verse tells us that Jacob loved Rachel, even though he first slept with Leah. Jacob hated Leah because she deceived her sister Rachel. Even if it were correct that she had to honor her father who told her to go and sleep with Jacob, yet it would have been just that she informed Jacob that she was Leah. She slept with him the whole night and made herself out to be Rachel. However, the Holy One knew well that Leah had gladly cleaved to the righteous one. Therefore, the Holy One had compassion on her and gave her children. Jacob had wanted to divorce Leah because she had <i>deceived</i> him. Therefore, the Holy One gave her children quickly. Jacob thought to himself, if I would divorce Leah, what would the children do without their mother? Therefore, the verse says, “<i>the Lord saw that Leah was unloved and he opened her womb; but Rachel was barren</i>” [29:31]. This means, the Holy One saw that he hated Leah and that is why the Holy One gave her children. Rachel did not have children, in the expectation that he would love Leah.<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban, Genesis, 29:30 –31.</i>
<i>Bahya</i> and <i>Ramban</i> write. How is it that Jacob could have hated Leah? The explanation is because he loved Rachel very much. Thus, in comparison it would appear that he hated Leah.<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 29:31; Ramban, Genesis, 29:31.</i>
“<i>He served him another seven years</i>” [29:30]. The verse teaches us the <i>righteousness</i> of Jacob. Even though Laban had acted <i>deceitfully</i> with Jacob and had given him Leah instead of Rachel. Jacob’s intention was that he had served the first seven years for Rachel and he served the latter seven years equally <i>faithfully</i> the latter seven years.<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 29:30.</i>
“<i>She conceived and bore a son</i>” [29:32]. <i>Bahya</i> writes. The Torah says about each son, “<i>she conceived and bore a son</i>” [29:32]. This means, she was pregnant and gave birth. That is to say, she gave birth shortly after conceiving. She gave birth after seven <i>months.</i> All the tribes were born during the latter seven years, except for <i>Benjamin.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 29:32.</i>
“<i>This time my husband will become attached to me</i>” [29:34]. When Leah gave birth to her third child, she said <i>prophetically:</i> Jacob will have four wives and the four wives will have twelve children. This amounts to three children for each woman. Therefore, Leah said: since I have three children, I have had my <i>share</i> of the children. Therefore, my husband will be attached to me. That is why she called the third son, <i>Levi</i>, which means attached. So write Rashi and Hizkuni.<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 29:34; Hizkuni, Genesis, 29:34.</i>
However, <i>Toldot Yizhak</i> writes. A woman, who has two children, picks up a child in each hand. However, when she has three children, then the husband must take the third child in his hand. Therefore, Leah said: since I have three children, my husband must cleave to me to hold the third child.<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Genesis, 29:31–35.</i>
“<i>Therefore, she named him Levi</i>” [29:34]. <i>Rashi</i> asks a question here. Why is it written, “<i>therefore, she named him Levi</i>” [29:34]? The explanation is that by each son where it is written, “<i>therefore</i>” that son had many children in <i>Israel</i>, but with <i>Levi</i> it is also written “<i>therefore</i>,” but because they did not work in <i>Egypt</i> for <i>Pharaoh</i>, the children of Levi were not numerous.<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 29:34.</i>
Jacob had forbidden the Levites to carry his coffin when he died. Thus, the Egyptians thought that the Levites must be holy. Therefore, the king did not allow the Levites to work in Egypt. Since they did not work in Egypt, the blessing was not on Levi to have many children, as the verse says, “<i>the more they were oppressed, the more they multiplied</i>” [Exodus 1:12]. This means, the more the Egyptians made the Israelites work, the same Israelites had many children in Egypt. However, the <i>tribe of Levi</i> did not work. Therefore, they had few children. <i>Hizkuni</i> writes below in the Torah portion on Exodus, on the verse “<i>get to your labors</i>” [Exodus 5:4], why the Levites did not work.<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Exodus, 5:4.</i>
“<i>He was named Levi</i>” [29:34]. Regarding the earlier children it is written, “<i>she named him.</i>” This means, Leah named the children and regarding Levi it is written, “<i>He named him.</i>” This means, he gave his name, Levi. The explanation is, the Holy One sent <i>Gabriel</i> to bring Levi before Him and He gave him a name and called him Levi. This means, to join. That is to say, the Holy One promised to give him <i>presents, Priestly and Levitical tithes</i>, and meat from the <i>sacrifices.</i> So writes <i>Rashi.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 29:34.</i>
“<i>This time I will praise the Lord</i>” [29:35]. Leah had her fourth son. She said: I have more children than is my allotted portion. Therefore, I will praise God and will call the child Judah. This means, praise.<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 29:35.</i>
“<i>When Rachel saw that she had borne no children to Jacob, she became envious of her sister</i>” [30:1]. <i>Toldot Yizhak</i> asks a question. Did not Rachel see with the first children that Leah had that she could not have children? Why was she <i>envious</i> with the fourth child? The explanation is that Rachel thought that each of Jacob’s wives would have three children. Therefore, Rachel was not <i>envious</i> of the first three children. However, when she saw that Leah had four children, Rachel said to Jacob: why do you stand by while Leah takes away a son from me?<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Genesis, 30:1–22.</i>
“<i>Rachel became envious</i>” [30:1]. Rachel was envious of her sister. <i>Rashi</i> asks a question. How is it that a righteous woman like Rachel should be envious? This is a bad attribute. The explanation is that she was envious of Leah’s <i>good deeds.</i> She thought that Leah must be very pious. One is allowed to be envious over Torah and <i>good deeds.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 30:1.</i>
“<i>She said to Jacob, give me children or I shall die</i>” [30:1]. Rachel said to Jacob: give me children and if you will not give me children, I will die. Isaac, your father had prayed for Rebecca, pray also for me.<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid.</i> We learn from the verse that if someone does not have children, they are compared to someone who is dead.
“<i>Jacob was incensed at Rachel and said, can I take the place of God?</i>” [30:2]. Jacob was angry with Rachel and said: am I instead of God, the one who keeps you from having children. That which you said that my father prayed for Rebecca, was because my father himself had no children with any woman. However, I have children with Leah, even though I do not have children with you. So writes Rashi.<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 30:2.</i>
<i>Ramban</i> asks a question. How is it that Jacob should answer that he has children from Leah and therefore, he does not want to pray for Rachel? The <i>righteous ones</i> pray for unrelated women, that they should have children, like Elisha who prayed for unrelated women that they should have children. Even more so, Jacob should have prayed for Rachel, his beloved wife. Or, why was Jacob angry with Rachel? She desired a just thing and thought that God accepts the prayers of the righteous. Therefore, the Midrash writes that the Holy One answered Jacob: since you responded to the barren Rachel dismissively, your children will therefore have to bow down to the son of Rachel, that is Joseph. The meaning is that Rachel said to Jacob that he should keep praying until she becomes pregnant. That is to say, he should fast and wear sackcloth and should call to God until she would have children. If she would not have children, she would die of anguish. That is, she made Jacob afraid. She knew well that Jacob loved her very much and would be afraid that she would die. Therefore, Jacob would engage in great prayer that she should have children. That is why Jacob was angry. He thought: she is making me fearful about dying that I should pray that she would certainly have children. Am I instead of God that she should certainly have children through my prayer?<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban, Genesis, 30:1–2.</i>
“<i>She said, here is my maid Bilhah, consort with her</i>” [30:3]. She said to Jacob. Your grandfather Abraham had children with Hagar and intended to have children with Sarah his wife. Jacob responded: Sarah herself went and gave her maid to Abraham, to have children. Rachel answered: If so, I will give you my maid Bilhah. Have children and perhaps I will also be fulfilled from this merit. So writes <i>Rashi.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 30:3.</i>
<i>Bahya</i> writes. Rachel said: my name is Rachel. There is no <i>letter</i> in my name that is in the name of the Holy One. Leah has one <i>letter</i> in her name that is in the name of the Holy One, that is a <i>heh.</i> The <i>heh</i> causes her to have children. Therefore, I will give my maid, who I called Bilhah, which has two <i>heh</i>’<i>s</i> in her name. One <i>heh</i> will cause that she will have children and the other <i>heh</i> will cause that I will also have children.<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 29:35.</i>
“<i>Bilhah conceived and bore Jacob a son</i>” [30:5]. <i>Ramban</i> writes. The Torah writes, “<i>bore to Jacob.</i>” Bilhah bore to Jacob. That is, when the children were born to the maidservants, Jacob loved the children of the maidservants equally.<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban, Genesis, 30:5.</i> She had a son, <i>Dan.</i> Then she was pregnant again and had another son and she called him <i>Naphtali.</i> That means, God has accepted my prayer.
<i>Toldot Yizhak</i> asks a question. Why did <i>Leah</i> give her maidservant to <i>Jacob?</i> Didn’t she have enough children? The explanation is that she thought that from this merit Leah would also have more children. Rachel gave her maidservant that she should have children and that Rachel should have children, as a result of the merit. That is why it is written about Rachel, “<i>she may bear on my knees and that through her I too may have children</i>” [30:3]. This means, my maid should have a child and I should also have a child as a result of the merit. However, Leah said: the children of my maid are not important in my eyes, since I have, <i>thanks to God</i>, my own children. However, I will give the maid to my husband, in the hope that from this merit, I will have more children. Therefore, it is written concerning Leah, “<i>she took her maid Zilpah and gave her to Jacob</i>” [30:9]. That is to say, it is not written, “<i>she may bear on my knees</i>,” that the maid should have children, but that she should have more children in her womb. When Leah saw that Zilpah had a son with her husband Jacob, she was upset. She said: I did not desire to have children from the maid. The Holy One takes no notice of me because I have ceased to have children and the child that my maid gave birth to, came through the <i>constellations and stars</i> that caused my maid to have a child. Therefore, she called the maid’s son, <i>Gad.</i> This means, astrological sign. That is, the son came through the constellations in heaven. She gave birth to <i>Zevulun</i> and Leah said, since I will have six children, my husband will move in with me. Because Leah did not speak properly about the Holy One, when she said that the maid’s children did not come form the Holy One, but through the <i>constellations</i>, therefore God punished her and gave her an evil daughter. She said: God is punishing me, <i>praised be the true Judge.</i> Therefore, her daughter was called <i>Dinah.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Genesis, 30:1–22.</i>
“<i>Zilpah, the maid of Leah, gave birth</i>” [30:12]. <i>Rashi</i> asks a question. Why is it not written, <i>she conceived and gave birth?</i> This means, she became pregnant and gave birth. The explanation is that Zilpah was very young and did not recognize that she was pregnant. Laban the <i>deceiver</i>, had given her to Leah, the oldest daughter, in the expectation that Jacob should think that because Zilpah was in the room where Leah was lying in the bed, this must be Rachel, since Zilpah was the youngest one and Rachel was also the youngest one.<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 30:10.</i>
“<i>He found mandrakes in the field</i>” [30:14]. Reuben went to where they were cutting wheat and found mandrakes in the field and brought them to Leah, his mother. Ramban and Bahya write. The herb that Reuben found has a good fragrance and cause women to become pregnant from it. One puts them in the bed and arouses the husband’s inclination that he should desire to sleep with his wife. Therefore, when Rachel saw the <i>mandrakes</i>, the herb, at Leah’s she said to Leah: give me the herbs. She thought that they would make the bed fragrant and Jacob would have desire for Rachel.<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban, Genesis, 30:14; Bahya, Genesis, 30:14.</i>
Leah became angry with Rachel and said: you want to take away my husband with the fragrant herbs. Rachel responded: I will reward you with one night that Jacob wanted to sleep with me. You should sleep with him in return this night. The custom was that Jacob slept with each wife one night and the other wife the next night. Therefore, because Rachel sold the night’s sleep with the righteous one, she was not worthy to lie with Jacob in the cave.<sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 30:15.</i>
“<i>Jacob came from the field</i>” [30:16]. Jacob came from the field. Leah came toward him and told him. You will sleep with me this night. I have rented you. He slept with her and had a son. She called him <i>Issachar.</i> That is, the Holy One has given me a son, because I wanted Jacob and He has given me a son.
“<i>This time my husband will exalt me</i>” [30:20]. Leah had another son, the sixth one. She said: my husband will spend all the nights with me because I have more children than the other wives. That is why she called him <i>Zebulon</i>, which means, spend the night.
“<i>Last, she bore him a daughter</i>” [30:21]. Afterwards, Leah gave birth to a daughter. <i>Hizkuni</i> writes. Why is it not written, <i>she conceived</i>, that Leah was pregnant and gave birth to Dinah? The explanation is that Dinah was born with <i>Zebulon.</i> They were twins. <i>Hizkuni</i> gives another explanation. It is not written, <i>she conceived</i>, since Leah was supposed to have a son, <i>Joseph.</i> However, Leah prayed in the first trimester that she should have a daughter in the hope that Rachel should have Joseph. The Holy One heard her prayer and made her child a daughter in her womb. Therefore, it is written, “<i>she gave birth to a daughter</i>” [30:21]. She had a daughter. That is to say, the child she was carrying was a son, but what she gave birth to was a daughter. The daughter was called Dinah, since Leah <i>judged</i> herself and desired to have a daughter.<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 30:21.</i>
“<i>God remembered Rachel</i>” [30:22]. The Holy One remembered that Rachel had acted with lovingkindness toward Leah and taught her the <i>signs</i> that Jacob had taught Rachel that she should respond to him, in the bed, so that he would know that she was Rachel. She taught the same <i>signs</i> to Leah that she should respond to Jacob in bed. The Holy One remembered that Rachel had cried greatly when she thought that Jacob would <i>divorce</i> her because she had no children and Esau would marry her. Therefore, the Holy One remembered her piety and gave her a son.<sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 30:22.</i>
“<i>God has taken away my disgrace</i>” [30:23]. When Rachel had a son, she said: people said that I would have no children and Jacob would divorce me and Esau would marry me. Now my <i>disgrace</i> has been removed, since I have a son. Therefore, she named him Joseph. This means, removed. Another explanation is that when a woman has children, if the woman does something wrong, she says that the child did it. One asks, who broke the glass, she can say that her son did it. Or, who ate the figs? She says that the child did it. With this, her <i>disgrace</i> was removed. So writes <i>Rashi.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">83</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 30:23.</i>
However, <i>Toldot Yizhak</i> writes. The custom was that each one had two wives. One was to have children. She went around the house like a widow, without nice clothes or jewelry. The other woman was beautifully adorned and he kept her to sleep with. He gave her an herb to drink that she should not become pregnant, in the hope that she should remain beautiful. That is why the mockers said that Jacob had two wives. One is beautiful and Jacob had given her a drink so that should not have children. This was Rachel. However, now that Rachel had a son, Rachel said: my disgrace has been removed.<sup class="footnote-marker">84</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Genesis, 30:23.</i>
“<i>May the Lord add another son for me</i>” [30:24]. Rachel said: God should give me another son. <i>Rashi</i> asks a question here. Why did she ask for one son and not for many children? The explanation is that Rachel knew <i>prophetically</i> that Jacob would only have twelve children. Therefore, Rachel said: if only one more son, then she prayed, let that one be mine.<sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 30:24.</i>
“<i>After Rachel had borne Joseph</i>” [30:25]. When Joseph was born, who was the <i>opponent</i> of Esau, Jacob no longer feared Esau and wanted to return home.<sup class="footnote-marker">86</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 30:25.</i>
<i>Toldot</i> [<i>Yizhak</i>] writes here. Why is Joseph more the opponent of Esau than the other brothers? The explanation is that Joseph would come with Esau to court and would say, have you done evil to your brother, Jacob? Esau could not answer: you have also done evil to your brother. Joseph only did good for his brothers, and they did evil to him and sold him. However, the other brothers could not say to Esau: have you done evil to your brother, Jacob? He could respond to them, you have also done evil to your brother, Joseph.<sup class="footnote-marker">87</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Genesis, 30:25.</i>
“<i>Give me my wives</i>” [30:26]. Jacob said: I do not want to leave you without <i>permission.</i> Therefore, give me my wives and children.<sup class="footnote-marker">88</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 30:26.</i>
“<i>Laban said to him, if you will indulge me, I have learned by divination that the Lord has blessed me on your behalf</i>” [30:27]. Laban said to Jacob: I ask you, remain here with me. I have found that the blessing in my house is on your account. Though I have had no son and since you came, I have also had sons. If Laban had had sons, he would not have sent his daughters to guard the sheep.<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 30:27.</i>
<i>Hizkuni</i> asks a question. One could say that when Jacob came, Laban had some sons, but they were very small and could not guard the sheep. Therefore, Rachel had to guard them.<sup class="footnote-marker">90</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 30:27.</i>
How is it that Laban had no sons before Jacob came? <i>Hizkuni</i> gives no answer to the question. However, Rabbi Isserlein does give an explanation. If Laban had a son, even if he was very small, Laban would not have sent Rachel to guard the sheep. He would rather have sent Zilpah or Bilhah to guard. However, because he had no son, he preferred to send Rachel. She would guard better, since she would inherit everything, because he still had no son, the daughters inherit. Rachel faithfully pastured the sheep, but Zilpah and Bilhah were his daughters from concubines and they would not inherit, and would not faithfully guard.<sup class="footnote-marker">91</sup><i class="footnote">Be’ure Maharai, Genesis, 30:27.</i>
“<i>Name the wages due from me</i>” [30:28]. Laban said: tell me what your wages are and I will give it to you, but remain with me. <i>Toldot Yizhak</i> writes. Laban had more daughters and he said to Jacob, serve me. I will give you more of my daughters as wives. This is the meaning of “<i>name the wages.</i>” That is, I will give you another woman. Jacob responded: I have four and that is enough.<sup class="footnote-marker">92</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Genesis, 30:31–32.</i>
“<i>The Lord has blessed you wherever I turned</i>” [30:30]. Jacob said: I have served you faithfully and the Holy One blessed you for my sake.
“<i>He said, what shall I pay you</i>” [30:31]. Laban said: what shall I give you for your earlier service that you served me. Jacob responded: “<i>pay me nothing</i>” [30:31]. That is, for the earlier service, give me nothing, since I served you for the wives. However, if you want me to serve you further, come and we will see the sheep.<sup class="footnote-marker">93</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 30:31.</i>
“<i>Removing today from there every speckled and spotted animal</i>” [30:32]. Take out your sheep, the speckled and spotted ones and from the lambs, the blotched ones. Put them aside and the sheep that are speckled and spotted will be mine. If you will find among my sheep, those that are not spotted or speckled, then I will have <i>stolen</i> them.<sup class="footnote-marker">94</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 30:32.</i>
“<i>That day he removed the streaked goats</i>” [30:35]. <i>Ramban</i> writes. Laban was a deceiver. Jacob had taken out the streaked and spotted goats. Laban went and removed the male and female goats and even the <i>streaked</i> ones that are streaked with white streaks on their feet. He also removed those that were a little white. Therefore, Jacob the righteous one did a little deception to Laban with the stick. Since Laban had taken away all the spotted and streaked ones, from what would the remaining sheep get spots or streaks?<sup class="footnote-marker">95</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban, Genesis, 30:35.</i>
“<i>He put a distance of three days journey</i>” [30:36]. Laban drove his speckled and streaked sheep away, in the expectation that few speckled, streaked, and spotted sheep would be born.
“<i>Jacob took a white stick</i>” [30:37]. Jacob took sticks of birch, hazel and boxwood and speckled the sticks. He placed them by the water trough where the sheep used to drink, in the hope that the sheep would see the sticks and would have speckled sheep. As soon as the sheep came to the sticks they became frightened and jumped back. The rams mated with the sheep and they also had speckled sheep. <i>Rabbi Oshiah</i> said: the water contained the sperm and they gave birth to speckled ones.<sup class="footnote-marker">96</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 30:38.</i>
“<i>Jacob separated the lambs</i>” [30:40]. Jacob separated the sheep that were born speckled from the other sheep, in the hope that the other sheep should see them and give birth to speckled ones.<sup class="footnote-marker">97</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 30:40.</i>
“<i>The animals were mating</i>” [30:41]. Jacob placed the sticks before the strong rams, who were always running after the sheep, since their nature was strong, and mated with the sheep in the hope that they would give birth to new strong sheep.<sup class="footnote-marker">98</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban, Genesis, 30:41.</i> “<i>Mating</i>” – This means, those who quickly mate and are healthy.<sup class="footnote-marker">99</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 30:41.</i>

“<i>He had many sheep</i>” [30:43]. The blessing came to Jacob’s sheep, more than other sheep, and camels, donkeys, and male and female servants.<sup class="footnote-marker">101</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 30:43.</i>
Jacob heard the talk of Laban’s children, saying, how did Jacob acquire so much goods. This all belongs to Laban, our father. The Holy One appeared to Jacob and said to him: return to your land, to your home, and I will be with you. Jacob sent to Rachel and to Leah and said: the Holy One has appeared to me. Therefore, dear wives, you know well that I have <i>faithfully</i> worked for your father and your father has deceived me ten times, but the Holy One has always helped me.
“<i>If he will say thus, the speckled shall be your wages, then all the flocks bore</i>” [31:8]. <i>Ramban</i> and <i>Toldot Yizhak</i> ask a question. Why does the verse say, “<i>if he will say thus</i>”? This means, when he will say. It should have said, when he said, because Jacob said here, what had happened to him with Laban. It should have said, <i>if he said thus.</i> This means, when he said. The explanation is that Laban was a great deceiver. He knew well that whatever he would select with Jacob, the Holy One would give him in great quantity. Therefore, Laban selected, before they were pregnant, only the spotted ones should be for Jacob, expecting that the Holy One would make all of them pregnant with spotted ones. Laban thought to himself that before they will give birth, I would select differently, expecting that the spotted ones should be for Laban. The Holy One knew Laban’s intentions and what he would do. Therefore, as soon as Laban selected the spotted ones and intended to say this, the Holy One caused them to be pregnant with the other opinion, and after the pregnancy, the sheep became that way. Therefore, the verse says, “<i>if he will say thus</i>,” as he would say later.<sup class="footnote-marker">102</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban, Genesis, 31:8; Toldot Yizhak, Genesis, 31:8.</i>
“<i>Pay me nothing</i>” [30:31]. Jacob said to Laban. The blessing is not in what one counts. Therefore, give me something that one does not count. Let us go through the sheep and those that are spotted will be mine. But if I would say that you should give me a lot of money, there will be no blessing in something that one counts. You will not give it to me because there is no blessing in it. Another explanation is that Jacob said: If you would promise to give it, you would not keep your word and would not give it to me. Therefore, I desire from you that you allow me to guard your animals. I will have their pasture in my hands and then I will certainly have my pay. So writes the <i>Toldot Yizhak.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">103</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Genesis, 30:31–32.</i>
“<i>I saw that the he-goats mating with the flock were streaked</i>” [31:10]. I saw in my dream how the rams mated with the sheep. Jacob said to his wives: even though Laban had removed all the spotted and streaked ones in the hope that the sheep would not give birth to spotted and streaked ones. Yet, the <i>angel</i> brought spotted and streaked lambs from Laban’s sheep and placed them among Jacob’s sheep in the expectation that the sheep would give birth this way.<sup class="footnote-marker">104</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 31:10.</i>
“<i>The angel said to me</i> … <i>note well</i>” [31:11–12]. The <i>angel</i> said to me: see the rams that are mounting the sheep that are spotted and streaked. I have seen the deceit that Laban want to do. I am your God who appeared to you in <i>Beth El.</i> Leave this land now and return to your land where you were born.
<i>Bahya</i> asks a question here. How could the angel tell Jacob to look at the rams mounting the goats or the sheep? It is a transgression to see this, as the Talmud states. A person should not watch when the hen mates with the rooster, or animals mate with each other.<sup class="footnote-marker">105</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Avodah Zarah</i> 20b.</i> The explanation is that this happened in a dream. Jacob was accustomed to the ways of nature. <i>Heaven forbid</i>, he did not want to be deceitful to Laban, but only to protect himself that he should come out of it without any loss. From this Torah portion we can learn that a person should make himself holy when he has sexual relations with his wife, since everything follows the thought. Even the animals that saw the striped sticks had such lambs. Therefore, our sages said: “<i>a person should always sanctify himself during sexual relations.</i>”<sup class="footnote-marker">106</sup><i class="footnote">According to C.B. Chavel, in his edition of Bahya’s commentary, this passage is not found in Talmudic literature. He did find it mentioned in <i>Emunah ve-Bitahon</i> by Ramban.</i> This means, a person should have good thoughts when he wants to have sexual relations with his wife. He should have no thoughts about other women. The women, even more so, should not have other thoughts, since much depends on the thoughts of the women. When she has good thoughts, then the child will be pious.<sup class="footnote-marker">107</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 30:37.</i>
“<i>He has used up our purchase price</i>” [31:15]. Rachel and Leah said: we have nothing to hope for, to inherit in our father’s house. Since he has sons, even the dowry he promised us, even the money has been taken away. However, that which the Holy One has put aside, that we have received. Therefore, do what God has told you.<sup class="footnote-marker">108</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 31:15–16.</i>
“<i>Jacob rose and placed his children and his wives</i>” [31:17]. Jacob took his children first and then his wives. Esau first took his wives and then his children.<sup class="footnote-marker">109</sup><i class="footnote">The reference to Esau is found in Genesis, 36:6.</i>
<i>Devek Tov</i> writes. Jacob was righteous. His thought was to have children with his wives. Therefore, his children were more beloved than his wives. However, Esau was an evildoer. He did not have wives to have children. Therefore, the wives were more beloved than the children and placed them first. So writes <i>Devek Tov on Rashi.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">110</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Devek Tov,</i> Genesis<i>,</i> 31:17, note, 30.</i>
<i>Hizkuni</i> writes in Exodus, “<i>Moses took his wife and his sons</i>” [Exodus 4:20]. Why did Jacob first put his children on the camels and <i>Moses</i> first put his wife on the donkey and then put his children on it. The explanation is that the children of Moses were very small. They could not sit on the donkey by themselves. Therefore, Moses had to first place his wife on the donkey and afterwards he put the children in the lap of their mother. However, with Jacob, the children were grown and strong. They could sit on the camels by themselves. Thus he put the children on the camel first.<sup class="footnote-marker">111</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Exodus, 20:4.</i>
One can give another explanation. Jacob was running away from Laban and he feared that Laban would pursue him and kill whomever he reached first. Therefore, Jacob put the children in front and the wives he put in the back. He thought that if Laban would come quickly; let him come upon his daughters. Perhaps he will have more <i>mercy</i> on his daughters than on his grandchildren.<sup class="footnote-marker">112</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 32:23.</i> Also, if Laban’s people would want to kill, let them rather kill the wives rather than the children. Therefore, he put the wives in the back. However, Moses’s enemy was in front of him, since he had many <i>enemies</i> in <i>Egypt.</i> Therefore, he put his wife in front and the children in back.
“<i>Rachel stole her father</i>’<i>s household idols</i>” [31:19]. Rachel stole Laban’s <i>idols</i>, so that she would separate her father from his <i>idols.</i> So write <i>Rashi</i> and <i>Hizkuni.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">113</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi and Hizkuni, Genesis, 31:19.</i>
However, <i>Toldot Yizhak</i> writes that she took Laban’s images in the hope that the images would not tell that Jacob had run away and that Laban should say, my gods allowed themselves to be stolen, so they must be nothing. <i>Rabbi Abraham</i> asks: why did Rachel not hide and bury them at Laban’s. The explanation is that she did not have the time to bury them on the way, since there were many maids and servants and twelve children all together. They would have seen her bury them and Rachel did not want them to know about this.<sup class="footnote-marker">114</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Genesis, 31:19.</i>
<i>Bahya</i> writes. They made the images by taking a person who was a firstborn and they slaughtered him. They preserve him in salt and <i>spices</i> and they take a golden tablet and write <i>magical things</i> on it and place the tablet under the tongue of the dead person. They place the dead person in a wall and light candles before him and bow down to him. They speak an incantation and he responds to what they ask.<sup class="footnote-marker">115</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 31:19.</i>
“<i>On the third day, Laban was told that Jacob had fled</i>” [31:22]. Laban was told on the third day that Jacob had run away and that Jacob was three days journey from Laban.<sup class="footnote-marker">116</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 31:22.</i>
“<i>He pursued him a distance of seven days</i>” [31:22]. Laban pursued him with many people and he reached Jacob on the seventh day. The first three days the <i>messenger</i> went to tell Laban, and Jacob went another three days further. Thus, Jacob was six days journey from Laban and on the seventh day Laban reached Jacob. From here we learn that Laban traveled in one day as far as Jacob traveled in seven days.<sup class="footnote-marker">117</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 31:23.</i>
<i>Hizkuni</i> writes here that Laban went quickly. However, Jacob traveled slowly. Or, Laban traveled quickly, as is the custom of among thieves who run quickly. However, Jacob had to travel slowly since he had great wealth, many animals and a large household.<sup class="footnote-marker">118</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 31:22.</i>
“<i>Good or bad</i>” [31:24]. The Holy One came to Laban in a dream and said to him. Do not do good or bad with Jacob. Rashi writes. Do not even speak good things with Jacob, since the good of the evildoers is only evil among the righteous.<sup class="footnote-marker">119</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 31:24.</i>
<i>Bahya</i> writes. It could be that Jacob left on a Sunday and <i>Laban</i> reached him on the <i>Sabbath.</i> Laban was a <i>gentile</i> and traveled the whole <i>Sabbath.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">120</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 31:22.</i>
“<i>Why did you flee in secrecy</i>” [31:27]. Laban said: why did you run away from me and did not tell me? I would have sent you off with joy and song. You did not let me kiss my sons and daughters.
“<i>I have it in my power</i>” [31:29]. Laban said: I could have done evil with you, but the Holy One who appeared to me told me that I should do no evil to you.
<i>Hizkuni</i> writes. Laban said: I could have done evil; that you well understand. God appeared to me since God feared that I would do evil to you. Therefore, He warned me.<sup class="footnote-marker">121</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 31:29.</i>
“<i>Why did you steal my gods</i>” [31:30]. Laban said: why did you steal my god? Jacob responded: wherever you will find it, that person should not live. <i>Rashi</i> writes: as a result of that <i>curse</i>, Rachel died on the way. Jacob did not know that Rachel had taken the images.<sup class="footnote-marker">122</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 31:32.</i>
“<i>Laban went into Jacob</i>’<i>s tent and Leah</i>’<i>s tent and the tent of the two maidservants, but he did not find them. Leaving Leah</i>’<i>s tent, he entered Rachel</i>’<i>s tent</i>” [31:33]. <i>Rashi</i> writes. Laban went into Rachel’s tent, since Jacob lived with Rachel. Laban first went into Rachel’s tent which was Jacob’s primary dwelling.<sup class="footnote-marker">123</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 31:33.</i> Afterwards, Laban went into <i>Leah</i>’<i>s</i> tent and into the tents of <i>Zilpah</i> and <i>Bilhah</i> and found nothing. Then he again went into <i>Rachel</i>’<i>s</i> tent. He said: I know <i>Rachel</i> well. She used to touch everything and he searched there once again. However, Rachel had quickly placed the images underneath her and sat on them. She said to her father that she was having her <i>menstrual period</i> and could not get up.
<i>Ramban</i> writes here. Why did she say to her father, I couldn’t stand up, since when a woman has her period she cannot stand up? The explanation is that Rachel was a woman who had little <i>menstrual blood.</i> When a woman has not had children, her <i>menstrual blood</i> is light, and therefore when she had her period, such a woman is weaker than other women. That is why Rachel said: I am weak and cannot stand up.<sup class="footnote-marker">124</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban, Genesis, 31:35.</i>
Furthermore, <i>Ramban</i> and <i>Bahya</i> write that as soon as Rachel said that she had her period, Laban went away from her. In those days they would separate themselves from a menstruating woman. They would not even speak with her. The Talmud also says that one should not step in the footsteps of a woman who has her period.<sup class="footnote-marker">125</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban, Genesis, 31:35; Bahya, Genesis, 31:35. C.B. Chavel in his edition of Bahya’s commentary suggests that the source is <i>Baraita de-Nidah</i>, a post-Talmudic text.</i>
“<i>Jacob became incensed</i>” [31:36]. Jacob said angrily: what have you found of your vessels by me? He said: I served you twenty years. Your sheep and she-goats did not miscarry and no lion devoured them.<sup class="footnote-marker">126</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 31:38–39.</i>
I was a <i>paid watchman</i> and I paid you for everything. You should have honored me because I worked for fourteen years for your daughters, and six years for the sheep and you have deceived me ten times. I was supposed to work for you for six years for the spotted sheep. The first year they had not been born yet and the next five years you deceived me twice, since the small animals give birth twice a year and each time Laban changed his words, twice very year.<sup class="footnote-marker">127</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 31:41.</i> As soon as the animals became pregnant, Laban changed his mind. Once streaked and the next time spotted.<sup class="footnote-marker">128</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 31:41.</i>
<i>Ramban</i> asks a question. Jacob told him to search in the tent at first. Why did Jacob later get angry? The explanation is that Jacob thought that perhaps his wife or child had taken the images, but now he saw that he found nothing. Jacob said: you came with <i>accusations</i> against me.<sup class="footnote-marker">129</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban, Genesis, 31:36.</i>
“<i>The daughters are my daughters, the children are my children</i>” [31:43]. Laban said: the daughters are my daughters and the sons are my sons. <i>Bahya</i> writes in the name of <i>Rabbenu Hananel. Laban lied</i>, as our <i>sages</i> said: the grandchildren of sons are like his own sons, but the grandchildren of daughters are not like his own children. <i>Laban</i> also <i>lied</i> when he said: the sheep are mine. He had given him the sheep himself.<sup class="footnote-marker">130</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 31:43.</i>
“<i>Jacob took a stone and set it up as a pillar</i>” [31:45]. Jacob took a stone and made a pile. Laban said to Jacob that the pile of stones should be a <i>witness</i> between us that nobody should do any evil to his <i>friend.</i>

“<i>Jacob sent messengers</i>” [32:4]. Jacob sent angels from heaven, that they should go to his brother Esau.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 32:4.</i> <i>Bahya</i> writes. They were real angels, since it is written in the <i>Torah portion</i>, “<i>the messengers returned</i>” [32:7]. This means, the <i>angels</i> returned to Jacob and it is not written that they went, since they were real <i>angels.</i> They flew to Esau immediately and returned to Jacob immediately.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 32:4.</i>
Rabbi Isserl writes. They were real angels, since the verse said, “<i>thus shall you say to my lord Esau</i>” [32:5]. This means, you should say to my lord Esau. Why does he honor him by calling him lord? The explanation is that the <i>angel of Esau</i> was also among the <i>angels.</i> Therefore, Jacob honored Esau and called him lord. That is, Jacob wanted to humble himself before the angel of Esau, so that the angel would do no harm.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Be’ure Maharai, Genesis, 32:4.</i>
“<i>I stayed with Laban</i>” [32:5]. He told them to say to Esau. You hate me for nothing, since I was only a servant and no lord, in the house of Laban. The <i>blessing</i> of my father that he blessed me that I should be a lord over my brothers was not fulfilled for me. Therefore, he said, “<i>I stayed.</i>” He meant by this, there are six hundred and thirteen commandments in the Torah.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The gematria of the word “<i>I stayed</i>” [<i>garti</i>] is six hundred and thirteen.</i> That is to say, Jacob said to Esau, do not think because I lived with the evildoer Laban, that I did not observe the Torah, and you will vanquish me.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 32:5.</i> Since our father said that when Jacob will not study Torah, then Esau will have dominion over Jacob.

“<i>I have acquired cattle, asses, sheep and slaves</i>” [32:6]. Jacob said to Esau: the blessing of my father was “<i>of the dew of heaven and the fat of the earth</i>” [27:28]. This means, the dew of heaven and the fat of the earth. That which I have is not from heaven nor is it from the earth, but is an ox, an ass, and sheep and goats.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 32:6.</i>
Bahya writes here. Why did the verse here write oxen and asses first, and then sheep? The Torah would first write the sheep, since they are the most important of all the animals, as we find with Abraham, “<i>I acquired sheep and cattle</i>” [Genesis, 12:16], and concerning Jacob, “<i>he had many sheep, goats and cattle</i>” [30:43]. The explanation is that Jacob did not want to mention sheep and goats, since he thought: I took the <i>blessing</i> from Esau through sheep and goats. I took a young goat from the pen and I slaughtered it and made food for my father. I put the fur on my hands and my throat, so that Isaac should not recognize me. That is why Jacob did not want to mention “<i>I have sheep</i>,” but he first mentioned, “<i>I have oxen and asses.</i>” This is also why later in the Torah portion, when Esau appeared to Jacob and Jacob saw that Esau was at peace with him, Jacob first mentioned <i>sheep</i>, and afterwards <i>oxen and asses.</i> The <i>Midrash</i> writes that he first mentioned <i>oxen and asses.</i> This shows us that Joseph was called <i>ox</i> and he was the adversary of Esau. That is to say, Jacob showed Esau that he was not afraid, since he had the help of Joseph.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 32:6.</i>
“<i>We came to your brother Esau</i>” [32:7]. <i>Rashi</i> writes: the <i>messengers</i> said to Jacob. You called Esau brother, but Esau is the same old Esau, an evildoer.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 32:7.</i>
“<i>He is also coming</i>” [32:7]. Bahya writes that the verse teaches us that the angel of Esau was also coming toward Jacob to help Esau. Therefore, the word “<i>also</i>” is written here.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 32:7.</i>
“<i>And four hundred men with him</i>” [32:8]. Four hundred men went with Esau.
“<i>Jacob was greatly frightened and anxious</i>” [32:8]. Jacob was very frightened that they should not kill him and he was also afraid that he should not kill other people, as Rashi writes.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 32:8.</i>
Bahya writes that Jacob was afraid of Esau and he was afraid of Esau’s guardian angel.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 32:7.</i>
<i>Hizkuni</i> also writes: why was Jacob afraid? There were angels to protect him. The explanation is that the angels who were there, one was <i>Michael</i>, and the other one was <i>Samael</i>, the evil one, the guardian angel of Esau. That is why Jacob was very afraid.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 32:8.</i>
<i>Ibn Shuaib</i> and <i>Toldot Yizhak</i> write. Jacob was afraid that he would be killed, and he was also pained that Esau was coming to kill him. This means that my father must have died. Esau had said that when his father would die, he would kill Jacob. Jacob was pained that he did not honor his father, while Esau had honored his father greatly.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Ibn Shuaib, <i>Derashot</i>, I; 67; Toldot Yizhak, Genesis, 32:7.</i>
<i>Toldot Yizhak</i> asks a question. Why does the verse say, “<i>Jacob was greatly frightened</i>” [32:8]? This means, Jacob was very afraid that they would kill him. Afterwards, it says, “<i>he was afraid</i>” [32:8], and it is not written, “<i>he was very afraid.</i>” He was sad that he would kill strangers. The explanation is that Jacob said: if I will kill strangers, then the sin is not so great as the Talmud says, “<i>if someone comes to kill you, rise up and kill him first.</i>”<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Sanhedrin,</i> 72a.</i> This means, if someone comes to kill you rise up and kill him first. Therefore, it is written, “<i>Jacob was greatly frightened</i>” [32:8]. That is to say, he was very afraid that he would be killed. “<i>He was afraid</i>,” he was afraid that he would kill others, but it is not written “<i>greatly</i>” that he was very afraid to kill others.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Genesis, 32:7.</i>
“<i>The other camp may yet escape</i>” [32:9]. Jacob divided his group into two sides. He said: if Esau will overcome one side, he and his people will be exhausted and weak. When he will come to the other side, they will be fresh and strong and Esau will be weak from the first side. So write <i>Toldot Yizhak</i> and <i>Hizkuni.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Genesis, 32:8; Hizkuni, Genesis, 32:9.</i>
<i>Bahya</i> writes. The Torah portion teaches us how we Israelites should behave in the exile, with Esau. Just as Jacob prepared himself with three things, for <i>war</i>, for <i>prayer</i> and with <i>presents</i>, so too, should we do in the exile. We must give presents to the nations and must speak kind words to them. We must pray to the Holy One. However, waging war is not possible, as the verse says, “<i>I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem</i>” [Song of Songs 2:7]. This means, I adjure you Israel that you should not wage war with the nations.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 32:8.</i>
From this Torah portion we also learn that our sages said: “<i>A person should always divide his assets into thirds; a third in land, a third in goods, and a third in hand.</i>”<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Baba Mezia,</i> 42a.</i> This means, that the person should divide his assets into three parts. One <i>third</i> should be in <i>land</i> and houses; one <i>third</i> should be in <i>merchandise</i>; and one <i>third</i> should be money in hand, as the verse says. “<i>The Lord will ordain blessings for you upon your barns</i>” [Deuteronomy 28:8]. This means, merchandise. “<i>Upon all your undertakings</i>” [Deuteronomy, 28:8]. This means, money in your hand. “<i>He will bless you in the land</i>” [Deuteronomy, 28:8]. This means, land. The Torah portion also teaches us, “<i>the other camp may yet escape</i>” [32:9]. If, <i>heaven forbid</i>, an evil king arises who wants to do evil to Israel, and expels Israel, the Holy One sends a good king, in the expectation that Israel should remain in the world.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 32:9.</i>
“<i>I am unworthy of all the kindness</i>” [32:11]. Jacob said: my merits have been reduced. That is to say, Jacob said: I have accepted goodness from the Holy One. He will not do any more kindness, since I am not worthy to receive kindness from the Holy One. Even though the Holy One promised me to do kindness, who can know if my sins are not too numerous?<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 32:11.</i>
“<i>With my staff alone I crossed</i>” [32:11]. Jacob said: I had nothing of my own when I ran away from Esau, except for my staff. Now I have become two groups of people, with goods and animals. The <i>Midrash</i><sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanhuma</i>, ed. Buber, <i>Vayetze</i>, 3.</i> writes, “<i>With my staff alone I crossed</i>” [32:11], means that Jacob took his staff and hit the Jordan, which spilt the water, and he crossed on dry land.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 32:11.</i>
<i>Bahya</i> writes. From this Torah portion we learn that when things go well for a person, he should also think about the day when things went poorly for him, in the expectation that he should praise the Holy One, who helped him out of the great need and <i>poverty</i> and to <i>wealth.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 32:11.</i>
“<i>I fear, he may come and strike me down, mothers and children alike</i>” [32:12]. Jacob said: I am afraid that he will kill the mothers and the children. Jacob was not afraid that he would be killed, since the Holy One promised that He would protect him from all evil.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 32:12.</i>
“<i>I will make your offspring as the sands of the sea</i>” [32:13]. Jacob said: if he will kill the children and the mothers, where will be the blessing that my children will be like the sand of the sea.
“<i>He selected from what was at hand presents</i>” [32:14]. He took <i>precious stones</i> in his hand and wanted to present them to Esau.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 32:14.</i>
<i>Bahya</i> and <i>Toldot Yizhak</i> write. He took a bird in his hand with which one hunts <i>animals</i>, called a hawk. Nobles carry them on their arm to hunt animals with them. Jacob wanted to present the bird to Esau, since Esau was a hunter.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Genesis, 32:13; Bahya, Genesis, 32:14.</i>
“<i>200 she-goats and 20 he-goats</i>” [32:15]. <i>Bahya</i> writes. Jacob put the goats in front of the animals, since they always go in front of the animals and because he had twenty times as many he-goats as the other animals. He mentions the camels after them because the camels were better than the other animals. Then he mentions the <i>kosher animals</i> and afterwards the donkeys and horses, which are <i>non-kosher animals.</i> Jacob also placed the animals according to the length of their pregnancy. Sheep and goats are pregnant for five <i>months</i>; camels for six <i>months</i>; cows for nine <i>months</i>; donkeys and horses for twelve <i>months.</i> Another explanation is that Jacob did not want to mention sheep and goats first. He thought: let not Esau hate me because I took away the blessing through goats. However, now that Jacob prayed, Jacob said to Esau, I am not afraid of you. Therefore, he began with goats. He said: I began the blessings through goats that I should be a lord over my brother and you should be my servant. Therefore, he mentioned donkeys and young foals at the end. That is to say, you will fall into the hands of the <i>Messiah</i>, who will ride on a donkey and on a young foal, as the verse says, “<i>Lo, your king is coming to you. He is victorious, triumphant, yet humble, riding on an ass, on a donkey foaled by a she-ass</i>” [Zechariah, 9:9]. Jacob showed all this with the <i>present</i> to Esau, how Israel will go into exile, and the number of animals was five hundred and fifty. Therefore, the <i>kingdom</i> of Esau began five hundred and fifty years before the <i>kingdom</i> of Israel was established.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 32:15.</i>
<i>Ba</i>’<i>al ha-Turim</i> writes. The verse says, “<i>200 she-goats and 20 he-goats; 200 ewes and 20 rams</i>” [32:15]. Each word ends with a <i>final mem.</i> This shows us that Jacob only sent animals that were not worthy to be sacrificed. That is to say, they had a defect [<i>mum</i>], which is shown by the [letter] mem.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Ba’al ha-Turim, Genesis, 32:15.</i>
<i>Rashi</i> writes. Jacob divided the animals in the following way. He gave ten she-goats for each he-goat; since the he-goat does not work he has to have ten she-goats to lie with. If you want to ask, does the animal have <i>sense</i> that the he-goat will lie with ten she-goats? Perhaps he will only lie with one she-goat. The explanation is that the animal no longer lies with the male when it gets pregnant. Therefore, the he-goat will certainly lie with ten she-goats, since he has nothing to do. Similarly, the ram who does nothing also needs ten ewes. However, the oxen do not have free time, since they must plow. Therefore, Jacob gave each ox four cows to lie with. The donkeys who travel long distances do not have free time and therefore Jacob gave each <i>male</i> donkey two <i>females.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 32:15.</i>
“<i>30 milch camels with their colts</i>” [32:16]. Thirty female camels and their males. <i>Rashi</i> asks a question here. Why did the verse not explicitly write about the males? The explanation is that the camels are very <i>modest.</i> They do not lie with their females in front of others. That is why the verse does not explicitly name them.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 32:16.</i>
<i>Toldot Yizhak</i> asks a question. Why did the Holy One not appear to Esau and say to him, do no evil to Jacob, like the Holy One appeared to Laban and said to him, do no evil to Jacob? The explanation is that the Holy One wants that there should be <i>nations</i> who will <i>persecute Israel</i>, in the expectation that they will be pious. With this explanation, another question is also explained. Why did Jacob not pray when Laban came to kill him? The explanation is that Jacob only prayed concerning Esau, who was the greatest evildoer to Israel, that he should not cause a great exile for his children in the future. However, Laban was only an evil for a specific time.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Genesis, 32:13.</i>
<i>Toldot Yizhak</i> asks another question. Why did the angels leave him and not protect him that nothing should happen to him? The explanation is that the Holy One wanted to show that the righteous are better than the angels, as we find with Jacob who fought with the angel who could not do anything and he vanquished the angel.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid.</i>
“<i>Keep a distance between droves</i>” [32:17]. Jacob said to his servants. Do not drove the animals close to each other to Esau; in the expectation that he should think that there are many animals. When Esau will encounter you and will ask you, whose animals are these? You should say, Jacob’s and they are an <i>offering</i> and a present to our lord Esau. Jacob is coming behind us. If Esau will ask, why did he not come immediately to meet me? You should respond that Jacob thought that he will remove the anger from our lord Esau and then he will come before you himself.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 32:17–21.</i>
<i>Bahya</i> writes. “<i>Keep a distance</i>” [32:17]. Jacob said: <i>Lord of the Universe</i>, when <i>troubles and exile</i> will come upon Israel, do not let the troubles come quickly, one after another. Let Israel have some rest between one trouble and the next one. When they will pay <i>taxes</i>, they should not have to give everything away at once.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 32:17.</i>
“<i>He remained in camp that night</i>” [32:22]. He spent the night among his people and not in his tent, since Jacob wanted to wage war with Esau if he would come at night.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban, Genesis, 32:22.</i>
“<i>He took his two wives, his two maid servants and his eleven children</i>” [32:23]. <i>Hizkuni</i> writes here. Why did he place the wives in front and then the children? The explanation is that he thought to himself, if Esau approaches to kill, it is better the wives than the children. However, when Jacob was running away from Laban he placed the children in front and then the wives, since Jacob thought that Laban is coming from behind toward me. It is better that Laban encounter his daughters first.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 32:23.</i> So writes <i>Hizkuni.</i>
However, <i>Rabbi Isserl</i> gives a different explanation. He says that the wives were in front, because the waters were split. The children did not want to go through the water first. They were afraid, as we find by the sea. Israel did not want to go into the sea until they were similarly split, until <i>Nachshon ben Aminadav</i> came and started to go first, and the Holy One gave him a good reward.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Be’ure Maharai, Genesis, 32:23.</i> So writes <i>Rabbi Isserl.</i>
“<i>And his eleven children</i>” [32:23]. He took eleven children. <i>Rashi</i> asks a question here. The verse only mentions eleven children. Here he certainly means the eleven sons, and where was Dinah? The explanation is that Jacob had locked Dinah in a box so that Esau should not see her and want to take her as a wife. Therefore, the Holy One punished Jacob that he did not give her as a wife to Esau. Perhaps Dinah might have made Esau pious. Therefore, because of Jacob’s sin, Dinah fell into the hands of <i>Shechem.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 32:23.</i>
“<i>He crossed the ford of Jabbok</i>” [32:23]. Jacob tested the water first and afterwards he took his household across the water.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban, Genesis, 32:23.</i>
“<i>Jacob was left alone</i>” [32:25]. Jacob remained behind alone, since he had forgotten a small jug out of which the small children drank, so that they should not die of thirst. This teaches us that money is <i>important</i> in the eyes of the righteous. The righteous one remembers that [acquiring] money faithfully and justly is very difficult, and they will not steal.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 32:25.</i>
Because he tarried, an angel came and wrestled with him until the dust of the earth rose up [in a cloud]. They wrestled until dawn and the angel was the angel of Esau.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 32:25.</i>
He searched for a sin that he had committed, so that he could harm Jacob and kill him. He found no <i>sin</i>; only that Jacob had married two sisters during their lifetime.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">The Torah permits marrying two sisters serially, the second after the death of the first, but not while both are still alive.</i> This is the meaning of the verse “<i>he saw that he had not prevailed against him</i>” [32:26]. That is to say, the angel saw that he could find no sin in Jacob, and he could do nothing to him.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 32:25.</i>
“<i>He wrenched Jacob</i>’<i>s hip</i>” [32:26]. He wrenched Jacob’s hip. That is to say, the hip that lay with two sisters. With this, the <i>angel</i> was able to prevail slightly over Jacob.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 32:25.</i>
<i>Ba</i>’<i>al ha-Turim</i> writes. The angel saw that he could not do anything to Jacob. He thought that he was an angel and wanted to see if he had a knee, since angels have no knees. Thus, the angel was able to wrench his hip.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">Ba’al ha-Turim, Genesis, 32:26.</i>
“<i>He said, let me go</i>” [32:27]. The angel said: send me away from you. The angel thought that because I was sent by the Holy One to Jacob, I do not want to go away without permission from Jacob. Therefore, the angel pleaded with Jacob to let him go, since Jacob was holding him.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 32:27.</i>
“<i>For dawn is breaking</i>” [32:27]. The morning star is about to rise. Jacob said to the angel, are you a thief that you say that it is almost day? It is customary for thieves to be afraid when it is day. The angel responded that he was no thief. However, since the day that he was created he never sang <i>praises</i> before the Holy One and now the time has come that I should sing <i>praises</i>, since the morning star is about to rise. Therefore, let me go. Jacob responded: I will not let you go until you will bless me and you should strengthen the <i>blessings</i> with which my father had blessed me. The <i>angel</i> responded: your name should be Israel, because you vanquished Esau and Laban and <i>angels.</i> Your name should not be Jacob. This means that you have falsified. That is to say, you took away the <i>blessing</i> from Esau with <i>deceit.</i> Now the <i>angel</i> of Esau agreed with the <i>blessings</i> that Jacob had received from his father. Therefore, we say, “<i>you will give truth to Jacob</i>” [Micah, 7:20]. That is to say, whatever Jacob did to Esau and Laban, he did everything with <i>truth</i> and no <i>deceit.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 32:27.</i>
The Midrash writes.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Genesis Rabbah</i>, 78.3.</i> “<i>For you have striven with divine beings</i>” [32:27]. This means that the image of Jacob is engraved on the <i>Throne of Glory</i> of the Holy One. Therefore, the <i>angel</i> said to Jacob: you have vanquished God. That is to say, you have dominion by God, since you are on the <i>Throne of Glory.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 32:29.</i>
<i>Hizkuni</i> writes. “<i>For dawn is breaking</i>” [32:27], means that the <i>angel</i> said: it is almost day.

“<i>Why do you ask my name?</i>” [32:30]. Jacob asked the angel, what is your name? The angel responded: why do you ask my name? The angel has no set name, but when he is sent on a mission, he is called by that name.<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 32:30.</i>
<i>Bahya</i> writes. The angel said: we never used to say our name. We do not want to make ourselves important. That is to say, that we should say that we do something by ourselves would be <i>something new</i>, since we do everything at the command of the Holy One. Some say, the explanation that the <i>angel</i> said, do not ask what my name is, because I was not able to do anything to you. It is <i>disgraceful</i> to me that one should know who I am. So writes <i>Bahya.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 32:30.</i>
<i>Hizkuni</i> writes. The <i>angel</i> said: I do not want to say my name; since the angels are afraid that one would adjure them with [magical] <i>names.</i> If they knew the <i>angel</i>’<i>s</i> name, they would be able to force the <i>angel</i> to do whatever the person desires. Therefore, the angel said: you do not need to know my name. You have vanquished me without [magical] <i>names.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 32:30.</i>
“<i>The sun rose</i>” [32:32]. The sun shined for Jacob. <i>Rashi</i> asks a question. Why does the sun shine for Jacob alone? When the sun shines, it shines for the whole world. The explanation is that the sun shined for Jacob’s sake, in the expectation that it will be a remedy for Jacob to heal hiship, since Jacob was limping. Therefore, the Holy One let the sun rise earlier than its normal time. We find that the sun set earlier for Jacob when he left <i>Beer Sheva.</i> Now the Holy One let the sun rise early for the sake of Jacob.<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 32:32.</i>
“<i>That is why the children of Israel do not eat the thigh muscle</i>” [32:33]. The children of <i>Israel</i> should not eat the hindquarter of the animals, but they should first remove the veins. <i>Hizkuni</i> writes. It is just that <i>Israel</i> should be <i>punished</i> that they should not eat the hindquarter, because they allowed Jacob to stand in the field. The <i>angel</i> wrenched Jacob’s hip, but if his children had been with Jacob, he would not have been hurt.<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 32:33.</i>
<i>Toldot Yizhak</i> writes. The angel caused Jacob to limp so that he would have to bow to Esau. When someone limps and walks, people think that he is bowing all the time. Therefore, it is written in the verse “<i>he bowed low to the ground seven times</i>” [33:3]. He bowed seven times.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Genesis, 32:32.</i>
“<i>Rachel and Joseph last</i>” [33:2]. Jacob placed Bilhah and her children and Zilpah and her children in front of Esau and then Leah with her children and Rachel with Joseph walking last. Jacob loved Rachel very much. That is why Rachel went last.<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 33:2.</i>
“<i>He himself went on ahead</i>” [33:3]. However, Jacob himself went ahead in front of his household. He thought, let Esau struggle with me first.<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 33:3.</i>
“<i>Esau ran to greet him</i>” [33:4]. Esau ran toward Jacob and embraced him, kissed him, and they cried.
“<i>Then the maids, with their children, came forward and bowed low</i>” [33:6]. Bilhah and Zilpah came with their children. Bilhah and Zilpah bowed down, but their children did not bow down. <i>Hizkuni</i> asks a question. Why did the children of Bilhah and Zilpah not bow down and the children of Rachel and Leah did bow down? The explanation is that the children of Bilhah and Zilpah thought to themselves, are we subservient that we should bow to Esau because we are the children of the <i>maidservants?</i><sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 33:6.</i>
“<i>Joseph and Rachel came forward</i>” [33:7]. <i>Rashi</i> asks a question. Why is <i>Joseph</i> mentioned before his mother, Rachel, and with all the other children, the mother is mentioned before their children? The explanation is that Joseph placed himself in front of his mother since she was very pretty, and so that Esau should not see her and want to take her.<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 33:7.</i>
“<i>We asked, what do you mean by all this company which I have met?</i>” [33:8]. Rashi writes. Esau encountered many <i>groups of angels</i> and they jostled and hit Esau’s people. The angels asked Esau’s people, who are you? They responded: we are with Esau. Then the angels hit them even more. They said: we are from <i>Isaac and Abraham</i>, and they hit them even more. Then they said: we are from the brother of Jacob and they made peace with them and did not beat them anymore.<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 33:8.</i> They said: you are ours.
“<i>Let what you have remain yours</i>” [33:9]. Esau <i>agreed</i> to the <i>blessings.</i> He said to Jacob, keep what you have. Jacob was blessed by his father Isaac, by Esau, and by Esau’s angel.<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 33:9.</i>
“<i>For to see your face is like seeing the face of God</i>” [33:10]. Jacob said: it is just that you should take a present from me, because I have seen you and this is like I have seen angels. That is to say, Jacob said to Esau: I have seen angels and they struggled with me and they could do nothing to me. That is to say, Esau should know that his angel had struggled with him and could do nothing, in the expectation that Esau should be afraid of Jacob.<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 33:10.</i>
<i>Bahya</i> writes. <i>Rabbi Yohanan</i> said: one is allowed to flatter evildoers out of fear, as Jacob did. He said to Esau: I see you gladly, like I had seen God. Even though Jacob hated Esau in his heart, yet Jacob flattered him, so that he should not do anything to him. In particular, Jacob said: “<i>like seeing the face of God</i>” [33:10]. In his heart, Jacob thought: I love you as much as the foreign god that you call <i>Elohim.</i> Similarly, Esau thought that “<i>Elohim</i>” means God. Our <i>sages</i> said that it is allowed to <i>flatter a gentile</i>, when the <i>gentile</i> thinks it is something <i>important</i> and the <i>Jew</i> thinks it is not.<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 33:10.</i>
“<i>He urged him, he accepted</i>” [33:11]. Jacob pleaded with Esau that he should take the present. Esau took the present and Esau said to Jacob: I will do you a favor and will go slowly.<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 33:11.</i>
Jacob very much wanted to keep Esau at a distance and he said: I cannot keep up with you. “<i>For the children are frail</i>” [33:13]. The children are frail and small. Bahya cites a midrash. Esau said to Jacob: let us divide <i>this world and the world to come</i> between us. Jacob responded: the children are frail and weak in the <i>commandments.</i> If they will take <i>this world</i>, they will not be able to withstand the <i>Day of Judgment</i> and will not be able to suffer Gehenna.<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 33:12.</i>
“<i>Let my lord go on ahead of his servant</i>” [33:14]. That is to say, you Esau, take your share of this world first. “<i>While I travel slowly</i>” [33:14]. I, Jacob, will go slowly into exile in this world.<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid.</i>
“<i>Until I come to my lord in Seir</i>” [33:14]. Until the <i>Messiah</i> will come. “<i>For liberators shall march up on Mount Zion to wreak judgment on Mount Esau; and dominion shall be the Lord</i>’<i>s</i>” [Obadiah 1:21].<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 33:14.</i>
“<i>Esau started back on that day on his way</i>” [33:16]. Esau went home alone. The four hundred men separated from Esau and ran away, and the Holy One paid them a good reward. <i>King David</i> killed many nations, but the Holy One protected the four hundred men of Esau.<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 33:16.</i>
“<i>Jacob arrived safe in the city of Shechem</i>” [33:18]. Jacob came complete with his Torah that he had not forgotten in Laban’s house. He was also complete with his money. Even though he had given presents to Esau, yet he still had enough. He was whole in his body, even though the angel had displaced his hip; he was again healed when he came to the city of Shechem.<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 33:18.</i>
“<i>The parcel of land where he pitched his tent</i>” [33:19]. Jacob bought a field in Shechem and built an altar to God.
“<i>Dinah, the daughter of Leah, went out</i>” [34:1]. Rashi asks a question. Why does it not say, the daughter of Jacob? The explanation is that the verse shows us that Dinah went out, taking after her mother, Leah, who also went out. She went toward Jacob and said: I have rented you to sleep with me.<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 34:1.</i>
Dinah went out to see the daughters of the nations. Hamor the son of Shechem came and took Dinah by force and slept with her. Bahya writes. Jacob caused this by sinning, by not giving Dinah to Esau. Perhaps Dinah might have made Esau pious. Jacob had hidden Dinah in a chest from Esau. The Holy One said: you did not want to give Dinah to one who observed <i>circumcision</i>, then you will give her to one who was not circumcised, to Shechem, the son of Hamor, as the verse says here. The Midrash writes.<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanhuma</i>, <i>Vayishlach</i>, 6.</i> Whenever a woman is in her house, she <i>atones</i> for the sins of the whole household, just like the altar forgives the whole world, as the verse says, “<i>your wife shall be like a fruitful vine within your house; your sons, like olive saplings around your table</i>” [Psalms 128:3]. This means, the wife should be like a grapevine. The root of the grapevine is in the house and the grapes grow and extend out of the house. So too is the woman. She should sit in her house and should have children who will go out into the world to study Torah. That is why the verse says, “<i>like olive saplings</i>” [Psalms 128:3]. The children will be worthy to anoint themselves with oil that is holy. That is why the verse compared the children to olives. All the trees in the world, when they begin to mate with other trees, an apple trees mates with a pear tree and similar other trees. However, the olive tree does not accept other branches to mate. So too should the wife be with <i>modesty.</i> She should not speak much with strange men. Another explanation is, just like the olive tree had <i>fruit</i> in nine <i>months</i>, so too a woman who is modest carries her children for nine months and the child she has is healthy. Therefore, the verse compares the children to olives. Olives are bitter at first, bitter with great pain day and night. Afterwards, whomever God gives is sweet like the good oil.<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 34:1.</i>
“<i>Shechem</i>’<i>s father Hamor came out to Jacob to speak to him</i>” [34:6]. The Midrash writes. Hamor said to Jacob: you grandfather Abraham was a prince, and I am a prince. Give your daughter to a prince. Jacob responded: my grandfather Abraham was called, <i>ox</i>, as the verse says, “<i>Abraham ran to the herd</i>” [Genesis, 18:7]. This is an ox. You are called Hamor, which means donkey, and the verse says, “<i>you shall not plow with an ox and a donkey together</i>” [Deuteronomy, 22:10].<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanhuma</i>, <i>Vayishlach</i>, 7.</i> This means, you should not plow with an ox and a donkey together.
“<i>He was strongly drawn to Dinah</i>” [34:3]. Hamor had relations with Dinah by force. <i>Bahya</i> writes. Dinah was eight years old at that time.<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 34:3.</i> Shechem convinced her. He said: your father Jacob does not have a field and my father has many fields. Therefore, take me as a husband.<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 34:3.</i>
“<i>Jacob</i>’<i>s sons came in from the field</i>” [34:7]. Hizkuni writes. The children of Jacob learned that their sister Dinah was defiled. They came immediately from the field and they were distressed that such a despicable thing should have happened to the daughter of Jacob.<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 34:7.</i> Even the nations did not do such an evil <i>thing</i> at that time and especially to the daughter of an important man like Jacob.<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 34:7.</i>
Hamor came to Jacob and his children and said: give me your daughter for my son Shechem and tell me how much should I give you as bride money, that is to say, the <i>ketubah.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 34:12.</i>
“<i>Jacob</i>’<i>s sons answered</i>” [34:13]. The children of Jacob answered. Bahya writes here. Why did the children answer for their father? The explanation is that the children honored their father, since their father was ashamed and could not respond, out of being <i>disgraced.</i> Thus, the children had to answer with <i>deceit.</i> They answered with <i>wisdom.</i> The children of Jacob thought: we can certainly do something deceitful, since our sister Dinah was defiled. The deceit was that the children of Jacob said: the whole city should circumcise their <i>foreskins.</i> Perhaps only the household of Hamor and Shechem would be willing and the others in the city would not want to do so. The children of Jacob thought: we will kill the whole city along with Shechem and Hamor, because they did not observe what we demanded of them. If they will all circumcise themselves, then we will come on the third day after their <i>circumcision</i> and will kill them. So write <i>Hizkuni</i> and <i>Bahya.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 34:13–14; Bahya, Genesis, 34:13.</i>
“<i>It is a disgrace among us</i>” [34:14]. The children of Jacob said: it is a disgrace for us to give our daughters to someone who is <i>uncircumcised.</i> It will be thrown in our faces that we have a defect in our bodies, with the foreskin. Therefore, if you want to <i>intermarry</i> with us, let us be equal with the <i>circumcision.</i> So writes <i>Hizkuni.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 34:14.</i>
“<i>We will take your daughters to ourselves</i>” [34:16]. <i>Rashi</i> writes. The children of Jacob said: you should take our daughters that we will give you and we will have the choice to take your daughters that we will want. However, Shechem and Hamor came to their <i>friends</i> in the city to convince them to circumcise themselves. They said: we will have the choice to take the daughters of Jacob’s children that we want to have, only let us observe the <i>circumcision.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">83</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 34:16.</i>
“<i>All those who went out of the gate of his town were circumcised</i>” [34:24]. All the men who went out of the city circumcised themselves. <i>Hizkuni</i> writes here. Why does the verse say, “<i>All those who went out of the gate of the city</i>”? This means, all those who went out of the city. With regards to Sarah it is written, “<i>All who came into the gate of the city</i>” [Genesis, 23:10]. This means, those who came into the city. The explanation is that here, Hamor and Shechem did not want to allow anyone out of the city. They first had to circumcise themselves, but they did it by force. Therefore, it is written, “<i>All those who went out of the gate of his city.</i>” However, with Sarah, they all came to do an act of grace with Sarah, to accompany her, out of good will.<sup class="footnote-marker">84</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 34:24.</i>
“<i>On the third day, when they were in pain</i>” [34:25]. It was on the third day and <i>Simeon and Levi</i> took their swords and attacked the city and killed them. They took their goods and money and took their sister. <i>Hizkuni</i> writes. They all <i>regretted</i> that they had circumcised themselves. The children of Jacob heard them say that they had regrets about the circumcision and that Hamor and Shechem said different things to the people of the city. They first said to Jacob, you should have the choice to take our daughters that you desire. Shechem and Hamor came to their wise men to convince them to circumcise themselves. They told them. We will have the choice to take the daughters of Jacob. <i>Hamor and Shechem</i> also said to their wise men, all the goods and money of the children of Jacob is ours. Therefore, they came and killed the whole city on the third day when they were very weak because of the circumcision.<sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 34:25.</i> They relied on the merit of Jacob to help them to kill the whole city with two men, Simeon and Levi.<sup class="footnote-marker">86</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 34:25.</i>
Bahya writes. On the third day, all the wounded ones were weak and everything that moves is weak. Even the third day of the week, which is Tuesday, people are weaker than the other days. This is because its <i>constellation is Cancer</i>, which is crab, and its <i>angel</i> is the <i>evil Samael</i>, and its star is <i>Mars</i>, which means blood. Therefore, our sages told us to fast on Sunday. This is the third day after the creation of man, when <i>Adam</i> was created on Friday. Therefore, every person is weaker on Sunday than on other days. That is why we smell incense, so that we will have strength as we enter Sunday, and to strengthen our soul with good smells. <i>Simeon</i> and <i>Levi</i> were twelve years old when they killed the whole city, which was large and full of people. So writes Bahya.<sup class="footnote-marker">87</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 34:25.</i>
<i>Ramban</i> asks a question about <i>Rashi,</i> who writes that the nations did not yet engage in illicit sexual relations, though the verse says concerning the <i>Canaanites</i>, “<i>for all these abhorrent things were done by the people who were in the land before you</i>” [Leviticus, 18:27]. The nations engaged in all these impurities.<sup class="footnote-marker">88</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban, Genesis, 34:13.</i>
The <i>Toldot Yizhak</i> gives an explanation. Rashi said that in Jacob’s times, the nations were pious with regard to <i>sexual relations.</i> They did not engage in <i>illicit relations</i>, since it was not long after the <i>Flood</i>, when the whole world was destroyed because of illicit sexual relations. If you want to ask, why were Abraham and Isaac afraid that people would take their wives if the nations feared illicit sexual relations? The explanation is that Abraham and Isaac have very beautiful wives and their likes were rare. Therefore, the kings wanted to take them as wives. Therefore, Abraham and Isaac were afraid that they would be taken. However, later in the time of <i>Moses Our Teacher</i>, the <i>Canaanites</i> did pursue illicit sexual relations. They had forgotten the Flood. It was a long time ago and there was nobody who could remind them of it.<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Genesis, 34:7.</i>
They took all their goods, their wives and children, and their animals captive.<sup class="footnote-marker">90</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis, 34:29.</i> “<i>You have brought trouble on me</i>” [34:30]. Jacob said to <i>Simeon</i> and <i>Levi.</i> You have brought me trouble and have made me odious to the whole world. Perhaps all the nations will gather together against me, in order to kill me. His children responded: shall we make a harlot of our sister? Bahya writes. What kind of authorization did <i>Simeon</i> and <i>Levi</i> have to kill and shed blood? The explanation is because the people of Shechem pursued illicit sexual relations and robbery more so than all the other nations. Therefore, they were killed by Simeon and Levi.<sup class="footnote-marker">91</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 34:30.</i>
“<i>Arise, go up to Bethel</i>” [35:1]. <i>Rashi</i> asks a question here. Why does he have to say, “<i>arise</i>”? This means, stand up and go. He should have said: <i>ascend</i>, go up. The explanation is that the Holy One said to Jacob. You have delayed long enough with your <i>vow</i> that you made that you want to bring an offering. Therefore, stand up and go to <i>Bethel</i> and bring your sacrifice. Because you have tarried long, therefore, you have sinned and your daughter was taken to Shechem with disgrace and transgression.<sup class="footnote-marker">92</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 35:1.</i>
<i>Hizkuni</i> asks a question. <i>Rashi</i> wrote above that Jacob sinned and therefore Dinah was taken to Shechem because he did not give Dinah to Esau, Now, <i>Rashi</i> writes that he sinned because he delayed and had not brought an offering. The explanation is that he should not have tarried. As soon as he came from <i>Padan Aram</i>, he should have given Dinah to Esau, in order to make him pious. Jacob tarried in <i>Sukkot</i> and in Shechem and also delayed fulfilling his vow.<sup class="footnote-marker">93</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 35:1.</i>

“<i>Jacob buried them under the terebinth</i>” [35:4]. Jacob buried the foreign gods under a linden tree. He did not want to wait to throw them into the <i>sea</i>, since he was far from the <i>sea.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">97</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 35:4.</i>
“<i>A terror from God fell on the cities round about</i>” [35:5]. A fear was upon the cities round about and they did not pursue Jacob. <i>Toldot Yizhak</i> writes. The cities round about said that what happened to Shechem was justified because they circumcised themselves and became Israelites and threw away our god. That is why this happened to them; our god punished them. Therefore, we will not pursue Jacob. This is the meaning of the verse “<i>A terror from God fell on the cities.</i>” The destruction and shame of their foreign gods was on all the cities around Jacob.<sup class="footnote-marker">98</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Genesis, 35:5.</i>
“<i>Deborah, Rebecca</i>’<i>s nurse, died</i>” [35:8]. <i>Rashi</i> asks a question here. How does <i>Deborah</i> come to the house of Jacob? The explanation is that Rebecca sent <i>Deborah</i> to Jacob in Laban’s house to call him back.<sup class="footnote-marker">99</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 35:8.</i>
<i>Deborah</i> died on the way with Jacob and Jacob buried Deborah. At that burial, Jacob was told that his mother had also died. However, the verse does not want to explicitly write that Rebecca died. Rebecca had been put into her grave and nobody knew when she had died, in the expectation that she should not be cursed that she had an evil son, Esau the evildoer. So writes the Midrash that when Rebecca died, the people said, who would accompany Rebecca to the <i>cemetery?</i> Abraham is dead and Isaac is blind. Jacob has gone to <i>Padan Aram</i>, and if Esau will accompany her, people will curse that she had an evil son. Therefore, they carried Rebecca to the <i>cemetery</i> at night. That is also why the verse does not say when Rebecca died. That is why it is written, “<i>Allon-bachuth</i>” [35:8]. This means, two reasons for crying. One is that he cried because his mother died and the other reason he cried is because his mother was not buried with honor.<sup class="footnote-marker">100</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 35:8.</i>
One asks a question. What would it help that she was buried at night, in the expectation that she should not be cursed, when people would think the same thing when she was alive? The explanation is the verse that says, “<i>you shall not curse the deaf</i>” [Leviticus, 19:14]. This means, one should not curse a deaf person, one who does not hear. However, the verse “<i>you shall not curse the deaf</i>” was not said about a dead person. That is to say, they could well curse a dead person, and therefore they did not want to say that Rebecca had died.
“<i>He blessed him</i>” [35:9]. The Holy One consoled Jacob during his <i>mourning.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">101</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 35:9.</i>
“<i>You shall be called Jacob no more, but Israel shall be your name</i>” [35:10]. <i>Rashi</i> writes. You shall not be called Jacob, which means, you have wrongfully taken away the blessings. But Israel should be your name, which means you have been victorious, that is to say, you are a lord.<sup class="footnote-marker">102</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 35:10.</i>
Bahya and Hizkuni write. You should not be called Jacob alone, but sometimes Jacob and sometimes Israel. You should have two names, but not Jacob alone, which means, you have wrongfully taken away the blessings.<sup class="footnote-marker">103</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 35:10; Hizkuni, Genesis, 35:10.</i>
“<i>Rachel was in childbirth and had hard labor</i>” [35:16]. Rachel had a difficult labor. The midwife said to Rachel: do not fear, you will have a son. Our sages say that with each of Jacob’s sons a daughter was also born, and with <i>Benjamin</i>, two daughters were born. So writes the <i>Rabbati.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">104</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Genesis Rabbah</i>, 82.8.</i>
A story about two <i>disciples</i> of <i>Rabbi Joshua.</i> They changed their clothes so that they should not be recognized as Jews, since it had been commanded to kill the Jews who would not apostatize. One of the king’s officials came to them and asked them. I know well that you are Jews. Why do you not give your souls for the sake of God and you disguise yourselves so that people should not know that you are <i>Jews?</i> They responded: one does not need to commit suicide. That is why we do what we can. Perhaps we will not be recognized. The same <i>gentile</i> said to them. I will ask you something in your Torah. If you will answer me, I will not do anything to you. The verse says, “<i>when her labor was at its hardest</i>” [35:17]. When her labor was difficult, the midwife said to her: do not fear, you will have a son, whether she would have a son or not. The two <i>Jews</i> responded: the midwife should say good things to the woman when she has a difficult labor, in the hope that she will be cheered and to raise her spirits in her troubles.<sup class="footnote-marker">105</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, <i>Vayishlach</i>, <i>Remez</i>, 136.</i>
“<i>Some distance</i>” [35:16]. It was still a distance until the city of <i>Ephrath</i>, but as soon as Rachel died, Jacob buried her in the field. He said: because she died in childbirth, she is full of blood and therefore I do not want to take her to the city, since she will become besmeared with blood, and he placed a <i>monument</i> on her grave.<sup class="footnote-marker">106</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 35:19.</i> <i>Bahya</i> writes that it is an honor for the women to be buried in the city where they died.

“<i>Reuben went and lay with Bilhah</i>” [35:22]. <i>Reuben</i> went and lay with Bilhah, since after Rachel died Jacob placed his bed in the tent of <i>Bilhah.</i> That is to say, the bed on which Jacob used to sleep with Rachel. Jacob placed that bed in Bilhah’s tent. Therefore, Reuben came and threw the bed out and said to <i>Bilhah.</i> You are a <i>maidservant</i> and don’t equate yourself to Rachel, my aunt, who was a noble lady.<sup class="footnote-marker">108</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 35:22.</i> Nonetheless, the verse wrote as if Reuben had lain with <i>Bilhah</i>, because he had disturbed the sleeping of his father with Bilhah.<sup class="footnote-marker">109</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 35:22.</i>
<i>Ramban</i> writes. Reuben disturbed Bilhah’s bed because Reuben thought to himself. I am the firstborn and will take two parts of the goods of my father. Perhaps he will have more children with Bilhah. They will take away my inheritance. That is to say, I will inherit less if my father will have more children. He also thought, my mother Leah is too old to have children and Zilpah may have died by that time. Therefore, Reuben disturbed the bed of his father.<sup class="footnote-marker">110</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban, Genesis, 35:22.</i>
“<i>Israel heard</i>” [35:22]. Jacob heard that Reuben had thrown out the bed and was not very angry with his son, <i>Reuben.</i> He counted him first among his children, called him <i>firstborn</i>, and honored him that he should be firstborn to inherit and also first born to perform the <i>worship</i> at the <i>sacrifices</i>, and firstborn to be counted among his children. The birthright was given to Joseph so that the children of Joseph should be counted as two <i>tribes</i> of Jacob.<sup class="footnote-marker">111</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 35:23.</i>
“<i>The sons of Jacob were twelve in number</i>” [35:22]. That is to say, one should not say that Reuben committed a transgression with throwing the bed out and was not as good and pious as the other children.<sup class="footnote-marker">112</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 35:22.</i> Therefore, the verse counts that Jacob had twelve children, that he had no more children, but he had twelve children.<sup class="footnote-marker">113</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 35:22.</i>
“<i>Jacob came to his father Isaac at Mamre, at Kiriath-arba</i>” [35:27]. Jacob came to his father and it does not say that he came to his mother, Rebecca, since his mother had died previously. However, Scripture does not tell us that she had died. We have written previously why the Torah did not say that Rebecca died.<sup class="footnote-marker">114</sup><i class="footnote">See the comment to Genesis, 35:8 above.</i>
“<i>He was buried by his sons, Esau and Jacob</i>” [35:29]. <i>Hizkuni</i> asks a question. Why does it mention <i>Esau the evildoer</i> before <i>Jacob the righteous one?</i> It would have been just that Jacob should be listed first in the verse. The answer is that Jacob honored Esau because of his <i>hatred</i>, because he [Jacob] had taken away the birthright and the <i>blessings</i> from him. In particular, because Isaac had died, Jacob was afraid of Esau. Esau had said: as soon as my father will die, I will take <i>revenge</i> on Jacob. Therefore, when Isaac died, <i>Jacob honored Esau</i> at the <i>cemetery</i> and let him go first. However, when Abraham died, it is written, “<i>Isaac and Ishmael buried him</i>” [Genesis, 25:8]. Isaac is mentioned first and then Ishmael, who was the son of the <i>maidservant, Hagar.</i> Isaac was the son of Sarah, the mistress of the household.<sup class="footnote-marker">115</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 35:29.</i>
“<i>Esau took Oholibamah</i>” [36:2]. <i>Rashi</i> writes here. Esau’s wife was called <i>Oholibamah</i> and Esau gave her the name <i>Yehudit.</i> That is, so that his father Isaac should think that Esau had pious <i>Jewish</i> wives.<sup class="footnote-marker">116</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 36:2.</i>
“<i>And Basemath daughter of Ishmael</i>” [36:2]. Esau took a wife called <i>Basemath</i>, the daughter of <i>Ishmael.</i> Rashi asks a question here. We find that Esau took the daughter of <i>Ishmael</i> who was called <i>Machlat</i> and here she is called <i>Basemath.</i> The explanation is that there are three whose transgressions are forgiven. One is a <i>convert</i> who <i>converts</i>; all of their transgressions are forgiven. The second one is one who achieves <i>greatness and leadership.</i> The third one is when one takes a wife. That is why he called his wife <i>Machlat</i>, because his transgressions were forgiven.
“<i>Timna was a concubine of Eliphaz</i>” [36:12]. <i>Rashi</i> asks a question here. Why does it not say that <i>Eliphaz</i> took <i>Timna</i> as a concubine? The explanation is that the verse shows us that all the kings and nobles desired to unite with the children of Abraham. Therefore, the verse says, “<i>Timna was a concubine of Eliphaz</i>” [36:12]. That is to say, <i>Timna</i> was descended from <i>nobles and kings</i>, and joined the children of Esau who was of the children of Abraham.<sup class="footnote-marker">117</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 36:12.</i>
“<i>Who discovered the hot springs in the wilderness</i>” [36:24]. One was called <i>Anah.</i> He was a descendant of Esau and was in the wilderness, herding cattle. He took a <i>female</i> horse and caused a donkey to mate with her and they produced a mule. Since he was a <i>bastard</i>, he thought to bring more <i>bastards</i> into the world among the animals. Therefore, the mules are called <i>hot springs</i>, because the fear of them is great among people.<sup class="footnote-marker">118</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 36:24.</i>
<i>Hizkuni</i> asks a question. There were mules in the time of Isaac, since <i>Rashi</i> writes that Isaac’s mule was better than the silver and gold of <i>Abimelech.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">119</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 26:13.</i> The explanation is that there were mules, but these mules were produced when a female horse mated with a donkey by themselves. However, <i>Anah</i>, the son of Esau, went and with his hands, caused a female horse to mate with a donkey. Therefore, the verse says that he brought many mules into the world. That is why no mule can ever have offspring, since the Holy One does not want that creatures should increase that God did not create, when He created the world. The blessing that God gave to all of His creatures did not apply to a creature combining <i>two</i> species.<sup class="footnote-marker">120</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 36:24.</i>

Vayeshev

“<i>Jacob was settled in the land where his fathers had sojourned</i>” [37:1]. Bahya writes. This portion teaches us that the righteous person in the world is like a <i>sojourner</i> who has no relatives and no home, no field and does not think of anything other than to wander and must prepare provisions, since he does not know where he would travel. So too is the righteous person. He thinks about death all the time and prepares provisions for the journey. These are the <i>good deeds.</i> Therefore, the verse says, “<i>Jacob was settled in the land where his fathers had sojourned</i>” [37:1]. That is, he dwelled like a <i>sojourner</i> like his ancestors, who were also sojourners in the world who thinks about the next world.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, <i>Vayeshev</i>, Introduction.</i>
Scripture had mentioned the children of Esau briefly in the previous <i>Torah portion</i> because he did not want to speak at length about the evildoers. However, when it came to the children of Jacob, it goes on at length and explicitly about how the children of Jacob fared. A <i>parable.</i> A person lost a pearl in the sand. He takes a sieve and searches for the pearl. As soon as he finds the pearl, he throws away the sand and takes the pearl. So too, the Torah writes about the children of Esau briefly, but when it comes to the children of Jacob, it speaks at great length and explicitly about how the children fared.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 37:1.</i>
“<i>This is the line of Jacob</i>” [37:2]. This is the history of the children of Jacob. The first thing happened. Joseph was seventeen years old and he was raised with the children of Bilhah and Zilpah. He herded the sheep with their children. Therefore, the verse says, <i>youth</i> [<i>na</i>’<i>ar</i>]. That is, it was no <i>shame</i> that he herded with the children of the <i>maidservants, Bilhah and Zilpah</i>, because he was still a youth, that is to say, young. So writes Hizkuni.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 37:2.</i>
Rashi writes. He did childish deeds. He adorned himself and beautified his hair. Also, he still lived with the children of Bilhah and Zilpah. The other children separated themselves from them and held them in <i>low esteem.</i> However, <i>the righteous Joseph</i> joined these children.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 37:2.</i>
“<i>Joseph brought bad reports of them</i>” [37:2]. Joseph told his father everything that he saw the children of Leah doing. Rashi asks a question here. Why does it say here “<i>Joseph brought</i>”? This means, he brought reports to his father. Concerning the spies it is written, “<i>They spread calumnies</i>” [Numbers, 13:32]. This means, they drew out. The explanation is that Joseph was righteous. He told no <i>lies</i> about his brothers, but everything that he saw with his own eyes explicitly he told and brought to his father. However, the <i>spies</i> were evildoers. They embellished evil words; they even said falsehoods about the <i>land of Israel.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Devek Tov, Genesis, 37:2.</i>
What evil did Joseph see among his brothers? They were completely righteous. The explanation is that Joseph made a <i>mistake.</i> He saw them eating a calf whose mother had been slaughtered and the calf came out alive. One is allowed to eat the calf without <i>slaughtering</i> it. This what the brothers were eating, and Joseph told his father how they were eating it without having slaughtered it. Joseph also told his father how the children of Leah said to the children of <i>Bilhah and Zilpah:</i> you are children of <i>maidservants</i>, that is to say, <i>of low esteem.</i> Joseph said: one should not call anyone the <i>son of a slave</i> or the like. One should not call anyone the <i>son of a maidservant.</i> Joseph thought that it was a sin to call someone <i>son of a slave</i> or <i>son of a maidservant.</i> However, the brothers said that nonetheless they are <i>sons of maidservants</i> and one is allowed to call them <i>sons of maidservants</i> because <i>in truth they are children of maidservants.</i> Joseph also said about the children of Leah that they engaged in <i>illicit sexual relations</i>, since he saw that the children of Leah engaged in much commerce with the wives of the <i>Cutheans.</i> Joseph thought that they were certainly engaging in illicit sexual relations. However, Joseph was <i>mistaken.</i> One is allowed to talk much with women in order to engage in commerce with them. The Holy One punished Joseph with three things. The first thing that Joseph had said that they were eating <i>animals without slaughter.</i> Therefore, when they sold him, his brothers first slaughtered a kid in order to dip Joseph’s shirt in blood. The second was that Joseph said that the brothers called the children of Bilhah and Zilpah, <i>slaves</i> and servants. Therefore, Joseph was sold as a slave. The third thing that Joseph said was that the brothers engaged in illicit sexual relations. Therefore, Joseph was punished that his mistress wanted to sleep with him and he later was thrown into <i>prison.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 37:2.</i>
“<i>Israel loved Joseph</i>” [37:3]. Jacob loved Joseph very much, more than the other brothers. Hizkuni writes here. All of the brothers hated Joseph. First, the children of Leah hated Joseph because Jacob loved him more than the other children. The children of Bilhah and Zilpah hated Joseph because he spoke ill about the children of Leah.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 37:2.</i>
Rashi and Bahya write. “<i>This is the line of Jacob</i>” [37:2]. Why does the verse hang the line of Jacob on Joseph? The explanation is that everything that Jacob served and worked in the house of <i>Laban</i> was because of Rachel and Joseph was the son of Rachel. Joseph looked like Jacob. Also, all the <i>attributes</i> of the brothers were in Joseph. The <i>birthright of Reuben</i> was given to Joseph. The <i>kingship</i> of <i>Judah</i> was also in Joseph, since Joseph was a <i>king</i> in <i>Egypt.</i> The <i>prophecy</i> of <i>Levi</i> was also in <i>Joseph.</i> He <i>prophesied to Pharaoh</i> about how a hunger would come to Egypt. Joseph also had the wisdom of <i>Issachar</i>, as it is written concerning Joseph, “<i>there is none is discerning and wise as you</i>” [Genesis, 41:39]. This means, there is nobody wiser than you. Also, everything that happened to Jacob also happened to Joseph. Just like the brothers wanted to kill Joseph, so too, Esau wanted to kill Jacob. Just like the mother of Jacob was <i>barren</i> so too the mother of Joseph. Just like Jacob was born circumcised so too was Joseph. Just like the mother of Jacob had a difficult delivery so too did the mother of Joseph. Just like the mother of Jacob had only two children so too that of Joseph. Just like <i>angels</i> came to Jacob so too to Joseph. Just like <i>good attributes</i> came to Jacob through a dream, so too to Joseph.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 37:2; Bahya, Genesis, 37:2.</i>
<i>Ramban</i> asks a question about <i>Rashi.</i> If Joseph had spoken against the children of Leah about how badly and lowly they held the children of the <i>maidservants</i> and had <i>denigrated</i> them, why did the children of the maidservants agree to kill him and to sell him? <i>Dan Naphtali, Gad and Asher</i> were the four children of the <i>maidservants. Reuben</i>, the oldest one, also did not <i>agree</i> to sell Joseph. Thus, there were five and Joseph himself was the sixth. They could have overcome the other brothers not to sell <i>Joseph.</i> The explanation is that <i>Joseph</i> had spoken ill of the children of the <i>maidservants.</i> Therefore, they also hated him. The children of Leah hated Joseph because Jacob loved Joseph more than all the other brothers.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban, Genesis, 37:1.</i> So also write Bahya and <i>Hizkuni.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 37:2; Hizkuni, Genesis, 37:2.</i>
“<i>Israel loved Joseph best of all his sons</i>” [37:3]. <i>Toldot Yizhak</i> writes. The custom in the houses of the <i>nobility</i> is that they love those who spread <i>gossip.</i> Therefore, the verse says that concerning Jacob that even though Joseph <i>gossiped</i>, yet he did not love Joseph because of the <i>gossip</i>, but because “<i>he was the child of his old age</i>” [37:3]. He was learned in the Torah and that is why he loved him.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Genesis, 37:2–3.</i>
“<i>His brothers saw that their father loved him</i>” [37:4]. Joseph’s brothers hated him because Jacob loved him. <i>Toldot Yizhak</i> asks a question. Is it just that they should hate him because Jacob loved him? Why is Joseph guilty that he was loved? The explanation is that the brothers said: if our father would not believe the evil things that Joseph says about us, then it would not bother us. One could consider him a fool. However, our father still loves Joseph, even after his evil talk. He must hate us because of the evil talk. Therefore, the verse says that the brothers saw that Jacob loved Joseph and that is why they hated him.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Genesis, 37:4.</i>
“<i>He made him an ornamented tunic</i>” [37:3]. He made him a silk shirt, and all of his troubles came from this shirt. Our <i>sages</i> learn from here that one should not give one child better clothes than the others, so that they should not come into conflict, as happened with Joseph.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 37:3.</i>
The word “<i>pasim</i>” alludes to his troubles. The “<i>peh</i>” is <i>Potiphar</i> to whom Joseph was sold. The “<i>samech</i>” is <i>merchants.</i> The “<i>yud</i>” is <i>Ishmaelites.</i> The “<i>mem</i>” is <i>Midianites.</i> Joseph was sold to all of them.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 37:3.</i>
“<i>They could not speak a friendly word to him</i>” [37:4]. The brothers could not speak with Joseph. <i>Rashi</i> writes. The verse tells us that the brothers were righteous. As soon as they became angry with Joseph, they could no longer speak with him. There are many evil people who hate someone very much in their heart and speak with him with their mouth. However, Joseph’s brothers did not do this. They were the same in their heart and with their mouth.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 37:4.</i>
“<i>Joseph had a dream which he told to his brothers</i>” [37:5]. <i>Hizkuni</i> writes. The first dream did not come true, and therefore, it was not written down. He told the dream to his brothers in the hope that they would not hate him if he would become a ruler, since it is from God that he should be a ruler and not from his father’s love.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 37:5–6.</i>
“<i>There we were binding sheaves</i>” [37:7]. Joseph said: I had a dream. We were cutting wheat in the field. My sheaf stood up and your sheaves gathered around mine and they bowed down to my sheaf. <i>Toldot Yizhak</i> writes here. That is to say, the sheaves gathered around and did not voluntarily bow down to my sheaf, but they had to bow down, out of gratitude. Another explanation is that they gathered around my sheaf like a servant who serves his master and runs to his master. Another explanation, “<i>your sheaves gathered around</i>” [37:7]. This means, your sheaves became small. Joseph gathered wheat in <i>Egypt.</i> The <i>grain</i> became spoiled. Joseph explained that in the dream that your sheaves became small. Therefore, though the dream was about sheaves of grain, it showed that the brothers would bow because of grain and hunger.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Genesis, 37:7.</i>
“<i>His brothers answered, so you mean to reign</i>” [37:8]. The brothers were very wise and thought that the dream meant that Joseph would be a king over his brothers. Therefore, they said: do you want to be a king over us? Bahya writes. The brothers hated Joseph very much. Why did they interpret the dream positively? The explanation is that the Holy One made them speak well of his dream with their mouths.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 37:7.</i>
“<i>They hated him even more for his talk about his dreams</i>” [37:8]. His brothers hated him because of the dream and also hated him and because he told the <i>dreams</i> to his father and boasted of the <i>dreams.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 37:8.</i>
“<i>And he told it to his father and his brothers</i>” [37:10]. Joseph told his dream again to his father and to his brothers. Jacob shouted at Joseph: what do you think with the dream, that I and your mother will bow down to you, even though your mother Rachel had died? That is, you say that the dream shows that the sun is the father and the moon is the mother and the eleven stars are eleven brothers. They will all bow down to you. Your mother died long ago. Therefore, the dream is nothing. Jacob said all this so that the brothers should not hate Joseph. However, Jacob thought in his heart that the dream would come true. The <i>moon</i> indicated <i>Bilhah</i> who had raised <i>Joseph</i> like a mother and she would bow down to <i>Joseph.</i> Our <i>sages</i> say that there is some foolishness in every <i>dream.</i> That is to say, even if the <i>dream is true</i>, there is some foolishness in that <i>dream. Jacob</i> wanted to remove the <i>hatred</i> from the brothers. That is why he said that the mother had died long ago, so the dream cannot be true.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 37:10.</i>
<i>Toldot Yizhak</i> asks a question. Why was the first dream about sheaves of wheat, and the second dream was about stars? The explanation is that the brothers first came for grain, like the peasants who plow, sow and work the fields. However, the second time the brothers came with authority and honor. They were the brothers of <i>Joseph the king.</i> Therefore, the second dream was about stars. That is to say, important people. Therefore, Joseph did not see the sun and moon in the first dream, since the first time the brothers came alone, without father and without mother. However, the second time his father came with Bilhah. That is why the sun and moon were present in the second dream. This explains why Joseph told the second dream to his brothers and to his father. He only told the first dream to his brothers. The explanation is that the first dream was only that the brothers would come, but his father and mother did not yet come the first time.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Genesis, 37:9–11.</i>
<i>Imre Noam</i> asks a question. Why does the verse say concerning the sheaves, “<i>and bowed low to my sheaf</i>” [37:7]? This means, they bowed to my sheaf and concerning the stars it is not written that the stars bowed to my star. The explanation is that the stars are in the sky, so Joseph could not say that your stars bowed to my star. The brothers would have asked Joseph, did you have your star in your hand that you say that the stars bowed to your star? However, with the sheaves, Joseph could well say, I had my sheaf in my hand and your sheaves bowed down to my sheaf.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Imre Noam, Genesis, 37:7.</i>
Another explanation is that the first dream was that the brothers came for grain and did not recognize Joseph. Thus, the brothers bowed down for the sake of the grain. Therefore, it is written, “<i>and bowed low to my sheaf</i>” [37:7]. That is to say, they bowed down for the sake of the grain and not to me and my honor. However, the stars showed that the brothers, father and mother, knew him well and bowed down for the sake of <i>Joseph</i>’<i>s honor.</i> Therefore, it says concerning the stars, “<i>bowed to me</i>” [37:9]. That is to say, you will bow for the sake of my honor.
“<i>To pasture their father</i>’<i>s flock</i>” [37:12]. The children went to pasture themselves. That is to say, they had their father’s sheep. They ate from the sheep and were pasturing themselves, without their father’s knowledge. Therefore, the word “<i>et</i>” is written with two dots over it in the Torah. This shows us that the sheep also fed the brothers. That is, they ate from the sheep. Therefore, they did even more evil things to their brother Joseph. That is to say, they ate their fill of their father’s sheep and they sold their brother Joseph.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 37:12; Devek Tov, Genesis, 37:12 note 7.</i>
“<i>He answered, I am ready</i>” [37:13]. Jacob said to Joseph: go to your brothers. They are pasturing in <i>Shechem.</i> Joseph responded: I am ready. Even though Joseph knew well that his brothers hated him and it was <i>dangerous</i> for him to go to his brothers, yet he would go, out of respect for his father.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 37:13.</i>
“<i>He sent him from the valley of Hebron</i>” [37:14]. If you want to ask, what was Jacob thinking to send Joseph to his brothers, who hated him very much? The explanation is that the Holy One had commanded this, so that through this, Israel would come to the <i>exile of Egypt.</i> So had the Holy One said to Abraham who was buried in <i>Hebron.</i> Your children will be in <i>Egypt</i> for four hundred years.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 37:14.</i>
“<i>A man came upon him</i>” [37:15]. An <i>angel</i> named <i>Gabriel</i> found Joseph.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 37:15.</i> <i>Toldot Yizhak</i> writes. The custom was that when a person was going to a field, he would ask people to show him the right path, but the people did not ask him, what are you looking for? Here it was the <i>opposite.</i> A man came to Joseph and said, what are you looking for? This was certainly an angel who wanted to lead Joseph to his brothers, in the expectation that he would come to <i>Egypt.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Genesis, 37:15.</i>
Another explanation is that it had to be an <i>angel</i>, since Joseph said to the man, “<i>could you tell me where they are pasturing?</i>” [37:16]. Tell me where my brothers are pasturing. One can ask: Joseph should have asked the man if he knew where his brothers were pasturing and then he should have asked, tell me where they are pasturing? The explanation is that Joseph understood that this is an angel. Therefore, he asked him, tell me where they are pasturing. That is to say, you are an angel. Tell me where are my brothers? If you want to ask, who tells us that this is <i>Gabriel? You could say</i>, it was another angel? The explanation is that the <i>angel Gabriel</i> is the one called “<i>the man Gabriel</i>” [Daniel, 9:21], and here it is written, “<i>a man came upon him</i>” [37:15].<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Pirke de Rabbi Eliezer</i>, chap. 38.</i>
“<i>The man said, they have gone from here</i>” [37:17]. <i>Rashi</i> asks a question here. Why did the angel respond that the brothers had left here, since Joseph had asked, where are my brothers? The <i>angel</i> should have answered briefly; they have gone to the city of <i>Dothan.</i> The explanation is that the angel did not say to him go to your brothers. They will kill you. This is the meaning of the verse “<i>gone from here.</i>” That is to say, your brothers no longer consider you as a brother. They have renounced their brotherhood. Therefore, the verse says, “<i>from here.</i>” The word “<i>here</i>” [<i>zeh</i>] has the numerical value of twelve. That is to say, your brothers are saying that there should not be twelve brothers, but eleven brothers, since we will not consider Joseph a brother. Joseph did not turn away, but still went to his brothers, out of respect for his father, which would protect him.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 37:17.</i>
Here one asks a question. If Jacob did <i>accompany</i> Joseph on his way, why was Joseph harmed on the way. The <i>accompaniment</i> did not protect him. The explanation is that Jacob had intended that Joseph should only go to the city of Shechem. It was for this purpose that Jacob accompanied Joseph, but Joseph went further and that is why the accompaniment did not help beyond that. Why did Jacob only intend that he should go to Shechem and no further? The explanation is that the Holy One wanted it to happen in this way, so that Joseph should come to Egypt.
“<i>They conspired to kill him</i>” [37:18]. The brothers thought that they wanted to kill Joseph, but they should not touch him with their hands to kill him. They incited vicious dogs to attack him, but God helped him.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 37:17.</i>
“<i>Come now, let us kill him</i>” [37:20]. When Joseph was protected from the vicious dogs, his brothers said: we will kill him and throw him into a pit. We will say that a wild animal ate him.
The Holy One said here. “<i>We shall see what comes of his dreams</i>” [37:20]. That is to say, his dreams show that you will not be able to do anything to him. He will be a <i>king</i> over you.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 37:20.</i>
“<i>Let us not take his life</i>” [37:21]. When <i>Reuben</i> heard this, <i>Reuben</i> wanted to save him and said: “<i>Let us not take his life.</i>” That is to say, <i>Reuben</i> showed the brothers that he also hated him. Therefore, <i>Reuben</i> spoke <i>wisely.</i> It is not appropriate to kill any person, not even a stranger. Therefore, <i>Reuben</i> did not say, “<i>Let us not take.</i>” This means, we will not kill him. Rather, he said: “<i>Let us not take his life.</i>” How appropriate is it to take a <i>life?</i> Therefore, <i>Reuben</i> said: “<i>Shed no blood</i>” [37:22]. That is, shed no blood of any person. God will punish you. It is not that I love Joseph. Rather, I am concerned with your <i>welfare</i>, that you should not shed blood. Therefore, <i>Reuben</i> said: “<i>shed no blood</i>” and did not say, <i>do not shed his blood.</i> This means, do not shed his blood. That is to say, Reuben did not want to show the brothers that he loved Joseph, in the expectation that they would listen to his advice. <i>Reuben</i> thought: I am the oldest; my father will be angry with me that I did not save him. So writes Bahya.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 37:21.</i>
“<i>Cast him into that pit</i>” [37:22]. Reuben said: throw him into a pit. Hizkuni asks a question here. If indeed there were snakes in the pit, so what did Reuben’s advice help? The snakes would devour Joseph. The explanation is that Reuben told them to throw him into a pit that did not have snakes. Reuben thought to himself: when my brothers will leave, I will steal him out of the pit and bring him to our father. However, the brothers took him out of that pit and threw him into a pit that contained snakes. That is why it is written in the verse that Reuben came back to the pit and he did not find Joseph in the pit.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 37:22.</i>
“<i>They stripped Joseph</i>” [37:23]. The brothers pulled off Joseph’s silk shirt.
“<i>Took and threw him into the pit</i>” [37:24]. <i>Simeon</i> took Joseph and threw him into a pit in which there was no water, but there were snakes in it. However, the brothers did not see the snakes. That is why the verse says, “<i>the pit was empty, there was no water in it</i>” [37:24]. One asks a question here. If you say that the pit was empty, I would know that it is empty and I would know that there is no water in it. Why does the verse have to say there was no water in it? It is obvious that when it is empty, then I would know that it also doesn’t have water in it. The explanation is that the verse shows us that it was empty of water, but there were snakes in it. If you want to ask that if it is full of snakes, then it is not empty. The explanation is that the snakes had holes in the pit into which they ran, at times. At that time, the pit was empty. That is also why the brothers did not see the snakes. If they had seen them, they would not have thrown Joseph into it.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 37:24.</i> As Hizkuni also writes, if there had been water in the pit, they would not have thrown Joseph into it.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 37:24.</i>
“<i>Let us not do away with him ourselves</i>” [37:27]. That is to say, let us not kill him with our hands. We will not do this. Ramban writes. The snakes in the pit went into their holes. If his brothers had seen that the snakes were in the pit and were not harming Joseph, the brothers would have understood that Joseph was holy and was righteous. How would it be appropriate that they should sell Joseph?<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban, Genesis, 37:22.</i>
“<i>Then Midianite traders passed by, they pulled Joseph up out of the pit</i>” [37:28]. “<i>They sat down to a meal</i>” [37:25]. They sat down to eat at a distance, so that they should not hear the cry of their brother in the pit. Then a group of <i>Ishmaelites</i> came from the city of <i>Gilead</i> carrying wax, balm and old wine and was on their way to <i>Egypt.</i> Rashi asks a question. Why does the verse tell us what they were carrying? The explanation is that the verse tells is the merit of Joseph, since the <i>Ishmaelites</i> used to carry <i>merchandise</i> that stank. However, now it happened that the <i>righteous Joseph</i> should not smell bad things. Therefore, they were carrying only spices and good wine, so that Joseph should only smell pleasant odors.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 37:25.</i>
When they threw Joseph into the pit, they threw him in naked, without a garment, only with an <i>amulet</i> around his neck. <i>Raphael</i> came and made Joseph a garment out of it. They sold Joseph while he was still in the pit, and his brothers saw the garment when the <i>Ishmaelites</i> brought Joseph out of the pit. They argued with the Ishmaelites. They said: we sold him to you without a garment. The <i>Ishmaelites</i> gave them shoes for the garment. <i>Imre Noam</i> wrote this.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Imre Noam, Genesis, 37:23.</i>
“<i>His brothers agreed</i>” [37:27]. The brothers listened to <i>Judah</i> and wanted to sell him as a slave. They said: the children of Abraham are supposed to be in <i>exile in Egypt.</i> Perhaps Joseph will be in exile for all of us. He is also a descendant of Abraham.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 37:27.</i>
“<i>They pulled Joseph up</i>” [37:28]. Rashi writes. The brothers pulled Joseph out of the pit and sold him to the <i>Ishmaelites</i>, and the <i>Ishmaelites</i> sold him to the <i>Midianites.</i> The <i>Midianites</i> sold him to the <i>Egyptians.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 37:28.</i>
However, <i>Hizkuni</i> and Bahya write. “<i>Midianite traders passed by</i>” [37:28]. The Midianites passed near the pit and heard Joseph shouting. They pulled him out and sold him to the Ishmaelites. The <i>Ishmaelites</i> gave Joseph to the <i>Midianites</i> to hold as a <i>pledge.</i> The Ishmaelites and the <i>Midianites</i> sold Joseph to <i>Potiphar.</i> Therefore, the verse says, “<i>The Midianites sold him in Egypt</i>” [37:36]. This means, the Midianites sold him in Egypt. Later, the verse says, “<i>Potiphar bought him from the Ishmaelites</i>” [39:1]. This means, the <i>Ishmaelites</i> sold him into Egypt. That is to say, Joseph was sold through both, the Ishmaelites and the Midianites. Joseph said to his brothers when he made himself known to them, “<i>whom you sold into Egypt</i>” [Genesis, 45:4]. Joseph said: because you threw me into the pit; through that I was sold into Egypt. However, the brothers did not sell him, and did not know what happened to him. Reuben came to the pit and did not find him. All the brothers thought that a wild animal ate Joseph, since the brothers were not present when the Midianites pulled him out of the pit.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 37:28; Bahya, Genesis, 37:28.</i>
Another explanation is that <i>Potiphar</i> saw that Joseph was a handsome man. He thought that he was not a slave. He must be someone important and thought that the Midianites had kidnapped him. <i>Potiphar</i> said to the Midianites, give me a guarantee that he was not kidnapped. That is why the verse says: “<i>Potiphar bought him from the Ishmaelites</i>” [39:1]. That is to say, Potiphar received guarantees from the Ishmaelites and therefore, he bought Joseph.
<i>Rabbi Isserl</i> writes. The <i>Ishmaelites</i> and the brothers sold Joseph to the Midianites. The <i>Ishmaelites</i> gave silver into the hands of the brothers for Joseph and the Midianites pulled Joseph out of the pit with the brothers. The Midianites did not want Joseph out of their hands. We are entitled to Joseph because he is in our hands. The Ishmaelites could not agree with the Midianites. They said: let us take Joseph to Egypt. You will take him and sell him in Egypt and the Ishmaelites took their principal and the Midianites took the rest.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Be’ure Maharai, Genesis, 39:1.</i>
<i>Toldot Yizhak</i> writes. The Midianites were the brokers for the <i>Ishmaelites.</i> Therefore, the <i>Midianites</i> pulled up Joseph. They wanted to show that Joseph was handsome. It is the custom of the brokers that they show the merchandise with their own hands to the merchant. The broker sells the merchandise. Therefore, the verse says, “<i>The Midianite traders passed by, they pulled Joseph out of the pit. They sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites</i>” [37:28]. That is to say, the Midianites sold him to the Ishmaelites and the Ishmaelites sold him to Potiphar. That is, they were brokers and sold him into Egypt. The Ishmaelites said to the Midianites. As you were brokers to me, so too you should be brokers to <i>Potiphar</i> and help me sell Joseph. Therefore, it is written in the verse once that the Midianites sold Joseph and once it is written that the Ishmaelites sold him. So write the <i>commentaries.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Genesis, 37:28.</i>
One can give another explanation that the Ishmaelites gave money for Joseph. They said to the Midianites: we know well that the Egyptians will not want to buy Joseph because he is <i>circumcised.</i> They will think that it is a <i>defect</i> in Joseph and he will not have children, since the Egyptians did not know about circumcision. Therefore the Ishmaelites said to the Midianites. Take Joseph in your hands, as if he was yours and you will sell him. When the Egyptians will see that he is circumcised, then we Ishmaelites will testify that it is a custom to be circumcised, since we Ishmaelites also practice circumcision. We Ishmaelites will say that we practice <i>circumcision</i> and we have children, just like all the other nations. We practice circumcision so that we will not engage in licentiousness. Therefore the Ishmaelites led him to Potiphar. They knew well that Potiphar could not have children and could not sleep with his wife. They thought Potiphar would certainly buy him, because he could not sleep with his wife. Potiphar was afraid to buy slaves in his house so that his wife should not have illicit relations with that slave. Therefore, we will tell Potiphar that the circumcision was given so that one would not engage in illicit sexual relations and Potiphar will buy him. Therefore, the verse says, “<i>The Midianites, meanwhile, sold him in Egypt to Potiphar, a courtier of Pharaoh</i>” [37:36]. That is to say, the Midianites sold him, and then the verse says, “<i>Potiphar bought him from the Ishmaelites</i>” [39:1]. That is to say, Ishmael was the rightful owner to sell Joseph.
“<i>Twenty pieces of silver</i>” [37:28]. Hizkuni and Bahya write. The Holy One said: you sold Joseph for twenty pieces of silver. This is equivalent to <i>five selahs</i>, five silver coins. Therefore, each firstborn must give <i>five selahs</i> to redeem him, because Joseph was also a <i>firstborn.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 37:28; Bahya, Genesis, 37:28.</i>
“<i>What am I to do</i>” [37:30]. Reuben came to the pit and did not find Joseph. He tore his clothes and said: I am the oldest; our father will hang it all on me.
<i>Hizkuni</i> writes: Reuben was afraid that his father would say: certainly you Reuben killed him because the <i>birthright</i> was taken away from you and was given to Joseph.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 37:30.</i>
Where was Reuben that day when the brothers sold Joseph? The explanation is that he was with Jacob, since every day one had to serve his father. He <i>repented</i> on that day that he had disturbed his father’s bed.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 37:29.</i>
“<i>They dipped the tunic in blood</i>” [37:31]. The brothers took a kid and slaughtered it. They tore the tunic and smeared it with blood, so that one should think that a <i>wild animal</i> tore him apart.
Hizkuni writes that the brothers sent the garment with <i>messengers.</i> They were afraid that their father would note that they hated him and would say: you killed him.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 37:32.</i>
Bahya also writes. It must be that the brothers did not go by themselves because it is written, “<i>is it your son</i>’<i>s tunic</i>” [37:32]? The messengers said: do you recognize this tunic, if it is your son’s tunic? If the children had brought the tunic, they would have said: see if this is Joseph’s tunic?<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 37:32.</i> It is not customary for children to say to their father, is this your son’s?
“<i>A savage beast devoured him</i>” [37:33]. Jacob recognized it and said: a wild animal certainly devoured Joseph. If robbers had killed him, they would have taken away the tunic. The Midrash says that he saw <i>prophetically</i> that Potiphar’s wife would cast aspersions on Joseph and he would be thrown in <i>prison.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Genesis Rabbah</i>, 84.19.</i> Bahya writes. Why did the Holy One not say to Jacob that Joseph was still alive? The explanation is that his nine brothers put a ban on anyone who would tell that Joseph was sold; he should be cursed. They joined the Holy One to their group so that there should be a quorum of ten, so that the ban should be strong. Abraham did the same thing with regard to <i>Sodom.</i> He wanted to join the Holy One to nine righteous people, who together with the Holy One would be ten righteous ones and should protect a city in which there would be ten righteous ones. If you want to ask, the Holy One would not join with the children for evil, that they wanted to make a ban not to tell Jacob. The explanation is that there was no evil. The Holy One joined the ban, since if Jacob had heard that his children had sold Joseph he would have cursed them that they should be taken from this world, <i>heaven forbid.</i> Therefore, the Holy One joined with them.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 37:33.</i>
“<i>He observed mourning for his son many days</i>” [37:34]. Jacob mourned for many days for Joseph, for twenty-two years. Jacob has sinned that he did not honor his father Isaac. Jacob was with Laban for twenty-two years, since Jacob served fourteen years for Rachel and Leah. Afterwards, he served for six years for the sheep and Jacob was on the road for two years. All together, this is twenty-two years.<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 37:34.</i>
“<i>All his sons and daughters sought to comfort him</i>” [37:35]. All of his sons and daughters got up to console and comfort Jacob. Bahya writes. The daughters, means Dinah and <i>Serach</i>, the daughter of <i>Asher.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 37:35.</i> However, <i>Rashi</i> writes. The daughters, means that a daughter was born with each son, and Reuben took her as his wife. So too, a daughter was born with each of Jacob’s sons and that son took her as a wife. So says <i>Rabbi Judah.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 37:35.</i> Ramban writes here. The six children of Leah took the daughters that were born to the other six children. The other six children took the daughters that were born with the children of Leah. <i>Rabbi Nehemiah</i> said that the children of Jacob took wives from the <i>Canaanites.</i> The verse calls them daughters of Jacob; because the custom is that the son’s wife is called a daughter.<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban, Genesis, 38:2.</i>
“<i>He refused to be comforted</i>” [38:35]. He did not want to accept their consolation. Rashi asks a question here. The <i>Talmud</i> writes that one does not need to cry excessively over the <i>deceased.</i> Why did Jacob not want to accept consolation? The explanation is the <i>decree</i> of the Holy One that one forgets the <i>deceased</i> and no longer remembers them. Therefore, Jacob could not accept consolation because Joseph was still alive and he could not forget him. Therefore, Jacob mourned for a long time, but if Joseph had died, then Jacob would have forgotten him. The Holy One does the person a favor that he should forget the deceased person, and should not be in <i>anguish.</i> However, concerning a living person, the Holy One does not cause that he should be forgotten.<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 37:35.</i>
“<i>I will go down mourning to my son in Sheol</i>” [37:35]. Jacob said: I will mourn until I will come to <i>Gehenna</i>, because Joseph has been taken away from me. I know well <i>prophetically</i> that none of my children should die while I am alive.<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid.</i>
<i>Ibn Shuaib</i> writes. Why did Jacob engage in so much anguish? The explanation is that Joseph was not yet twenty years old and Jacob thought that the Holy One does not punish a person for his sins until he is twenty years old.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">Ibn Shuaib, <i>Derashot</i>, I: 78.</i>
One asks a question. Even if the Holy One causes that one forgets the <i>deceased</i> and one cannot forget someone who is still alive, Jacob was <i>wise</i>, why did he not think that he must be alive because I cannot forget him? The explanation is that Jacob <i>tore</i> his garments at first. He thought that he had died and later when he could not forget him, he thought that he might still be alive, but he might be in a prison or in trouble. That is why he mourned all his days.
<i>Devek Tov</i> asks a question. Why was Jacob not punished that he did not honor his father Isaac for fourteen years? The explanation is that Isaac was very happy that Jacob was studying Torah and did not insist on the honor due him. Why then was Jacob punished that he was in the house of Laban? Rebecca and Isaac told him to go there. The explanation is that Rebecca sent <i>Deborah</i> immediately after him that Jacob should return home. However, Jacob tarried because of Laban’s daughters, to marry them, and he did not honor his mother and father.<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">Devek Tov, Genesis, 37:35 and note, <i>samech.</i></i>
“<i>His father bewailed him</i>” [37:35]. <i>Rashi</i> asks a question here. Why did Isaac also not cry over the anguish of his son? The explanation is that “<i>His father bewailed him</i>” means that Isaac his grandfather cried and therefore this must be Isaac because Isaac knew well that Joseph was alive, but he cried for the anguish of his son Jacob. It is not written that Isaac mourned and engaged in mourning practices, since the Holy One had let him know that Joseph was still alive, but Isaac was not supposed to tell, because he was under a ban not to tell.<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 37:35.</i>
Similarly, The Holy One informed <i>Benjamin</i> that Joseph was still alive and he was silent. Therefore, the <i>precious stone</i> of Benjamin was in the garment of the <i>High Priest.</i> This <i>precious stone</i> is called <i>Yeshpeh</i> [Jasper], which means <i>yesh peh.</i> That is, he had a mouth to speak and he knew about Joseph, but said nothing. If there was a ban, how did the Holy One tell it to Isaac and Benjamin? The explanation is that the ban was only not to tell Jacob.<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 37:33.</i>
“<i>About that time Judah left his brothers</i>” [38:1]. The children of Jacob saw that Jacob had great anguish over Joseph. The children all hated Judah. They said to him: you were the chief and just as you said that we should not kill Joseph, but we should sell him, so too, if you had said that we should let Joseph go home to our father, we would have listened to you. Therefore, all the brothers hated Judah and denigrated him. Thus, Judah separated himself from them.<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 38:1.</i>
“<i>The daughter of a certain Canaanite</i>” [38:2]. Judah married a wife, the daughter of a merchant.<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban, Genesis, 38:2.</i>
“<i>Er, Judah</i>’<i>s firstborn was displeasing to the Lord</i>” [38:7]. Judah had two children with his wife. The oldest one was called <i>Er</i>; he committed transgressions. The other one was called <i>Onan</i>; he also committed transgressions. Their transgression was that they did not want that their wives should become pregnant and did not inseminate their wives. <i>Er</i> did not want his wife to get pregnant because she was a beautiful woman. He thought that she would become ugly. Therefore the Holy One killed him because of his transgression.<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 38:7.</i> From here our sages learn that one who ejaculates <i>semen without a purpose</i> is killed. This was the transgression of the <i>generation of the Flood.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 38:10.</i>
<i>Er</i> died and Judah said to his son that he should engage in <i>levirate marriage</i> with <i>Er</i>’s wife, in order to establish the name of his brother. The child should be named after his brother <i>Er. Onan</i> thought to himself. I will have children and they will be named after my brother and not after me. Therefore, he did not inseminate his brother’s wife and spilled his <i>seed</i>, and the Holy One killed him.<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis, 38:8–10.</i>
Judah said to <i>Tamar</i>, his daughter-in-law who had been married to Judah’s two sons. Wait until my son <i>Shelah</i> will grow up and he will marry you. However, Judah’s <i>intention</i> was not to give his son to <i>Tamar</i>, because Judah’s two sons who had been married to Tamar had died. Judah thought that this woman Tamar couldn’t keep a husband. Whoever sleeps with her must die, and the <i>law</i> is that whoever has two husbands who died, nobody will marry her a third time.<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 38:11.</i>
<i>Ramban</i> asks a question here. Why did Judah say, I will give you <i>Shelah</i> my son when Judah’s intention was not to do this? He should have said explicitly, since you had two husbands, I do not want to give you Shelah. Therefore, <i>Ramban</i> said that she was justified in expecting to be taken by <i>Shelah</i> for <i>levirate marriage.</i> However, he said: because Shelah is still small and young, it is not right to marry Tamar. He will also <i>spill his seed needlessly</i> because he is not ready to have children. Perhaps he will also die. Tamar saw that <i>Shelah</i> had grown up and <i>Shelah</i> was not given to her as a husband. Tamar disguised herself and removed the clothes that <i>widows</i> used to wear, covered herself with a veil, and sat on the road where Judah, he father-in-law, would pass. She wanted to have children with Judah.<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban, Genesis, 38:11.</i>
“<i>For she had covered her face</i>” [38:15]. He thought she was a whore because she had covered herself. Bahya writes that it was the custom of the whores to cover their faces, in the expectation that they would sleep with every man, even with <i>relatives</i>, and they would not be recognized.<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 38:15.</i>
<i>Rashi</i> also writes another explanation. She covered her face in the house of her father-in-law, Judah, and was very modest. Therefore, he did not think that it could be her, and he did not recognize her.<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 38:15.</i>
From here our sages learn that a person should accustom himself to see their relatives and to recognize them, in the expectation that he should not commit a transgression, as happened with Judah and Tamar.<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 38:15.</i>
“<i>Let me sleep with you</i>” [38:16]. Judah said: prepare yourself and I will sleep with you. Tamar said: what will you give me if I will sleep with you? Judah responded: I will send you a kid. Tamar responded: give me a pledge. Judah said: what shall I give you as a pledge? She said: give me your <i>signet ring</i> that sign with and she wanted a garment with <i>zizit</i> that Judah should give her from his body.<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban, Genesis, 38:18.</i>
She thought to herself: if he will hold on to the garment with the <i>zizit</i>, the <i>zizit</i> will hit Judah in his face and he would not want to sleep with her. There is a story about a rabbi who gave four hundred golden coins to a prostitute, so that he should sleep with her. The <i>zizit</i> flew in his face and he quickly removed himself from the prostitute.<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">Keli Yakar, Genesis, 38:18; the story is in B. <i>Menahot,</i> 44a.</i>
It is said that Tamar desired these three things as pledges. She showed him that her intention was not as a prostitute, but as a pious <i>daughter of Israel</i>, who when she wants to have relations with a man, she needs a <i>wedding canopy</i> and a ring to sanctify the <i>marriage.</i> Therefore, she said: give me the ring, in place of the <i>sanctification</i>, the staff as poles for the <i>wedding canopy</i> and the <i>talit with the zizit</i>, as a cover for the <i>wedding canopy.</i> It is still the custom in <i>Ashkenaz</i> that one makes the <i>wedding canopy</i> from a <i>talit</i> with <i>zizit.</i> Therefore, she said: and your garment and staff; just like nobles with a staff.
“<i>He gave them to her and slept with her and she conceived by him</i>” [38:18]. He gave them to her and she conceived from him. <i>Rashi</i> asks a question here. What is the meaning of “<i>she conceived by him</i>”? The explanation is that she had children who were righteous as Judah.<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 38:18.</i>
Tamar went home immediately and donned her old clothes and Judah sent the kid to the woman. He wanted his <i>pledges</i> back, but they did not find her.
“<i>Judah was told, Tamar has played the harlot</i>” [38:24]. It was told to Judah that Tamar, his daughter-in-law, had become pregnant. Judah said that Tamar should be burned in the fire. <i>Rashi</i> writes that she was the daughter of Shem, who was a priest. That is why he ordered her to be burned.<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 38:24.</i>
<i>Ramban</i> writes. The custom was in some lands that a woman who engages in illicit sexual relations and is married, that woman is given into the hands of her husband. He can do whatever he wants with her. Tamar was supposed to marry Shelah. She was like a <i>married woman.</i> Therefore, he ordered her to be burned.<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban, Genesis, 38:24.</i>
“<i>As she was being brought out</i>” [38:25]. Tamar was being taken out to be burned and she said to her father-in-law. I am pregnant from the person to whom these three things belong. Tamar wanted to shame her father-in-law before being burned. She said: if Judah, my father-in-law, would recognize them then it is good. If he does not want to recognize them, then I will allow myself to be burned. From here our sages learn that a person should not shame his friend, but he should allow himself to be thrown into a fire.<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 38:25.</i>
<i>Ba</i>’<i>al ha-Turim</i> writes. Judah had ordered that a sign should be burned in her face that people should know that she was a whore. However, he did not order her to be burned completely.<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote">Ba’al ha-Turim, Genesis, 38:25.</i>
“<i>Examine these</i>” [38:25]. Tamar said: examine the <i>signet</i>, the garment and the staff, and Judah recognized them.
“<i>He said, she is more in the right than I</i>” [38:26]. Judah said that Tamar is right in what she says. She became pregnant by me. <i>Rashi</i> writes that a <i>heavenly voice</i> called down: I wanted that Tamar should sleep with Judah, so that righteous people should come from Tamar, because she was modest in her father-in-law’s house. Therefore, kings of Israel should be descended from her. Tamar was right because she had not been married to Shelah, and that is why she did this.<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 38:26.</i>
<i>Ramban</i> writes. “<i>She is more in the right than I</i>” [38:26], means, Tamar is more pious than I am. I had intended to have sexual relations with an impure woman, but Tamar’s intention was to fulfill the commandment of levirate marriage.<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban, Genesis, 38:26.</i>
The custom was that the closest relative performed the levirate marriage, even the father-in-law. Therefore, Hizkuni also writes, why was Judah not liable to be burned because he slept with his daughter-in-law? The explanation is because Tamar had no children. Therefore, Judah could have married Tamar, as is the custom with levirate marriage. <i>Hizkuni</i> also writes that Tamar was still a <i>virgin.</i> She had not been properly married to Judah’s children. Therefore, she would have been allowed to marry Judah. <i>Hizkuni</i> writes further, <i>She is more in the right than I</i>” [38:26]. Judah said: Tamar desired to have children from me. She thought that she could not have children from my children; they destroy their <i>seed.</i> Perhaps <i>Shelah</i> will also want to do the same. Therefore, I will have relations with Judah, my father-in-law. Another explanation of “<i>She is more in the right than I</i>” [38:26]. She must remain right; I should not <i>judge</i> to do something to Tamar. If I were to judge to do something to her, then I would also have to be <i>judged.</i> Therefore, Tamar remains right, for my sake.<sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 38:24, 26.</i>
Bahya writes a midrash. The <i>evil Samael</i> had hidden the three pledges in the expectation that Tamar would be killed. Tamar prayed to the Holy One and said: <i>Lord of the Universe</i>, cause the three pledges to be found, so that three souls should not be lost. That is to say, Tamar had twins in her belly. The Holy One sent the <i>angel Gabriel</i> that he should bring the three pledges before the <i>judges</i> so that they should see that Tamar was right.<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 38:25.</i>
“<i>He was not intimate with her again</i>” [38:26]. He did not sleep with her again. So writes Hizkuni. He was afraid to sleep with her. He thought that she killed all the men who slept with her. He was also afraid to sleep with her, because she was his daughter-in-law. Some sages say that he continued to sleep with her.<sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 38:26.</i>
“<i>There were twins in her womb</i>” [38:27]. Hizkuni writes. The midwife said to Tamar: you have twins in your belly. Therefore, she prepared a red thread to identify the first one who would emerge.<sup class="footnote-marker">83</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 38:27.</i>
When the child emerged, she tied a red thread on the hand of the child, to recognize which one was the firstborn. He was called <i>Zerach.</i> That is to say, he shined with his red thread. <i>Zerach</i> had stuck out his hand from the mother’s body. They tied the red string on him and he pulled his hand back into his mother, and the other one emerged. He was called <i>Perez.</i> That is to say, you are strong and came out first, before the first brother came out.
“<i>Joseph was taken down to Egypt</i>” [39:1]. Joseph came to Egypt into the house of <i>Potiphar</i> and everything that Joseph did, he had great <i>luck</i> and success.
“<i>His master saw that the Lord was with him</i>” [39:3]. <i>Rashi</i> writes. Joseph’s master saw that Joseph always mentioned the name of the Holy One.<sup class="footnote-marker">84</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 39:3.</i>
Wherever he went, he mumbled like a magician. The master said to Joseph. Are there too few magicians in Egypt, and you also engage in magic? The Holy One showed a cloud that stood over Joseph. Wherever he went, the cloud went with him. Joseph’s master saw that the Holy One was with Joseph and his master placed him over all of his house and his treasures. The Holy One blessed the master’s house because of Joseph. He believed him completely and asked for no <i>accounts</i> from him, from the time that his master had seen the cloud going with Joseph.
Bahya writes. The verse says, “<i>in the house and outside</i>” [39:5]. The blessing was on the field and in the house. This teaches us that Joseph was in Potiphar’s house a whole year and then he was in prison for twelve years. Joseph was separated from his father for thirteen years before he became a king in Egypt. Joseph should only have been in Potiphar’s house for eleven years, according to the dream of the eleven stars. They alluded to eleven years. That is to say, <i>Joseph</i> should have become <i>king</i> after eleven years. However, Joseph committed a sin. He relied on the <i>chief cupbearer</i> to Pharaoh, that he should remind Pharaoh to bring him out. He did not rely on the Holy One, who could help him. Therefore, Joseph had to remain in prison for another two years.<sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 39:5.</i>
“<i>Nothing save the food that he ate</i>” [39:6]. <i>Rashi</i> writes. The master had given everything into Joseph’s hands, but he did not give his wife into Joseph’s hands.<sup class="footnote-marker">86</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 39:6.</i>
Ramban and Hizkuni write. The Egyptians did not allow a Hebrew to touch their bread. The verse tells us that the master gave everything into Joseph’s hands, but not his bread, “<i>for the Egyptians could not dine with the Hebrews</i>” [Genesis, 43:32], as the verse says in <i>Miketz.</i> The <i>Egyptians</i> could not eat bread with the <i>Hebrews.</i> They considered the <i>Hebrews</i> impure.<sup class="footnote-marker">87</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban, Genesis, 39:6; Hizkuni, Genesis, 39:6.</i>
<i>Toldot Yizhak</i> writes. “<i>The Lord sent success to everything he undertook</i>” [39:3]. The verse means that whatever Joseph put his hands on, had great luck. There was a merchant who had great luck with whatever he laid his hands on. Joseph also had such great luck. <i>Toldot Yizhak</i> writes another explanation of, <i>The Lord sent success to everything he undertook</i>” [39:3]. This means, the custom was that the merchant must sometimes keep <i>merchandise</i> for a long time before he sells it, in the expectation that he would make a profit from it. Therefore, he had to hold on to the merchandise. However, Joseph had great success. He did not need to hold his merchandise; he was successful immediately.<sup class="footnote-marker">88</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Genesis, 39:3.</i>
Ramban writes. “<i>Nothing save the food that he ate</i>” [39:6]. That is to say, he did not find that Joseph should have taken anything, except for the bread that a person must eat. Also, Joseph did not enjoy the pleasures, even though he had the goods in his hands. He only ate the minimal amount of bread necessary. This is how faithful Joseph was with his master.<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban, Genesis, 39:6.</i>
“<i>Joseph was handsome</i>” [39:6]. The verse tells us that Joseph was very handsome and through this it happened that his master’s wife would want to sleep with him. The <i>Midrash</i> says that Joseph saw that his master treated him well. He adorned himself and ate and drank well. The Holy One said to him: you have forgotten your father, who is sitting in anguish. I will incite your master’s wife and she will desire that you should sleep with her, and will bring you into <i>prison.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">90</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 39:6.</i>
“<i>She said, lie with me</i>” [39:7]. His master’s wife said to Joseph, lie with me. “<i>He refused. He said to his master</i>’<i>s wife</i>” [39:8]. Ramban asks a question here. Why does the verse have to say, “<i>to his master</i>’<i>s wife</i>”? It should say briefly, “<i>He refused. He said, my master does not know</i>” [39:8]. The explanation is that the verse says that even though it was his master’s wife and he had to fear her, and should rightly have slept with her, yet Joseph did not fear his master’s wife. He feared the Holy One more and did not want to sleep with her. That is why the verse says, “<i>He said to his master</i>’<i>s wife, my master</i>” [39:8]. My master is normally with you, so how should I sleep with you?
Bahya writes. A Midrash. The image of his father appeared to Joseph and it said to him: your brothers will be inscribed on the garment of the <i>high priest</i> when the <i>high priest</i> will bring <i>sacrifices</i> in the <i>Temple.</i> If you will sleep with the licentious woman, you will not be inscribed on the garment of the <i>high priest.</i> Therefore, Joseph did not sleep with her.<sup class="footnote-marker">91</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 39:8.</i>
“<i>Except yourself, since you are his wife</i>” [39:9]. <i>Toldot Yizhak</i> writes. Why does the verse have to say, he did not withhold anything, he gave everything into my hands except for you. You are his wife. The explanation is that Joseph said: my master has commanded me concerning everything in my master’s house, even concerning you. I have the authority; if you need clothes and <i>jewelry</i> you must come to me. I can give it to you or not. However, you are his wife to sleep with him, and I am not that. Therefore, the verse says, “<i>since you are his wife</i>” [39:9].<sup class="footnote-marker">92</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Genesis, 39:9.</i>
Bahya and <i>Toldot Yizhak</i> cite the Midrash. His master’s wife said to him. Why do you not want to sleep with me? No person will know? Joseph responded: A <i>Hebrew</i> is not allowed to sleep with a gentile woman even if she is unmarried. How can I sleep with you? You are <i>a married woman</i> and have a husband. A parable. A gentile calls a Hebrew to eat an excellent pig with him. The Hebrew responds: I cannot even eat ox meat that has not been properly <i>slaughtered.</i> So Joseph said: your <i>widows and unmarried women</i> are forbidden to us. <i>How much more so a married woman!</i><sup class="footnote-marker">93</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Genesis, 39:9; Bahya, Genesis, 39:10.</i>
“<i>I would sin before God</i>” [39:9]. <i>Hizkuni</i> writes. You tell me that there is no person here. Joseph responded: the Holy One knows about everything.<sup class="footnote-marker">94</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 39:9.</i>
<i>Rashi</i> writes that Joseph said to her. It is also forbidden for you to sleep with a strange man. Not sleeping with <i>a married woman</i> is also a commandment that was given to the children of <i>Noah</i> before the Torah was given.<sup class="footnote-marker">95</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 39:9.</i>
“<i>To lie with her, to be with her</i>” [30:10]. Joseph did not listen to sleep with her in this world, in the expectation that he would not be with her in the next world. Whoever sleeps with a gentile woman ends up in <i>Gehenna.</i> Bahya writes. There are three types who are <i>trustworthy</i> in the world. One is a <i>householder</i> who properly <i>tithes.</i> The second is a <i>widower</i> who has no wife and is constantly among <i>loose women</i> and does not engage in illicit relations with them. He is very <i>trustworthy.</i> The third is a <i>pauper</i> who is given money to hold and he returns it. So too, Joseph was a fine young man, seventeen years old. He was among many loose women in Egypt and he was <i>trustworthy</i>, not touching any of them, even though his master’s wife adorned him with beautiful garments. Every day, his master’s wife gave Joseph two garments, a white garment in the morning and a white garment in the evening. She implored him greatly that he should sleep with her. She had seen in the stars that she would have children from Joseph. However, the stars showed that Joseph would have children from her daughter. Joseph converted his master’s daughter and married her.<sup class="footnote-marker">96</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 39:10.</i>
“<i>One such day, he came into the house to do his work</i>” [39:11]. Hizkuni writes. The verse tells us about the piety of Joseph. He did not have the desire to sleep with her, since it was daytime. The custom is that one does not have sexual relations with one’s wife, and especially not with someone else’s wife. However, his master’s wife was brazen and wanted to sleep with him, even during the day.<sup class="footnote-marker">97</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 39:11.</i>
<i>Rashi</i> writes. It was a big <i>holiday</i> and his master’s wife said that she was <i>sick</i> and could not go to the <i>temple.</i> She thought this up. She said to Joseph. Now is a time that you can sleep with me. There is nobody in the house. Some sages say that Joseph did want to sleep with her. His inclination overcame him, but the image of Jacob appeared to Joseph and Joseph separated himself from her.<sup class="footnote-marker">98</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 39:11.</i>
“<i>He left his garment in her hand</i>” [39:12]. The woman was holding his garment and she said, you must sleep with me. Joseph left her the garment. <i>Bahya</i> writes here that it was an act of <i>righteousness</i> for Joseph. He did not want to tussle with his mistress, so he honored her by leaving his garment with her.<sup class="footnote-marker">99</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 39:12.</i>
“<i>He fled outside</i>” [39:12]. Joseph ran out so that his inclination should not overcome him to sleep with her, since Joseph’s inclination was afire. She almost convinced him, particularly in the room when they were alone.<sup class="footnote-marker">100</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid.</i>
“<i>She called out to her servants</i>” [39:14]. When she saw that Joseph had run out, she called out and shouted to her household that Joseph had wanted to forcibly sleep with her. Joseph heard that I was shouting and he ran out, leaving his garment with me. <i>Hizkuni</i> writes. She said that Joseph had removed his garment in order to forcibly sleep with her. That is why he forgot the garment and ran away quickly.<sup class="footnote-marker">101</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 39:12.</i>
“<i>She told him the same story</i>” [39:17]. When the master came and lay down beside her, she said to him. Joseph also did this to me. That is to say, just like you embrace and kiss me, Joseph also did this to me. That is, he did not properly lie near me, but embraced and kissed me. I shouted and he ran away. Ramban and also <i>Bahya</i> ask a question. How is it that she should say that Joseph properly lay near me? She made herself despicable to her husband. Also, <i>Potiphar</i> was a <i>eunuch</i> and could not sleep with any woman. However, he lay near his wife and kissed and embraced her. Therefore, she said that you are now doing what Joseph also did. If you want to ask, Potiphar, Joseph’s master, had a daughter with his wife. So how could he have been a <i>eunuch</i>, and not have proper relations with his wife? The explanation is that when <i>Potiphar</i> saw Joseph for sale and that Joseph was handsome, <i>Potiphar</i> thought he would buy him to have <i>homosexual relations</i> with him. The Holy One caused that <i>Potiphar</i> should not be able to sleep with any woman and became a <i>eunuch</i>, in the expectation that he should not have <i>homosexual relations</i> with Joseph.<sup class="footnote-marker">102</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban, Genesis, 39:19; Bahya, Genesis, 39:19.</i>
Therefore, <i>Rashi</i> also writes that she said, <i>sexual practices like these.</i> That is to say, when we used to kiss and embrace, Joseph did as you are doing to me.<sup class="footnote-marker">103</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 39:19.</i>
“<i>He put him in prison</i>” [39:20]. Hizkuni writes. He was put in prison, but they could not <i>judge</i> him; there were no witnesses present. The Talmud says that Joseph was brought to the king. The <i>angel Gabriel</i> disguised himself as one of the <i>nobles</i> and said to the king that they should discover who was right. If the garments of the woman were torn, then Joseph would be in the wrong. He had wanted to sleep with her by force. If Joseph’s garments were torn, then she had wanted to sleep with him by force. They found that Joseph’s garments were torn. <i>Priests</i> sat in <i>judgment.</i> The <i>priests</i> declared Joseph innocent, but they said that it would be a disgrace for the woman if we were to declare Joseph innocent. Therefore, let him sit in <i>prison</i>, so that people would not say that the woman was a whore. Because, the <i>priests judged</i> properly, therefore, Joseph gave them sufficient bread, when he became king during the famine.<sup class="footnote-marker">104</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 39:20.</i>
“<i>He put him in prison</i>” [39:20]. Joseph was put in the <i>prison</i> where the <i>nobles</i> were placed; it was light in the prison.
“<i>The Lord was with Joseph</i>” [39:21]. The Holy One was with Joseph in the prison.
“<i>Some time later, the cupbearer of the king gave offense</i>” [40:1]. As a result of <i>Potiphar</i>’<i>s</i> wife, all the people spoke about Joseph. The Holy One caused the <i>nobles</i> of the king to do bad things to the king, so the people would forget about talking about Joseph. The king’s cupbearer gave him a beaker of wine and the king had him put in <i>prison.</i> However, afterwards the king let him go free, since the <i>noble</i> was not responsible that a fly fell into it. Who can protect themselves from this, when he gives it into the hand of the king? The other noble was the bread baker to the king. The king found a piece of earth in the bread and the king also put him into <i>prison.</i> However, afterwards the king killed him. He could have been careful that a pebble and piece of earth should get into the bread. The two <i>nobles</i> were put in the prison where Joseph was. The head of the prison told Joseph to serve the two nobles, and the nobles were in the prison for a whole year.<sup class="footnote-marker">105</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 40:1.</i>
“<i>Each dream with its own meaning</i>” [40:5]. Each one had a dream about himself, and also dreamed about his <i>colleagues dream</i> and what it meant. The other <i>noble</i> also had a <i>dream</i> about himself and also about his friend.<sup class="footnote-marker">106</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 40:5.</i>
“<i>They were distraught</i>” [40:6]. Joseph came the next morning and the noblemen were upset. Joseph asked them why they were upset. They said: we had a dream and we don’t know the meaning of the dream.
“<i>There is no one to interpret them</i>” [40:8]. <i>Hizkuni</i> writes. There is no one among us in the <i>prison</i> that can interpret the dream. Joseph said: tell me the dream. Perhaps God will give that I will be able to interpret them.<sup class="footnote-marker">107</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 40:8.</i> The cupbearer said to Joseph. I dreamed that there was a grapevine before me and there were three branches on the vine. They sprouted and the grapes ripened quickly. I also dreamed that I took the king’s goblet into my hand and I took the grapes and squeezed them into the king’s goblet. Then I gave the goblet into the hand of Pharaoh. Joseph said: the dream means that the three branches are three days, and after three days Pharaoh will again take you back to be his cupbearer, as before. Remember me and do me an act of kindness and help me to get out of prison.
“<i>For I was kidnapped from the land of the Hebrews</i>” [40:15]. Joseph told them the land from which he came and he was not ashamed among the gentiles that he was a <i>Hebrew.</i> Therefore, he was worthy to be buried in the land of Israel. However, Moses Our Teacher did not disclose his land, as the verse says in Exodus, “<i>an Egyptian rescued us</i>” [Exodus, 2:19]. The daughters of <i>Jethro</i> said that the <i>Egyptian</i> helped us. They called Moses an Egyptian. Therefore, Moses was not worthy to be buried in the land of Israel.<sup class="footnote-marker">108</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 40:15.</i>
“<i>The chief baker saw how favorably he had interpreted</i>” [40:16]. The head of the bakers saw that Joseph had properly interpreted the dream. Rashi writes. How did he see that he had properly interpreted? The explanation is that the head of the bakers dreamed that the chief cupbearer would go out of the prison in peace.<sup class="footnote-marker">109</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 40:5.</i>
“<i>He said to Joseph</i>” [40:16]. The <i>head of the bakers</i> said: I dreamed that I was carrying three baskets in which one carries bread on one’s head. In the top basket were all kinds of delicacies for the king, and the birds were eating it. Joseph responded: the three baskets mean three days. After three days Pharaoh will hang you on the gallows and the birds will eat your flesh.
“<i>On the third day</i>” [40:20]. The third day came and it was the day that he became king and he made a <i>feast</i> for his nobles. He remembered the two nobles and he restored the cupbearer to his earlier <i>position</i>, and he hanged the baker.
“<i>The chief cupbearer did not remember Joseph</i>” [40:23]. The <i>nobleman</i> did not remember the good that Joseph had done, that he should remember him positively before Pharaoh. Since Joseph had relied on the <i>nobleman</i>, therefore he had to sit in <i>prison</i> for two years, so that he would rely on God to help him.<sup class="footnote-marker">110</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 40:23.</i>

Miketz

“<i>After two years time</i>” [41:1]. At the end of two years, Pharaoh had a dream. <i>Hizkuni</i> writes. The Talmud writes in [tractate] <i>Sotah.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Sotah,</i> 36b.</i> Joseph wanted to sleep with his master’s wife, but the image of Jacob appeared and overcame his inclination. He stuck the nails of his ten fingers in the earth and allowed the semen to go out. The king found a nail in it and he was angry. He was supposed to have twelve tribes like his father. Nonetheless, he only had two children, because he had lost the children when he released semen from his ten fingers. Also as a result, Joseph was commanded to be in prison for ten years and a further two years because he had relied on the chief cupbearer.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 41:1.</i>
After twelve years Pharaoh had a dream where he was standing by the water, and after two years Pharaoh had a dream. Bahya and <i>Toldot Yizhak</i> ask, why did the verse not say, <i>and Pharaoh, king of Egypt?</i> The explanation is because his downfall first came with the ten plagues, through the hand of Moses, who punished the river that it became all blood. Here, the dream was by the water, and that is why the verse does not want to call him king. That is to say, his <i>kingship</i> had become ordinary near the water. Therefore in the whole <i>portion</i> it is just written <i>Pharaoh</i> and not <i>king.</i> As soon as he starts to think that Joseph should become a king, He remembered <i>Pharaoh</i>, “<i>when he stood before Pharaoh, king of Egypt</i>” [41:46]. That is to say, for the sake of <i>Joseph</i>’<i>s honor</i> it says that <i>Pharaoh</i> was a <i>king</i>, and he made Joseph a <i>king.</i> The verse shows us that <i>the kingdom of Pharaoh</i> remained standing because Joseph had given him the <i>advice</i> that he should gather grain for the famine. Therefore, it also says, “<i>by the river</i>” [41:1]. This means, he <i>dreamed</i> that he was standing over the water. It should have correctly said, <i>by the bank of the river.</i> This would have meant, by the shore of the water. This shows us that Pharaoh made himself to be a false god. He was a lord and said that he created the water, and what the <i>evildoer intended</i> came to him in a <i>dream.</i> The Holy One wanted to drown Pharaoh with <i>dreams</i> and to make his <i>wise men</i> fools, that they should not know what the dream meant, in the expectation that Joseph would come and explain the dream and would become a king.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 41:1; Toldot Yizhak, Genesis, 41:1.</i>
“<i>Seven cows, handsome</i>” [41:2]. <i>Pharaoh</i> saw in the <i>dream</i> how seven cows came to the river. They wanted to drink.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 41:2.</i> This alluded to satiety and hunger, since the cows plow and make grain and bread. The cows were handsome. This showed that there would be much grain and great satiety. Afterwards, Pharaoh saw another dream and again seven cows, thin and emaciated. These cows ate up the seven handsome cows. Pharaoh then awoke. Pharaoh fell asleep again. He had another dream about seven handsome ears of grain on one stalk, and again seven threshed out ears of grain followed the good ears and swallowed them.
“<i>Pharaoh awoke and it was a dream</i>” [41:7]. Pharaoh woke up and saw that the dream needed to be interpreted. <i>Hizkuni</i> asks a question here. Why did the verse not say at the first dream, “<i>Pharaoh awoke and it was a dream</i>”? He should also have needed to interpret the first dream. The explanation is that in the dream where the cows ate the other cows, this is not such a great <i>novelty</i>, since cows have mouths with which to eat. However, the seven ears eating the other seven ears is something novel. Therefore Pharaoh was frightened about the seven ears.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 41:7.</i>
“<i>His spirit was agitated</i>” [41:8]. In the morning Pharaoh was very frightened. His <i>soul</i> was very agitated.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 41:8.</i> Bahya writes. Why did Pharaoh not forget the dream and <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i> did forget the dream? The explanation is that if Pharaoh had forgotten the dream and had asked the <i>wise men</i> that they should tell him the dream and its meaning, then the <i>chief cupbearer</i> would not have brought Joseph out of the <i>prison.</i> He thought that Joseph would not know to tell someone what they had <i>dreamed</i>, but Joseph knew how to explain a dream that one placed before him. Therefore, the Holy One caused that Pharaoh did not forget the dream. However, <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i> did not tell the <i>dream.</i> He thought to himself. If I were to tell the dream, then many wise men would come and explain what is meant, but I will not know which is telling the truth. Therefore, I will not tell the dream. Whichever wise man will come and tell me what I <i>dreamed</i>, he will also be able to explain the dream.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 41:8.</i> So write <i>Hizkuni</i>, <i>Toldot Yizhak</i>, and <i>Imre Noam.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 41:8; Toldot Yizhak, Genesis, 41:10–12; Imre Noam, Genesis, 41: 8.</i>
<i>Toldot Yizhak</i> and <i>Imre Noam</i> give another explanation. <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i>’<i>s</i> dream was about what would happen after many thousands of years. Therefore, <i>Daniel</i> should have explained the dream, that the dream shows what would happen after many long years, thus <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i> did not believe in it. <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i> had said, who tells me that what Daniel says is true. However, since Daniel told him the dream that <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i> had dreamed, the <i>king Nebuchadnezzar</i> was amazed that Daniel knew the dream and believed how he had interpreted the dream. However, here with Pharaoh, the dream was what would happen in the immediate future. Thus, they could soon see that Joseph was correct about what he said concerning the dream. Therefore, Pharaoh did not forget the dream.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Genesis, 41:10–12; Imre Noam, Genesis, 41: 8.</i>
<i>Toldot Yizhak</i> asks another question. Why did Pharaoh not kill the wise men who could not explain the dream? Nebuchadnezzar had asked his wise men that they should tell him what he had dreamed. This is hard to know and they did not tell him and he had them all killed. The explanation is that Nebuchadnezzar’s wise men advised him to kill the <i>priests</i> and destroy the <i>Temple.</i> If the priests had been alive, they could have explained the dream through the <i>Urim veTumim.</i> Nebuchadnezzar said: because you caused the priests to be killed, therefore tell me what the dream means and if you do not tell me, I will kill you all.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Genesis, 41:10 –12.</i>
“<i>A Hebrew youth was there with us, a servant of the chief steward</i>” [41:12]. The <i>chief cupbearer</i> said to Pharaoh. The baker and I had dreams and there was with us a Hebrew youth, a servant who properly explained the dreams to us.
<i>Rashi</i> writes here. The favor of an evildoer is not whole. That is to say, when an evildoer does a favor for a righteous person, he does not do it wholeheartedly. When the <i>chief cupbearer</i> wanted to do Joseph a favor to get him out of the <i>prison</i>, he said that Joseph was a youth, a fool. He is not suitable as a leader, a Hebrew who cannot speak our language. He is a servant. It was written in the <i>protocols</i> that no servant could be a king in <i>Egypt.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 41:12.</i>
<i>Hizkuni</i> writes. The <i>chief cupbearer</i> feared that if Joseph would become king, he would be angry with me that I left him sit for so long and did not help him. Therefore, <i>chief cupbearer</i> spoke ill of Joseph. Hizkuni writes another explanation why he spoke ill. He thought the king would become angry with him when he would discover that such a wise man was sitting in prison.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 41:12.</i>
However, <i>Toldot Yizhak</i> writes. The thought of the chief cupbearer was to praise Joseph greatly, to bring him so that he should become king. Therefore, the chief cupbearer said to Pharaoh that Joseph is very wise and in addition, is a <i>prophet.</i> Therefore he said to Pharaoh, you want to remember the one who interpreted our dream. He is no <i>elder</i>; he is a young man who could have learned little wisdom. Thus, there is <i>prophecy</i> within him. He knows how to interpret dreams. If you want to think that he is a sorcerer and does <i>sorcery</i> and thus knows how to interpret dreams, he is a Hebrew, who does not pursue sorcery. If you want to say that he is a nobleman who learns wisdom, he is a servant who has no time to learn wisdom. He works for the chief steward. They did not have time for study, but they were busy with their <i>work.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Genesis, 41:10 –12.</i>
“<i>As he interpreted for us, so it came to pass</i>” [41:13]. [Midrash] <i>Rabbati</i> writes. A woman comes before <i>Rabbi Eliezer</i> and said. I saw in a dream that the beam of my house broke. He said: you will have a son who will live, and she had a son. Another time, the woman came to the <i>house of study</i> of <i>Rabbi Eliezer</i> to again ask about a dream. Rabbi Eliezer was not at home. The <i>students</i> said: tell us. She told them her dream; a beam in my house broke. The <i>students</i> answered, your husband will die. The woman shouted and cried. <i>Rabbi Eliezer</i> came over immediately and asked why the woman was crying. The <i>students</i> said that they had interpreted her dream that her husband would die. Rabbi Eliezer said; you have killed her husband with your words, since all the dreams follow the words of how one interprets it, as the verse says, “<i>As he interpreted for us, so it came to pass</i>” [41:13].<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Lamentations Rabbah,</i> 1.18.</i>
“<i>But none could interpret them for Pharaoh</i>” [41:8]. <i>Bahya</i> writes that Pharaoh had a dream and also saw what the dream meant. He remembered the dream, but forgot what it meant. Pharaoh’s wise men said that he would have seven daughters and he would bury seven daughters. However, Pharaoh did not want to accept this, since Pharaoh’s heart was beating in his body.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 41:8.</i>
<i>Bahya</i> and <i>Toldot Yizhak</i> ask. Why did Pharaoh’s <i>wise men</i> not understand that it meant hunger and satiety? One plows the field with the cow and the ox to get bread. The ears are of grain. The explanation is that the Holy One made the wise men foolish, in the expectation that Joseph would come and explain the meaning of the dreams.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 41:8; Toldot Yizhak, Genesis, 41:10–12.</i>
“<i>He was rushed from the dungeon</i>” [41:14]. Our sages learn from here that the <i>redemption</i> comes from <i>troubles</i>; out of the pit, Joseph soon became a <i>king.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 41:14.</i>
“<i>He had his hair cut and changed his clothes</i>” [41:14]. He had his hair cut and put on other clothes. <i>Rashi</i> asks a question. How did Joseph know that he would be freed, that he allowed his hair to be cut? The explanation is that Joseph did everything for the sake of <i>Pharaoh</i>’<i>s honor</i>, because he was coming before a king.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 41:14.</i>
“<i>To hear a dream is to tell its meaning</i>” [41:15]. Pharaoh said to Joseph. I have heard that you understand the meaning of dreams.
Joseph responded. “<i>God will see to Pharaoh</i>’<i>s welfare</i>” [41:16]. The Holy One will tell you what the dream means. <i>Bahya</i> writes. Pharaoh and his whole nation thought that the whole world was guided by the seven planets in heaven. The Holy One had no power in the world, <i>heaven forbid.</i> When Pharaoh saw seven ears, Pharaoh thought that the number seven alludes to the seven planets that will cause hunger and satiety. Therefore, Joseph first said, the Holy One will respond. That is to say, do not think that the planets and <i>constellations</i> do anything on the earth, but everything comes from the Holy One.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 41:16.</i>
“<i>Seven sturdy and well-formed cows</i>” [41:18]. Pharaoh told his dream to Joseph, how he saw seven cows, strong and well formed. <i>Bahya</i> asks a question. Why is it written here that the dream Pharaoh told Joseph was different from the dream that was written above? The explanation is, our sages say that Joseph said to Pharaoh, you have not seen “<i>Seven sturdy and well-formed cows</i>” [41:18], but you saw “<i>handsome and sturdy</i>” [41:2]. Joseph told many other similar things to Pharaoh. You saw differently in the dream. Pharaoh was amazed. Were you in my dream, or are you a <i>prophet?</i> Therefore, Pharaoh later said about Joseph, “<i>since God has made all this known to you</i>” [41:39]. That is, the Holy One told you everything, so that you know what I dreamed.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 41:18.</i>
“<i>Pharaoh</i>’<i>s dreams are one and the same</i>” [41:25]. Joseph responded. Do not think, Pharaoh, because you saw seven cows in the dream and later saw seven ears that these are two different things, but it is one dream. The Holy One who is showing you that there will first be seven years of much grain. There were the seven good cows and the good ears, and the seven bad cows and seven bad ears mean that there will be seven years of great hunger. Therefore, the dream was repeated twice, once it was cows and once ears. This shows that the Holy One will soon bring satiety and hunger.
Hizkuni asks a question here. Joseph also had two dreams, one after another, about his brothers and they were not fulfilled immediately. The explanation is that with Pharaoh there were two dreams in one night. Therefore, they were fulfilled quickly. However, Joseph’s dreams did not occur in one night.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 41:32.</i>
“<i>Let Pharaoh find a man of discernment and wisdom</i>” [41:33]. Joseph said: you, Pharaoh should choose a man who is <i>wise, discerning</i>, and understanding. He will be able to lead the land, with sufficient bread, and what will be surplus should be sold. He should gather silver and gold into the king’s treasury. He should be wise, so that he will be able to make sure the grain will not be able to spoil.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban, Genesis, 41:33.</i>
“<i>Let Pharaoh take steps to appoint overseers</i>” [41:34]. Pharaoh should appoint a man, and he should appoint <i>officials</i> to gather the grain.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 41:34.</i>
“<i>Organize the land of Egypt</i>” [41:34]. Each one should give a fifth of their grain into the king’s treasury. Even though, previously they gave a tenth, but now it was right that they should give a fifth to increase the treasury, in the expectation that the people should not die in the famine.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 41:35.</i>
“<i>Let the grain be collected</i>” [41:35]. Joseph <i>advised</i> that they should make treasuries in the ground to hide the grain.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 41:35.</i>
“<i>Could we find another like him, a man in whom is the spirit of God?</i>” [41:38]. Pharaoh was very pleased with Joseph’s advice and [it found favor] in the eyes of the nobles. Pharaoh said: is there found such a man in whom is the <i>spirit</i> of God?
<i>Ramban</i> writes. Since the <i>Egyptians</i> hated Hebrews very much, and when a Hebrew touched a piece of bread, they considered the bread impure. Thus, Pharaoh thought that the Egyptians would not <i>agree</i> to make Joseph a viceroy. Therefore, I must talk with them and he said that one does not find an Egyptian who is so wise.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban, Genesis, 41:38.</i>
“<i>Since God has made all this known to you</i>” [41:39]. Pharaoh said: Since the Holy One has told you all this, there is no greater <i>wise and discerning one</i> than you. Therefore, you should be a master over my people. Pharaoh removed his ring from his hand, the one with which one <i>seals things</i>, and put it on the hand of Joseph. He said: you should be a ruler. Only my throne should be higher than yours.
<i>Hizkuni</i> writes. Pharaoh said: I will examine Joseph to see if he is truthful. Perhaps Joseph is lying and he just wants to free himself from the prison. Therefore, I will see. If he will he accept the <i>authority</i>, he told the truth about his solution. If he would not tell the truth, he would not accept the authority, so that he should not remain responsible.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 41:42.</i>
“<i>He put a gold chain about his neck</i>” [41:42]. He put a golden necklace around Joseph’s neck. He rode in the chariot right behind that of Pharaoh. They called out in all the streets, here rides the young king.
“<i>No one shall lift up hand or foot</i>” [41:44]. Pharaoh said: no man should take a sword in his hand without Joseph’s knowledge.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 41:44.</i>
Pharaoh gave Joseph the name <i>Zaphenath-paneah.</i> This means, he said everything that was hidden. That is to say, just like a prophet.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 41:45.</i>
“<i>He gave him Asenath daughter of Poti-phera</i>” [41:45]. He gave Joseph a wife, the daughter of Poti-phera. He was called Poti-phera because he gave fattened calves for foreign gods. He was called Poti-phera because he was a <i>eunuch.</i> He could not sleep with a woman. He said that he became a <i>eunuch</i> because he was ashamed before the other nobles and became a priest<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 41:45.</i>
<i>Hizkuni</i> gives an explanation. He married the daughter of Poti-phera, in the expectation that he would show that he did not sleep with Poti-phera’s wife. If he had slept with Poti-phera’s wife, he should not have married her daughter.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 41:45.</i>
<i>Hizkuni</i> and Bahya write. The <i>Asenath</i> that Joseph married was the daughter of <i>Dinah</i>, who had a daughter with Shechem. The children of Jacob wanted to kill the daughter out of <i>disgrace.</i> Jacob came and made that daughter an <i>amulet</i> that whoever will marry you will know that he is <i>marrying</i> into the family of Jacob. Jacob chased that daughter out of his house. She hid herself among thorns and thistles, and that is why she was called Asenath, because she hid among thorns and thistles. A thorn in <i>Hebrew</i> is <i>sneh.</i> The <i>angel Gabriel</i> came and led Asenath to the house of Poti-phera and the wife of Poti-phera raised her and considered her a daughter. When Joseph came to Egypt, all the women came to see his beauty. Each woman threw him a jewel. Asenath did not have what to throw, so she threw the amulet, which was an image of Jacob and Joseph married her. Later, when Jacob came to Joseph and asked him, whose are the children? Joseph showed him the amulet that Jacob had written.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 41:45; Hizkuni, Genesis, 41:45.</i>

“<i>Before the years of famine, Joseph became the father of two sons</i>” [41:50]. The verse tells us that because it was a great famine, it was <i>forbidden</i> to sleep with one’s wife.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 41:50.</i> Joseph had the children before the famine came. That is to say, they were not born in a sin. That is to say, one is not supposed to <i>sleep with one</i>’<i>s wife</i> during a <i>famin</i>e, nonetheless, one who does not have children is allowed to sleep with one’s wife even during a famine in the hope of having children.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 41:50.</i> Joseph did not have any children and would have been allowed to sleep with his wife even during the famine. The explanation is that Joseph saw great suffering before him when the people were crying and shouting because of the famine. Therefore, it was forbidden for Joseph to sleep with his wife during the famine.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Devek Tov, Genesis, 41:50, n. 5.</i>
Hizkuni asks a question. Levi slept with his wife during the great famine and had a daughter who was called <i>Yocheved</i>, the mother of <i>Moses</i>, <i>Aaron</i> and <i>Miriam.</i> Yocheved was born just as Jacob and his children came to the gates of Egypt, outside the walls of the city of Egypt, in the midst of the famine. The explanation is that Joseph had to separate himself because he knew well that his father and his brothers were also in trouble. However, Levi saw that his father was lacking nothing. If you want to ask, Levi should have thought of Joseph’s troubles. The explanation is that Joseph was one individual and one is not obligated to anguish over one person.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 41:50.</i> However, <i>Devek Tov</i> writes. Joseph had the grain in his hands. He saw the outcry himself that they were calling for bread.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Devek Tov, Genesis, 41:50, n. 5.</i>
“<i>Whatever he tells you, you shall do</i>” [41:55]. Pharaoh said to his people. Go to Joseph and eat what he will give you. <i>Rashi</i> cites a midrash. They came to Joseph. Joseph said to them: my God will not feed someone who is uncircumcised. Therefore, go and have yourselves circumcised. They came again to Pharaoh and said that Joseph desired that we should become <i>circumcised.</i> Pharaoh responded: you fools, why are you crying out to me? Why did you not gather <i>grain</i> the first year there was satiety? They responded: we gathered and it spoiled. Pharaoh asked: do you have no bread from yesterday? They said: even the bread in the basket became spoiled. Pharaoh responded: therefore go to Joseph and allow yourselves to be circumcised for the sake of bread. Whatever Joseph has commanded, that must be. He commanded that the grain would spoil. If he would command us to die, then we would all have to die.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 41:55.</i>

“<i>The famine spread in the land of Egypt</i>” [41:56]. The famine was so strong that whatever they ate did not sate their hunger.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 41:56.</i>
“<i>Jacob saw that there were food rations in Egypt</i>” [42:1]. Rashi writes. Jacob did not see that the grain was there, but he heard it said that the grain was in Egypt. Why does the verse write that he saw? The explanation is that he heard that there was grain in Egypt. He also saw something <i>prophetically</i> that there was hope for Jacob in Egypt. The word <i>shever</i> has two meanings. It means grain and <i>shever</i> also means hope.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 42:1.</i>
“<i>Jacob said to his sons, why do you keep looking at one another</i>” [42:1]. Jacob said to his children. Why are you looking at each other and do not want to go to Egypt for grain? So writes Rashi. Rashi further writes. Why will you appear before the children of <i>Ishmael</i> and <i>Esau</i> that you are sated? That is to say, as if you have enough grain. Yet, you do not want to show yourself before other nations that you have grain. Therefore, go for grain in Egypt.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 42:1.</i> So also writes Hizkuni.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 42:1.</i>

“<i>Ten of Joseph</i>’<i>s brothers went down</i>” [42:3]. Rashi asks a question here. Why does he have to say that they were Joseph’s brothers? He should have said that they were the children of Jacob. The explanation is that they regretted that they had sold their brother Joseph and said: we will redeem him, even for much money, if only we can find him.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 42:3.</i>
Bahya writes. The verse tells us that ten brothers went. That is to say, they wanted to pray with a quorum, which is ten, and that the Holy One should send them their brother Joseph.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 42:3.</i>
Ramban writes. Ten brothers went together to fulfill the dreams. The first dream was about the brothers themselves. Therefore, the brothers had to first bow down alone. When Joseph saw that Benjamin was not with them, Joseph thought that the dreams couldn’t be fulfilled; eleven brothers have to bow down to me. As long as eleven brothers did not bow down, then I should not say to my brothers that I am Joseph. Therefore, Joseph cast aspersions on his brothers so that they should bring Benjamin, in the hope that the first dream will be fulfilled. Also, that the second dream should also soon be fulfilled, that his father and mother should also come to him. If Joseph had not thought this, how is it that Joseph would have <i>troubled</i> his brothers and his old father, and did not long before send a letter to his father, to console him that he is still alive and that he is a <i>minister</i> in Egypt. Egypt was only six days journey from the city of <i>Hebron</i> where Jacob was living. Even if it was a thousand miles, Joseph should have sent a letter to his father to alleviate his father’s troubles and sadness. However, Joseph was wise in dream interpretation and saw that it was not possible for his father and brothers to bow down in their land, their home. He thought that since he was a king in the land of Egypt, then it would be appropriate for them to bow down to me and they would not recognize me. In particular, he saw that it was a great famine and all the nations must come to me.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban, Genesis, 42:9.</i>
“<i>The sons of Israel were among those who came</i>” [42:5]. The sons of Jacob came among other people. They were disguised so they should not be given the <i>evil eye.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 42:5.</i>
“<i>Joseph was the vizier of the land; it was he who dispensed rations</i>” [42:6]. <i>Ramban</i> asks a question here. Is it just that a great lord like Joseph, who was over all of Egypt, that he should sell grain and measure it out himself? The explanation is that Joseph ordered all the treasuries should be closed, but only one treasury was open, in the expectation that his brothers would come to that treasury. Thus he would bring his brothers to himself. Thus, he took the silver with his own hands from each person. <i>Ramban</i> gives another explanation. Joseph commanded the <i>officials</i> that they should sell each nation <i>grain</i> separately in separate treasuries for each land. The children of Jacob came from their land, <i>Canaan.</i> People from the whole land were sent to choose a treasury.<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban, Genesis, 42:6.</i>
“<i>When Joseph saw his brothers, he recognized them</i>” [42:7]. As soon as Joseph saw his brothers, he recognized them. He was afraid that they would also recognize him. He disguised himself and put a Turkish turban on his head and covered his forehead and part of his face. He spoke harshly and angrily with them. He asked them: from where did you come? The said that they were from the land of Canaan. Thus Joseph properly recognized that they were his brothers. That is why it is written again in the verse, “<i>Joseph recognized his brothers</i>” [42:8]. That is, he recognized them with certainty.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban, Genesis, 42:7.</i>
Hizkuni writes. He recognized his brothers clearly. He heard one call the other by name. Joseph was afraid he would be recognized. He thought that if he would say that he was Joseph, his brothers would scatter throughout the world and would not return to their father. Therefore, he thought that they should bring Benjamin.<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 42:6–7.</i>
“<i>They did not recognize him</i>” [42:8]. Joseph recognized his brothers because in the past, each one had a beard. However, Joseph did not have a beard in the past and now Joseph had a beard. So writes Rashi.<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 42:8.</i>
Ramban writes. Joseph had previously thought that his brothers would come to him, and was looking for them and recognized them. However, the brothers never in their lives thought that Joseph would be somebody who would come to a position of great authority.<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban, Genesis, 42:8.</i>

The Midrash says. “<i>Though Joseph recognized his brothers, they did not recognize him</i>” [42:8]. The brothers fell into Joseph’s hands. He recognized that they were his brothers and he had compassion for them, like one brother should have for another. However, when Joseph fell into the hands of his brothers, they did not recognize him as a brother and they sold him.<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Genesis Rabbah</i>, 91.7.

“<i>He said to them, you are spies</i>” [42:9]. Joseph said: you are spies, to spy out the land. The Midrash writes and also Rashi, <i>Hizkuni</i>, and Bahya, that Joseph had commanded that no person should be allowed to enter into any gate in Egypt. He must first write down his name and his father’s name, and from which city he came from. Every evening, the <i>guards</i> brought the letters listing those who had come to the city. When the children of Jacob came, each one went into a different gate and each one wrote his name and his father’s name. In the evening, the ten letters of the ten children of Jacob with their names and the name of their father, Jacob, were brought. Joseph immediately commanded that all the grain treasuries be closed, but only one treasury should remain open. Joseph gave the letters to the <i>official</i> in his hand. If the people called Reuben the son of Jacob, Simeon the son of Jacob, and similarly, the other brothers, this <i>official</i> should stop these children and send them to him. The official waited for three days and they did not come. Joseph immediately took ten <i>strong men</i> from the house of Pharaoh and let them search in Egypt. They found the brothers in the market where the prostitutes are found. The brothers wanted to find Joseph. Since he was a handsome man, he might have been sold to the prostitutes market, to have sexual relations with him. The ten men found them and brought them before Joseph. Joseph said to his brothers, you are <i>spies</i> seeking to see how the land can be conquered.<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 42:9; Bahya, Genesis, 42:3; Hizkuni, Genesis, 42:12.</i>
Bahya writes. Joseph took a goblet in his hand and knocked on it. He said: my goblet tells me that you are spies. The children of Jacob said: our father commanded us that we should not go together in one group, through one gate. Joseph again said to them: what were you doing in the prostitutes market. They responded: we lost something and looked for it there. Joseph again said: my goblet tells me that two of your brothers destroyed the city of <i>Shechem.</i> They became very frightened and said: we are twelve brothers. Our father sent us all together, since there are robbers on the roads because of the famine. If we were strong, two would have been enough to go for grain.<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 42:7.</i>
<i>Toldot Yizhak</i> writes. Why did the brothers answer, we are sons of one father, when he said, you are <i>spies?</i> The explanation is that they answered Joseph, if we had been spies; our father would have sent one alone. It is a great danger, so how is it that a father would send all of his children into such danger. Joseph said; “<i>it is just as I have told you</i>” [42:14]. That is to say, because you are all brothers [and sons] of one man, then you are spies, since spies fear to go with strangers. They think, perhaps one will be captured and they will torture him with fire, to tell them if they are spies. If they would not be brothers, then they would confess and immediately tell them that they are spies. However, one brother does not betray another brother. Therefore, you must be spies, since one brother gives everything for another. Another explanation is because the brothers said, “<i>the youngest, however, is now with our father and one is no more</i>” [42:13]. This means, one is with our father and one died. Joseph responded: because one remained with his father, he must be righteous. He obeyed his father; he did not want to be a spy. However, you are all braggarts and do not obey your father. If your other brother were also a spy, he would also have come here with you.<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Genesis, 42:9–14.</i>
“<i>By Pharaoh</i>” [42:15]. Joseph swore by the life of Pharaoh. You should not leave here. When he wanted to swear a falsehood, he swore by the life of Pharaoh.<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 42:15.</i>
“<i>It is just as I have told you</i>” [42:14]. Joseph said to his brothers. If you had found that much money was demanded to redeem Joseph, would you have redeemed him? They responded: we would gladly redeem him for all the money that would be desired for him. Joseph said: and if they would not want to hand him over, what would you do? They responded: we would risk our lives for it. Joseph immediately swore and said. I see from your words that you are spies.<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 42:14.</i>
Bahya writes here. Joseph swore falsely by the life of Pharaoh. He also swore a second time by the life of Pharaoh; you should not leave me. That is, you should not all leave. He had in mind that Simeon should remain with him as a hostage.<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 42:13.</i>
“<i>Let one of you go</i>” [42:16]. Joseph said: send one of you who will bring Benjamin, your small brother, and you go into prison. Thus, we will see that you are no spies. They all went to prison immediately and on the third day Joseph came to them and said: I fear the Holy One. Therefore, let one of you sit in prison and the rest of you take grain to your father. Bring your small brother here to me.
“<i>They did accordingly</i>” [42:20]. They all did so. Bahya writes. They said together: we are all ready; take which one of us you want.<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 42:20.</i>
“<i>He took Simeon from among them and had him bound before their eyes</i>” [42:24]. Joseph took Simeon and bound him before his brothers. That is to say, to frighten them all. When the brothers departed, Joseph unbound Simeon and gave him food and drink. He took Simeon captive because Simeon had thrown him into the pit with his own hands. Another explanation for why he took Simeon is that he thought, I would separate Simeon from Levi. They are <i>strong men</i> and destroyed the whole city of <i>Shechem.</i> He also feared Simeon and Levi, that they would kill him.<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 42:24.</i>
However, Hizkuni writes. Joseph had intended to take Reuben, since he was the most senior. It is just that when a group is guilty, one takes the senior one. However, Joseph had heard that Reuben regretted that he had been sold and had said, you should not shed blood.<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 42:22.</i>
Bahya writes. “<i>He took Simeon from among them</i>” [42:24]. This means, Joseph took Simeon himself, but the brothers did not want to give any of them as a hostage in the prison. From here, our sages learn that when the nations of the world want to kill an Israelite and say, if you will not give us one, then we will kill you all. Then, <i>all the Israelites</i> should allow themselves to be killed, <i>heaven forbid</i>, before they hand over one of them to be killed.<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 42:24.</i>
“<i>We are being punished</i>” [42:21]. All the brothers said together: we have committed a sin in that we saw the suffering of our brother, Joseph, when we threw him into the pit. He asked us that we should not throw him into the pit. Bahya writes. It is the custom of the righteous that they think of their sins and repent. From here it is shown that the brothers did not sell Joseph, but they threw him into the pit.<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 42:21.</i>
<i>Toldot Yizhak</i> asks a question. Why did the brothers not want to recognize their sins when they were in prison for three days? When they went out, they first recognized their sins. The explanation is that the brothers heard how Joseph said, I fear the Holy One, to cause you suffering. The brothers said: this is a gentile and not an Israelite, and he has compassion for us. We were Jews and Israelites and we did not have compassion for a Jew and in addition was our brother.<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Genesis, 42:21.</i>
“<i>Reuben spoke up and said to them, did I not tell you, do no wrong to the boy</i>” [41:22]. Reuben said to his brothers. I said that you should not sin toward the child, Joseph. You did not listen to me, and his blood is being demanded, even though you did not kill him with your own hands. Yet, it is before the Holy One as if you had killed him with your own hands, because you saw that he was not used to suffer troubles.<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 42:22.</i>
“<i>There was an interpreter between him and them</i>” [42:23]. The brothers spoke <i>Hebrew.</i> Joseph heard everything and the brothers did not think that this was Joseph. He made himself as if he did not understand <i>Hebrew</i> and put his son <i>Menashe</i> as an interpreter to translate between him and his brothers. Joseph heard that his brothers were very sad that they had sold him. He turned away from his brothers and cried.<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 42:23.</i>
“<i>They filled their bags with grain</i>” [42:25]. Joseph ordered that they should fill the grain for the brothers, without measuring, and that their silver should be returned under the grain, so that the brothers should not know about it. However, the second time Joseph ordered the silver to be given to them so that the brothers should know about it. Joseph ordered that they should be given supplies and all sorts of food for the road. Joseph did this because he wanted to show that he did not hate them, but that they should bring their brother.<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 42:25.</i>
“<i>One of them was opening his sack</i>” [42:27]. Levi opened his sack on the road and wanted to feed his donkey. He found that he had the silver in his sack. The brothers were all afraid and said: what has the Holy One done to us that the silver came into our sacks? When they came to their father, they told everything to their father. Their father responded: you have killed me. Joseph is gone and Simeon is also gone, and you want to take Benjamin from me. Jacob suspected that his children had sold Simeon and they also wanted to sell Benjamin.<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 42:27, 28, 36.</i>
“<i>You may kill my two sons</i>” [42:37]. Reuben had four children. He said to Jacob: my two children should be a substitute for Benjamin, if I don’t bring him back, but put Benjamin into my hands. Jacob said to Reuben: you are a <i>firstborn fool.</i> How could I kill my grandchildren, your children, who are like my own children? It is not enough suffering that I would lose Benjamin, <i>heaven forbid</i>, and you want me to also kill my grandchildren?<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 42:37.</i>
<i>Toldot Yizhak</i> asks. Was Reuben such a fool that Jacob would kill Reuben’s children, particularly since they had not sinned? The explanation is that Reuben said to Jacob. My two children should be killed if I don’t return Benjamin. If you Jacob would say that your children are also my children, Reuben could also respond, is Benjamin your son and not my brother? Benjamin is my relative. As much as my children belong to you, so one brother to the other brother is called <i>first with first.</i> That is to say, they are very close. Grandchildren to their grandfather are called, <i>first with second.</i> That is, they are not as close to each other. One brother who loves his brother and therefore, I will watch over Benjamin more and will bring him back to you.<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Genesis, 42:36–37.</i> However, Jacob did not listen to the words of Reuben.<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 42:38.</i>
Judah said to Jacob: my dear father, if Benjamin will go with us, there is a doubt if he will remain or will come. If he will go with us, then we will certainly remain alive, since we will bring grain. If Benjamin will not go with us, then we will not be able to bring grain, and we will certainly die of hunger. Therefore it is better that Benjamin should come with us. There is a doubt if he will be killed and that we should not die of hunger. There is no doubt that we will certainly die of hunger.<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 43:8.</i>
“<i>I myself will be surety for him</i>” [43:9]. Judah said: I will be surety to bring Benjamin and place him before you. If I will not bring him, then I will be called a sinner all my days. If we had not tarried, we could have brought grain back twice.
Bahya writes. The brothers were forced by hunger and did not want to dispute their father that he should give Benjamin, in the expectation that they would suffer hunger until their father should himself tell Benjamin to go with them. Jacob commanded them about five things. The first thing he said was, take a nice <i>present</i> with you, beautiful <i>fruits</i> and good wine, to <i>honor</i> the official who is appointed over the grain. The second is, take enough money, in case it has gotten more expensive. The third is, take the silver that you found in your grain with you. Perhaps the gentile forgot it. The fourth is, take your brother Benjamin. The fifth is, pray.
“<i>May El Shaddai dispose the man to mercy</i>” [43:14]. That the Holy One should give you compassion and grace before the man who is appointed over the grain.
“<i>He may release to you your other brother</i>” [43:14]. Jacob said: God should give that Simeon should come out of prison.<sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 43:14.</i>
<i>Ramban</i> and Bahya write. He did not want to name Simeon explicitly in his prayer, since Jacob hated Simeon because he had killed the people of <i>Shechem.</i> If Jacob had grain in his house, he would not have given Benjamin to redeem Simeon. He would have left Simeon in Egypt.<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban, Genesis, 43:14; Bahya, Genesis, 43:14.</i>
<i>Rashi</i> writes. Jacob had said, “<i>your brother</i>” [43:14]; by this he meant Simeon. Then he said, “<i>other</i>” [43:14] and this means Joseph. That is to say, Jacob thought, perhaps Joseph is still alive. Therefore, he asked God that He should send him back with his brothers.<sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 43:14.</i>
“<i>When Joseph saw Benjamin with them</i>” [43:16]. When the brothers came to Joseph, he saw Benjamin. Joseph said to his clerk, bring all the men to my house. He immediately commanded <i>Menashe</i> that he should slaughter hens, geese, and sheep, since the children of Jacob do not eat without <i>slaughter and inspection.</i> He also commanded that they should porge the veins from the meat, as is the custom among Jews.<sup class="footnote-marker">83</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 43:16.</i>
“<i>For the men will dine with me at noon</i>” [43:16]. <i>Bahya</i> writes here. <i>Ministers and judges</i> eat at noon, since they do not have the time to eat in the morning. Therefore, Joseph said: the men should also eat with me at noon.<sup class="footnote-marker">84</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 43:16.</i>
“<i>The men were frightened</i>” [43:18]. The brothers were afraid. They said: it is not customary that guest should stay in Joseph’s house. It must be that we are brought into the house of Joseph because of the silver that we found in our grain. He will take us as slaves. They immediately said to Joseph. We plead with you. We bought grain and when we came to the inn, we found the silver for the grain in our sacks. Now, we have brought the silver back to return it to you. We have also brought other silver to purchase grain. We do not know who put the first silver into our sacks. Joseph responded: do not be afraid. Your God and the God of your ancestors gave you that silver, but the silver that came for my grain is for me in my hands, and he brought out Simeon to his brothers.<sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 43:18, 20, 23.</i>
“<i>They laid out the gifts</i>” [42:25]. The children arranged the present very beautifully to carry it into the house of Joseph, where he used to eat.<sup class="footnote-marker">86</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 43:25.</i> When Joseph came, the bowed down before Joseph with the present. Joseph asked them: is your father well? They said: he is well and bowed down to him that he had asked about the health of their father.<sup class="footnote-marker">87</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 43:28.</i> When he saw Benjamin, his brother from the same mother, he asked: is this your small brother about whom you told me? Joseph said about Benjamin, “<i>may God be gracious to you, my boy</i>” [43:29]. The Holy One should make people gracious to you, my son. Joseph had compassion for Benjamin and wanted to cry. He ran into another room and cried there. He washed his face and came out again, and ordered that a table be provided for him. A separate table was prepared for the brothers, and a separate table for the household, since the Egyptians did not eat bread with the Hebrews, because the Egyptians worship a sheep and consider a sheep to be a god, and the Hebrews eat sheep. Therefore, no Egyptian would eat with a Hebrew.<sup class="footnote-marker">88</sup><i class="footnote">Targum Onkelos, Genesis, 43:32.</i>
“<i>They were seated from the oldest in order of seniority</i>” [43:33]. Joseph took his goblet in his hand and knocked on it. He called, <i>Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar</i>, <i>Zebulon.</i> They had one mother and he seated them together. Joseph seated all the brothers in the same way. Then Joseph came over to Benjamin. Joseph said: you have no mother and I have no mother, sit near me.<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 43:33.</i>
“<i>The men were astonished</i>” [43:33]. All the brothers were amazed. <i>Toldot Yizhak</i> writes. The brothers were amazed. What nation is he that he does not eat with the Egyptians and also does not eat with us? It is this that amazed them.<sup class="footnote-marker">90</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Genesis, 43:33.</i>
“<i>Portions were served</i>” [43:34]. Joseph gave presents to each brother, but to Benjamin he gave five presents. One part was what he gave each brother. The second part was what Joseph himself gave. The third part was given by <i>Asenath</i>, Joseph’s wife. <i>Menashe</i> gave the fourth part and <i>Ephraim</i> gave the fifth part.<sup class="footnote-marker">91</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 43:34.</i>
“<i>They drank their fill with him</i>” [43:34]. Joseph and his brothers all drank. Joseph and his brothers had taken a vow not to drink until they would become aware of where Joseph was. Joseph had also made a vow. He would see his brothers and learn if his brother was still alive. Here one asks a question. Joseph acted properly that he drank wine and became drunk, because he had heard about his father and saw that his brothers were healthy. However, the brothers made a vow that they would not drink wine until they would hear about Joseph. Why did they now drink when they had not heard about Joseph? The explanation is given by <i>Rabbi Loewe</i> of Prague. The brothers thought. If we will not drink wine with Joseph, he would say that we are <i>spies</i> and are afraid to drink too much, so that we should not reveal that we are spies? The brothers said: Joseph wants to examine us if we are spies. Therefore, we must drink, since it is a danger for us.<sup class="footnote-marker">92</sup><i class="footnote">Gur Arye, Genesis, 43:34.</i>
“<i>He instructed his house steward</i>” [44:1]. He commanded his official to fill as much grain as the men could carry, more than the value of their silver. Joseph also ordered that their silver be put back into their sacks. The brothers should be told that the silver had been put in their sacks because the lord had suspected them of being spies. Joseph wants to apologize, that you should forgive him and therefore he is giving you the silver from the grain.<sup class="footnote-marker">93</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban, Genesis, 44:1.</i>
Ramban and Bahya write. If they would have put the silver in their sacks without their knowledge, and they would have also put the goblet in their sacks without their knowledge, then the brothers could have said, we did not steal the goblet. It came into our sacks without our knowledge. Therefore, Joseph commanded that the silver should be returned with the brothers knowledge, in the expectation that he would order that they should take the goblet from which Joseph himself drank out of at his table, and put it in Benjamin’s sack, without his knowledge. Therefore, Joseph commanded that the silver should be returned with the brothers knowledge, in the expectation that he will order that they should take Joseph’s own goblet, from which he drank at his table, and should put it in Benjamin’s sack without his knowledge.<sup class="footnote-marker">94</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban, Genesis, 44:1; Bahya, Genesis, 44:1.</i> The goblet was a divided goblet. That is to say, one goblet would be put inside another goblet.
Hizkuni asks a question. Why was the goblet put in Benjamin’s sack and not in another sack? The explanation is that Joseph thought, perhaps this is not Benjamin and the brothers had taken a strange young man and said that this was Benjamin. Therefore, Joseph ordered that the goblet should be put in Benjamin’s bag. If they would risk their necks for the sake of Benjamin, then Benjamin is their brother.<sup class="footnote-marker">95</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 44:2.</i>
“<i>With the first light of morning, the men were sent off</i>” [44:3]. From here we learn that one should leave when it is day. Our sages said about this, “<i>a person should always enter with</i> ‘<i>it was good</i>’ <i>and leave with</i> ‘<i>it was good</i>’<i>.</i>”<sup class="footnote-marker">96</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Pesahim</i>, 2a.</i> This means, the person should enter the inn when it is still daylight and should leave when it is already daylight.
“<i>They had not gone far</i>” [44:4]. They left the city and had not gone far. Joseph had them chased after, in the expectation that they would not have gone far, in order not to trouble them to return from a distant way.<sup class="footnote-marker">97</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 44:3–4.</i> Joseph commanded: you should say to them. Why would you pay evil in place of the good that I have done for you?
“<i>It is the very one from which my master drinks</i>” [44:5]. He said: the goblet that my master drinks from at his table. You have <i>stolen</i> it. When someone takes something from the <i>king</i>’<i>s</i> table, he is guilty of the death penalty.
“<i>He uses it for divination</i>” [44:5]. He used to do <i>sorcery</i> with it. Therefore, he loved it very much.<sup class="footnote-marker">98</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Genesis, 44:5.</i>
<i>Ramban</i> writes. The pursuer said: My master asked the <i>sorcerers</i> about the goblet. They told him that you have it. Therefore, my master had you chased after. The brothers responded: how likely is it that we should do such a thing? Previously, we found silver in our sacks and we returned it. Why would we steal our own <i>silver</i> or gold from our master’s house? Therefore, where you will find the goblet among one of us, he will be put to death. Also, all of us brothers will be slaves to our master. Joseph said to his servants. The <i>truth</i> is thus. When a group goes together and one finds a theft by one, then all of them are imprisoned. However, I want to do a <i>kindness</i> with you. Where I will find the theft, he will be my slave, and the rest of you will be free. Ramban writes. “<i>What you are proposing is right</i>” [44:10]. That is, the brothers said: when ten are going together and one finds a theft by one member of the <i>group</i>, perhaps the others did not know about it and are innocent. However, the brothers said: we will all surrender if you will find even by one of us; we will all be slaves to our master. Concerning this, Joseph’s servants responded: you are <i>right.</i> When one finds a theft in one member of a <i>group</i> then the others go free, but the one where the theft is found will be a slave.<sup class="footnote-marker">99</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban, Genesis, 44:5,10.</i>
“<i>He searched, beginning with the oldest</i>” [44:12]. The servant started to search the oldest brother and all the others until he reached the youngest one, expecting that they should not notice.<sup class="footnote-marker">100</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 44:12.</i>
“<i>The goblet turned up in Benjamin</i>’<i>s bag</i>” [44:12]. He found the goblet by Benjamin. The brothers were ashamed and said to Benjamin that he was born to a thief. Your mother, Rachel, also stole the images from <i>Laban.</i> They hit him on his shoulders and because they <i>suspected</i> him for no reason, he was worthy that the <i>Temple</i> was built in his <i>part</i> of the <i>land of Israel.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">101</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 44:12.</i>
“<i>It was a wicked thing for you to do</i>” [44:5]. <i>Toldot Yizhak</i> writes. You don’t know how to steal. As the proverb has it, the thief is hung not because he stole, but one hangs a thief because he does not know how to properly steal.<sup class="footnote-marker">102</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Genesis, 44:5.</i>
“<i>Here we are, then, slaves of my lord, the rest of us as much as he in whose possession the goblet was found</i>” [44:16]. We will also be slaves with the one where you will find the goblet. <i>Toldot Yizhak</i> asks a question here. It is obvious that the one in whose possession the goblet was found would be a slave. How would it be that he should be innocent? The explanation is that the brothers said. The Holy One has found a place to raise up the sin that we all sinned, that we sold our brother. Therefore, we will all be slaves and not we alone want to be slaves, not even the one where you found the goblet, he was not present when we sold Joseph. He should also be a slave. The Holy One sent upon us that the goblet came to us. This explains why he said, “<i>we too</i>” [44:16]. That is to say, even those of us who did not sin with the goblet. Furthermore, we will also be slaves.<sup class="footnote-marker">103</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Genesis, 44:9–10.</i>
“<i>They rent their clothes</i>” [44:13]. They all tore their garments. Even Benjamin where the goblet had been found also tore his garments. Because they suspected him for no reason, Benjamin was worthy that from him <i>Mordecai</i> was descended and wore garments that a king used to wear in the days of <i>Ahasuerus.</i> However, the brothers caused their father to tear his garments when they brought Joseph’s damaged shirt. Jacob tore his garment and therefore the Holy One again sent to the children that they must also tear their garments because of Joseph. The Holy One repays everything, <i>measure for measure.</i> The servant who chased them down was his son, <i>Menashe.</i> Because he caused the children of Jacob to tear their garments, therefore the land of <i>Menashe</i> was divided and torn. Half of his land was across the <i>Jordan</i> and half was <i>outside the land.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">104</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 44:12.</i>
“<i>They threw themselves on the ground before him</i>” [44:14]. The brothers fell before Joseph and also Benjamin. Now the dream was fulfilled that eleven stars would bow down and with <i>Benjamin</i> there were eleven brothers, in comparison with the eleven stars.<sup class="footnote-marker">105</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 44:14.</i>
“<i>What can we say to my lord</i>” [44:16]? What should we say about the first silver that came into our sacks without our knowledge? “<i>How can we plead</i>” [44:16]? What should we now say about the goblet? The Holy One now found a place to ask for His <i>debts</i> for the <i>sins</i> that we did.<sup class="footnote-marker">106</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 44:16.</i>
<i>Ibn Shuaib</i> asks a question. How is it that Joseph sent his brothers himself and kept Benjamin himself and caused his father sorrow? He might die if Benjamin would not return. Why did he not let them know immediately that he was Joseph? The explanation is that Joseph knew well that it was very difficult for Jacob that he should go from the <i>land of Israel</i> to <i>outside the land</i>, to Egypt. Therefore, he did not want to immediately say that he was Joseph. He waited until Judah spoke strong words with him. Then he had to identify himself. Joseph thought that it was from God that Jacob should come to Egypt and I am not responsible for it. Therefore, Jacob first asked the Holy One if he should leave the <i>land of Israel.</i> The Holy One gave him permission and said to him, “<i>do not fear to go down to Egypt</i>” [46:3]. The Holy One did not tell Jacob for twenty-two years that Joseph was in Egypt, since the time for the Egyptian exile had not yet come. For as long as Isaac was still alive, the <i>Egyptian exile</i> could not begin. Joseph knew this well and therefore Joseph asked his brothers, “<i>how is your aged father</i>” [43:27]? This means, is your father, the old one, still alive? Here one asks a question? Why did Joseph have to say, your father, the old one? What is the difference if one is old or young? The explanation is that Joseph asked, is your father Jacob alive and is your grandfather alive? This is Isaac. The brothers had said to Joseph when Joseph said, you are <i>spies</i>, the brothers said: we are descended from important people, from the <i>nobles Abraham</i> and <i>Isaac.</i> Therefore, Joseph asked, is your grandfather Isaac still alive? The brothers responded: “<i>it is well with your servant our father, he is still in good health</i>” [43:28]. That is to say, our father is still alive, but our grandfather is no longer alive. They did not want to explicitly say that he had died. From here we learn that one should not tell bad news explicitly, but one should convey bad news obliquely. We find in the Talmud.<sup class="footnote-marker">107</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Pesahim,</i> 4a.</i> <i>Rabbi Hiyya</i> asked <i>Rav</i>, is my father alive? <i>Rav</i> answered, your mother lives. That is to say, he should understand that his mother lived, but his father was dead.<sup class="footnote-marker">108</sup><i class="footnote">Ibn Shuaib, <i>Derashot</i>, I: 84–85.</i>
“<i>Far be it from me</i>” [44:17]. Joseph said: <i>heaven forbid</i> that you should all be slaves, but the one who had the goblet should be a slave and you should return in peace to your father.

Vayigash

“<i>Judah went up to him</i>” [44:18]. Judah approached Joseph with good words, as <i>King Solomon of blessed memory</i> said, “<i>A gentle response allays wrath; a harsh word provokes anger</i>” [Proverbs 15:1]. The verse teaches us that a person will succeed with soft words on his tongue. So too, Judah saw that Joseph was angry because of the goblet. Therefore, he spoke soft words. He said before Joseph all the words and all the things as it happened, in the hope that he would have compassion.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, <i>Vayigash</i>, Introduction.</i>
Judah prepared himself for legal proceedings, for good words and also for war. Therefore, Judah said, “<i>please, my lord</i>” [44:18]. That is, with me you find everything, whether legal proceedings, good words or war. You will not vanquish me. Therefore, Judah said, “<i>please, my lord</i>” [44:18]. That is, let the sin of the goblet be on me, and not on Benjamin. Let me be a slave and not Benjamin. If you want to say, why do I want to be in the place of Benjamin, more than the other brothers, it is because I was the guarantor with my father to bring Benjamin back home.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 44:18.</i>
“<i>You who are the equal of Pharaoh</i>” [44:18]. Judah said to Joseph. In my eyes you are as important as Pharaoh. Another explanation is, you will be punished because of Benjamin, who you want to detain, like Pharaoh who detained our mother Sarah for one night. He became leprous and so you will be leprous because of Benjamin. The brothers suspected Joseph that he wanted to take Benjamin for <i>homosexual relations</i>, to sleep with him. Another explanation that you are like Pharaoh; how is Pharaoh? He promises and does not keep his word. So too, you do not keep your word. You said that you wanted to do a kindness with Benjamin and now you do very little kindness with him. Another explanation is, Judah said to Joseph. You are like Pharaoh in my eyes. That is to say, if I would go to war with you, I would kill you both and I would begin with you.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 44:18.</i>
“<i>My lord asked his servants, have you a father or another brother</i>” [44:19]? He said: you Joseph, you came only with accusations from the beginning. Why did you need to ask if we have a father? Did we desire to marry your daughters? Judah said to Joseph. You went at us only with <i>accusations.</i> Why would you ask about our father or brothers? Because you asked about our father and brothers, we told you the truth that we have a father and a small brother, and that one brother was lost.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 44:19.</i> In the previous portion they said that one brother was lost. The explanation is that the brothers were now afraid that they lost a brother. Perhaps Joseph would say, search for him and bring him here. Therefore, the brothers said: we learned that one brother died.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 44:20.</i> We have told you that if the youth would be removed from his father, the father would die of anguish and also the youth. <sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 44:22.</i>
You had said: you should not see my face without the youth. We came to our father and our father said, “<i>my wife bore me two sons</i>” [44:27]. That is to say, you will take Benjamin from me. My most beloved wife was Rachel. She only left me two children, Joseph and Benjamin. Joseph is not here, and you will also take Benjamin from me.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban, Genesis, 44:29.</i>
“<i>He meets with disaster</i>” [44:29]. Something will happen to him on the way, like what happened to his brother. He is not used to travel on the roads.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban, Genesis, 44:29.</i> Now that Benjamin is with me, I rejoice with him and console myself with him, over his brother and mother who have died. If you will cause Benjamin to be lost, then you will soon bring me to my grave, with troubles and sorrow over my former days.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 44:29.</i>
Bahya writes. Judah said to Joseph. Be warned about our father. He cursed Rachel when she took the images and Rachel soon died of his curse. He could also curse you. Also, the brothers went to the city of Shechem and destroyed it for the sake of one woman. How much mores so now, for one male, this is Benjamin, two will go and devastate Egypt. In addition, Benjamin is holy. The Holy One will rest in his land and the <i>Temple</i> will be built in his <i>part</i> of the land of Israel. Therefore, hand over Benjamin.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 44:18.</i>
“<i>Your servant has pledged himself for the boy</i>” [44:32]. Judah said: I must speak more than the other brothers because I was the <i>guarantor for Benjamin</i> and <i>accepted excommunication</i> upon myself to bring Benjamin to my father. I have put my <i>share in the world to come</i> in jeopardy.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 44:32.</i> The guarantor loses his soul because he caused the one whom he guaranteed to sin. He lost physically and financially, when Judah was the guarantor for Benjamin.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Ibn Shuaib, <i>Derashot</i>, I: 88.</i>
He said, “<i>I shall stand guilty before my father forever</i>” [44:32]. When <i>Judah</i> said that he had become a guarantor for <i>Benjamin</i>, Joseph said. I see in my goblet that you sold your brother and why were you not the guarantor for him? You brought a sin to his father. When Judah heard this, he said to <i>Naphtali.</i> Find out how many markets and streets there are in the city of Egypt. Naphtali said: there are twelve markets in <i>Egypt.</i> Judah said: I will take three markets to destroy them and you brothers, each one take one market to destroy the people. The brothers said to him, if you will <i>destroy Egypt</i>, it is as if you destroyed the whole world. Judah again began to argue with Joseph. He said: first you came with <i>accusations</i> and said that we were <i>spies.</i> Then you said that we stole the goblet. Therefore, I want to swear by my father and you swore by the life of <i>Pharaoh</i> the evildoer. Now I will take out my sword and chop off your head. I will open my mouth and swallow you up. Joseph said: I will stop up your mouth with a stone. Judah said: the fire of the city of Shechem burns in my heart. Joseph said: the fire of your daughter-in-law, <i>Tamar</i>, in whose bed you lay, that is what is burning in you. <i>Judah</i> said: I will soon color Egypt with blood. Joseph said: you have long experience in coloring; you colored Joseph’s shirt and told your father that a wild animal had devoured Joseph. Immediately, the brothers <i>agreed</i> to <i>destroy</i> the city of <i>Egypt.</i> Joseph was afraid and identified himself to his brothers.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 44:32.</i>
Joseph ordered all the people to leave. Only the brothers should remain with Joseph, since he thought that the brothers would be embarrassed before the Egyptians that they had sold him. It would also be an embarrassment for Joseph that he had such brothers and would not allow the brothers to live in Egypt. He also told them to leave because there were many of Pharaoh’s ministers who would plead on behalf of Benjamin and he would not be able to deny them. Therefore, he asked everyone to leave.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban, Genesis, 45:1.</i>
<i>Rabbi Samuel the son of Nachmani</i> said that Joseph was in great danger when he told all the people to leave and identified himself to his brothers. How did he not fear that they would <i>kill</i> him and nobody would know about it?<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 45:1.</i>
The Midrash writes. Joseph said to his brothers. You told me that Benjamin’s brother died. Now I will call him, and he called out, come here Joseph. The brothers looked around in all four directions. Joseph said: why are you looking around? I am Joseph your brother. The brothers’ souls flew out from fright and they could not answer. <i>Rabbi Johanan</i> said: when the brothers could not respond to Joseph, <i>how much more so</i> when the Holy One will have the <i>Day of Judgment</i> for the people and will tell them their sins, they will not be able to respond out of fright.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 45:3.</i>
<i>Toldot Yizhak</i> asks a question. Why does Joseph have to ask, I am Joseph, is your father still alive? They had said much earlier, in a previous portion, that Jacob was still alive. The explanation is that Joseph said: I am your brother Joseph that you sold me. Joseph thought: the brothers would be afraid that I would kill them because they had sold me. Therefore, Joseph said: my father is still alive. Therefore, do not be afraid. <i>Even the evil Esau</i> did not want to do anything to Jacob because Isaac, his father, was still alive. He did not want to cause anguish for his father. <i>How much more so</i>, I will do no evil to you. Therefore, he immediately asked, is our father still alive? Therefore, do not be afraid.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Genesis, 45:3–5.</i>
When Joseph saw that the brothers were afraid, Joseph said to his brothers, “<i>come forward to me</i>” [45:4]. Come here to me. I am Joseph that you sold. However, do not be afraid. The Holy One sent me to feed you. You did not send me to Egypt, but the Holy One did. You can well understand this since you sold me as a slave and the Holy One made me a lord over Egypt.
The brothers approached Joseph and he showed them his circumcision, that he was their brother.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 45:4.</i>
<i>Bahya</i> writes. Joseph said: I am Joseph. Just as when you sold me to Egypt, I am still your brother and do not want to have dominion over you.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 45:4.</i>
<i>Ibn Shuaib</i> writes. “<i>Only then were his brothers able to talk to him</i>” [45:15]. Afterwards, the brothers spoke with him, with Joseph. They pleaded with Joseph that he should not tell Jacob that they sold him. They were afraid that he would curse them all. Jacob never knew about the sale, as we will write below in <i>parshat Vayehi.</i> As Ramban also writes, if Jacob had known about the sale, he would have ordered in his <i>will and testament</i> that Joseph should forgive his brothers. Therefore, Joseph did not send to tell Jacob about the sale, in the expectation that Jacob should not curse the brothers. Some sages say that Joseph was not supposed to say that he was sold because the ten brothers had issued a ban. From here we learn that when ten issue a ban, then one must observe the ban, even though they are not among the ten people. So writes <i>Ibn Shuaib.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Ibn Shuaib, <i>Derashot</i>, I: 90.</i>
“<i>Hurry back to my father</i>” [45:9]. Joseph said: go immediately to our father and tell him that God has made me a lord over the land of Egypt. Therefore, come quickly to me. I will put you in the land of <i>Goshen</i>, near Egypt. Bahya writes. <i>Joseph</i> knew well that Jacob would not want to live in the capital city of Egypt. Therefore, he proposed to Jacob that he would put him in <i>Goshen</i>, near Egypt.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 45:10.</i>
“<i>There I will provide for you</i>” [45:11]. <i>Ramban</i> asks a question. Why did Joseph not provide for Jacob in the land of <i>Canaan</i> and told him to go <i>outside the land of Israel.</i> The explanation <i>Ramban</i> gives is that he said, I cannot provide for you in the land of <i>Canaan.</i> The king and his ministers will say that <i>Joseph</i> wants to <i>enrich</i> himself in the land of <i>Canaan</i> and wants to return to the land of <i>Canaan.</i> Therefore, you have to go to the land of <i>Goshen</i>, since the famine will still continue. When you and my brothers will come to <i>Goshen</i>, the ministers and the king will see that I will remain in the land of Egypt.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban, Genesis, 45:11.</i>
“<i>You can see for yourselves and my brother Benjamin</i>” [45:12]. Joseph said to his brothers. You see my honor and that I am your brother. I am circumcised and I speak <i>Hebrew</i> as well as you. <i>Hizkuni</i> asks. What kind of <i>proof</i> is <i>circumcision?</i> There are many Turks who practice <i>circumcision.</i> The explanation is that the Turks practice <i>circumcision</i>, but do not <i>uncover the corona</i>, but Joseph had <i>circumcision</i>, and <i>uncovered corona. Hizkuni</i> asks another question. The <i>Egyptians circumcised</i> themselves for the sake of grain, since Joseph did not want to give grain to the Egyptians. They had to circumcise themselves first. What kind of proof was it that Joseph showed his <i>circumcision?</i> Perhaps he was one of the Egyptians who had circumcised themselves? The explanation is that <i>Joseph</i> was the lord over the grain. Had he been an Egyptian, he would not have needed to circumcise himself because he was very wealthy. Therefore, the brothers said that he must be a Jew and is our brother.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 45:4.</i>
Therefore, <i>Joseph</i> said, “<i>you can see for yourself</i>” [45:12]. That is, you see my great honor and wealth and that I am circumcised and that I am a Jew.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 45:12.</i>
“<i>My brother Benjamin for himself</i>” [45:12]. He compared all the brothers to each other. That is, just as I have no <i>hatred</i> toward <i>Benjamin</i>, so too, I have no <i>hatred</i> to all of you.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 45:12.</i>
<i>Hizkuni</i> writes. <i>Joseph</i> said to his brothers. If you will not tell our father that I am alive because you have all sworn that you would not tell him, then let Benjamin see that I am alive. Let him tell my father, since Benjamin had not sworn<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 45:12.</i>
<i>Toldot Yizhak</i> asks a question. Why did Joseph say that you see and Benjamin sees that I speak <i>Hebrew?</i> There were many people in Egypt who could speak <i>Hebrew.</i> The explanation is that Joseph said: you should go and tell our father that he should come here. The famine will last another five years. If you do not believe me that I am right, then see with your own eyes that the dream that I <i>dreamed</i>, that eleven brothers will bow down to me, and the dream of the ears of grain pointed to famine. Your eyes show you that you have come along with Benjamin and you bowed down. This is why I desired that you should also bring Benjamin, so that you eleven brothers should bow down at one time, in the expectation that the dream should be fulfilled. Therefore, you should also believe me when I tell you that there will be a famine for five years. This is the meaning of the verse, “<i>it is indeed I who am speaking to you</i>” [45:12]. That is to say, you can understand what I am saying, that it is true. Therefore, bring my father and I will support him.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Genesis, 45:12.</i>
<i>Rabbi Isserl</i> writes. When Joseph said, “<i>I am Joseph, is my father still well?</i>” [45:3]. That is to say, I am still alive and my father should still live. With his prophecy, he should know that I am alive, if my father was a prophet. Therefore, Joseph asked, is my father still alive with his prophecy?<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Be’ure Maharai, Genesis, 45:3.</i>
“<i>He embraced his brother Benjamin around the neck and wept</i>” [45:14]. Joseph fell on Benjamin’s neck and he cried, because two <i>Temples</i> would be built in Benjamin’s land and they would be <i>destroyed.</i> Benjamin cried about Joseph, since one <i>Temple</i> would be destroyed in Joseph’s land.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 45:14.</i>
He kissed all of his brothers. He showed them that they should not fear him, since he had no hatred for them any more.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 45:15.</i>
“<i>The news reached Pharaoh</i>’<i>s house</i>” [45:16]. Pharaoh’s house was notified that the brothers of Joseph had come. Pharaoh and the ministers rejoiced. They were ashamed that they had thought that Joseph might have been a slave who was descended from ordinary people and became a king. However, now they had seen that Joseph had important brothers and an important father. They liked this very much. The Midrash says that they wanted to kill him. An angel came down from heaven and threw the brothers into all the corners of the house. Judah shouted and the walls of Egypt collapsed and all the pregnant women miscarried out of fright. Pharaoh fell off of his throne, and all the warriors in all of Egypt were frightened.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 45:16.</i>
“<i>Load up your beasts</i>” [45:17]. Pharaoh said to Joseph. Tell your brothers that they should load grain on their donkeys to take to the land of Canaan. Pharaoh knew well that Joseph was very <i>humble</i> and <i>trustworthy.</i> He would not send it on his own authority. Therefore, Pharaoh himself ordered that they should send grain to the land of Canaan to feed them. He ordered them to bring his father to the land of Egypt with his wives and household.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 45:19.</i>
“<i>You shall live off the fat of the land</i>” [45:19]. Pharaoh said that they should eat from the best of the land.

“<i>Joseph gave them wagons</i>” [45:21]. Joseph sent a <i>sign</i> to Jacob that he should believe that it was Joseph. He said to tell Jacob, remember what torah we studied when you accompanied me on the way. You studied with me that it is a very meritorious thing to accompany the guest. When one accompanies the guest, the guest is protected from robbers on the road. Therefore, the Torah commanded to bring a calf as expiation when one finds a person who was killed near a city. The people must kill the calf and must say over the calf, we have not spilled this blood. We have accompanied the guest and gave him bread for provisions. That is why the verse says, “<i>he gave them wagons.</i>” That is to say, he sent Jacob a sign from the calves that Jacob studied when he separated from him.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 45:27. The comment builds on the connection between wagons [<i>agalot</i>] and calf [<i>egel</i>].</i>
“<i>He gave a change of clothing</i>” [45:22]. Joseph gave each brother clothes, since they had torn their clothes over the goblet. They were ashamed to go outside.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 45:22.</i>
“<i>To Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver</i>” [45:22]. He gave silver to Benjamin because he was not at the sale of Joseph. He did not give money to the other brothers. It was a <i>penalty</i>, since whoever sells a person as a slave; he must give thirty weights of silver. Therefore, Joseph penalized each brother thirty weights of silver and there were ten brothers who sold Joseph. Ten times thirty is three hundred. Therefore Joseph gave Benjamin three hundred weights of silver. So write <i>Bahya</i> and <i>Hizkuni.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 45:22; Hizkuni, Genesis, 45:22.</i>
However, <i>Toldot Yizhak</i> writes. Joseph gave three hundred weight of silver because he spoke three evil things about his brothers. The <i>law</i> is that when someone says <i>bad things</i> about his friend, he must give a hundred weights of silver. It was not given to the brothers because they sold him.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Genesis, 45:22.</i>
He gave five changes of clothes to Benjamin. The first was because Benjamin tore his garments with the brothers over the goblet. The second garment was given because he was his brother from the same mother. The third garment was because he had hidden the goblet and accused him of being a thief. He gave him the last two garments because when someone steals something he must return double. Joseph accused Benjamin of being a thief and therefore he paid him double. So writes Hizkuni.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 45:22.</i>
Bahya and <i>Toldot Yizhak</i> write. Joseph gave five garments to Benjamin. With this he showed that Mordecai would come from Benjamin, and he would go forth in five garments before <i>King Ahasuerus.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 45:22; Toldot Yizhak, Genesis, 45:22.</i>
Joseph sent ten donkeys with food for his father. He sent good, old wine and all sorts of food in the world, and good fruits.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 45:23.</i>
All the brothers went to their father and also Benjamin, who went with Judah, who was his guarantor to bring him back to his father, upon which Judah took a ban of excommunication upon himself, to bring him. Bahya asks a question. Why was Judah punished that his bones could not rest in his coffin for the forty years in the desert? It is because he took upon himself the ban of excommunication to bring Benjamin back. What kind of sin did Judah commit? He did bring him back. The explanation is that because Judah said, I will have sinned all my days if I did not bring Benjamin back. How did he know that he would bring him back? Perhaps Joseph would not let him return? Therefore, Judah had not spoken properly.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 45:24.</i>
“<i>Do not be quarrelsome on the way</i>” [45:24]. Joseph said to his brothers. Do not be afraid when you have many goods with you. Now in this inflation, there is much robbery, but because I am sending you and they are afraid of me on all sides. He also said that you should not argue with each other that you spoke ill of Joseph and that is why you sold him. Therefore, do not argue. You should not study excessively on the way, so you don’t go astray.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 45:24.</i>
<i>Imre Noam</i> asks a question. Why did Jacob not forbid his children to study when they went to Egypt for grain? The explanation is that Jacob did not have to forbid that they should not study Torah on the way, because they had no grain, they would certainly not study Torah. One does not need to forbid them. Our sages said, “<i>if there is no flour, there is no Torah</i>” [M. <i>Avot</i> 3. 17].<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">Imre Noam, Genesis, 45:24.</i>
Some sages say that Joseph commanded that when they studied Torah on the road, they should not talk about <i>idle things</i>, such as “<i>what a beautiful tree this is, or what a lovely field this is</i>” [M. <i>Avot,</i> 3.7]. Therefore he said, <i>do not engage in halakhic matters</i> [Rashi, 45:24]. That is to say, you should not speak <i>idle words</i> when you will study, but you should study earnestly.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Devek Tov, Genesis, 45:24.</i>
Joseph also commanded them that they should not stride quickly and run, since it diminishes the sight of the one who strides quickly.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Ta</i>’<i>anit,</i> 10b.</i> Joseph thought that they would walk quickly to tell their father the good news about <i>Joseph.</i> Therefore, he forbade them to stride quickly.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 45:24.</i>
“<i>His heart went numb</i>” [45:26]. The children told Jacob that <i>Joseph</i> was alive and that he was a king in Egypt. Jacob was shocked out of great joy and almost <i>fainted.</i> Old people are very weak when they are frightened and their <i>soul</i> easily leaves them.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban, Genesis, 45:26.</i>
He could barely believe that he was still alive. They told him the sign from the Torah that they studied when Joseph had taken his leave from Jacob. This was the portion of “<i>the calf whose neck is broken</i>,”<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy, 21:1–9.</i> that one should accompany every guest.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 45:27.</i>
“<i>The spirit of their father Jacob revived</i>” [45:27]. <i>Prophecy</i> again returned to Jacob. The whole time that he did not know about Joseph <i>prophecy</i> had been removed from <i>Jacob.</i> Joseph was in Egypt for twenty-two years and was only five days journey from Jacob; he did not know that Joseph was alive. So writes [Midrash] <i>Tanhuma.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 45:27.</i>
“<i>Enough, my son Joseph is still alive</i>” [45:28]. Jacob said: it is not important that he is a king, but it is enough that he is still alive. So writes <i>Hizkuni.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 45:28.</i>
Rabbi Isserl writes. Jacob said: Esau was called enough. He thought that Joseph was lost and rejoiced that Joseph was lost. Joseph was the opponent of Esau, who would war with Esau. Therefore, Jacob said: enough do not rejoice Esau, Joseph is still alive.<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">Be’ure Maharai, Genesis, 45:28.</i>
“<i>He offered sacrifices to the God of his father Isaac</i>” [46:1]. Jacob traveled to <i>Beer Sheva</i> and brought sacrifices to the God of his father Isaac. From here we learn that one must honor one’s father more than one’s grandfather. Therefore, it was mentioned that he brought sacrifices to the God of his father Isaac and did not mention Abraham his grandfather.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 46:1.</i>
<i>Hizkuni</i> writes. Jacob brought the sacrifices because his father, Isaac, had brought sacrifices in <i>Beer Sheva</i> and therefore he mentioned Isaac and not <i>Abraham.</i> He brought <i>sacrifices</i> because he saw <i>prophetically</i> that his children would have to be in exile in Egypt. Therefore, he brought sacrifices so that the Holy One would act kindly with his children in the <i>exile.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 46:1, 3.</i>
“<i>I am the God of your father</i>” [46:3]. The Holy One appeared to Jacob and said to him. I forbade your father to go outside the land of Israel, but you should not fear, and go to Egypt. Hizkuni writes. Jacob said: now I am going to Egypt. The exile will begin, which was told to my grandfather, that his children would be in exile in a foreign land. The Holy One said to Jacob. Even though your children will be in exile, they will again have what I promised. They will become a great people in this exile.<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 46:3.</i>
“<i>I Myself will go down with you</i>” [46:4]. The Holy One said to Jacob, I will go with you to Egypt. That is to say, I will redeem you from exile, and promised him that he would be buried in the <i>land of Israel.</i> Therefore, the verse says twice, “<i>will bring you back</i>” [46:4]. That is, I will have you brought back to the <i>land of Israel</i> and all the twelve tribes will also be brought back to be buried in the land of Israel, and afterwards they will also be brought to the <i>world to come.</i> Therefore, he says <i>I.</i> That is to say, the <i>Ten Commandments</i> that begin with <i>I.</i> The <i>tribes will accept them</i>, and through that, they will ascend to the <i>land of Israel</i>, the <i>world to come</i> and the <i>Garden of Eden.</i> Just as the Holy One was in Egypt with Israel, so too he was in the <i>Babylonian exile</i>, and so is the Holy One with Israel in the <i>exile of Edom</i>, which is our exile that we are in the midst of. Because the Holy One was with Israel in Egypt, seventy souls became six hundred thousand men in the exile of Egypt. Bahya writes. A rabbi was once <i>speaking</i> in the <i>house of study.</i> He saw that the people were not interested in listening to his <i>sermon</i> and several were sleeping. He wanted to wake them, so he began to tell a tall <i>tale</i> in the hope that they would wake up. He said that there was a woman in Egypt who carried in her womb six hundred thousand children at one time. The people woke up as a result of this tall tale. They asked the rabbi, who was the woman who had so many children? The rabbi said: she was called <i>Yocheved</i> and she gave birth to <i>Moses Our Teacher</i>, who with his good deeds was compared to six hundred thousand men; that is to say, in comparison to <i>all of Israel.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 46:4.</i>
“<i>Joseph</i>’<i>s hand shall close your eyes</i>” [46:4]. Hizkuni writes. The Holy One said to Jacob. Joseph will still live when you will die, and Joseph will put his hand over your eyes when you will die. That is, the custom is that when a person dies, one closes his eyes after death, since it is shameful to the deceased if the eyes remain open. The Holy One promised Jacob that Joseph would take Jacob to the land of Israel to bury him with honor.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 46:4.</i>
“<i>They took along their livestock and the wealth they had amassed</i>” [46:6]. Jacob took his children, wives, livestock and all his goods that he had acquired in the land of <i>Canaan.</i> However, all the goods that he had gathered in <i>Padan Aram</i> with Laban, he gave all this to Esau for the share of the cave where all the <i>Patriarchs</i> should be buried. Jacob said: all the money that I have acquired outside <i>the land</i> [of Israel] is not beloved to me. He placed a great pile of gold and silver before Esau and said: take as much as you want, even though Jacob was very stingy with a penny, as we find. He once forgot a small jug of oil and he returned alone for the jug in the field. It is just that we should be stingy with the kosher [properly acquired] money, since the kosher penny is hard to acquire. Similarly, Jacob thought that the false penny that I acquired when I was outside <i>the land</i> and gathered money and livestock, for the sake of which I threw away the holy <i>land of Israel.</i> Therefore, he did not want to have that money.<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 46:6.</i>
“<i>Saul the son of a Canaanite woman</i>” [46:10]. The verse says that Jacob came with his household to Egypt. The children of Simeon also came and one son was called Saul, the son of the Canaanite woman. That is, Simeon and Levi took Dinah out of the house of Shechem and Hamor. Dinah did not want to leave, since she would not find a man who would take her as a wife. Simeon swore that he would take her as a wife and had a son with her who was called, Saul the son of the Canaanite woman.<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 46:10.</i> That is to say, because Dinah slept with the Canaanite, she was called the Canaanite woman. If you want to ask, how is it that he should take his sister as a wife? The explanation is that we find that with each son of Jacob, a <i>female</i> was born, and each one should marry that sister. The verse does not say this explicitly that they married their twins. It says, “<i>All the persons belonging to Jacob who came to Egypt</i> – <i>his own issue, aside from the wives of Jacob</i>’<i>s sons</i>” [46:26]. This means, all the souls who issued from his flesh and the wives of the children of Jacob. That is to say, one should understand that the wives of his children were not the children of Jacob, and in truth, they were born with the tribes. Each of the tribes took his twin as a wife. The souls were seventy and Jacob. With Jacob, there were seventy-one. So there were seventy elders over Israel in Egypt during the exile. <i>Moses Our Teacher</i> was seventy-one. So too, there were seventy nations in the world. Israel is over the seventy nations. There are also seventy angels around the Throne of Glory in Heaven and the Holy One is over them all.
“<i>Judah</i>’<i>s sons: Er, Onan</i>” [46:12]. Hizkuni asks a question. Why does the verse have to count the children of Judah, <i>Er and Onan</i>, since they died before they went to Egypt? The explanation is, because Judah took a wife from foreigners. Therefore, he sinned, so that <i>Er and Onan</i> died. Therefore, the verse here counts <i>Er and Onan</i> among the children who came to Egypt. Hizkuni gives another explanation. It mentions his children, Er and Onan, here, because Judah caused that all the children of Jacob came into the <i>exile of Egypt.</i> If Judah had rebuked his brothers that they should not sell Joseph, then they would not have come to Egypt. The Holy One said to Judah. You did not think that your father was anguished about Joseph. Therefore, when Israel, your father, will be full of joy and happiness, your children who died will be remembered, and you will mourn, because you caused your father to mourn.<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 46:10.</i>
“<i>The sons of Jacob</i>’<i>s wife Rachel</i>” [46:19]. It does not say about any of the wives that she was the wife of Jacob, but only for Rachel does it say that she was the wife of Jacob. The explanation is, because Jacob loved Rachel very much, more than the other wives.<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 46:19.</i>
“<i>All the persons numbered sixty-six</i>” [46:26]. With <i>the evil Esau</i> there were only six souls and the verse calls them souls, many people. Jacob had seventy children and the verse calls them <i>soul</i>, as if they were all one person. The explanation is that because Esau and his children worshiped many foreign gods, therefore the verse calls them, many people. However, with Jacob and his children, the verse calls them, a <i>soul</i>, like they were one person, because they served one God, they were all like one person. Therefore, when a Jew apostatizes, one says that he has gone to the larger <i>community.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 46:26.</i>
“<i>He sent Judah ahead</i>” [46:28]. Jacob sent Judah that he should go ahead and should show him the way to go to <i>Goshen</i>, so that he should not have to go through the city of Egypt. So writes Hizkuni.<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 46:28.</i> Rashi writes that he sent Judah ahead to find a house in which to study Torah.<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 46:28.</i>
“<i>Joseph ordered his chariot</i>” [46:29]. Joseph hitched his chariot to go to his father. <i>Rabbi Judah</i> said: two people saw great joy that no other person saw in their days. One was Jacob. When Joseph went to meet his father, all the nobles also went out toward Jacob and all the people of Egypt also went to Jacob with great honor. The other one was <i>Jethro</i>, who had great joy when he saw <i>Moses Our Teacher</i> coming toward him, and all of Israel following him. This was a great honor for him.<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 46:29.</i>
“<i>He embraced him around the neck</i>” [46:29]. Joseph fell on Jacob’s neck and cried, but Jacob did not fall on Joseph’s neck. Jacob was <i>reciting the Shema</i> at that time.<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 46:29.</i> Here one asks a question. Why did Joseph also not <i>recite the Shema?</i> The explanation is that Joseph was absolved from the obligation to read the <i>Shema</i> because he was engaged in fulfilling a commandment. He was honoring his father and was going to greet him. Thus, he did not need to <i>read the Shema.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">Devek Tov, Genesis, 46:29, n. 10.</i>
Ramban writes. How is it that Joseph fell on his father’s neck? This was not culturally appropriate. He should have prostrated himself before his father with fear. Therefore, the explanation must be that Jacob fell on his son’s neck and embraced him. “<i>He wept on his neck, etc.</i>” [46:29]. That is to say, Jacob was still crying, as he had cried previously when he was lost, so Jacob was still crying. Particularly now, when a son that he had <i>lost hope</i> for, had become a king. How could he not cry for joy? The old people can do no more than cry in their troubles and their joy.<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban, Genesis, 46:29.</i>
“<i>Now I can die</i>” [46:30]. Jacob said to Joseph. I thought that I would die two <i>deaths</i>, one in this world and in the other world. The Holy One would, <i>heaven forbid</i>, punish me because of you, that you were almost killed because I sent you, the Shekhinah had departed from me. But now that you are alive, I will only die one time and depart this world. So writes Rashi. However, <i>Toldot Yizhak</i> writes. Jacob said: if I had not seen you alive, I would not die. I died long ago, when they brought me your shirt, my soul left me. I was as if dead, but now since I have seen you alive, I am alive again. Therefore, I can die when my time will come<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Genesis, 46:30.</i>
“<i>I will go up and tell the news to Pharaoh</i>” [46:31]. Joseph said to his brothers. I will go to Pharaoh and will tell him that my brothers and father have come. When Pharaoh will ask you, what kind of <i>artisans</i> are you, you should say that you have flocks in the field and your parents were also shepherds. Tell him also that you have many flocks and therefore have no other work.
Hizkuni writes here. Joseph told them to say that they were shepherds, expecting that Pharaoh should denigrate them. They caused Joseph to be mute before Pharaoh, that Joseph became insignificant before Pharaoh. Therefore Joseph told the brothers to say that they are shepherds, that is, insignificant. Rashi writes that Joseph told them that they should say that they were shepherds because the Egyptians worship the sheep and consider it an idol. Therefore, the Egyptians hate shepherds.<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 46:34.</i>
Here one asks a question. Why do they hate the shepherds? On the contrary, they should love those who watch over the sheep because they do good things for the sheep and watch over them that they should have food and water. The explanation is that sometimes they sheep go astray and the shepherd must hit them. That is why they hate those who hit their idols. Another explanation is that they therefore hate shepherds because the one who watches over them knows what the sheep are and does not worship them.<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">Imre Noam, Genesis, 46:34.</i>
“<i>Selecting five of his brothers</i>” [47:2]. Joseph took five brothers who were not so handsome, that is to say, the weakest ones, and placed them before Pharaoh. He took the weakest ones, because if he had seen the strongest brothers, then Pharaoh would have made them officers, to go to war. Joseph took <i>Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Benjamin, and Issachar</i>, since they were the weakest ones.<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 47:2.</i>
“<i>We have come to sojourn in the land</i>” [47:4]. Pharaoh asked: what kind of artisans are you? They said: we are shepherds and that is why we have come here to live, since there is no food to eat for the sheep in the land of Canaan. Therefore, let us dwell in the land of Goshen. Pharaoh answered Joseph: put your brothers in the land of Goshen and put your father wherever you want. If you know that there are strong people among your brothers, let them watch over my flocks since the sheep used to pasture in the wilderness, which was full of wild animals. Therefore, one must have strong people to guard the flocks.<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 47:6.</i>
“<i>Jacob greeted Pharaoh</i>” [47:7]. Joseph brought his father before Pharaoh, and Jacob greeted Pharaoh. Pharaoh asked Jacob: how old are you? Jacob responded: all my days I have been a stranger and wandered from one city to the other city and had no good in my days. Therefore, do not think that I am old, but my face is looks old from troubles and worries. My parents were all older than me. Hizkuni writes. The Holy One said to Jacob: I protected you from Esau, from Laban, and from Shechem and returned Dinah and Joseph to you. You said that you had evil, bad and few years. For this reason, I will diminish thirty-three years less than your parents from you, as many extra words that you spoke. For each word you must live one year less. From here we learn that a person should always praise God, even when not everything goes well and one should not talk against God who does everything for good.<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 47:8.</i>
<i>Imre Noam</i> writes. Pharaoh asked Jacob: how old are you, because Jacob had said that he would remain in Egypt until the end of the famine. Afterwards, he would return to the land of Canaan. Therefore, Pharaoh asked, how old are you. That is, you think you will live long enough that you want to return to the land of Canaan after the famine. The Midrash<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">Ginzberg, <i>Legends of the Jews</i>, V: 360, cites the Imre Noam as the source of this story, and does not cite a midrashic source.</i> writes that Pharaoh was with Abimelech when Abraham came before Abimelech. This Abimelech had a very low gate and an image of the idol was over the gate. Each person who wanted to visit Abimelech through that gate, had to bow down. When Abraham came to that gate, the gate rose, so that Abraham should not have to bow down to the image. Pharaoh in Egypt also had a gate with this image. When Jacob came, the gate went up. Pharaoh asked Jacob: how old are you? Pharaoh had thought that this was Abraham because the gate went up.<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">Imre Noam, Genesis, 47:8.</i>
“<i>Jacob blessed Pharaoh</i>” [47:10]. Jacob blessed Pharaoh and said to him. The water from the river <i>Nile</i> should also go up and water all the fields. There was no rain in Egypt to water the fields. From Jacob’s blessing onwards, the river <i>Nile</i> watered all the fields.<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 47:10.</i>
“<i>Joseph sustained his father and his brothers, and all his father</i>’<i>s household with bread, down to the little ones</i>” [47:12]. Joseph sustained his father and his father’s household, even the children, and he gave enough bread. The custom is that the small children spoil the bread by crumbling it.
“<i>Joseph gathered</i>” [47:14]. Joseph gathered all the silver in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan in return for the grain. He brought the silver into Pharaoh’s treasury. When the silver was used up, they came to Joseph and said, give us bread, the silver is used up. Why should we die before your eyes? Joseph said: give your flocks. Joseph gave them bread for one year in exchange for the flocks. The next year they came again and said, give us, since the flocks and bread are finished. Joseph took all of their fields and gave them bread for their fields.
Ramban writes. Why does the verse have to say that the Egyptians said that the silver of the <i>land of Egypt</i> was used up and says again that the silver of the <i>land of Canaan</i> was used up? Why was Egypt concerned that the silver in the <i>land of Canaan</i> was used up? The explanation is that the Egyptians said to Joseph. You think to gather more silver for your grain. They knew that the silver was used up in all the lands. Why should we die for nothing, as nobody will buy your grain?<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban, Genesis, 47:15.</i>
“<i>Provide the seed</i>” [47:19]. The Egyptians said to Joseph, give us grain. We will sow the grain on the fields, even though Joseph had said that it would be five more years of famine. Now he gave them grain to sow. The people said that Joseph is no proper prophet. The explanation is that when Jacob came, all the Egyptians saw that the water of the river Nile went towards him and watered all the fields. All the ministers and also Pharaoh said that the blessing came because of Jacob.<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 47:19.</i>
However, Ramban writes. As soon as Jacob died, the five years of famine began again, in the expectation that there should be seven years of famine to fulfill what Joseph had said. When the righteous person is in the world, the blessing is with them in the world.<sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban, Genesis, 47:18.</i>
“<i>Take our</i>” [47:19]. Ramban asks. They said to Joseph: buy us as slaves and the verse says that Joseph only bought the fields. The explanation is that the Egyptians said to Joseph. Buy slaves to serve and buy the fields that they should be yours. Joseph said: I will only buy the fields. You must be included in the sale of the fields, in order to work the fields. It would be just that you should take a fifth part and Pharaoh will take four parts of the field to eat, for your labor. However, I will do a kindness with you. You should take four parts and Pharaoh will take the fifth part, just like you were the <i>owners</i> of the fields. However, be warned that you will serve Pharaoh forever, to work the fields.<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban, Genesis, 47:19.</i>
Joseph was concerned that each one would remain on his fields, and it would be forgotten in the long run and each one would say that the field was his, and they would not want to give to Pharaoh from the field. Therefore Joseph took all the people and interchanged them from one city to another city.<sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 47:21.</i>
“<i>The priests had an allotment from Pharaoh</i>” [47:22]. He gave the <i>priests</i> enough bread from the king’s table. Joseph made all this because the priests gave a proper judgment when his master’s wife said that Joseph had slept with her. His master’s wife had taken the white of a chicken egg and she threw it on the bed sheet. She said that this was Joseph’s semen, when he had slept with her. The sheet was brought before the priests and the priests said that the sheet should be held before the fire. If it were semen, then it would dissolve in the fire. However, if it was egg white, it would become hard and pieces of the egg white would remain as a sign on the sheet. They did so and the egg white remained on the sheet. Yet, it is written in the verse that Pharaoh gave them bread. The explanation is that Joseph spoke with Pharaoh that the priest should be given enough bread because they served in their <i>idolatrous</i> temples.<sup class="footnote-marker">83</sup><i class="footnote">Imre Noam, Genesis, 47:22.</i>

Vayechi

“<i>Jacob lived</i>” [47:28]. <i>King Solomon</i> said: “<i>the road of righteousness leads to life</i>” [Proverbs, 12:28]. Whoever gives charity lives long and is knowledgeable that life depends on the <i>disposition of stars</i>, on stars in heaven. When one has a good constellation [<i>mazal]</i>, he lives long. When he has an evil <i>mazal</i>, he has a short life. However, charity is greater than the <i>constellations.</i> Concerning this, our sages said that charity is very important; it reaches to the <i>Throne of Glory.</i> That is, charity is higher than the constellations. When the constellation decrees that a person should die, charity comes and causes him to live long. We also find this in the Torah portion that Joseph sustained Jacob with food for seventeen years. Jacob was worthy of this because he had sustained Joseph for seventeen years. <i>Measure for measure.</i> Joseph was seventeen years old when he was separated from his father. Therefore, the verse says, “<i>Jacob lived seventeen years in the land of Egypt</i>” [47:28]. That is to say, he lived in Egypt for seventeen years, that Joseph sustained him. His life was one hundred and forty-seven years.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, <i>Vayehi</i> Introduction.</i>
This portion is closed in the <i>Torah scroll.</i> There is no separation between one portion and the other, as is found between all the other Torah portions. The explanation is because the exile began in Egypt. That is, it became dark before the eyes of Israel. Therefore, the portion is stopped up. Another explanation is that Jacob wanted to tell his children about the <i>end</i> of the exile in advance. Now, the prophecy departed from Jacob. He was supposed to have told them when the Messiah would come. The Midrash writes that Jacob saw that the letters <i>het</i> and <i>tet</i> were missing in the names of his children. That is to say, no <i>het</i> and no <i>tet.</i> He wanted to tell them about the <i>end</i> of the exile and Jacob again saw that there was no <i>kuf</i> and no <i>zadi</i>, that is, <i>kez</i> [end]. Jacob again did not tell his children about the end. Therefore, the portion is stopped up.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 47:28.</i>
“<i>When the time approached for Israel to die</i>” [47:29]. Jacob felt in his body and saw that his <i>strength</i> was weakening, and that he would soon die. He sent for Joseph and wanted to ask him and make him swear that he would take him after his death to the land of <i>Canaan</i> to be buried there.
Bahya writes. Why does the verse say, “<i>Jacob lived</i>” [47:28]. Here he is called Jacob and soon after he is called Israel. Why was he not called by his name? The explanation is that the name Jacob points to <i>physical deeds.</i> That is, when Jacob went to eat and drink and feed his body. Here he is called Jacob. When he went to do <i>good deeds</i> for his soul, he was called Israel. That is, the name Israel came to him because of <i>dominion</i>, that he vanquished the angel. Therefore, when Jacob went to fulfill commandments, good deeds and Torah, the verse calls him Israel. Therefore, the portion said, “<i>Jacob lived.</i>” That is, when he went to eat and drink to sustain his body, he was called Jacob. Afterwards, when he was sick and about to die, that his body would go away from the world and his soul would begin to live properly in the next world, which is the proper life for the soul. This is called Israel in the verse.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 47:29.</i>
“<i>He summoned his son Joseph</i>” [47:29]. Jacob called his son Joseph, even though Reuben was the firstborn and Judah was a king. Yet, he called Joseph who was a king in Egypt, who had the power to take Jacob to the land of Canaan.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 47:29.</i>
“<i>True kindness</i>” [47:29]. Jacob said: you should do a <i>true kindness</i> with me. That is to say, even though I ask you that you should carry me to bury me in the <i>land of Canaan</i>, I will not be able to repay you when I will be dead. Therefore, he said: you should do a <i>true kindness.</i> That is to say, it is called true when one does not hope to receive a reward for what he did.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 47:29.</i>
“<i>Please do not bury me in Egypt</i>” [47:29]. You should not bury me in Egypt for three reasons. The first is because the earth of Egypt will produce lice because of Israel in the days of <i>Moses Our Teacher.</i> The second is, when the Messiah will come, the dead will come back to life and the dead <i>outside the land of Israel</i> will have to roll through mountains and caves to the land of Israel and this will be painful. The third is that the Egyptians will make an idol out me, if I will lie in Egypt.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 47:29.</i>
“<i>He swore to him</i>” [47:31]. Joseph had to swear to Jacob that he would keep this. Ramban writes here. Did Jacob believe that he would not keep what he promised without an oath? The explanation is that he made him swear in the expectation that Pharaoh would not be able to break his vow. Pharaoh would want to keep Jacob and bury him in Egypt, so that his merit would protect them.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban, Genesis, 47:31.</i>
<i>Ibn Shuaib</i> writes. The whole time that <i>Jacob</i> was in <i>Egypt</i>, seventeen years, no woman miscarried her child, and no person had a toothache. The woman carried her child to term, and all of this was the result of <i>Jacob</i>’<i>s merit.</i> That is why <i>Jacob</i> made <i>Joseph</i> swear that he would take him to be buried in the <i>land of Canaan</i>, <i>Pharaoh</i> would not break his <i>oath.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Ibn Shuaib, <i>Derashot</i>, I:99.</i>
<i>Ibn Shuaib</i> writes that that the word <i>Vayehi</i> has the numerical value of thirtyfour. That is to say, the most important part of his life was thirty-four years, the first seventeen years when <i>Joseph</i> was with Jacob, his father, and now again seventeen years in <i>Egypt.</i> This was his proper life. However, the other years were no life.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid., I:98.</i>
<i>Bahya</i> writes. <i>Jacob</i> was afraid that they would make an <i>idol</i> out of him. If he became an <i>idol</i>, God repays and punishes all those who worship <i>idols</i>, and He particularly punishes the <i>idols.</i> Jacob also said that the earth of the <i>land of Israel atones</i> for our <i>sins</i>, since the verse said, “<i>it shall be inhabited by folk whose sin has been forgiven</i>” [Isaiah 33:24]. That is to say, the people that dwell in the <i>land of Israel</i>, their <i>sins</i> are forgiven. The gate of <i>prayer</i> to Heaven is also is also there and from there the <i>soul</i> goes straight to heaven.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 47:29.</i>
<i>Jacob</i> said, “<i>when I lie down with my fathers</i>” [47:30]. I will come to my ancestors. <i>Rabbi Isaac</i> said about this. From here we learn that the person knows well on the day when he will die, where he will come, to the <i>righteous</i> or to the <i>evildoers.</i> Therefore, the verse said first, I would come to my ancestors. Afterwards, the verse says, you must take me to the <i>land of Israel.</i> That is to say, Jacob said: my soul is coming soon to my ancestors. When a person dies, even at sea or in the <i>wilderness</i>, or on <i>dry land</i>, it soon comes to its ancestors. Jacob said: you should bury me in the grave where my ancestors are. From here we learn that a righteous person should be buried near another righteous person and an evildoer near another evildoer.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 47:30.</i>
“<i>I will do as you have spoken</i>” [47:30]. Joseph said: I will also do as you did. That is, you have made me swear, so too, I will make the tribes swear that they should take me to the land of Canaan.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid.</i>
“<i>Israel bowed at the head of the bed</i>” [47:31]. Jacob bowed to Joseph for the good news. At the same time, he was also bowing to the head of the bed since the Shekhinah is at the head of the bed of a sick person. Another explanation is that he bowed in the direction of the bed. That is to say, his bed was kosher; only righteous people came from his bed, even Joseph who was captured by gentiles, remained a pious Jew.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 47:31.</i> Here the dream was fulfilled that the sun, which was Jacob, bowed to Joseph.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 47:31.</i>
“<i>Some time afterward</i>” [48:1]. <i>Hizkuni</i> writes. From the day that the world was created, no person sneezed, since he did not want to die. He would have died from the sneeze, even in the street or on the road where he was walking. He would have died, until Jacob prayed and said, <i>Lord of the Universe</i>, let me first become sick, so that I will first give a testament to my children. The Holy One listened to his prayer and made him sick. Immediately, all the nations became afraid; they did not know what was wrong. Therefore, we must say a short prayer when a person sneezes.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 48:1.</i>
Jacob sent Ephraim, who was always at Jacob’s side that Joseph should come, since Jacob was very weak.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 48:1.</i>
<i>Ibn Shuaib</i> writes. Joseph kept himself separated from Jacob because he did not want to talk too much with him, as he might ask him, how did you come to Egypt? Joseph did not want to tell him. He always told him that he got lost, even though that was a lie.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Ibn Shuaib, <i>Derashot</i>, I: 99.</i> One is allowed to tell a lie for the sake of <i>peace.</i>
“<i>Israel summoned his strength</i>” [48:2]. Jacob sat up in his bed, even though he was weak, because Joseph had come. He said: even though Joseph is a son, he is also a king and one must do honor to a king, even a <i>gentile</i> king. <i>Moses Our Teacher</i> honored Pharaoh.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 48:2.</i>
Hizkuni writes. He got up because he wanted to show that he was still mentally competent, just like when he was healthy. When a sick person lies weakly and says something, they can respond, but they might not accept it. When he becomes healthy again, one might say that he said it or did it without mental competence. Therefore, now Jacob wanted to bless his children. Thus, he got up and wanted to show that he was healthy and mentally competent, so that they could not retract his blessings.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 48:2.</i>
Jacob said: the Holy One appeared to me and said to me, I will make you a nation. At the time I had all of my children, except for Benjamin, who was born after these words. The words of the Holy One were heard that I would have many children. Therefore, I give the blessing to Joseph’s children so that they should also have a share in the <i>land of Israel</i>, just like Reuben, Simeon and the other brothers.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 35:11.</i> Jacob did this to honor Rachel, his most beloved wife. Joseph was Rachel’s first born and therefore Jacob gave him <i>double the portion</i> of the other brothers.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 48:5.</i>
“<i>Rachel died</i>” [48:7]. Jacob said to Joseph. If you want to ask me why am I burdening you that you should carry me to the <i>land of Canaan</i> to bury me there and not in the <i>land of Egypt?</i> I buried your mother in the field, on the way, where she died, and I did not take her to the cave of our other ancestors, even though she died quite close to the city of <i>Bethlehem</i> and I did not take her there. Certainly, you resent me for this. However, you should know that the Holy One told me to do this, that I should bury her on the way. When Israel will leave <i>Jerusalem</i> for the <i>exile of Nebuzaradon</i>, Israel will pass on that road. Rachel will pray for Israel from her grave and the Holy One will accept her prayer.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 48:7.</i>
Hizkuni writes. Jacob said: I did not bury Rachel in the cave with me because Esau was still at war with me. I did not have the <i>right of ownership</i> yet for the cave. However, I did bury Leah in the cave. Esau had gone away and left the cave to me alone. Another explanation is that the field where Rachel was buried is part of the land of her children. However, the cave is in the land of the children of Leah, in the land of Judah. It is no honor to live in a strangers land. Another explanation is because Rachel died in childbirth, she was full of blood. If she were to be carried through the fields, she would be jostled and her <i>shrouds</i> would be smeared full of blood. Therefore, I buried Rachel on the way, where she died.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 48:7.</i>
Hizkuni and <i>Toldot Yizhak</i> question Rashi, who writes. Jacob said: I did not bury Rachel in the land of Canaan. We find that she was indeed buried in the land of Canaan. The explanation is that Jacob said: I did not bury her in a city, but in the field, even though it was close to <i>Bethlehem.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 48:7; Toldot Yizhak, Genesis, 48:6.</i>
Ramban writes. Jacob did not bury Rachel in the cave. He was ashamed that two sisters should lie next to each other and that Jacob should lie near them. People would say that Jacob had married two sisters when they were alive. Therefore, Leah was buried in the cave because she was the first and <i>legitimate</i> wife of Jacob. Jacob should not have married Rachel because she was the sister of Leah.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban, Genesis, 48:7.</i>
“<i>Israel saw the sons of Joseph</i>” [48:8]. Hizkuni writes. Jacob could not see, so how did he see Joseph’s children? The explanation is that he understood with his intellect that these were the children of Joseph. He recognized Joseph by his voice.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 48:8.</i>
Jacob wanted to bless the children, but <i>prophecy</i> departed from Jacob, since <i>Jeroboam</i> and <i>Ahab</i>, two evil <i>kings</i>, would be descended from <i>Ephraim.</i> King <i>Jehu</i> and his evil children would be descended from <i>Menashe. Jacob</i> said to <i>Joseph.</i> Who are these children that they are not <i>worthy to be blessed? Joseph</i> said: I had them <i>properly</i>, with <i>kiddushin</i> and <i>ketubah</i>, and showed him the <i>ketubah.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., his marriage was completely according to Jewish tradition.</i> Joseph immediately prayed, and the <i>prophecy</i> again returned to Jacob. Jacob said to Joseph. Bring them here and I will bless them.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 48:8.</i>
“<i>Israel</i>’<i>s eyes were dim with age</i>” [48:10]. <i>Toldot Yizhak</i> writes. Why does the <i>Torah</i> tell us that Jacob could not see? The explanation is that a person who wants to bless or curse, that person looks at the one he wishes to bless or curse. Then the person can do what he needs to do. Therefore, the verse says that Jacob had trouble seeing and that is why he could not bless the children of Joseph with his eyes. That is to say, that he should cast a good eye on them. That is why Jacob said to Joseph. You must bring the children before me so that I may touch them with my hands and embrace them and kiss them. Through this, the <i>blessing</i> will come to them.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Genesis, 48:8–10.</i> In these <i>generations</i>, few people have good eyes to bless. Therefore, we must bless with the hands. Jacob said: I did not think that I would see you, and now the Holy One has shown me your children.
“<i>Joseph then removed them from his knees</i>” [48:12]. Jacob kissed the children. Joseph pulled the children away from Jacob and wanted to properly place them, Menashe on the right hand of Jacob, because he was the <i>firstborn.</i> He wanted to place Ephraim at the left hand of Jacob to be blessed.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 48:12.</i>
“<i>Crossed his hands</i>” [48:14]. Jacob knew well that <i>Joseph</i> would put <i>Menashe</i> at his right hand and <i>Ephraim</i> at his left hand. Even though <i>Jacob</i> did not see well, but he also knew <i>prophetically</i> that Ephraim would have many more important descendants than would <i>Menashe.</i> Therefore, <i>Jacob</i> crossed his hands with <i>wisdom</i> and <i>understanding.</i> That is, he put his right hand on <i>Ephraim</i>, the younger one, and he put his left hand on <i>Menashe</i>, and this was the <i>wisdom</i>, even though Joseph had placed Menashe at Jacob’s right hand. Jacob did not want to shame or <i>disgrace Menashe</i> by telling him to go to the left hand. This would be a <i>disgrace</i> because he was the firstborn. Therefore, Jacob allowed him to remain standing where Joseph had placed him. However, Jacob crossed his hands, so that the right hand was on <i>Ephraim.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 48:14.</i>
“<i>Although Menashe was the first born</i>” [48:14]. This means, that even though <i>Menashe</i> was the firstborn, he did not want to <i>disgrace</i> him and crossed his hands. Hizkuni gives an additional explanation, and Bahya also gives this explanation. “<i>Although Menashe was the first born</i>” [48:14], means that although Menashe was the firstborn, it was just that Jacob should put his right hand on Ephraim. Jacob did this because he saw <i>prophetically</i> that Ephraim, the younger one, would have better children than Menashe.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 48:14; Bahya, Genesis, 48:13.</i>
“<i>May they be teeming multitudes upon the earth</i>” [48:16]. Jacob blessed the children of Joseph that they should be so numerous as the fish in the water, and no evil eye should have dominion over them. That is to say, that nobody should be able to give them the <i>evil eye</i>, like the fish in the water that cannot be given an <i>evil eye.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 48:16.</i>
“<i>He thought it was wrong</i>” [48:17]. Joseph saw that <i>Jacob</i> placed his right hand on <i>Ephraim.</i> He was very unhappy about this and wanted to take away Jacob’s hand and wanted to place it properly. That is to say, he wanted to place the right hand on Menashe, and said to his father: Menashe is the firstborn. Therefore, place your right hand on Menashe.
His father responded to <i>Joseph</i>, “<i>I know my son, I know</i>” [48:19]. That is, I know well that he is the oldest and a great nation will come from him, but the younger is better. That is to say, <i>Gideon</i> will be descended from him, and the Holy One will do a miracle for Israel, through his hands. However, from <i>Ephraim</i> the younger one, <i>Joshua</i> will be descended and he will make the land an inheritance for Israel and will teach Torah to Israel. He will wage war with the nations. He will make the <i>sun</i> stand still in the city of <i>Gibeon.</i> That is to say, the day will be longer for the sake of <i>Joshua</i>, so that he should be able to destroy the nations. Similarly, he also caused the moon to remain standing in the city of <i>Emek Alon</i> because of the war.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 48:19.</i>
Ramban writes. Why did it hurt Joseph so much that Jacob placed the right hand on Ephraim? They were both his children. The explanation is that Joseph thought that Jacob had lost his <i>prophetic powers</i> and that is why he made a mistake and placed his right hand on Ephraim, the younger one. Therefore, the blessing would not be fulfilled since he made a mistake and without sense. Jacob responded: I do have sense and know well that he is the older one, so be quiet Joseph.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban, Genesis, 48:19.</i>
<i>Toldot Yizhak</i> asks a question. Why did Joseph allow the children to be blessed when Jacob put his right hand on Ephraim? He should have immediately taken away his hand before he had uttered the blessing. The explanation is that Joseph thought that Jacob wanted to honor each son and therefore he placed his right hand on Ephraim, the younger one. He wanted to honor him with a great blessing. That is, he would bless him better. When Joseph saw that he blessed them both with one blessing, then Joseph was upset that he had put the right hand on Ephraim. Jacob responded: “<i>I know my son, I know</i>” [48:19]. That is, two times, I know. Why I put my right hand on Ephraim. I also know that I did not bless Menashe more. <i>On the contrary</i>, I wanted to bless <i>Ephraim</i> more. Israel should bless their children, “<i>God make you like Ephraim and Menashe</i>” [48:20]. They should mention Ephraim before Menashe. So writes <i>Toldot Yizhak.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Genesis, 48:17–20.</i>
However, Bahya writes. “<i>He put Ephraim before Menashe</i>” [48:20]. This means, he placed Ephraim before Menashe. That is to say, like a servant stands before the master to serve him. So said Jacob. You are younger and Menashe is older. A younger brother should honor the older brother. Therefore, be careful about the <i>honor of Menashe</i> who is the firstborn.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 48:20.</i> When Jacob had finished blessing the children, Jacob again began to bless Joseph separately and told him about the exile and about how the Holy One will bring the <i>redemption</i> for Israel.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 48:21.</i>
“<i>One portion more than to your brothers</i>” [48:22]. Jacob said to Joseph: I have given you a portion more than your brothers, so that your two children will be equal to the other children, <i>Reuben, Simeon, Levi.</i> That is, they will take a share in the land of Israel just like Reuben or the other children.
“<i>Which I wrested from the Amorites with my sword and bow</i>” [48:22]. Jacob said: The land of Israel that will be taken from the Amorites, there your two children will be given a share, each one separately, since I have given you the status of the firstborn. Therefore, your children will take two shares. Jacob said to Joseph: therefore, take the trouble to carry me to the land of Canaan, because I will give you a city where you will be buried. This is the city of Shechem.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 48:22.</i>
“<i>In the days to come</i>” [49:1]. Jacob called his children and wanted to tell them when the Messiah would come. Prophecy departed from Jacob and immediately changed the subject.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 49:1.</i> Jacob said that the redemption for us would be like the redemption from Egypt and the redemption will be better because wisdom and understanding will be greater in the days of the Messiah.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 49:1.</i>
“<i>Reuben, you are my firstborn</i>” [49:3]. He called Reuben first and said. You are my first drop of seed, since Jacob did not see his seed until he slept with Leah and she became pregnant the first night from the drop of seed.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 49:3.</i>
“<i>Exceeding in rank and exceeding in honor</i>” [49:3]. You are certainly deserving that you should have more than your brothers; the <i>birthright</i>, the <i>priesthood</i>, and the <i>kingship.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid.</i>
<i>Toldot Yizhak</i> writes here that he was worthy to have these three things because he was the firstborn, the first drop. Therefore, it was just that he should be a priest who takes the first part of everything, whether the <i>tithe</i>, <i>terumah</i>, or <i>challah</i> and the first part of the <i>sacrifices</i>, because he was born from the <i>strength of Jacob.</i> That is to say, he was still strong. He rolled a large stone by himself that many people used to gather before they could move the stone from its place. Jacob rolled the stone by himself. He married Leah at that time and had Reuben with her. Reuben was born when Jacob was at his strongest. Therefore, it was just that he should have the kingship, since a king must be strong. That is to say, the king must have a strong heart so that he could wage war with his enemies. Jacob said to Reuben: you are worthy of these three things, the birthright of the firstborn, the priesthood, and the kingship. Why don’t you have the kingship? It is because you were quick with your anger, like water that flows quickly. That is to say, you are not worthy to have the kingship because you get angry. A king must do everything with deliberation and must seek advice from his advisors. That is why he is called king. This shows he must have compassion and must seek advice about what he should do. This is also why you should not have the birthright, because you disturbed your father’s bed with <i>Bilhah</i>, so that Jacob should not have more children with her. You, Reuben, are firstborn and would inherit more if there would be fewer children. Therefore, you should not have the birthright, <i>measure for measure.</i> The third is that Reuben desecrated the bed of Jacob, where the <i>Shekhinah</i> used to appear. Therefore, you are unworthy, Reuben, to have the <i>priesthood.</i> You desecrated and made the bed unholy. Therefore, you must also remain unholy.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Genesis, 49:3.</i>
Hizkuni writes. From the time that Reuben did his deed with Bilhah, Jacob did not sleep with Bilhah. “<i>My couch he mounted</i>” [49:4]. Jacob said to his children. See what Reuben did. He went on my bed where I used to sleep.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 49:4.</i>
“<i>Simeon and Levi are a pair</i>” [49:5]. Jacob called Simeon and Levi and said to them. You are brothers in agreement about Shechem and about Joseph, that you destroyed the city of Shechem. You should not have done that, since the whole city of Shechem had <i>circumcised</i> themselves. Perhaps, they would have become proper Jews after that.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban, Genesis, 49:5.</i>
Bahya writes. “<i>When you mounted your father</i>’<i>s bed</i>” [49:4], means, you have desecrated two beds. One is the bed of the <i>Shekhinah</i> that used to be on the bed and the other is my bed. Therefore, it is written, “<i>my beds.</i>” This means two beds, since the Shekhinah was always with Jacob. Even in bed, Jacob’s thought was on the Shekhinah. The Midrash says that Jacob said to Reuben. You will not be healed from the disgrace until <i>Moses Our Teacher</i> will ascend mount <i>Ebal</i> and will count Reuben first for the curses. That is, they will curse whoever will transgress the Torah. <i>Moses Our Teacher</i> will say to the <i>tribe of Reuben</i> that they should ascend mount Ebal and should curse. “<i>Cursed be he who sleeps with his father</i>’<i>s wife</i>” [Deut. 27:20]. This means, cursed be he who sleeps with his father’s wife. As soon as <i>all of Israel</i> knew that Reuben was innocent, then he was forgiven for the transgression.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 49:4.</i>
“<i>Simeon and Levi are a pair</i>” [49:5]. You were brothers to your sister Dinah that you risked your lives for Dinah’s sake. However, with Joseph you were no brothers. That is to say, they did not act like brothers when they threw him into the pit and afterwards sold him. Therefore, when the brothers later came to Egypt to Joseph, Joseph threw Simeon into prison before all of his brothers. Joseph did this so that Simeon should have expiation for his sin that he sold Joseph.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 49:5.</i>
“<i>Their weapons are tools of lawlessness</i>” [49:5]. <i>Jacob</i> said to <i>Simeon</i> and <i>Levi.</i> You have stolen and robbed the sword from <i>Esau.</i> That is to say, your thing is not to go about with swords, as Esau, who goes about with the sword. It is his blessing, that he should commit murder.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 49:5.</i>
“<i>Let not my person be included in their council</i>” [49:6]. Jacob said to Simeon and Levi. With your advice, <i>Zimri</i> gathered the tribe of <i>Simeon</i> and took a gentile Midianite woman before Moses and said. Is she permitted to me to sleep with her or is she forbidden? If you, Moses, want to tell us that she is forbidden, how did you take the daughter of Jethro who was also a gentile? Therefore, Jacob said: On that incident, my name, Jacob, should not be mentioned. By the war of Korah, who was from the tribe of Levi, there too my name, Jacob, should not be mentioned. Because Simeon and Levi killed Shechem and Hamor and wanted to kill Joseph, therefore, my name should not be mentioned in connection with their deeds.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 49:6.</i>
“<i>Cursed be their anger</i>” [49:7]. Jacob said: cursed should be your anger. That is to say, the Holy One should give that Simeon and Levi should never have cause to curse, so that they should not be able to do anything with their anger. So writes Hizkuni.<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 49:7.</i>
<i>Rashi</i> writes. Even when they are worthy to be cursed, yet Jacob did not curse them, but cursed their anger.<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 49:7.</i>
“<i>I will divide them in Jacob</i>” [49:7]. The teachers and scribes should be from Simeon and they will be dispersed among Israel. The <i>tribe of Levi</i> should also be dispersed so that they go among all the barns for their <i>terumah</i> and <i>tithes.</i> Thus, Jacob caused them to be dispersed among Israel with honor. That is to say, to be teachers and to collect tithes is, with honor.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 49:7.</i>
“<i>Judah, your brothers will praise</i>” [49:8]. Judah saw that Jacob was denigrating his children, so he stood in back and did not want to show himself to Jacob. Jacob said to Judah: you are not like this; your brothers will praise you.<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 49:8.</i>
“<i>Your hand will be on the nape of your foes</i>” [49:8]. Your hand shall be on the nape of your enemies. That is, you will win your wars and your enemies will flee before you and will show their nape and their back. All of your brothers will bow down to you.<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 49:8.</i>
“<i>Your father</i>’<i>s sons</i>” [49:8]. Since Jacob had many wives and had children with each of them, therefore he says, all of your father’s children will bow down to you. That is to say, even though they are not your brothers from the same mother.<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 49:8.</i>
“<i>Judah is a lion</i>’<i>s whelp</i>” [49:9]. Jacob prophesied about Judah that <i>King David</i>, who would lead <i>all of Israel</i>, would come from him. Shortly afterwards, he would be a strong king alone. That is to say, after <i>King Saul</i>’<i>s</i> death.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 49:9.</i>
“<i>On prey, my son, have you grown</i>” [49:9]. Jacob said to Judah. I suspected you that you had attacked my son and killed him. However, you said, what profit would we have if we would kill him, and protected my son Joseph from death. With your daughter-in-law Tamar you learned that she became pregnant from you, and you rescued her from death. Therefore, you will be worthy that <i>King Solomon</i> will come from you. There will be peace and <i>quiet</i> in the time that he will live. So writes Rashi.<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 49:9.</i>
Hizkuni writes. “<i>On prey, my son, have you grown</i>” [49:9]. This means that you are praised, that you can attack and kill your enemies, the gentiles.<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 49:9.</i>
One asks a question about Rashi. How did Jacob praise Judah that he rescued Joseph? The Talmud writes: whoever praises Judah does not do properly, because he said to his brothers, what profit would we have if we kill Joseph? If they had profited, then they would have killed Joseph.<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Sanhedrin,</i> 6b.</i> Thus, Judah did not act properly with his words. Therefore, we explain that Judah first said, “<i>what do we gain by killing</i>” [Genesis, 37:26]. What kind of profit will we have if we kill him and shed the blood of a person, even one who is not our brother? <i>How much more so</i>, how can we spill blood, even if we would have great profit from our brother Joseph?<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">Devek Tov, Genesis, 49:9.</i>
Therefore, Judah said, “<i>he is our brother</i>” [Genesis, 37:27]. That is to say, he is indeed our brother. If you want to follow the advice of Reuben who said to throw him into a very deep pit, so that we should not shed blood with our own hands, but he will die on his own, this is also not right, since he is still our brother. We find concerning <i>Abel</i> who was killed by his brother, <i>Cain</i> that the earth did not want to accept his blood. It cried out from the earth. Therefore, Judah said, “<i>and covering his blood</i>” [Genesis, 37:26]. If you will think to cover the blood with the earth when Joseph will die in the pit, it is nothing. The blood calls out from the earth. Therefore, the Talmud says that one should not say, “<i>what profit.</i>” This means what profit from talking about whether Judah was worthy to be blessed or to be praised. In any event, Judah was right in that he said, “<i>he is our brother.</i>” Therefore, there is no opinion that one should do anything to him. Therefore, Jacob also said, “<i>on prey you grow</i>” [49:9]. That is to say, because he was my son and you were also my son. You are brothers and therefore you saved him. Therefore, you are just to be praised and blessed.
“<i>The scepter shall not depart from Judah</i>” [49:10]. <i>Kingship</i> should not be removed from Judah, even when the <i>Temple</i> was destroyed. The <i>exilarchs in Babylon</i> should be from <i>David.</i> They were the leaders of Israel in the exile, just like a king. They are also the <i>students</i> and <i>rabbis</i> and the <i>leaders</i> of the academies who always came from the house of Judah.<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 49:10.</i>
“<i>Until Shiloh comes</i>” [49:10]. All of this shall be until the Messiah comes and the <i>kingdom</i> shall be his. All the nations will bring <i>gifts</i> and <i>sacrifices</i> to the Messiah.<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 49:10.</i>
<i>Bahya</i> writes. “<i>Until Shiloh comes</i>” [49:10]. This means that the <i>kingdom</i> of Judah will last until <i>Moses Our Teacher</i> will come from the <i>tribe of Levi</i> and will be a king over Israel, as the verse says, “<i>He will be a king in Jeshurun</i>” [Deuteronomy, 33:5]. This means that Moses is a king over Israel and the word <i>Shiloh</i> has the same numerical value as Moses. That is to say, the word <i>Shiloh</i> alludes to Moses. Bahya gives another explanation. “<i>The scepter shall not depart from Judah</i>” [49:10]. This means that the <i>kingship</i> will not come and will not <i>reach Judah</i> “<i>until Shiloh comes</i>,” not until the <i>tabernacle</i> in the city of <i>Shiloh</i> will be removed and destroyed. Afterwards, the <i>prophet Samuel</i> will come from the Holy One and will make <i>David</i>, from the <i>tribe of Judah</i>, the king. <i>Bahya</i> writes another explanation. The <i>kingship</i> will not be removed forever from the tribe of Judah. When the Messiah will come, the <i>kingship of Judah</i> will be restored eternally. That is to say, it may be abrogated now, but when the Messiah comes, the kingship of Judah will be forever. This is the meaning of the word <i>forever.</i> That is to say, “<i>The scepter shall not depart from Judah</i>” [49:10]. The <i>kingship of Judah</i> will not be removed forever. Therefore, when the nations tell us that from this verse that the Messiah has come, that is to say, it is written, “<i>Until Shiloh comes</i>” [49:10]. This means that the kingship will be removed from Judah when the Messiah comes. The <i>nations of the world</i> say: we see that the kingship has been removed from Israel, thus your Messiah must have come. We respond to them that the verse means that the kingship will not be removed from Judah when the Messiah will come, but the <i>kingship of Judah</i> will become eternal at that time. However, before the Messiah comes the <i>kingship of Judah</i> will be abrogated. Therefore, when we see now that the <i>kingship of Judah</i> has been abrogated, the Messiah has also not come and if the Messiah had come, then the <i>kingship of Judah</i> would also not have been abrogated. <i>Bahya</i> also writes that, “<i>Until Shiloh comes</i>” [49:10], shows us that just as <i>Moses</i> led Israel from the exile of Egypt, so he will also lead us out of the final exile along with the <i>prophet Elijah.</i> As Midrash Rabbah says: the Holy One said to Moses. Just like you risked your life for the sake of Israel in Egypt, so too in the end when the <i>prophet Elijah</i> will lead Israel out of the exile, you Moses will come along with the <i>prophet Elijah</i>, as the verse says, “<i>the Lord travels in whirlwind and storm</i>” [Nahum, 1:3]. The word “<i>whirlwind</i>” alludes to Moses, who was thrown into the water into the reeds.<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">This is a play on words; whirlwind is <i>sufa</i> in Hebrew and reed is <i>suf.</i></i> The word “<i>storm</i>” alludes to the <i>prophet Elijah</i>, who was in the storm when he was taken up alive to heaven.<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">II Kings, 2:11.</i> “<i>On prey, my son, have you grown</i>” [49:9]. <i>Bahya</i> writes. Judah rescued Joseph so that the brothers did not kill him. Afterwards, he rescued Tamar, along with Peretz and Zerach, when Judah learned that she had become pregnant from him. The Holy One repaid this, <i>measure for measure.</i> Since Judah rescued Joseph from the pit, therefore the Holy One rescued <i>Daniel</i> from the lion pit. He was descended from Judah and because he had rescued Tamar and two children from the fire, so that she was not burned. Tamar had been taken out to be burned, but Judah saved her. Therefore, the Holy One also saved <i>Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah</i> so that they emerged alive from the fire of the furnace. All three were descended from Judah. Also, the Temple was built through the children of Judah. The first <i>Temple</i> was built by <i>King Solomon</i> who was descended from Judah. The second <i>Temple</i> was built by <i>Zerubbabel</i> who was descended from Judah. The third <i>Temple</i> will be built by the Messiah, who will be descended from Judah.<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 49:10.</i>
“<i>He tethers his ass to a vine</i>” [49:11]. Jacob <i>prophesied</i> that when they will have the <i>land of Israel</i>, they will have much wine, particularly the land of Judah would be full of vines. A horse and a donkey will be needed to pull one vine with grapes. That is, the grapes will be so big.<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 49:11.</i>
“<i>His eyes are reddened from wine</i>” [49:12]. There will be so much wine in the land of <i>Judah</i> that their eyes will be red from drinking so much.<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 49:12.</i>
“<i>His teeth are whiter than milk</i>” [49:12]. There will be so much milk in the land of Judah that their teeth will be whitened because of the milk.<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 49:12.</i>
Another explanation of “<i>His eyes are reddened from wine</i>” [49:12]. The hills are red because of the grapes that will pour over the hills. “<i>His teeth are whiter than milk</i>” [49:12]. The valleys will be white from milk that will pour out of the cattle from an excess of milk.<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 49:12.</i>
<i>Bahya</i> writes. There is no letter <i>zayin</i> in the section regarding Judah though all the other letters of the alphabet are found in this section. The explanation is that the kingship of Israel came through Judah, who waged war with the nations, and won all the wars not with <i>weapons</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew term is <i>clei zayin</i>, and is a play on the word <i>zayin</i>, as in the name of the letter.</i> that is swords and bows, but they won the wars with the name of the Holy One, who helped Israel with all the wars. Therefore, the name of Judah includes all the letters of the name of the Holy One,<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">That is, the Tetragrammaton.</i> and <i>dalet</i> was added to Judah, in addition to the name of the Holy One. This shows us that Judah was the fourth son of Jacob’s children. The <i>kingdom of Judah</i> was compared to the sun, which was created on the fourth day. Just like the sun shines and illumines in the sky, it strengthens during the day, so too the <i>kingdom of Israel</i> will strengthen before long, as the verse says, “<i>his throne, as the sun before Me</i>” [Psalms, 89:37].<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 49:12.</i>
“<i>Zebulon shall dwell by the seashore</i>” [49:13]. The land of Zebulon is by the sea and he will carry merchandise with ships on the sea. He will feed <i>Issachar</i>, who studies Torah day and night. The merit of Zebulon is greater than that of Issachar. Even if he studies Torah, for if Zebulon did not give Issachar food, the Issachar could not study Torah. Therefore, Zebulon is written first in the Torah, before <i>Issachar</i> is mentioned. The one who helps to study Torah and the one who gives <i>students</i> and those who study Torah <i>for the sake of heaven</i> to eat, his reward is greater and more immediate from the Holy One, than the one who studies Torah himself.<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 49:13.</i>
“<i>Issachar is a strong-boned ass</i>” [49:14]. He compares <i>Issachar</i> to a donkey. Just like a donkey has large bones and its flesh is minimal, so too are the children of <i>Issachar</i> who study Torah, their bodies and their flesh are slight. The strength of the one who studies Torah will be diminished and the flesh of his body will be less.<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 49:14.</i>
“<i>Crouching among the sheepfolds</i>” [49:14]. Just like the donkey goes day and night and when it wants to rest, it rests within the boundaries of the city. So too are the scholars. They do not rest day or night, but study Torah, and do not rest in their homes.<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 49:14.</i>
“<i>He saw how good was security</i>” [49:15]. Since the Torah wants that one should rest and not pursue <i>business</i> and not wage <i>war</i>, therefore it is written concerning Issachar that he must have peace and <i>rest.</i> That is why we say in the <i>Eighteen Blessings</i> every day, “<i>Restore our judges as at first, and our counselors as at the beginning; remove from us sorrow and sighing.</i>” This means, we pray to God that we look to <i>Jerusalem</i> that it should give us advice and understanding to understand the Torah, as the verse says, “<i>for the land shall be filled with devotion to the Lord</i>” [Isaiah 11:9]. That is to say, when the Messiah will come, there will be understanding and wisdom for each person to understand the Torah and commandments. Therefore, it is written before the blessing, <i>Restore our judges</i>, <i>Sound the Shofar.</i> That is to say, when one will blow the shofar when the Messiah will come, there will be wisdom and understanding to properly judge and to study Torah. “<i>He bent his shoulder to the burden</i>” [49:15]. This teaches us that the scholar should be humble, even when he has learning and when he is disrespected. “<i>And became a toiling serf</i>” [49:15]. Issachar will be a <i>tax</i> for Israel. That is to say, he will teach Torah to Israel and <i>give rulings about forbidden and permitted</i> and other laws. The Midrash states: “<i>Issachar is a strong-boned ass</i>” [49:14]. This means that when Jacob cam from the field on his donkey, Leah heard the donkey braying. She went out of her tent toward Jacob and said to Jacob. Come, I have rented you, to sleep with me this night. She became pregnant that night and gave birth to <i>Issachar.</i> Therefore, the verse says that the donkey caused that Issachar was born.<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 49:15.</i>
“<i>Dan shall govern his people</i>” [49:16]. This is <i>Samson the hero</i> who came from the tribe of <i>Dan.</i> He was a judge over Israel and led Israel with justice, just like a king, and he destroyed many nations. The Midrash states: “<i>As one of the tribes of Israel</i>” [49:16], means that Samson was compared to the Holy One, who was unique in the world like the Holy One who destroys nations without a sword and without arrows. So too was Samson who destroyed alone, without others, without sword and without arrows. Rather, he took a bone from a donkey, a jawbone, and killed a thousand men with that jawbone. Therefore, the verse compared him to a snake, which goes alone very slowly and kills many people. So too with Samson; he did not go with great shouts and with many people, and destroyed many nations. Another explanation is that like a snake has a poison like fire, so too Samson burned the Philistine’s wheat.<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 49:16–17.</i>
He captured three hundred live foxes and tied burning torches to the foxes and chased the foxes to the wheat, through the fields and all their gardens and burned all the fields of the wheat of the Philistines. When the Philistines learned of this, they came to wage war against Israel. <i>All of Israel</i> went to <i>Samson</i> and said to <i>Samson</i>, the <i>Philistines</i> do not want anyone but you. Three thousand Israelite men went and wanted to bind Samson to give him to the Philistines. Samson said to the three thousand Israelite men. Swear to me that you will do nothing to me and I will allow you to bind my hands and feet. They said: we will do nothing to you, but will bind you. They took two thick ropes and bound Samson and took him to the Philistines. However, as soon as they saw him bound, they began to blow trumpets and dance, out of great joy. The <i>spirit</i> of God came over Samson and the ropes on his hands were like flax burned in fire and they dissolved around his hands. Samson took the jawbone of a dead donkey and killed three thousand Philistines with that jawbone. Afterwards, Samson was very thirsty and had nothing to drink. Samson prayed to the Holy One and said: Lord of the world, You have helped me with the Philistines, and now shall I die of thirst and fall into the hands of the <i>uncircumcised ones.</i> The Holy One caused a miracle and made water to flow from the jawbone of the donkey, like a fountain. Samson drank and remained alive.<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">Judges, 15:4–18.</i>
The Midrash says that therefore Samson was compared to a snake. Just like a snake has no feet, so too Samson also limped on his feet.<sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote">The source is, B. <i>Sotah,</i> 10a, quoted in Bahya, Genesis, 49:17.</i>
“<i>I wait for your deliverance, O Lord</i>” [49:18]. Jacob saw that Samson was the last <i>Judge</i> of Israel, since <i>Samuel the prophet</i> followed Samson. Also, Samuel did not wage war as had Samson. Jacob said about this, that he would die in the war. That is to say, even though he will die, nonetheless, “<i>I wait for your deliverance, O Lord</i>” [49:18]. That is to say, I hope to God that He will help [deliver] us from our enemies, even when the Judges will be gone. So writes Ramban.<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban, Genesis, 49:17.</i>
However, Rashi and Bahya write. Samson himself said, “<i>I wait for your deliverance, O Lord</i>” [49:18]. That is to say, when Samson grabbed the pillars in order to pull them down, Samson prayed to God that he should help him to topple the pillars. He was not sad that he would also die, but that he would have <i>revenge</i> on the Philistines. He said, “<i>Let me die with the Philistines</i>” [Judges, 16:30]. That is, let me die with the Philistines.<sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 49:18; Bahya, Genesis, 49:18.</i>
“<i>Gad shall be raided by raiders</i>” [48:19]. Jacob said that <i>Gad</i> would go with his brothers across the <i>Jordan</i> to wage war with the nations. They will kill many nations and the <i>children of Gad</i> will return from the land of Israel and will take their share in land outside the land [of Israel]. They will all come home in peace and not one of them from Gad will be killed.<sup class="footnote-marker">83</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 49:19.</i>
“<i>Asher</i>’<i>s bread shall be rich</i>” [49:20]. Jacob blessed <i>Asher</i> that his land will be full of good olives. They will carry oil to all the lands from him.<sup class="footnote-marker">84</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 49:20.</i>
“<i>Naphtali is a hind let loose</i>” [49:21]. Jacob said to <i>Naphtali</i> that his land would have good fruit that will grow quickly and ripen before all the other lands, like a hind. Like a hind that runs quickly, so will his fruit grow quickly.<sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 49:21.</i>
“<i>Which yields lovely fawns</i>” [49:21]. They will make a blessing on his fruits more quickly than the other lands. Another explanation is that Jacob prophesied about <i>Sisera</i>, that ten thousand men from Naphtali gathered and went quick as a hind. They ran quickly to wage war with <i>Sisera.</i> “<i>Which yields lovely fawns</i>” [49:21]. This is the <i>song</i> that Deborah and [her husband] <i>Barak</i> sang at that time.<sup class="footnote-marker">86</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 49:21.</i>
The Midrash says that Esau did not want to allow Jacob to be buried in the cave. Naphtali ran to Egypt to bring the letter that Esau had sold his share in the cave to Jacob. Before he could go, <i>Husham</i>, the son of Dan, rose up and killed Esau because he did not want to allow them to bury Jacob in the cave.<sup class="footnote-marker">87</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 49:21.</i>
Ramban writes and <i>Toldot Yizhak</i> cites the Ramban. He compares Naphtali to a hind since the custom with the hinds was that they were sent overland with letters to the <i>king of the north.</i> When a hind was born in a land, they were taken to the <i>king of the southern land.</i> The <i>king of the south</i> raised them in his land. When he needed to send letters to the land of the north, he would attach the letter to its throat and it runs by itself to the king of the north and carries the letter. It gives a positive report when it returns. This is the meaning of “<i>which yields lovely fawns</i>” [49:21].<sup class="footnote-marker">88</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban, Genesis, 49:21; Toldot Yizhak, Genesis, 49:21.</i>
<i>Imre Noam</i> writes. “<i>Naphtali is a hind let loose</i>” [49:21]. Naphtali is quick on the way. Therefore, he gives good news to each one that he encounters. Nobody hinders him on his way, and this is the meaning of “<i>which yields lovely fawns</i>” [49:21].<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">Imre Noam, Genesis, 49:21.</i>
“<i>Joseph is a wild ass</i>” [49:22]. Joseph is a son who has charm. “<i>A wild ass by a spring</i>” [49:22]. Whoever sees Joseph is charmed by him. “<i>Wild ass on a hillside</i>” [49:22]. The daughters of Egypt ran to the walls to see the beauty of Joseph. Another explanation of “<i>Joseph is a wild ass</i>” is that when Esau came to Jacob and saw all of his children and wives, Joseph placed himself in front of his mother Rachel and made himself as tall as he could so that the evil Esau should not see Rachel, who was very beautiful. Therefore, Jacob said, “<i>Joseph is a wild ass.</i>” That is, because you made yourself taller for your mother, therefore, you are worthy of the greatness that all the women will see your beauty. <i>A wild ass by a spring.</i>” You will merit that no <i>evil eye</i> will harm you.<sup class="footnote-marker">90</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 49:22.</i>
<i>Bahya</i> writes. “<i>Joseph is a wild ass.</i>” He says, “<i>Joseph is a wild ass</i>” twice. They will be many among Israel from the two children, as Moses also says, “<i>these are the myriads of Ephraim, the thousands of Menashe</i>” [Deuteronomy, 33:17].<sup class="footnote-marker">91</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 49:22.</i>
“<i>Wild colts on a hillside</i>” [49:22]. The daughters of Egypt went on the walls to see the beauty of Joseph. Joseph was very modest and did not want to look at a woman. Therefore, he merited kingship. The Midrash says. “<i>Joseph is a wild ass</i>” means, through the cows in Pharaoh’s dream, Joseph came to the greatness that he also became a king.<sup class="footnote-marker">92</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 49:22.</i>
“<i>They bitterly assailed him</i>” [49:23]. Potiphar and his wife assailed him and his brothers warred with him. “<i>They shot at him and harried him</i>” [49:23]. His enemies harried him. That is to say, the brothers who will divide the inheritance with him, hate him.<sup class="footnote-marker">93</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 49:23.</i>
“<i>Yet his bow stayed taut</i>” [49:24]. He aimed strongly. That is to say, a king. “<i>His hands were made firm</i>” [49:24]. His hands were made over. That is to say, the king put the golden <i>signet ring</i> on his hand. “<i>By the hands of the Mighty One of Jacob</i>” [49:24]. Joseph had all this from the Holy One, who is the Mighty One of Jacob. “<i>Thus, the Shepherd, the Rock of Israel</i>” [49:24]. From here, Joseph merited to be a lord over Israel.<sup class="footnote-marker">94</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 49:24.</i>
<i>Toldot Yizhak</i> writes. “<i>Yet his bow stayed taut</i>” [49:24]. This means that the wife of Potiphar came to him and wanted that he should sleep with her. He restrained himself and strongly held on to his genitals and did not want to sleep with her. Therefore, Joseph merited that his hands were adorned with golden rings of a king. “<i>By the hands of the Mighty One of Jacob</i>” [49:24]. This means that Joseph did this, that he did not sleep with Potiphar’s wife because the image of Jacob appeared to Joseph in Egypt, in a dream, and said to Joseph, do not sleep with the gentile woman. Therefore, Joseph said to Potiphar’s wife, “<i>my master</i>” [39:8]. That is to say, Joseph showed his master’s wife. Do you not see my master? That is to say, my father who does not want that I should sleep with you. Joseph pointed to the window that Jacob was standing there and had appeared to Joseph. Jacob said to Joseph. If you will sleep with the gentile woman, you will be called “<i>the shepherd of harlots</i>” [Proverbs, 29:3]. If you will not sleep with her, you will be called “<i>the Shepherd, the Rock of Israel</i>” [49:24]. That is to say, a lord over Israel. Each of the twelve <i>tribes</i> had its own <i>precious stone.</i> The precious stone of Joseph was <i>onyx.</i> The <i>high priest</i> wore a garment and the other brothers had a separate precious stone on that <i>breastplate.</i> The name of each tribe was engraved on their precious stone. The high priest also had another garment called an <i>ephod.</i> There were two stones on it that were called <i>onyx</i>, like the stone of Joseph that was on the <i>breastplate.</i> The names of the twelve tribes were engraved on these two stones of the <i>ephod.</i> Therefore, the verse says, <i>the Shepherd, the Rock of Israel.</i>” That is to say, onyx, which was Joseph’s stone, had engraved on it the names of all of Israel.<sup class="footnote-marker">95</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Genesis, 49:24.</i>
“<i>The God of your father who helps you</i>” [49:25]. Joseph merited all this from the Holy One, your Father, who will help you. “<i>And Shaddai</i>” [49:25]. You were always with the Holy One, so that you did not sleep with your master’s wife. Therefore, He will bless you. “<i>Blessings of the breast and womb</i>” [49:25]. God will bless your father and mother. That is to say, when a man and a woman will have relations, they will have children and will not miscarry. That is to say, Joseph will have many children in the world.<sup class="footnote-marker">96</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 49:25.</i>
“<i>The blessings of your father surpass</i>” [49:26]. Jacob said to Joseph. The <i>blessing</i> of your father is greater and better than the <i>blessing</i> of my parents. That is, the Holy One blessed Jacob without measure and specific goals. “<i>Rest on the head of Joseph</i>” [49:26]. The same blessing should be on the head of Joseph.<sup class="footnote-marker">97</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 49:26.</i>
“<i>Benjamin is a ravenous wolf</i>” [49:27]. Jacob <i>prophesied</i> that they would capture wives to marry, in the days of the <i>concubine of Gibeah.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">98</sup><i class="footnote">Judges, 19:1–21:25.</i> The tribe of Benjamin would be excommunicated and they would have to capture wives to marry, like a wolf captures prey. “<i>In the morning he consumes the foe</i>” [49:27]. <i>King Saul</i> will rob much goods and money from the nations. He will come from the tribe of Benjamin. “<i>In the evening he divides the spoil</i>” [49:27]. In the end, <i>Mordecai and Esther</i> will come from the tribe of Benjamin and will take goods and money from Haman.<sup class="footnote-marker">99</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 49:27.</i>
“<i>This is what their father said to them and blessed them</i>” [49:28]. The verse teaches us that even though Jacob slighted some of his children, but nonetheless, he blessed them with his whole heart, all together.<sup class="footnote-marker">100</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 49:28.</i>
“<i>I am about to be gathered to my kin</i>” [49:29]. Jacob <i>commanded</i> and said. When I will die, you should bury me in the <i>grave</i> of my ancestors in the cave.
Ramban writes. Even though Joseph had sworn to bury Jacob in the cave, yet all of them together carried him to be buried in the cave.<sup class="footnote-marker">101</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban, Genesis, 49:29.</i>
“<i>There Abraham and his wife Sarah were buried; there Isaac and his wife Rebekah were buried</i>” [49:31]. <i>Ramban</i> asks here. Why did Jacob say, they buried Isaac? Jacob also helped bury Isaac. The explanation is that Jacob did not want to be remembered together with Esau, since Esau also helped to bury Isaac. Therefore, Jacob said in brief, they buried Isaac. Therefore, he also says that Abraham and Sarah, and Isaac and Rebekah were buried in the cave and there I buried Leah. I established a <i>right of possession</i> there so that Esau would have no <i>right</i> there, so that only three patriarchs and their wives should lie there. Therefore, Joseph did not ask to be buried in the cave, since there were already three pairs in the cave. That is why Joseph did not ask to be buried in the cave because they were already three before him in the cave. When Jacob was being carried to be buried, <i>Zafu</i>, the grandson of Esau, came with a large crowd and waged war with Joseph and his people, on the way. However, Joseph won the war and he was captured and imprisoned along with his most important followers. They were imprisoned in Egypt until Joseph died. He ran away and became king of <i>Rome.</i> Later he became king of the land of Italy. He was the first king of <i>Rome.</i> However, none of Joseph’s people were killed in that war. The <i>merit of Jacob</i> and the <i>merit of Joseph</i> helped them.<sup class="footnote-marker">102</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban, Genesis, 49:31.</i>
“<i>He breathed his last and gathered</i>” [49:33]. Rashi writes. It is not written that Jacob died. The explanation is that our sages said that Jacob did not die.<sup class="footnote-marker">103</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 49:33.</i>
<i>Ramban</i>, <i>Toldot Yizhak</i>, and Bahya ask a question. Yet, it is written in the Torah portion that the <i>physicians</i> and <i>doctors</i> embalmed Jacob with good spices, so that he should not stink, since he died. Thus, we hear there that he must have died. The three sages write the explanation. That is to say, Jacob was very holy. When he died, his soul still came to his body as if he were still alive. The Talmud writes in <i>tractate Ketubot, chapter twelve.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">104</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Ketubot,</i> 103a.</i> <i>Rabbi</i> [Judah the Prince] commanded before he died that they should prepare the table, the candles and the bed in his house every Friday before the Sabbath. He came to his house every Friday night after his death and recited the Kiddush. Once, his neighbor’s wife came and knocked on the door where Rabbi was. The maid went out and shouted at the neighbor’s wife. Go away, Rabbi has just come. As soon as Rabbi heard this, he was afraid that people would learn of this and Rabbi never came again. He said: I will cause a disgrace for the other righteous people who died before me, since they cannot come back to life, as I have done.<sup class="footnote-marker">105</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban, Genesis, 49:33; Bahya, Genesis, 49:33; Toldot Yizhak, Genesis, 49:33.</i> So too, Jacob came back to life. Concerning this, the sages said that Jacob did not die.
Another explanation that is given is that because Jacob had studied Torah day and night and had also taught students. When they give an explanation in the name of Jacob, his lips move in the grave, as if he was alive in the grave.<sup class="footnote-marker">106</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Yevamot,</i> 97a.</i>
“<i>The Egyptians bewailed him seventy days</i>” [50:3]. They cried for seventy days. That is to say, the forty days that they embalmed him and another thirty days that were customary for mourning.<sup class="footnote-marker">107</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 50:3.</i>
“<i>The physicians embalmed</i>” [50:2]. This means that the physicians explained how to embalm, and the children of Jacob themselves embalmed him in the way the physicians had taught them. That is to say, they did not allow any of the physicians to touch the body of Jacob, but the children embalmed him themselves.<sup class="footnote-marker">108</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 50:2.</i>
“<i>In the grave which I made ready</i>” [50:5]. Jacob said: you should bury me in the cave that I bought for myself. Jacob had piled up gold and silver before Esau and said to him. Take this for your share in the cave.<sup class="footnote-marker">109</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 50:5.</i>
“<i>Joseph went up to bury his father</i>” [50:7]. Nine groups accompanied Jacob to his burial. First was Joseph alone. Second, Pharaoh’s ministers. Third, the elders of his house. Fourth, the elders of Egypt. Fifth, Joseph’s household; his wife and his male and female servants. Sixth, all of his brothers went. Seventh, his father’s household went. Eighth, the chariots went. Ninth, the horsemen went.<sup class="footnote-marker">110</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 50:7.</i>

“<i>As he made you promise on oath</i>” [50:6]. Pharaoh said to Joseph. Go and bury your father because he made you promise. Had he not made you promise, I would not have let you go. Pharaoh said: I should not order you to transgress your oath, since you should also not transgress your oath to me that you swore not to reveal that I do not know how to speak the <i>Holy Tongue.</i> Whoever does not know all the <i>languages</i>, he cannot be king in Egypt. Therefore, Joseph swore that he would not reveal about Pharaoh that he did not know the <i>Holy Tongue.</i> Therefore, Pharaoh said: I must allow you to fulfill your oath.<sup class="footnote-marker">112</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 50:6.</i>
“<i>Goren ha-Atad</i>” [50:10]. All the kings of Canaan and Ishmael came to wage war. They saw that Joseph had hung his crown on Jacob’s coffin. All the kings took their crowns and hung them on Jacob’s coffin. That is why the city is called <i>Goren ha-Atad.</i> It means that there were so many crowns that it looked like a fence.<sup class="footnote-marker">113</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 50:10.</i>
“<i>As he had instructed them</i>” [50:12]. The children carried Jacob, as Jacob had commanded them. First, he commanded that his grandchildren should not carry him, since several grandchildren were born from daughters of Canaan. He commanded that no Egyptian should carry the <i>coffin.</i> He also commanded that three children should walk along each side of the coffin. They walked alongside the coffin the same way the Tablets were carried. He commanded that the <i>tribe of Levi</i> should not carry Jacob’s coffin, because they would carry the Tablets, which are holy. Joseph should not carry him because he was a king. Menashe and Ephraim were the substitutes for Joseph and Levi.<sup class="footnote-marker">114</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 50:12.</i>
“<i>He and his brothers</i>” [50:14]. Joseph and his brothers and all those who went with them returned home to Egypt. Rashi asks a question. Why did the verse first write about the brothers and then the Egyptians? Earlier in the portion it is written that the Egyptians went to bury Jacob. There, the brothers are mentioned afterward. The explanation is that the Egyptians saw how all the other kings hung their crowns on Jacob’s coffin. Thus, they also honored Jacob’s children and allowed them to go first on the way home.<sup class="footnote-marker">115</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 50:14.</i>
“<i>When Jacob</i>’<i>s brothers saw that their father was dead</i>” [50:15]. After Jacob died, Joseph made himself a separate table where he would eat. The brothers did not understand this and thought that Joseph wanted to take revenge on his brothers and therefore he did not want to eat with them, because he hated them. However, Joseph’s intention was positive. As long as their father had lived, they all ate together at one table. Jacob recited the blessing over the bread and the wine. However, now that Jacob had died, it was appropriate that Joseph should recite the blessing over the bread and wine, since he was <i>head of the household.</i> However, Joseph thought that he was the youngest among the brothers, and how appropriate was it that he should recite the blessing over the bread? Therefore, Joseph made a separate table.<sup class="footnote-marker">116</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Genesis Rabbah,</i> 100.8.</i>
Hizkuni writes. Joseph went on the way to bury Jacob. He came to the pit into which his brothers had thrown him. Joseph made a blessing over that pit that the Holy One had made a miracle for him and had helped him, and the brothers saw this. Therefore, they thought that he would certainly take revenge on them, because he had stood by the pit and thought about all the troubles he had in the pit.<sup class="footnote-marker">117</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Genesis, 50:15.</i>
They sent the children of Bilhah and had them say to Joseph.

The brothers therefore thought up what Jacob would command, since they were afraid of Joseph.<sup class="footnote-marker">119</sup><i class="footnote">Zeror ha-Mor, Genesis, 50:15.</i>
<i>Toldot Yizhak</i> asks a question. Why does the verse have to say, “<i>the servants of the God of your father</i>” [50:17]? This means, forgive the sin of the servants of your God of your father. Why does it have to mention servants? The explanation is that the brothers said to Joseph, because you said the first time that we introduced ourselves to you, you said to us, do not fear. You did not sell me, but God sent me to Egypt to sustain you. Therefore, like you Joseph, we were the servants of God when we sold you. Therefore, forgive us for the sin because we are the servants and messengers of God. Thus, we are not guilty, as you yourself said. Therefore, the verse says here, “<i>the servants of the God of your father</i>” [50:17].<sup class="footnote-marker">120</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Genesis, 50:17.</i>
Bahya writes. The brothers desired Joseph’s <i>forgiveness.</i> It is written in the verse that Joseph forgave them. Our sages said that when someone committed a transgression against his friend, even if he immediately repents, he is not forgiven until he apologizes to his friend, and he forgives him for what was done against him. It happened that the brothers died and were not forgiven by Joseph. Therefore, their children had to suffer. As a result, ten important rabbis of Israel died because of that transgression.<sup class="footnote-marker">121</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 50:17.</i>
“<i>The servants of the God of your father</i>” [50:17]. The brothers said: even though your father has died, nonetheless, the God of your fathers lives forever and we are the servants of God.<sup class="footnote-marker">122</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 50:17.</i>
“<i>Joseph was in tears</i>” [50:17]. Joseph cried that the brothers sent him this. Afterwards, the brothers went to Joseph themselves and fell before him and said, we are your servants. Joseph said to his brothers. Do not be afraid; am I then God? A person, even if he wants to do evil to a person, he cannot do anything without the Holy One. Just like when you wanted to do evil to me, the Holy One made for good, for you and for me, to feed you in a time of famine.<sup class="footnote-marker">123</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Genesis, 50:19.</i> Therefore, do not be afraid.

“<i>Joseph lived one hundred and ten years</i>” [50:22]. Joseph lived one hundred and ten years. He saw grandchildren from Menashe and Joseph raised them all. That is why the verse tells us that they were raised in the house of Joseph. That is why they were righteous. They learned everything good from Joseph.<sup class="footnote-marker">126</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 50:23.</i>
“<i>Joseph made the sons of Israel swear</i>” [50:25]. Joseph made Israel swear that they would bury him in the land of Israel when he would die. Joseph had the merit that <i>Moses Our Teacher</i> took his bones and carried them with a great entourage to the <i>land of Israel</i>, with <i>all of Israel.</i> Each <i>tribe of Israel</i> carried the bones of its founder. That is, the children of <i>Reuben</i> took the bones of Reuben and the children of <i>Simeon</i> carried the bones of Simeon and so too all the others. Joseph had buried Jacob and therefore, he had the merit that an important person buried him and that was <i>Moses Our Teacher.</i> When the Israelites were ready to go out of Egypt, the <i>coffin</i> of Joseph was in the river Nile. The Egyptians had placed it in the river Nile. They said: let the Nile be blessed by the merit of Joseph the righteous. Moses took a silver tablet and wrote on it, <i>rise ox, rise ox.</i> This means, rise Joseph, who was called <i>ox.</i> Moses called out: your brothers are leaving Egypt and the Shekhinah of the Holy One is waiting for you. Therefore, do not tarry and come out of the river Nile. If you will not rise, then we will be absolved of your oath. The Egyptians had placed him in an iron box and could not know where he was in the Nile. He rose and therefore Moses was worthy that the Holy One himself buried him. From here we learn that when a person has performed a meritorious act, he merits a great reward from God. As the verse says, “<i>Blessed is he who trusts in the Lord</i>” [Jeremiah, 17:7]. Blessed is the man who relies on the Holy One. “<i>For in the Lord you have an everlasting Rock</i>” [Isaiah, 26:4].<sup class="footnote-marker">127</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 50:25, 26.</i>

Shemot

“<i>These are the names</i>” [1:1]. <i>King Solomon, of blessed memory</i>, said: “<i>Like a ring of gold, a golden ornament, is a wise man</i>’<i>s reproof in a receptive ear</i>” [Proverbs, 25:12]. The verse teaches us that the one who accepts the reproof of the sages, has the best attribute. Therefore, <i>King Solomon</i> says here in this verse, the reproof is the adornment of the body like a golden nose ring is for the body. The primary reproof is to children when they are young and they only desire pleasures. The good inclination first comes when one is thirteen years old and therefore one punishes him at that time. That is why <i>King Solomon</i> says that one who does not hit his son with the rod hates his son. The one who loves his son punishes him with words and hits him for a good purpose. King David did not punish his son Absalom and that is why he was evil. He slept with his father’s wives in Jerusalem and his father had to run away from Jerusalem before Absalom. However, Jacob punished all of his children and studied with them. Therefore, they were all pious and righteous. Therefore, the verse calls them proper children to their father. This is the meaning of the verse “<i>These are the names of the sons of Israel</i>” [1:1]. That is to say, they were their father’s children. This means a proper father who raises his children to be good.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, <i>Shemot</i>, Introduction.</i>
Rashi writes. Why does the verse here need to count the children of Israel with their names? Scripture counted them above in <i>parshat Vayigash.</i> The explanation is that Israel are compared to the stars in the sky, that the Holy One counts when the Holy One takes them out to illumine the night. He counts them again when the Holy One call the stars back during the day.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Exodus, 1:1.</i>
<i>Zeror ha-Mor</i> and <i>Toldot Yizhak</i> write. The righteous are therefore compared to the stars in the sky that the Holy One counts is when they go and return. This teaches us that when the righteous die, they have more honor and more light in the next world. Just like the stars that illumine at night more than during the day, so too are the righteous. When they die, they have more light and honor in the next world.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Zeror ha-Mor, Exodus, 1:1; Toldot Yizhak, Exodus, 1:1.</i>
Bahya, Hizkuni, and Imre Noam write. The verse teaches us that Jacob gave each son and grandson a wife in the expectation that they should not take wives from the Egyptians. Therefore, the Egyptians had no pity for the Israelites, because they did not want to <i>marry</i> them.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 1:1; Hizkuni, Exodus, 1:1; Imre Noam, Exodus, 1:1.</i>
The Midrash, Bahya, and Zeror ha-Mor also write. The verse tells us that God, blessed be He, also came with Israel into exile in Egypt. This is the meaning of the verse “<i>each coming with his household</i>” [1:1]. That is, the Holy One is called <i>a man of war</i>, who came with the children of Jacob to Egypt in order to redeem them.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Exodus Rabbah,</i> 1.5; Bahya, Exodus, 1:1; Zeror ha-Mor, Exodus, 1:1.</i>
Bahya asks a question. Why does the verse mention Joseph last? The explanation is that Joseph is mentioned last in the expectation that the children of Leah and Rachel should not seek lordship over the children of Zilpah and Bilhah, that they were the children of servants. Therefore, the verse mentions <i>Dan, Naphtali</i>, Gad, and <i>Asher</i> between Benjamin and Joseph. He wants to show us that Dan, Naphtali, Gad and Asher, the children of Zilpah and Bilhah, should be as important as Benjamin and Joseph, who were from Rachel, Jacob’s most beloved wife. Therefore, Joseph is mentioned at the end. This shows us that Joseph was humble, even though he was a king. Therefore, the verse mentions him at the end of the list of the children, since the righteous, the more they have authority, the more they consider themselves humble in their own eyes.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 1:2–3.</i>
“<i>Joseph died and all his brothers</i>” [1:6]. <i>Bahya</i> writes. “<i>Joseph died and all his brothers and all that generation</i>” [1:6]. This teaches us that even though Joseph had died, yet their God lived in Heaven. Therefore, the verse says, “<i>Joseph died</i>” and immediately afterwards it is written, “<i>were fertile and prolific</i>” [1:7]. This means that the children of Israel increased greatly. Each woman had six children at a time, in one womb.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 1:6.</i>
<i>Toldot Yizhak</i> writes similarly. There were no women who could not bear children and none of them <i>miscarried.</i> They grew very quickly, like the <i>animals and insects.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Exodus, 1:6–7.</i>
<i>Zeror ha-Mor</i> writes that the number of seventy <i>souls</i> is mentioned again here because soon they became many thousands. <i>Zeror ha-Mor</i> writes. “<i>That were Jacob</i>’<i>s issue</i>” [1:5]. This means that seventy <i>souls</i> came from Jacob’s thigh. Since the angel had displaced Jacob’s thigh, so Jacob had to limp. However, if Jacob had not limped, he would have had more children. Therefore, the verse says “<i>Jacob</i>’<i>s thigh.</i>” This means that all seventy souls came from Jacob’s single thigh. Therefore, it is not written, <i>Jacob</i>’<i>s thighs.</i> This would mean that there were two thighs.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Zeror ha-Mor, Exodus, 1:5.</i>
Rashi writes. “<i>Joseph being already in Egypt</i>” [1:5]. Why does the verse tell us that Joseph was in Egypt? We’ve known it for a long time. The explanation is that the Torah shows that Joseph was always righteous, even when he was in Egypt and was a <i>king.</i> Yet, he was the earlier Joseph with <i>saintliness</i> and piety.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Exodus, 1:5.</i>
<i>Toldot Yizhak</i> writes. “<i>They increased very greatly</i>” [1:7]. Israel increased very greatly. <i>Rabbi Abraham</i> said. He saw a woman who gave birth to four children at one time. Therefore, since it is normal that twins are weak, either both or one of them is weak. The <i>strength</i> that one child should have is divided into two parts for two children. Even more so when six children are in one womb, they would all be weak. Therefore, the verse tells us, “<i>they increased very greatly</i>” [1:7]. They were all strong, even though six children were in one womb at one time.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Exodus, 1:6–7.</i>
“<i>A new king arose</i>” [1:8]. <i>Hizkuni</i> writes. It is not written, <i>and he died.</i> This would have meant that the first king died. This shows us that this was the old king. Why is it written, “<i>A new king arose</i>”? This shows us that the first king thought up many new evil decrees as soon as Joseph died and did not want to recognize the many positive things Joseph had done for the Egyptians.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Exodus, 1:8.</i>
Rashi also writes that <i>Rav and Samuel</i> argue in the Talmud. One says that it was the old king and one says that it was a new king.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Exodus, 1:8.</i>
<i>Zeror ha-Mor</i> writes. “<i>A new king arose</i>” [1:8]. The Egyptians saw that the Israelites were increasing greatly. They got together and they decided that they would not make a king who would be born from a king, but they would take a new king. They hated the descendants of the first king, that they had made Joseph a king. Therefore, they chose an evildoer, an uncompassionate person. Therefore, the verse says, “<i>the Israelite people are much too numerous for us</i>” [1:9]. That is to say, we must kill the Israelites all together for three reasons. The Israelites are used to <i>miracles</i> and <i>wonders.</i> Remember what Jacob did with his brother, Esau. He went against him with four hundred men and could do nothing to Jacob. Remember also what two of his children did to the city of Shechem, and what evil they did that they sold their brother. The second thing is that they are very numerous. The third is that they are very strong. Therefore, the verse says, “<i>let us deal shrewdly with them</i>” [1:10]. We must begin to think with wisdom against their wisdom, since the king was afraid. He saw that he was a stranger. Perhaps all the earlier <i>king</i>’<i>s relatives</i> will gather together with the Israelites, and they will kill us.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Zeror ha-Mor, Exodus, 1:8.</i>
Therefore, we must think about which mode of death we should use to kill them. Their God had sworn that he would not bring water again to destroy the world with a flood. Therefore, we will throw their children into the water, in the expectation that God will not destroy us with water, since their God repays <i>measure for measure.</i> However, they did not know that the <i>Holy One</i> would keep His <i>oath</i> that He would not bring water from heaven to destroy them. However, He would bring them into the water of the sea that is long and wide. The Egyptians would all drown in the sea, <i>measure for measure.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Exodus Rabbah</i>, 1.9.</i>
Hizkuni writes. The Talmud says in [tractate] Sotah that <i>Balaam</i> also sat as an advisor to destroy Israel and to torment them.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Sotah</i>, 11a.</i> How is it possible that <i>Balaam</i> lived for so long, until Israel were in the wilderness and waged war with Midian, at which time <i>Phinehas</i> killed <i>Balaam?</i> How is it possible that he lived for so long? We also find in [tractate <i>Sanhedrin</i>], <i>chapter ten</i>, that Balaam was only thirty-three years old when he was killed.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Sanhedrin</i>, 106b.</i> The explanation is that there were two <i>Balaam</i>’<i>s.</i> The son was named after the father. The one who advised Pharaoh was the father of the Balaam who was killed in the <i>wilderness.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Exodus, 1:9.</i>
“<i>They may join our enemies</i>” [1:10]. <i>Toldot Yizhak</i> writes. They feared that the Israelites would not fight but would surrender, as soon as an enemy would attack a city. They would surrender if only they would be left alive. The custom was that when a city surrendered, they would let the people live and the enemy would take the city.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Exodus, 1:10.</i>
“<i>They set taskmasters over them</i>” [1:11]. Pharaoh imposed masters to collect <i>taxes</i> from the Israelites. Pharaoh did not want to show that he hated the Israelites and wanted to torment them by imposing taxes. The Talmud states in the first chapter of [tractate] Sotah that three sat with Pharaoh to advise him. The first was <i>Balaam</i> who said that the Israelites should all be killed. Therefore, he was killed by the Israelites in the wilderness. The second one was <i>Job</i>, who remained silent and he was punished with sufferings. However, <i>Jethro</i> ran away from the meeting. Thus, he had the <i>merit</i> that his children were worthy to sit in the <i>Sanhedrin.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Sotah,</i> 11a.</i>
<i>Rabbati</i> writes. “<i>They set taskmasters over them</i>” [1:11]. Pharaoh took a brick and hung it around his neck. Whichever Jew said that he could not work, they said to him: why do you want to be better than the king himself? With this <i>Pharaoh</i> introduced it to the Israelites.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Sotah,</i> 11a; <i>Exodus Rabbah</i>, 1.10.</i> So too writes the <i>Tanhuma.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">It is not found in Midrash <i>Tanhuma</i> (either edition), but is found in <i>Yalkut Shimoni, Shemot</i>, <i>Remez</i>, 163.</i>
Pharaoh gathered <i>all the Israelites</i> and asked them to do him a favor and work. <i>Pharaoh</i> himself took a shovel to dig lime. <i>All the Israelites</i> also took shovels and dug lime. They worked this way until night. When night came, Pharaoh had the bricks counted, how many bricks had they made. They had made many bricks the first day since they were strong. Pharaoh said that they should make the same number of bricks every day. Pharaoh placed <i>masters</i> to calculate the number of bricks they made every day. <i>Guards</i> were placed over them who would also count the number of bricks. When the amount was not fulfilled, Pharaoh had the <i>guards</i> beaten because they did not finish the work. These <i>guards</i> allowed themselves to be beaten by others for the sake of Israel, and did not want to hand over Israelites to be beaten because of the numbers. Therefore, the <i>guards were worthy</i> that they were placed over Israel. <i>Sanhedrin,</i> they were the seventy <i>elders</i> in Egypt who were with Moses at all the miracles in front of Pharaoh. From here our sages learn that whoever allows himself to be persecuted for Israel will be worthy to attain <i>greatness</i> and honor.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Midrash <i>Tanhuma</i>, <i>Beha</i>’<i>alotekha</i>, 13; Midrash <i>Tanhuma</i>, (ed.

<i>Yalkut</i> writes. “<i>With all sorts of tasks in the field</i>” [1:14]. The king commanded that the men should sleep in the field at night, in the expectation that they would be separated from their wives, so that they would not have many children. However, the wives brought good food and drink to the field and consoled their husbands. They said that the Holy One would redeem us from this difficult exile. With that, the men’s spirits were raised and they had relations with their wives who became pregnant from their husbands. The Holy One gave them a good reward that they would have much gold and silver. The sea would throw up the dead Egyptians on the <i>dry land</i> before the Israelites, and the Israelites would take the gold and silver of the Egyptians.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, <i>Shemot</i>, <i>Remez</i>, 163.</i>
The Talmud writes in the <i>first chapter of</i> [tractate] <i>Sotah.</i> Israel went out of the <i>Egyptian exile</i> because of the merit of the pious women. When a woman went to draw water, the Holy One caused that the jug was half full of fish and half full of water. She cooked the fish in a pan and warmed it in the water and brought it to their husband in the field. They washed their husband, bathed, anointed, fed him and had relations and became pregnant from her husband. When the time came for her to deliver, she went to the field and had her child under an apple tree and no person was with her. The Holy One sent from heaven that the child was cleaned. Its navel fell off just like a midwife had cut it. The Holy One sent each child two rocks. From one, oil dripped out and from the other honey dripped out, so that the child would have nourishment without its mother. When Pharaoh became aware of them, he sent people to kill the children on the field. The Holy One created a <i>miracle</i> and caused the children to be swallowed up by the earth, so that Pharaoh would not find them. Pharaoh ordered that they plow with oxen over the children. However, the Holy One protected them from the hands of Pharaoh. Soon the Holy One allowed these children to grow up and they came out of the ground, like a grass that grows, and many thousands of such children came out of the earth. These children recognized the Holy One. When He came to Israel at the crossing of the sea, these children shouted, “<i>this is my God and I will enshrine Him</i>” [Exodus, 15:2]. This is my God and I will beautify Him with love.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Sotah,</i> 11b.</i>
“<i>The king spoke to the Hebrew midwives</i>” [1:15]. The king said to the Israelite midwives that they should secretly kill the Israelite children, when they will have male children.
“<i>Look at the birth stool</i>” [1:16]. Pharaoh said: you should look as soon as the child emerges from the mother and if the face it toward the ground, then it is certainly a son. Then you should kill it immediately, so that the mother should not know about it. She would think that the child was stillborn. However, when the child is born with its face up and not facing down, then this would be a daughter and you should let her live. So writes Hizkuni,<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Exodus, 1:15.</i> and the Talmud in <i>Sotah.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Sotah,</i> 11b.</i> Rashi also writes that he ordered them to kill the <i>males</i> because his astrologers told him that a redeemer of the Israelites would be born.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Exodus, 1:16.</i> Hizkuni writes.

Bahya and the Talmud in [tractate] Sotah write. Why was the stool where the woman sits to give birth called ha-<i>avnaim?</i> This shows us that when the woman is ready to give birth, her feet and other limbs become cold, like a stone. Therefore, the stone is called <i>avnaim.</i> That is, a stone that is cold and so will her body also be cold. Therefore, you should see that when someone’s body becomes cold, then she would certainly give birth. Therefore, you should notice it.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 1:15–16; B. <i>Sotah,</i> 11b.</i>
One midwife was called <i>Shifrah</i>, this was <i>Yocheved</i>, because she washed and cleaned the children nicely. The other midwife was called <i>Puah.</i> This was <i>Miriam</i>, the daughter of <i>Yocheved</i>, the mother of Moses, Aaron and Miriam. She was called <i>Puah</i> because she quieted the children when they cried and screamed.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Exodus, 1:15.</i>
<i>Baal ha-Turim</i> writes. <i>Yocheved</i> was called <i>Shifrah</i> because it happened that a woman had a stillborn child, she took a quill from a feather and blew into the child’s innards and it came back to life. Yocheved did this and therefore she was called <i>Shifrah.</i> This means, a straw with which one blows. The two midwives allowed them to live and gave enough food to all the children.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Baal ha-Turim, Exodus, 1:15.</i>
<i>Hizkuni</i>, <i>Toldot Yizhak</i>, and <i>Imre Noam</i> say that the two midwives were the supervisors of many midwives.

The Talmud says in [tractate] Sotah and the <i>Baal ha-Turim</i> also cites the Talmud that Pharaoh wanted to sleep with the two women and they refused, even though he was the king. They were very pious and did not want to engage in illicit sexual relations.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Sotah,</i> 11b; Baal ha-Turim, Exodus, 1:15.</i>
<i>Imre Noam</i> also writes that Pharaoh wanted to give the midwives a big bribe to kill the children. However, they did not want it, because they were God fearing.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Imre Noam, Exodus, 1:17.</i>
“<i>He said to them, why have you done this</i>” [1:18]. Pharaoh had them called and said to them. Why did you allow the children to live? They said: the Israelite women are like animals of the field. They give birth without a midwife. Another explanation is that they are their own midwives and they do not need us.
“<i>He established households for them</i>” [1:21]. Rashi and also the Talmud in [tractate] Sotah write that the Holy One rewarded each of the midwives. To Yocheved the Holy One gave that from her were descended priests and levites. From Miriam kings were descended.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Exodus, 1:21; B. <i>Sotah,</i> 11b.</i>

Hizkuni writes. Pharaoh had houses built in which to place the Israelite women who were pregnant, to watch over them in the houses, so that when they would have their children, they could throw them into the water.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Exodus, 1:21.</i>
Bahya asks a question. Why is it written “<i>for them</i>” as if it was talking to a man? It should have said “<i>for them</i>,” because they were women. The explanation is that the Holy One gave the women a reward just like when a man does a pious deed; the Holy One gives him a good reward, since the men fulfill the commandments properly. So too, the women fulfilled the commandment very properly, as if they had been men and they received a reward as if they were men.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 1:21.</i>
“<i>Pharaoh charged all his people</i>” [1:22]. Rashi writes, Tanhuma, and the Talmud in [tractate] Sotah also write. The astrologers said to Pharaoh that on that day a Messiah for Israel would be born. We do not know if he will be born among the Israelites or the Egyptians. The Messiah will be punished in water. Therefore, let all the children even the Egyptians be thrown into the water. However, the astrologers did not know that the water meant that Moses would be punished because Moses hit the rock in the wilderness in order to give water to the Israelites. The Holy One punished him that he would not come into the <i>land of Israel.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Exodus, 1:22; B. <i>Sotah,</i> 12b; <i>Midrash Tanhuma</i>, <i>Vayakhel</i>, 4.</i>
“<i>Married a Levite woman</i>” [2:1]. Rashi, Hizkuni, Ramban, Bahya and the Talmud in [tractate] Sotah write that Amram, Yocheved’s husband, was a <i>leader of the generation.</i> When Pharaoh commanded that all children should be thrown into the water, Amram separated from his wife and <i>divorced</i> her. Immediately, many righteous people among the Israelites also did the same. Miriam came to her father and said: your decree is worse than Pharaoh’s decree. Pharaoh only ordered that the males be killed and you cause both <i>males</i> and <i>females</i> to be destroyed. Amram immediately remarried his wife. All of them also remarried their wives. Therefore, it is written, “<i>Married a Levite woman</i>” [2:1]. This shows us that Amram erected a <i>wedding canopy</i> to remarry his wife. <i>Aaron</i> and <i>Miriam</i> danced before them like one dances before <i>bride</i> and <i>groom</i> and sang, my father has remarried my mother.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Hizkuni, Ramban, Bahya, all on Exodus, 2:1; B. <i>Sotah,</i> 12a.</i>
<i>Ramban</i> writes.

Also, <i>Miriam</i> taught Aaron and led him to dance.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban, Exodus, 2:1.</i>
<i>Yocheved</i> was one hundred and thirty years old at the time and the verse called her “<i>daughter.</i>” That is to say, young as a young girl. This teaches us that she became young again, like a maiden, and became pregnant and she also became beautiful in her <i>face</i>, not wrinkled. Her pregnancy was not painful and she gave birth without pain. This teaches us that the pious women do not have pain with pregnancy or childbirth.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Sotah,</i> 12a.</i>

“<i>When she could hide him no longer</i>” [2:3]. She had given birth to a son. This was <i>Moses</i>, and she could no longer hide him. For three months she had hidden Moses in her house. Afterwards, the Egyptians came and searched for him, since the Egyptians had made a <i>calculation</i> since the time that <i>Amram</i> had remarried her. They came to search after nine <i>months</i>, when a woman gives birth. However, Moses was born after six months and one day. Therefore, she still hid him for three months in the house, since the Egyptians had not come to search. When the nine months were up, the Egyptians came and asked what happened to the child? She said that they had taken it and thrown it into the water. Moses was born on the seventh of <i>Adar</i> and he was hidden until the sixth of <i>Sivan.</i> He was thrown into the water on the sixth day of <i>Sivan</i>, just like the same day that Moses <i>received</i> the Torah, which was also the sixth of <i>Sivan.</i> Thus the Torah also <i>saved</i> him from the water.

“<i>She saw how beautiful he was</i>” [2:2]. The woman saw that the house was filled with light when Moses was born, and she saw that he was born already circumcised, and he did not need to be circumcised. Therefore, the woman thought to protect him and made a box, which she sealed with lime and tar. She sent the box with the child on the water. The daughter of Pharaoh came and wanted to bathe when she saw the box. She ordered the box to be taken out and her maids did not want to take him out of the box. The Holy One brought an <i>unnatural death</i> to these maids. The Holy One made a miracle and made Pharaoh’s daughter’s arms long, so that she could reach the box in the water. When she opened the box she saw the <i>Shekhinah</i> with the child. The child was crying and she heard a loud <i>voice</i> from the child, like from a grown child. The <i>angel Gabriel</i> came and hit the child so that he would cry loudly, so that the daughter of Pharaoh should have compassion. The daughter of Pharaoh said: this child must be Hebrews. His mother feared that the child should not be killed in the water. Therefore, she took it out herself.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Sotah,</i> 12a-b.</i>

Miriam was the sister of the child and she said <i>prophetically</i> that her mother would have a son who would redeem Israel from Egypt. Therefore, Miriam stood at a distance from the water. They called many Egyptian women to nurse the child. However, the child did not want to nurse from a gentile, since the mouth that would speak with the Holy One, it was not just to nurse from a gentile. Miriam said to Pharaoh’s daughter: shall I call a Hebrew woman to nurse the child? She said: go and call her. Miriam went and called the mother. Pharaoh’s daughter said: take what is yours. That is to say, the prophecy was fulfilled in her mouth when she said: have what is yours. That is to say, your child. She said: nurse the child for me alone. That is to say, I will pay you well, but do not take another child to nurse.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Sotah,</i> 12b.</i> From here we learn that when a woman rents herself out to nurse a child, she is not allowed to take another child to nurse.
Bahya writes. The Holy One does great kindness for the righteous. It is not enough that she had her child again, and was given a good reward for nursing her child. When the child was weaned, the mother brought her child again to Pharaoh’s daughter who considered the child like her own son. Pharaoh’s daughter kissed him and embraced him. When Pharaoh himself kissed and embraced the child, and played with him as one does with a young child. Moses took the crown from Pharaoh’s head and threw it on the ground. That is to say, it was a hint that the Holy One would cause through Moses that Pharaoh’s crown would be abrogated through Moses later on. She gave him a name and called him Moses because he was drawn out of the water. So had the Holy One given into the mind of Pharaoh’s daughter that she should call him this, and the name remained Moses.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 2:9–10.</i>
When Moses was grown, he went out into the field and saw that the Israelites were working very hard and he was saddened. He saw that one judge used to wake the Hebrews when the rooster crowed, in the middle of the night. That same judge woke a Hebrew and the Hebrew left the house. The judge then slept with that Hebrew’s wife. The wife thought that it was her husband, and she became pregnant from him and gave birth to a son who was an evildoer. He cursed <i>God</i> and he was stoned. When the Hebrew came home he learned what happened and the judge also learned that the Hebrew knew about this. The judge beat the Hebrew at work. Moses knew all this that the judge had slept with his wife and also beaten him. He also saw that from him would come no child who would <i>convert</i> to Judaism. He laid his hands on the judge and killed him with the <i>Ineffable Name of God.</i> He hid him in the sand, so that no person could see him and find him.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Exodus Rabbah,</i> 1.27–29.</i>
The next day, Moses again went out to the field. Two people, <i>Dothan</i> and <i>Abiram</i>, were arguing. Moses came and said: you evildoer, why do you want to beat your friend? From here we learn that when one Jew lifts a hand against his friend, he is an evildoer. Here, nobody had beaten his friend, but had raised their hands to fight. Thus, he called them evildoers. <i>Dothan</i> and <i>Abiram</i> said to Moses. Who made you a <i>judge</i> or a <i>lord</i> over us? Moses was only twelve years old then. Therefore, they said: you are a youth, and you want to be a judge over us? You killed the Egyptian yesterday and buried him in the sand and you want to kill us also. Moses became frightened and said: as long as Israelites are in the <i>Egyptian exile</i> they are <i>informers.</i> They inform for the gentiles. Pharaoh heard about this, since <i>Dothan</i> and <i>Abiram</i> told this to Pharaoh and Pharaoh wanted to kill Moses. However, Moses made himself invisible with the aid of the <i>Ineffable Name of God</i> and they could not see him and he ran away. The Midrash says that they wanted to chop off his head. The sword could not chop his neck and Moses ran away to the land of Midian and sat down at a well.<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Exodus Rabbah,</i> 1.29–31.</i>
Jethro was lord over the land of Midian and Jethro had separated himself from <i>foreign gods.</i> The land <i>excommunicated</i> him and therefore Jethro had nobody to guard his sheep. Therefore, his daughters had to guard his flocks since he had no sons. All the shepherds took away the daughters’ water that they drew to water the flocks. When Moses saw that the shepherds wanted to take away the water from the daughters, Moses helped the daughters get away from the shepherds and watered the flocks. The daughters came to their father. Their father asked: why have you come so early? They said: a man, an Egyptian, helped us. That is to say, the Torah calls him an Egyptian because he killed an Egyptian and that is why he came to Midian. The daughters said: he drew the water and the water came up to him from the well. Therefore, Jethro said: why did you not invite him, so that he would take one of you as a wife. Jethro knew well that Moses must be a descendant of Jacob’s children to whom the water used to rise toward them.<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Exodus Rabbah,</i> 1.32.</i>
“<i>Moses consented</i>” [2:21]. <i>Bahya</i> asks a question. Why did <i>Moses marry</i> Jethro’s daughter? The explanation is that Moses had run away from Pharaoh and was afraid that he would be sought and found. That is why he wanted to <i>marry</i> into a <i>priestly</i> family. The king had no authority over the <i>priests</i>, just like when someone is <i>guilty of the death penalty</i>, he runs to the priests and they cannot do anything to him. He would take a wife from the priests if she converted, in the expectation that they would not give him up, if Pharaoh would search for him. That is why Moses came to Jethro, who had many daughters, in the expectation that he would give him one, since he had so many. This explains the question, why does the verse have to say that he had seven daughters. The explanation is that he had so many daughters, therefore Moses ran there. He thought: he would not deny me a daughter. Moses swore to <i>Jethro</i> that he would not leave the land of <i>Midian</i> without <i>Jethro</i>’<i>s</i> knowledge.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 2:21.</i>
Jethro gave his daughter as a wife to Moses and she was called <i>Zipporah.</i> She was called <i>Zipporah</i> because she, just like a bird runs quickly, so <i>Zipporah</i> ran quickly to Moses. Another explanation of why she was called <i>Zipporah</i> is that she shined like the morning star; she was beautiful.<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Exodus, 2:21.</i>
“<i>He named him Gershom</i>” [2:22]. <i>Zipporah</i> was pregnant and she gave birth to a son. She called him <i>Gershom.</i> That is to say, Moses was a stranger in a foreign land.
“<i>The king of Egypt died</i>” [2:23]. The king of Egypt became leprous and every day he slaughtered one hundred Israelite children and bathed in their blood.<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Exodus, 2:23.</i> Therefore the Israelites were mourning and the Holy One heard their great outcry. He thought about <i>Abraham, Isaac and Jacob</i>, who were very pious.
“<i>Moses was tending the flocks</i>” [3:1]. The <i>custom</i> of all the <i>righteous ones</i> was to tend flocks in the <i>wilderness</i>, in the expectation that they would remove themselves from people. When one is among people, many transgressions come from <i>gossip, envy, slander</i> and <i>encroaching on the property of others.</i> Therefore, it is written, “<i>into the wilderness</i>” [3:1]. That is to say, he did not want to feed his flocks in the fields of others. The sages say that Moses was in Egypt for forty years, forty years in Midian, and forty years in the desert. Similarly, <i>Rabbi Akiva</i> was in business for forty years, forty years he studied and for forty years he taught at his <i>academy.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 3:1.</i>
When Moses came to Mount <i>Horeb</i>, where the Torah would be given, the Shekhinah appeared as a fire. The fire was on the thorn bush and the thorn bush was not burned. Hizkuni and Bahya write. Why did the Holy One appear through fire? This was in the expectation that he would become accustomed to seeing fire, so that when he would come to Mount <i>Sinai</i> there would be much fire when the Torah would be given.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 3:1; Hizkuni, Exodus, 3:2.</i>
Why on a thorn bush? The Holy One said that when Israel will be in exile, it is like I am also in exile. Therefore, the Holy One appeared on a thorn bush, which sticks when one touches it.<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Exodus Rabbah</i>, 2.5.</i>
Moses said: I will see why the thorn bush is not burnt. The Holy One said to him: Moses, Moses. Moses responded: here I am. The Holy One said to him: remove your shoes; the earth on which you are standing is holy. You, Moses, must go barefoot. Why did he say, Moses, Moses, twice? The explanation is that the voice from Heaven is very strong. The person thought that there were two voices. Another explanation is that he had to talk twice, since the first time the Heavenly shout frightens the person. Therefore, he had to call the same person a second time.<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 3:4.</i>
“<i>I am the God of your father</i>” [3:6]. He said: I am the God of your father <i>Amram.</i> He showed that his father <i>Amram</i> had died. When one does not mention the name of the Holy One in connection with a person, they are still alive, but only when the person has died. Here, the name of the Holy One is mentioned in connection with him. Through this, the Holy One showed that his father <i>Amram</i> had died. The Holy One knew well that Moses would not want to take any position of authority while his father was still alive.<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Exodus, 3:6.</i>
Moses hid his face and was ashamed to speak with God. The <i>Holy One</i> said to <i>Moses:</i> I have seen the great <i>troubles</i> that the Israelites have in <i>Egypt.</i> Therefore, I have come to protect Israel and to bring them to a good land in which honey and milk will flow. Therefore, you Moses must go to Pharaoh to take Israel out of Egypt. Moses responded: who am I that I should go to the king of Egypt? What merit does Israel have that they should go out of Egypt? That is, Moses said: I am lowly and I should speak with a king? Perhaps he will kill me? Who am I that I should take out such an important and understanding people? What if they will want to go out from the heavy labor, but they will not want to go to the land of Canaan? They will fear the strong nations. The Holy One responded to Moses concerning these two things Moses feared. The first thing the Holy One said, I will be with you always. Therefore, do not fear Pharaoh. Concerning what you asked, what <i>merit</i> do they have? They will receive the Torah on the mountain. As the result of this merit, they will go out of the Egyptian exile. The fire that you see should be a sign that you should not be afraid of Pharaoh and Israel should also not fear the strong nations in the land of Canaan. I am God, pure fire, and I will burn them with fire. Moses responded: when Israel will ask, what is the name of the God who will take us out. The Holy One said: I am called <i>Eheye.</i> That is to say, I am always with you in this exile and in other exiles.
“<i>Assemble</i>” [3:16]. Go and assemble the elders of Israel and tell them, the God of your ancestors has sent me to you. He wants to take you out of Egypt.
“<i>I have taken note of you</i>” [3:16]. You should use this language, since Jacob also said, “<i>I have taken note of you</i>” [3:16]. Joseph also said, “<i>When God will take note of you</i>” [Genesis, 50:24]. This means, God will remember you for good. Thus, Israel will believe that God has sent you, when you will mention the word, <i>note.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Exodus, 3:18.</i>
“<i>Manifested Himself to us</i>” [3:18]. Go to Pharaoh and say that the God of the Israelites has appeared and ordered us to go to the desert to bring sacrifices. The Holy One said to Israel: I know well that Pharaoh will not allow you to go, but I must first show him My strong hand, with wonders and plagues. Afterwards, he will send you out of Egypt and I will cause that Israel will have grace in the eyes of Egypt, in the expectation that Israel should borrow gold and silver when they leave Egypt.<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus, 3:18–22.</i>
You will empty Egypt of gold and silver [3:22]. <i>Bahya</i> asks a question here. How appropriate is it that they will loan it and will steal it? The explanation is that the Holy One had said: you should ask and they will give you silver and gold as a gift. I will give your grace in the eyes of Egypt.<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 3:22.</i>
Moses said to the Holy One. Perhaps Israel will not want to believe that I was sent by God. “<i>What is that in your hand</i>” [4:2]? The Holy One said: what do you have in your hand? I know well that it is a staff. I will make a snake from it. Therefore, throw the staff on the ground. Moses threw the staff and it became a snake. Moses ran away; he was afraid of the snake. The Holy One said: grab the tail of the snake. Moses grabbed the snake and the snake became a staff.<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus, 4:1–4.</i>
<i>Rashi</i> writes. The Holy One showed that he had made a snake. That is to say, you Moses say about Israel that they will not believe in God, just like the snake spoke slander against the Holy One.<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Exodus, 4:3.</i>
Then the Holy One said to Moses: put your hand in your bosom. His hand became leprous. That is, the Holy One showed him that whoever speaks slander; he is afflicted with leprosy, like you Moses, who spoke slander against Israel that they will not believe in God.<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Exodus, 4:6.</i> The Holy One said to Moses again. Put your hand in your bosom again. He put it in his bosom again and it was healed as before. The Holy One said to Moses. You should show these two signs before Israel. When they will not believe your first sign, you will say how you became leprous in your hand because you spoke slander about Israel. Then they will believe because they have known for a long time that whoever wants to do evil to Israel, they will be stricken with leprosy. We find that with Pharaoh who took Sarah. He wanted to sleep with her and he became leprous. Similarly, <i>Abimelech</i> who also took Sarah, he also became <i>leprous.</i> If Israel will not believe your two signs, take water from the river and pour it on the earth, and it will become blood.
Moses said to the Holy One. I ask you God; I cannot speak well. Moses had once taken the crown off Pharaoh’s head and thrown it on the ground. The king wanted to have him killed. The astrologers said to the king: we have said that this one will take Israel out of Egypt. Pharaoh put <i>Jethro</i>, <i>Job</i>, and <i>Balaam</i> in charge of the trial. One of them said that he is <i>guilty of the death penalty.</i> The second said that he is a child; he has no <i>intelligence.</i> They brought a bowl with gold and with fire. They said; if the child will take the gold and not the fire, then it will have intelligence. Moses wanted to take the gold, but an angel came and pushed Moses toward the fire. Moses took a burning coal and put it in his mouth and burned his tongue. Therefore, Moses could not speak well. Therefore, Moses said: from my youth I could not speak well and even more so in my old age. Bahya asks a question here. Why did the Holy One not heal Moses? The explanation is that Moses did not pray to the Holy One that He should heal him, in the expectation that Moses would have an excuse that he could not speak well. Therefore, the Holy One should not send him to Pharaoh on his mission.<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 4:10.</i>
“<i>Who gives man speech?</i>” [4:11]. The Holy One responded: You do not want to go because you cannot speak? Who made you speak before Pharaoh? They wanted to kill you because you killed an Egyptian before Pharaoh.
“<i>Who makes him dumb?</i>” [4:11]. Who made Pharaoh dumb, so that he did not immediately have you killed? Or, who made the servants deaf that the servants of Pharaoh did not hear that you should be killed? Or, who made the servants blind so that they did not see that you had run away? The One who did all this can make you speak before Pharaoh. Moses responded: send Aaron, he is more suited to it. Furthermore, I will not lead Israel into the <i>land of Israel</i>, but I will die in the <i>wilderness.</i> Therefore, allow these messengers to go to Pharaoh; those will come to the <i>land of Israel.</i> The Holy One became very angry at Moses that he would not go to Pharaoh, but said to Moses: As a result of this, you will not be a priest, but <i>Aaron</i> your brother will be a priest and you Moses will be a Levite. Therefore, Aaron will also speak for you before Pharaoh. Aaron will come to meet you and will rejoice in his heart. He will not envy you that you are important. Therefore, Aaron merited wearing the <i>breastplate of judgment</i> with only pure <i>precious stones</i> on his heart because he did not envy you in his heart. Therefore, go and tell Aaron everything that I have told you and you should be a master who will give orders to Aaron. Aaron will speak for you before Pharaoh.<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Exodus, 4:11–16.</i> Take the staff with you to do all the signs.
“<i>Moses went back to his father-in-law Jeter</i>” [4:18]. Moses went and asked permission from Jethro, his father-in-law, to go to Egypt. He wanted to see his brothers who were still in Egypt. Jethro said: go in peace. God said to Moses: go to Egypt, Dothan and Abiram, who informed against you, have died. That is, even though Dothan and Abiram were still alive, but they had become very poor and that is like they had died, since when a person is poor it is as if he is dead. They will not be able to <i>gossip.</i> Their words are not accepted because they are poor.<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Exodus, 4:19.</i>
Moses took his wife and child and had them ride on a donkey. This same donkey was the one that Abraham rode on when he wanted to bring Isaac as a sacrifice. When the Messiah will come, the Messiah will ride on that same donkey.<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Exodus, 4:20.</i>
The Holy One said to Moses: when you come to Egypt, you should do all the signs before Pharaoh with the staff that is in your hand. I will strengthen Pharaoh’s heart that he should not send Israel out. When he will not send out Israel, say to Pharaoh: God, who sent me, says, “<i>Israel is my firstborn son</i>” [4:22]. That is to say, you should send my important people Israel to worship Me. If you will not send them, I will kill your son, your firstborn. Even though it was the last plague, yet the Holy One wanted to frighten him with the harshest plague.<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Exodus, 4:23.</i>
“<i>At a night encampment</i>” [4:24]. When Moses was on the way, an angel encountered him and wanted to kill him because he had not circumcised his son Eliezer when he was eight days old. Rabbi Yose said: Heaven forbid. How is it that Moses would not observe the commandment of circumcision with his son Eliezer? The explanation is that Moses said: how should I circumcise my children while I am on the way to Egypt. It is a danger to travel with a wound. Should I wait three days and first circumcise my child before I go on the journey? I do not want to delay the journey. Here one asks a question. Why did the angel want to kill Moses Our Teacher when he was not guilty? The explanation is that Moses came to an inn on the journey. He took care of his needs and put the circumcision aside. Therefore, the angel came and wanted to kill Moses. Bahya asks a question here. The angel came and swallowed Moses from his head to his place of circumcision. Then he swallowed him from his feet to his place of circumcision. Then <i>Zipporah</i> understood that this was because of the circumcision. She immediately took a flint stone and circumcised the child. Then the angel ran away. Why did Moses himself not circumcise the child? <i>Rabbenu Hananel</i> said: Moses was not there and the angel did not swallow Moses, but the angel swallowed the child. However, Rashi writes that Moses was there and the angel swallowed him, but Moses was sick. That is why he could not circumcise the child, but Zipporah his wife had to circumcise the child.<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 4:24.</i>
Bahya writes because it is written here, “<i>He let him alone</i>” [4:26]; this means that the angel left him alone. However, it is not written, <i>and He went.</i> This teaches us that the angel did not go away. He saw that Zipporah had only done the circumcision, but had not done the <i>uncovering of the corona.</i> Therefore, the angel waited until Zipporah also uncovered the corona of the child. Therefore, the verse says, “<i>a bridegroom of blood because of the circumcision</i>” [4:26]. That is, two <i>circumcisions.</i> The first is the circumcision and the second is to uncover the corona.<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 4:26.</i>
The Midrash says that the child was circumcised with a flint stone and not a knife. In previous times the custom was to circumcise with a flint stone. However, when <i>King David</i> came to kill the Philistine, King David had a stone in his hand and in his sling, wanting to kill the Philistine. The Philistine had an iron hat on his head and the stone could not enter it. The angel who was appointed over stones came and said to the angel who was over iron. Let the stone go through your iron. That is to say, allow your iron that is on the Philistine’s head to split, so that the stone should hit the head of the Philistine. Thus, I will cause the children to be circumcised with iron. I will forego the honor that they used to do with a stone. From then on, they began to circumcise with a knife, because of what the iron accomplished concerning the Philistine.<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Torah Shelemah</i>, Exodus 4:25, note 153, cites this midrash and quotes <i>Yalkut Shimoni</i> as the source. However, I have not been able to find it in <i>Yalkut Shimoni.</i></i>
“<i>Go to meet Moses</i>” [4:27]. The Holy One said to Aaron: go to Moses. Aaron went to him and kissed Moses. Moses told him all the signs that the Holy One had shown him. They assembled the elders and performed the signs with the staff. The Israelites believed that the Holy One had sent Moses to redeem them from the <i>Egyptian exile.</i> The people prostrated themselves and bowed over the good <i>news.</i>
The elders separated themselves. They were afraid to go to Pharaoh, but <i>Moses</i> and <i>Aaron</i> went alone. Therefore, the elders did not merit to go up Mount Sinai with Moses, but Moses went alone.<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Exodus, 5:1.</i>
Moses and Aaron said to Pharaoh. The God of Israel has told the Israelites that they should have a <i>holiday</i> in the wilderness. Pharaoh responded: I do not know your God. The Midrash says that Pharaoh had a book in which was inscribed all the <i>foreign gods.</i> Therefore, Pharaoh said: in my book the name of your God is not found.<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 5:2.</i>
Bahya writes. Pharaoh was very wise. He knew each angel that ruled over each land and he said: the name of your God has no land on the earth associated with him that He should rule over. However, he did not know that the Holy One rules over all the kings who rule over the whole world. Our sages gave a parable. A priest has a servant who is a fool. The priest goes away and the servant wants to find his master. The servant goes to a <i>cemetery</i> and shouts, is my master here? People respond to him: is not your master a priest? The servant says, yes he is a priest. The people say to him. You fool, how does a priest come to a <i>cemetery?</i> So too, Moses said to Pharaoh. Your <i>foreign gods</i> are all <i>dead</i> and corpses. However, our God lives eternally and is a king over all the kings. Pharaoh said: what does your God know? Moses responded: He created heaven and earth, makes rain fall and makes everything grow on the earth. He makes kings on the earth and He deposes kings on the earth. Pharaoh responded: I am the lord of the earth and I have created myself. Therefore, who is your God? The Holy One said: because Pharaoh makes himself so important with the river water, therefore, you Moses should turn the water of the Nile river to blood. Furthermore, Pharaoh said: I am not obligated to hear the words of your God. He has not appeared to me, but to <i>Abimelech.</i> He took Sarah and your God appeared to him at night. However, your God has not appeared to me and because I do not know Him, I do not want to hear his words.<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 5:2.</i>
They said to Pharaoh: let us go. The Holy One will punish you with plagues and with the sword. Pharaoh said to Moses. You should not disturb the people in their work. All of Israel are hearing you talk and do not work as a result.<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Exodus, 5:4.</i>
“<i>Get to your labors</i>” [5:4]. Pharaoh said to Moses and Aaron: go home to your work and do not disturb Israel from their work. However, Pharaoh did not tell Moses and Aaron to work, since the <i>tribe of Levi</i> was exempt from the work. Pharaoh had said: let the tribe of Levi teach Torah to Israel and let them show you proper laws and ordinances.<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 5:4.</i>
<i>Hizkuni</i> writes. Therefore, the tribe of Levi did not work at first when Pharaoh himself worked with the people, in the expectation that Israel would work quickly. Thus, Israel worked with Pharaoh and the tribe of Levi did not want to work. Jacob their father had commanded that the tribe of Levi had commanded that they not carry his coffin when he died, because the tribe of Levi would carry the Ark with the Tablets and other holy vessels. It was not appropriate to carry the coffin of dead people; that of Jacob. Therefore, the tribe of Levi did not want to work with Pharaoh the first day. Pharaoh also did not force them to work and thereafter left them without having to work.<sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Exodus, 5:4.</i>
“<i>That same day Pharaoh charged the taskmasters</i>” [5:6]. Pharaoh said to Moses and Aaron. You are disturbing Israel from their work. Therefore, you are causing that no more straw will be given to you to mix in with the clay. You must collect the straw yourselves, and the <i>amount</i> of bricks that you have to make every day is the same as you used to make, in the expectation that the work will be harder for you. Thus, you will not talk about going to the <i>desert festival</i>, but Israel spread out to collect straw and the taskmasters hit the Israelite foremen, who were placed over Israel that they should work. They said: finish your work. The <i>foremen</i> were Israelites and when they counted the bricks and when Israel did not finish the amount, the taskmasters beat the foremen. They said: why did you not force Israel to finish the proper amount of bricks?
The foremen allowed themselves to be beaten. Therefore, they merited to be the seventy <i>elders</i> and were the <i>Sanhedrin</i> over Israel, because the foremen did not beat the Israelites to force them to work.<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Exodus, 5:14.</i>
“<i>Now the foremen of the Israelites found themselves in trouble</i>” [5:19]. The foremen saw that the Israelites must work very hard and they were not given any straw and had to fill the <i>quota</i> of bricks every day. The foremen encountered Moses and Aaron when they were leaving Pharaoh. They said to them. God should judge you for making the work harder. Moses again went to God and said: “<i>why did you bring harm</i>” [5:22]? Why did you harm Israel and the shouting is about me? Because I am the <i>messenger</i> of God, Pharaoh has now made the work much harder than previously and he does not want to allow Israel to leave.
God said to Moses, “<i>you shall soon see</i>” [6:1]. That is, you are not like Abraham to whom I said, your <i>primary descendant</i> will be Isaac, and afterwards, when Isaac was thirty-seven years old, I said to Abraham. Take your son Isaac and slaughter him as a sacrifice. Abraham did not question it. He wanted to slaughter Isaac very quickly. However, you Moses speak much about My deeds. Therefore, you will see what signs I will do to Pharaoh, but you will not see the signs that I will do to thirty-one kings when Joshua will lead the <i>Israelites</i> to the <i>land of Israel.</i> However, you Moses will not be there.<sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Exodus, 6:1.</i>
Bahya writes. “<i>Why did you bring harm</i>” [5:22]? How is it that things are going badly for Israel? Pharaoh and his whole people, who are all evildoers, are doing well and Israel is having great <i>troubles. Troubles</i> come to two types of people. One is people that God punishes for their transgressions that they did. The other one that God punishes is the righteous one, in the expectation that he will have it good in the next world. Therefore, Moses asked: for what reason is it going badly for Israel? The Holy One responded, “<i>you shall soon see</i>” [6:1]. That is to say, you will soon see the catastrophe and plagues on Pharaoh and his people, the evildoers. Their joy will soon end and therefore, I have made the work of Israel very hard, in the expectation that their reward should be doubled when they will suffer the troubles with love. I want to punish Pharaoh for his transgressions. So as it was with the <i>redemption from</i> Egypt, so too will it be with the redemption from Egypt, so too will it be with the <i>redemption from this exile</i> that you are having in <i>Edom</i>, where the exile is lengthy and is worse every day with <i>false accusations.</i> Here God will also reward us double in the end when we will be redeemed with love. God will punish the nations much more for their sins that they committed against us in this great exile.<sup class="footnote-marker">83</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 5:22.</i>

Vaera

“<i>I appeared to Abraham</i>” [6:3]. God said: I appeared to <i>Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.</i> I told them that My name is <i>Shaddai</i> and did not tell them that My name is <i>YHVH.</i> Even with the name <i>Shaddai</i> I kept My promise and gave them what I promised. How much more so with the name <i>YHVH</i>, will I keep My promise? Therefore, go and tell Israel that I will keep My oath that I swore to their ancestors and I will take Israel out of Egypt.
Bahya writes. The verse here uses four terms, “<i>I will free you</i>,” “<i>I will deliver you</i>,” “<i>I will redeem you</i>,” “<i>I will take you</i>” [6:6–7]. This teaches us that the Holy One promised Israel four ways. The first was that they would be free from their masters. The second is that they would be separated far from their masters. The third is that He would split the <i>sea.</i> The fourth is that He would give the Torah. Therefore, it says about the first that they would be free from their masters. “<i>I will free you from the labors</i>” [6:6]. They will be free from work. They will be in Egypt and not have to work for six months, as our sages say. The Israelites stopped working on <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> and the redemption from Egypt was on the fifteenth day of <i>Nisan.</i> The second was that they went out from the authority of their masters in <i>Nisan.</i> Therefore, it says, “<i>I delivered you from your bondage</i>” [6:6]. I will protect them from their work. The third is to split the sea. Concerning this it says, “<i>I will redeem you</i>” [6:6]. That is, all the people. Since, as long as the master by whom the slave was in servitude lives, he remains afraid of the master, that he would capture him again. However, here when the <i>sea</i> was split, <i>all of Israel</i> saw that their masters were drowned, and the <i>sea</i> threw them out. Each Israelite saw that his master was dead and the Israelites were happy. This was the proper <i>redemption.</i> Concerning this it says, “<i>I will redeem you</i>” [6:6]. The fourth is that He would give the Torah to Israel. Concerning this it says, “<i>I will take you to be My people</i>” [6:7]. That is to say, with the giving of the Torah Israel were the people of the Holy One. They would serve Him and no other god.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 6:6.</i>
“<i>For a possession</i>” [6:8]. The Holy One said: I have raised my hand to swear that I will give the land of Israel to Israel. “<i>Possession</i>,” I give the land as your inheritance. Bahya asks a question here. Why is it written, <i>possession</i> and not <i>inheritance?</i> This teaches us that the Israelites will die in the wilderness, but their children will live and inherit it.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 6:8.</i>
“<i>They would not listen to Moses</i>” [6:9]. Moses came to the Israelites and said to them. I have come to take you out of this exile. The Israelites did not listen to Moses. They had great troubles with the work. They could not catch their breath because of the great amount of work. The Holy One said to Moses. Go to Pharaoh: let him send Israel out of Egypt. Moses responded: How should I go to Pharaoh when the Israelites will not listen to what I say to them? How should Pharaoh listen to my words to allow Israel to go? Even though it was good news for Israel to take them out, yet they did not want to listen to me. How should Pharaoh listen to my words?
God again commanded Moses that he should go to Pharaoh and said: show respect for the king, even if he is an evildoer. Further, it is just to honor a king, even if he is a gentile king. The Holy One commanded Moses that he should not be very angry at Israel.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Exodus, 6:13.</i>
“<i>The following are the heads of their respective clans</i>” [6:14]. Since the time had come to redeem Israel, that is why the verse lists each one according to his <i>pedigree.</i> That is, they are not like the <i>Egyptians</i> who have no <i>pedigree.</i> He gives their pedigree because he wants to say how Moses and Aaron are important, from their mother and father. Therefore, he must list them from Reuben until he comes to Levi.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 6:14.</i>
The verse says that Levi was one hundred and thirty seven years old. This teaches us that as long as one of the twelve tribes still lived, Pharaoh did not make the Israelites work. This was until Levi died; then the exile began. Levi lived much longer than all of his brothers. Therefore, the verse tells us that Levi was one hundred and thirty seven years old, since the exile began then.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Exodus, 6:16.</i>
“<i>Sister of Nahshon</i>” [6:23]. The verse tells us that Aaron married <i>Elisheva</i>, the daughter of <i>Aminadav.</i> Her brother’s name was <i>Nahshon.</i> This teaches us that when somebody wants to marry a wife, one should see what kind of brother she has, since the children take after the wife’s brother.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Exodus, 6:23.</i>
“<i>It is the same Aaron and Moses</i>” [6:26]. The verse sometimes mentions Aaron first. It wants to teach us that Aaron was also <i>important</i>, just like Moses, since he was older than Moses. Moses was much more important than Aaron with regard to prophecy.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 6:26.</i>
“<i>See, I am of impeded speech</i>” [6:30]. The Holy One said to Moses, go to Pharaoh. Moses said: I cannot speak; my lips are stopped up. Bahya asks a question. It is written, “<i>the Lord spoke to both Moses and Aaron in regard to the Israelites and Pharaoh king of Egypt</i>” [6:13]. There, Moses did not say that he could not speak. The explanation is because God had said to Moses and Aaron together, that they should say. Therefore, Moses was silent. He thought that perhaps Aaron would speak before Pharaoh, but here the Holy One said to Moses alone, go to Pharaoh. Therefore, Moses said that he was not the man who could speak; he had a bad tongue.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 6:30.</i>
<i>Hizkuni</i> asks a question. Why did the Holy One give such an important person who was descended from a man that the Torah would forbid to marry such a wife? Amram married his aunt, Yocheved, and they had Moses, Aaron and Miriam as children. The explanation is that Moses and Aaron were born from such people so that others should be able to throw before them, when they hold themselves above Israel, one could say to them, you were born from a man who married his aunt.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Exodus, 6:20.</i>
Here one asks a question. Why may a woman take her uncle as a husband and a man may not marry his aunt? The explanation is that the husband rules over his wife. Therefore, when a man would marry his aunt, perhaps he would beat her, as is customary among men. It is a sin for someone to beat his aunt. However, a woman may marry her uncle, since if he would beat her sometimes when she deserves it, this is no sin.
“<i>It shall turn into a serpent</i>” [7:9]. The Holy One said to Moses. If Pharaoh would desire a sign from you, take the staff and throw it before Pharaoh and it will become a snake. Bahya asks here. Why did it become a snake and not something else? The explanation is that Pharaoh is compared to the snake that spoke ill about the Holy One and caused <i>Adam</i> to sin. So too was Pharaoh who said, who is God that I should listen to Him? Therefore, the Holy One ordered them to make a snake. That is to say, Pharaoh will also be paid his reward as the snake was paid. Just like a snake is always crooked and is never straight, so too is Pharaoh who never keeps his word. Once he says that he will send Israel, when the plague hurts him. As soon as the plague was ended, he retracted and did not want to send Israel.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 7:10.</i>
“<i>In the presence of Pharaoh and his courtiers</i>” [7:10]. Aaron took his staff and threw it before Pharaoh and his courtiers. It became a snake and Pharaoh sent for his magicians to also make snakes with magic. The Holy One made Aaron’s snake a staff again. The staff swallowed all the magician’s snakes.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Exodus, 7:12.</i> This was a hint that the Egyptians would be swallowed up by the sea later on through the Israelites.
Bahya writes. The verse says, “<i>they turned into serpents</i>” [7:12]. That is to say, the magicians made as if they made snakes from the staffs. However, the truth is that they could not make snakes, but they made the people blind and they thought that they made snakes.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 7:12.</i>
“<i>Pharaoh</i>’<i>s heart stiffened</i>” [7:13]. Pharaoh’s heart strengthened and he did not want to send out Israel.
“<i>Go to Pharaoh</i>” [7:15]. The Holy One said: go to Pharaoh early in the morning. You will find him by the water. Pharaoh made himself to be a god. He said that he eats and drinks and does not need to excrete. Therefore, he went every morning to the Nile and excreted there, where no person would see him.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Exodus, 7:15.</i> Therefore, the Holy One said to Moses: go early to the water and there you will find Pharaoh. Say to him that he should send Israel out. I know well that he will not send them out until I will punish him with the plague of the <i>firstborn.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Exodus, 7:16.</i>
Tell him that I will hit the water with the staff and they will become blood, and the fish in the water will be killed. They will make the water stink and you will not be able to drink it. The Holy One said to <i>Moses:</i> Go to <i>Aaron</i> that he should take the staff and should hold it over the water. The water in all the rivers and lakes will turn to blood and in all the wooden and stone vessels the water will also become blood. Why did Aaron hit the water and not Moses? Since the water did not do anything to Moses when he was thrown into the water, therefore he was not supposed to hit the water.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Exodus Rabbah,</i> 9.10.</i>
Similarly by the frogs, Moses also did not bring the plague, but it came through Aaron. This is because frogs come from the water. Moses did not bring any plague that came from the water.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Exodus Rabbah,</i> 10.4.</i>
Similarly, the lice that came from the earth. Moses was not supposed to cause this, because the earth protected Moses when he buried the Egyptian that he killed. The earth hid him and did not inform on him.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Exodus Rabbah,</i> 10.7.</i>
Bahya asks a question. Where did the magicians take the water that they used to make blood from water before Pharaoh, if all the water had become blood through Moses and Aaron’s plague? The explanation is that they got the water out of the earth and made blood from it. The plague of Moses and Aaron was only on the water that had been drawn and was ready to drink. However, the water under the earth did not become blood and that is how the magicians made blood.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 7:22.</i> Hizkuni also writes the same thing.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Exodus, 7:20.</i>
“<i>The water stank</i>” [7:21]. The water stank, the fish died, and the Egyptians could not drink the water from the river. They dug up other water to drink.
“<i>When seven days had passed</i>” [7:25]. When the seven days of the plague had passed, Pharaoh did not want to send Israel Each plague lasted for seven days, just like a woman is <i>menstrual impurity</i> for seven days. Pharaoh had twenty-one days of rest before the next plague came upon him. During that period, Moses warned about the plague that was to come.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 7:25.</i>
“<i>Your whole country with frogs</i>” [7:27]. The Holy One said to Moses: Tell Pharaoh that because he will not allow Israel to leave, I will punish your land with frogs. Your house and rooms and your bed, by your nobles and slaves equally. So too, in your oven and in the dough that you bake for bread.
Bahya writes. The <i>king of Egypt</i> had a dispute with the <i>king of Ethiopia.</i> The <i>king of Egypt</i> said to the <i>king of Ethiopia:</i> you have taken away my land. The <i>king of Ethiopia</i> said the same. However, when the frogs came to the land of Egypt, they saw how far the land of Egypt extended. There were frogs in the whole land of Egypt up to the border of the land of <i>Ethiopia.</i> From then on, there was peace between the two kings.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 7:27.</i>
“<i>The frogs shall come up on you</i>” [7:29]. The frogs came into the bowels of the people and croaked inside their bodies.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Exodus, 7:29.</i>
“<i>The frogs came up</i>” [8:2]. One large frog came out of the water and Aaron beat all the frogs out of that one frog.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Exodus, 8:2.</i> The whole land became full of frogs from that one frog. The magicians also brought up frogs from the water. Pharaoh said to Moses and Aaron. Pray to God that He should take away the frogs and I will send Israel out. Moses said: when do you need me that I should pray and for which people to remove the frogs that they should only remain in the lakes? Pharaoh said: pray today that the frogs should leave tomorrow.
Bahya, Ramban, and Hizkuni ask. Why did Pharaoh not desire that the frogs should be removed that day? Instead he ordered that the frogs should be removed the same day. The explanation is that Pharaoh thought to himself, perhaps today is the day the frogs are supposed to leave by themselves. Therefore, I will tell him that he should remove the frogs tomorrow. Perhaps Moses will be a liar and they will go away before he has prayed. From then on, Pharaoh always said tomorrow. Moses also spoke about tomorrow to remove the plagues.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 8:5; Ramban, Exodus, 8:6; Hizkuni, Exodus, 8:6.</i>
<i>Hizkuni</i> and <i>Baal ha-Turim</i> write that Moses prayed that all the frogs should die. However, the frogs that were in the oven ran into the fire, where the Holy One had sent them. Because they went into the fire through the command of the Holy One, these frogs remained alive and emerged from the fire alive and back to their original home in the water.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Exodus, 8:9; Baal ha-Turim, Exodus, 8:1.</i> From here we learn that one who <i>sanctifies the Name</i> [of God], for the sake of God, comes into eternal life.
<i>Imre Noam</i> asks a question. It is written, “<i>the frogs died</i>” [8:9]. All the frogs died and Moses said to Pharaoh, “<i>the frogs shall retreat</i>” [8:7]. The frogs will be removed. The explanation is that the frogs that were inside the bodies of people would be removed alive from their stomach. Also, the frogs that were in the house of the king they left alive, <i>out of respect for Pharaoh.</i> However, elsewhere all the frogs died.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Imre Noam, Exodus, 8:9.</i>
“<i>Moses cried out to the Lord</i>” [8:8]. Moses prayed and cried out to God. <i>Imre Noam</i> asks a question. Why did <i>Moses</i> have to cry out loud at this <i>plague?</i> The explanation is because Moses had said to Pharaoh, “<i>you may have this triumph over me</i>” [8:5]. Boast about me when I will remove the frogs. Therefore, because he was arrogant, the Holy One did not accept his prayer immediately and he had to cry out loudly.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Imre Noam, Exodus, 8:8.</i> From here we learn that one does not have to shout loudly in order to pray.
<i>Rabbi Isserl</i> writes. The plague of blood was in wooden vessels and in stone vessels, but in iron vessels, even though there was water in it, it did not become blood. This teaches also us that when the equinox comes, one should put some iron into the water and the equinox will not harm it, just like in Egypt where the plague of blood did not occur in iron vessels.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Be’ure Maharai, Exodus, 7:19.</i>
“<i>It will turn to lice</i>” [8:12]. The Holy One said to Moses. Since Pharaoh does not want to send out Israel, say to Aaron that he should take the staff and hit the earth, so that many lice should come out in Egypt. Aaron did the hitting and not Moses because the earth had kept the Egyptian that Moses had killed and buried in the earth. Thus, Moses was protected by it.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Exodus, 8:12.</i>
Pharaoh and his <i>magicians</i> also wanted to make lice and they could not, because the <i>demons</i> do not have power over something that is smaller than a barley grain. Bahya writes. With the blood the magicians could also imitate it because it was not a new creation, since the water had already been created, and they only turned the water to blood. The frogs had also been created and they only caused them to come out of the water onto the land of Egypt. The magicians could imitate this, but the lice were a new creation that the magicians could not make. Therefore, the magicians recognized and said that this came from God. We cannot imitate this. Therefore, the Egyptians held the magicians in low esteem from then on. Pharaoh no longer called them at the other plagues. The lice were on the people and they livestock in the whole land of Egypt.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 8:14–15.</i>
“<i>The insects</i>” [8:17]. The Holy One said to Moses. Since Pharaoh does not want to send out my people Israel and has strengthened his heart, therefore I will send <i>wild animals</i> into their houses in the whole land of Egypt.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Exodus, 8:17, reinterprets the term as wild animals.</i> However, in <i>Goshen</i> where the Israelites live, the <i>wild animals</i> will not come there.
Bahya writes. When an earthly king wants to do something bad to his enemy, he keeps it as secret, so that his enemy should not guard against it. However, the Holy One does everything, first informing Pharaoh about each plague he cannot hide from the Holy One.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 8:18.</i>
“<i>A distinction between My people and your people</i>” [8:19]. The Holy One said: the wild animals will harm livestock and people. When an Israelite will go into the land of Egypt where the wild animals will be, no Israelite will be touched.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 8:19.</i>
“<i>Go and sacrifice to your God</i>” [8:21]. Pharaoh said to Moses and Aaron. Go and offer <i>sacrifices.</i> Therefore, Moses said: should we slaughter the sheep, which are your gods and whom you worship? The Egyptians will want to stone us. Therefore, we must go into the wilderness, far from Egypt, so that the Egyptians should not see that we are slaughtering their gods. Pharaoh responded: I will send you, but do not go very far, and pray for me. Moses responded: when I will leave you I will pray to God that He should remove the wild animals tomorrow. You should not think that the <i>wild animals</i> would be removed by themselves. However, Pharaoh, do not go back on your words.
“<i>He removed the swarm of insects</i>” [8:27]. He prayed and God removed the <i>wild animals. Bahya</i> asks a question. Why did the Holy One allow the wild animals to run away? Why did He not kill them, like He killed the frogs? The explanation is that He killed the frogs because they stank and made the whole land disgusting, in the expectation that this would hurt them. However, if he had killed the <i>wild animals</i>, then they would have had good fur skins, among them fox skins, wolf skins, and other such skins. Therefore, the Holy One allowed all the animals to run away again into the wilderness, in the expectation that they would have no benefit from them.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 8:27.</i>
<i>Hizkuni</i> writes. The <i>magicians</i> could not imitate the lice, since the earth was full of lice. Since the earth was full of lice, a person had to stand only on lice. One could not touch the earth because of the lice. When the magician does not stand on the earth, he cannot perform any magic.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Exodus, 8:14.</i>
“<i>This time also</i>” [8:28]. He made Pharaoh’s heart hard and he did not want to send out Israel. Bahya asks a question. Why did it say, “<i>This time also</i>” [8:28] by the plague of the wild animals? The explanation is that by the first three plagues, that is <i>blood, frogs, lice</i>, the magicians came and hardened Pharaoh’s heart. However, by the wild animals, the magicians did not come since they saw by the lice that they could not make it and said, it is all from the Holy One. Therefore, the verse says that the magicians did not harden Pharaoh’s heart during [the plague of] wild animals, but Pharaoh hardened his own heart.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 8:28.</i>
“<i>The hand of the Lord will strike your livestock</i>” [9:3]. The Holy One said to Moses. Go to Pharaoh, and if he does not want to send Israel, I will kill all of his livestock in the field. Bahya writes. He says on the field because all the animals used to be out in the field. However, in any event, even in the livestock in the Egyptian houses were killed.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 9:3.</i>
Ramban writes. He says on the field because the Egyptians kept their livestock in the fields, since they thought that they were gods. It is not right to keep them close to the people in the city. That is why they kept the flocks far from the city, close to the land of Goshen where the Israelites lived. The Israelite flocks were also close to the flocks of the Egyptians. Similarly, even though the Egyptian livestock were killed and the livestock of the Israelites were not killed. Pharaoh sent and checked that none of the Israelite cattle were killed. Yet, he still made himself hard and did not send Israel from his land.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban, Exodus, 9:3.</i>
“<i>Soot from the kiln</i>” [9:8]. The Holy One said to Moses and Aaron. Take your hands and fill them with ashes from the kiln. Throw it up toward the sky before Pharaoh. From this dust will be formed <i>boils</i> on the people and the animals. A miracle occurred that Aaron and Moses each took a handful of ash. Afterwards, Moses took two handfuls of the same ash in one hand and threw them into the sky. This was also a <i>miracle</i> that one cannot throw it high or with strength, since it immediately flies away. However, here Moses threw the ash with strength toward the sky.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Exodus, 9:8.</i>
“<i>The Lord stiffened the heart of Pharaoh</i>” [9:12]. <i>Bahya</i> asks a question. Why is it written here, “<i>The Lord stiffened</i>” [9:12], and concerning the earlier plagues it is written, “<i>The Lord stiffened</i>” [9:12], that God strengthened his heart? The explanation is that with the first plagues the magicians came and made Pharaoh’s heart strong. However, here with the plague of boils, the magicians were full of boils and were ashamed to go to Pharaoh’s house with boils. Therefore, it is written here, “<i>The Lord stiffened.</i>” That is, the Holy One strengthened the heart of Pharaoh.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 9:12.</i>
Rashi asks a question. The verse says that the boils were on the livestock, but where did the Egyptians have livestock? They had all been killed as was written previously. The explanation is that some Egyptians feared the Holy One and took their livestock from the field and into their houses. These remained alive and now the boils came on these livestock.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Exodus, 9:10.</i>
“<i>All My plagues</i>” [9:14]. The Holy One said to Moses: go and say to Pharaoh. If he will not send out Israel, then I, the Holy One, will destroy all of his trees and grain in the fields. I will send large hail. I will break all the trees and grain. Therefore, go and gather all your livestock from the fields and the people from the field, so that the hail should not kill them.
Bahya asks a question here. All the livestock were killed, as is written above. The explanation is that the Egyptians bought livestock from other nations. These livestock were now out in the fields. Another explanation is that Israelites had livestock together with gentiles and these livestock remained alive during the first <i>plague of lice.</i> Therefore, the verse says here that the same livestock should now be ingathered because of the hail.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 9:19.</i>
However, in any event one can ask a question. Why were the same livestock killed by the hail when an Israelite had a share in the same animal? The explanation is that the Holy One had given a <i>warning</i> here by the hail, that the animals should be brought into the house, in the expectation that the Israelite’s animals should not be killed; those that they owned in <i>partnership</i> with the gentiles.
Bahya writes. The hail destroyed all the trees and fire also came out of the hail. This fire burned all the roots in the earth. Even though the hail was water, yet the hail did not extinguish the fire. It is a parable. A king has two noblemen who hated each other. It happened once that the king went to war and needed these two nobles. The king made peace between these two noblemen. So too, the Holy One makes peace between his angels. <i>Michael</i> is appointed over water and <i>Gabriel</i> is appointed over fire. They are together in heaven and the Holy One makes peace between them. The hail broke and burned all the vegetation on the earth, barley and flax, also the livestock, and the people on the earth. However, in the land of Goshen, where the Israelites were, there was no hail.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 9:14.</i>
Pharaoh sent for Moses and Aaron and said: God in heaven is right. He and his people are evildoers because they do not send out Israel. Therefore, Pharaoh said to Moses and Aaron, ask that the great thunder and fire and hail that are here, should end. I want to send out Israel. Moses said: when I will leave the city, I will pray that the hail and fire should cease, in the expectation that you should know that God in heaven is a God over all the gods. Moses left the city because there were many foreign gods in the city. Therefore, he did not want to pray in the city.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Exodus, 9:29.</i>
Hizkuni asks a question. Why did Moses give a warning, here by the hail, that they should gather the livestock. With the pestilence above, all the livestock in the fields were killed and the Holy One did not order that the livestock should be gathered into the cities. The explanation is that the hail killed people and animals. Therefore, the Holy One ordered that the flocks and people be brought home. However, with the <i>pestilence</i>, only the cattle were killed. Therefore, they did not order that the cattle should be gathered into the houses.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Exodus, 9:19.</i>
Hizkuni also writes. That is why he went outside the city to pray. He wanted to show that even when there was still great hail and fire in the fields, yet Moses was not afraid and went to pray in the field.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Exodus, 9:29.</i>
Bahya writes. Why did Moses raise his hands to pray by the hail, more than by other prayers? The explanation is that the hail and thunder killed people and livestock. There was a great outcry among the people. Therefore, he prayed fervently and raised his hands.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 9:14.</i>
“<i>The Lord sent thunder and hail</i>” [9:23]. The thunder came first and killed the people and afterwards the hail came.
“<i>No rain came pouring down upon the earth</i>” [9:33]. The hail did not reach the ground. Bahya writes. The hail remained hanging between heaven and earth for forty-one years until Joshua came and waged war with thirty-one kings. The same hail came and killed the people of the thirty-one kings. The thunder and the great shout remained hanging under heaven until Elisha came and the king of Aram came against Samaria with a great multitude to capture the city of Samaria. The Holy One released this thunder upon the people of the king of Aram. They ran away from their tents before Samaria and the Israelites took all their goods.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 9:33.</i>
“<i>He reverted to his guilty ways</i>” [9:34]. The evildoer wants to stop his troubles, so he is pious and praises God. As soon as the trouble goes away from him, he is again evil. However, the righteous ones always make themselves humble. Therefore, they are always honored, as the verse says, “<i>a humble man will obtain honor</i>” [Proverbs, 29:23].<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 9:34.</i>

Bo

“<i>Go to Pharaoh</i>” [10:1]. <i>King Solomon, of blessed memory</i>, said. “<i>Happy is the man who is anxious always</i>” [Proverbs, 28:14]. Happy is the man who is anxious always, with all of his deeds, so that no evil comes from it. Therefore, the verse says “<i>man.</i>” That is to say, it is good for man who is created from the earth. It is similarly good that he has his intelligence and always thinks to do the good, like when he wants to eat and drink. His intention should be that he wants to give pleasure to his body, but his intention should be that the body should be strong to serve the Holy One. “<i>He who hardens his heart falls into misfortune</i>” [Proverbs, 28:14]. He who hardens his heart against God, he falls into much evil. When Pharaoh hardened his heart against God, many bad troubles befell him. Since he made his heart hard himself at first, therefore the Holy One also made his heart hard, in the expectation that He would punish him for his evil. Where the person wants to go, there is he led by the Holy One. If it is for good, then God helps him. If he wants to do evil, God also helps him, in the expectation that he will punish him.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, <i>Bo</i> Introduction.</i>
Therefore, the Holy One said to Moses, “<i>Go to Pharaoh</i>” [10:1]. Come to Pharaoh and <i>warn</i> him, how long will he not send Israel and does not want to recognize the wonders that I do, and does not want to be humble before Me? Therefore, I will send locusts that will cover the whole earth and will eat all the trees and everything that grows in the ground. Your houses will be full so that your parents have never seen such a large number of locusts on the earth.
Bahya writes. The Holy One had <i>warned</i> Pharaoh once at the water; since he made himself important and said that he created the water. He warned him the next time in his house. He held himself very high and boasted that he had a beautiful house. Therefore, the Holy One warned him in these two places and made him humble. The same thing happened with <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i> who made himself a god. The Holy One made him humble. He became a cow for seven years and ran around in the wilderness and ate grass like a cow.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 10:1.</i>
Bahya writes. The plagues in Egypt followed each other in the following way. On the fifteenth of Nisan, the Holy One came to Moses at the <i>thorn bush</i> and told him that he should go to Pharaoh. On the twenty-first day of <i>Nisan</i>, Moses went to his father-in-law to ask if he could leave the land of Midian, since Moses had sworn to Jethro that he would not leave the land of <i>Midian</i> without his permission. Therefore, he had to go to <i>Jethro</i> that he should <i>release him from his vow</i>, so that he could go to Egypt. Moses came before Pharaoh and warned him that he should send out the Israelites. This lasted eight days until the end of the <i>month of Nisan.</i> For three months, <i>Iyyar</i>, <i>Sivan</i> and <i>Tammuz</i>, Moses was in hiding from Pharaoh and away from the Israelites. Thus, the plague of <i>blood</i> began on <i>Rosh Hodesh Ab</i> and lasted for seven days. For three weeks, <i>Pharaoh had a respite</i> between each plague, so that the plagues extended until <i>Rosh Hodesh Nisan.</i> The locusts came on the <i>month of Nisan</i> and lasted for seven days in Nisan. Then came the plague of darkness that also lasted for seven days. This was fourteen days in Nisan and on the fifteenth day of Nisan the plague of the <i>firstborn</i> occurred. Thus, all the plagues lasted for twelve <i>months</i>, a full year. Moses came the first time in Nisan and warned Pharaoh about the plague of the firstborn. This was as if the plagues began in <i>Nisan</i> and lasted until the following <i>Nisan.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 10:5.</i> Just like the evildoer is in <i>Gehenna</i> for twelve months,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Shabbat,</i> 33b.</i> so were <i>Pharaoh</i> and his people in troubles and plagues for twelve <i>months.</i>
“<i>He turned and left Pharaoh</i>’<i>s presence</i>” [10:6]. Moses angrily went out from Pharaoh. He had warned him about the plague of locusts, expecting that they would discuss sending out Israel. The locusts were greatly feared in Pharaoh’s eyes. They would eat up all the grain on the ground. Therefore, Pharaoh immediately sent for Moses and Aaron that they should return to him. Pharaoh’s servants said to him: how long will this people Israel be an evil to us, that God afflicts us with all of these plagues? Pharaoh immediately sent for Moses and Aaron and said to them. Go and worship your God, but tell me who will go. Moses said: we must all go, women and children, since we have a holiday. This is <i>Shavuot</i>, that we have a holiday to receive the Torah. Pharaoh responded: what will the children do? Let the men go, since you said, to bring a sacrifice. The men bring the sacrifice and not the women or children. I see that you want to run away into the wilderness. It will be bad for you. I see a star in the wilderness that relates to you. This only means blood that you will die in the wilderness. This star is called <i>evil</i>, because it causes much evil for people. In truth, Pharaoh did see a star of blood over Israel. This means that Israel afterwards in the wilderness, the star alluded to the <i>Golden Calf.</i> They were supposed to have been destroyed because of that sin, but Moses prayed. Then the Holy One changed the blood into the <i>blood of circumcision</i> that Israel performed in the wilderness. <i>Joshua</i> said that Israel should be given the land of Israel. Therefore, Moses says in his prayer, “<i>Let not the Egyptians say, it was with evil intent that he delivered them</i>” [Exodus, 32:12]. That is to say, the Egyptians will say that You, God, took Israel out of Egypt in order to destroy them with the star that is called <i>evil.</i> Thus, all Your wonders and signs that You performed in Egypt will be forgotten and will be meaningless.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Exodus, 10:10; Bahya, Exodus, 10:10.</i> Pharaoh chased Moses out of his house.
“<i>Hold out your arm over the land of Egypt for the locusts</i>” [10:12]. The Holy One said to Moses: Hold out your hand over the land of Egypt and locusts will come over the land of Egypt. Moses held out his hand and God caused a great wind to blow from the east for a whole day and night. The wind brought the locusts over the whole land of Egypt and there were so many locusts that they covered the whole land of Egypt. It was dark because of so many locusts. They ate all the vegetation and grain. Therefore, <i>locusts</i> are mentioned seven times in the Torah portion, since there were all sorts of locusts, large and small, red, black, white, green and brown.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 10:14.</i>
“<i>I stand guilty before the Lord your God and before you</i>” [10:16]. Pharaoh said: I have sinned against your God and to you in that I have sent you away and chased you out of my house. Therefore, ask God that He should remove the locusts, this bitter death.
Bahya writes. The locusts ate out the eyes of the Egyptians and this killed them. That is why they said: remove this death from us. Moses prayed and a wind carried away the locusts into the sea.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 10:17.</i>
<i>Imre Noam</i> writes. Why into the sea? The explanation is that the locusts were sent back into the sea, in the expectation that the kings would run after <i>Israel</i> into the <i>sea</i> and the locusts would return and hurt the Egyptians. At the sea, each of the plagues was repeated. The same plague afflicted the Egyptians at the sea.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Imre Noam, Exodus, 10:19.</i>
“<i>Not a single locust remained</i>” [10:19]. All the locusts flew away, even the locusts that the Egyptians had gathered in barrels, in order to eat the locusts, came back to life and flew out to the sea, in the expectation that they should not derive any benefit from the locusts.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Exodus Rabbah</i>, 13. 7.</i>
Bahya writes. Moses’ prayer helped forever, from that time onwards. When Moses expelled the locusts from Egypt, no locusts have come into the land of Egypt. Yet, locusts sometimes come to the land of Israel. However, they are never found in the land of Egypt, and if they travel through the land of Egypt to the <i>land of Israel</i>, they do not damage the land of Egypt. Similarly, Moses told the frogs to remain in the water. There remained one large frog in the water. Occasionally, it goes out on to the <i>dry land</i> and it eats three people at one time. Spears and arrows cannot hurt him. He also has a powerful poison within him. Even when one strikes him in the stomach and kills him, yet when a person touches him after his death, the person dies.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 10:19.</i>
“<i>A darkness that can be touched</i>” [10:21]. God said to Moses: hold out your hand against the sky and a great darkness will come. This darkness will begin when the darkness of the night will end. Therefore, the Holy One said: let the dawn begin; the whole world should see that it is day and the darkness begins again. Thus, they will see that it is a plague from the Holy One.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Exodus, 10:21.</i>
<i>Hizkuni</i> and <i>Imre Noam</i> ask a question. Why did Moses not <i>warn</i> Pharaoh, if you will not send out Israel, I will darkness upon you? The explanation is that if the Egyptians had been warned they would have hidden all their gold and silver and Israel would not have been able to borrow from them. Therefore, there was the darkness.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Exodus, 10:21; Imre Noam, Exodus, 10:21.</i>
If an Israelite came to an Egyptian and asked to borrow a silver goblet or a gold chain, the Egyptian said that he did not have these things that he was asked to be borrowed. The Israelite responded: I see them there, all the things that I desire. Of all the <i>vessels</i>, I desire these. The Egyptians said: since you see in the darkness and I do not see, nonetheless, I will give it to you.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Exodus Rabbah</i>, 14. 3.</i>
Rashi gives another explanation. The darkness was because there were many <i>Israelite evildoers</i> who did not want to leave Egypt. The Holy One killed them all during the darkness, so that the Egyptians should not see and should not say that they were killed. So too, were the Israelites also killed. Therefore, the Holy One made the darkness and they buried the evildoers.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Exodus, 10:22.</i>
The darkness was so thick that when an Egyptian sat down, he was not able to stand up again. The thick darkness would not allow him to stand up. The darkness lasted for six days when each of the other plagues lasted for seven days. However, the seventh day, when it should have been dark in Egypt, that day was dark at the sea for the Egyptians.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Exodus, 10:22.</i>
“<i>Light in their dwellings</i>” [10:23]. Hizkuni asks a question. Why is it not written that the light was in the land of Goshen where the Israelites lived and by the other plagues it is written? The explanation is that therefore it is written that there was light only where an Israelite sat down. That is to say, when an Israelite went to an Egyptian’s house, there was light there. It was light for him there, but at the same time it was dark for the Egyptian. Therefore, the Torah did not say that the light was only in the land of Goshen, since it was light for the Israelites in all the cities wherever they were.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Exodus, 10:23.</i>
“<i>Only your flocks should be left behind</i>” [10:24]. Pharaoh said: you Israelites go into the wilderness to worship God, but your flocks should remain behind in Egypt was a pledge. Moses responded: you must give us even your flocks, since we do not know how many sacrifices the Holy One will desire from us that we should offer. Pharaoh did not want to send out the Israelites and said to Moses: Go from me and do not let yourself be seen before me again. Moses responded: you have spoken at the right time; you will not see me again before you. The Holy One said to Moses: I will bring my plague upon Pharaoh and afterwards he will send Israel quickly.
Therefore, say to Israel that each one should borrow silver and gold from the Egyptians and should go out of Egypt with the gold, since I have promised Abraham that they would leave Egypt with much money, because they have served, let them lend you silver and gold.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Exodus, 11:2.</i>
“<i>Toward midnight</i>” [11:4]. Moses said to Pharaoh: when midnight will come, the Holy One will kill all the firstborn of Egypt, whether they are the firstborn of a man or a woman, whether of a noble or a king, and also the firstborn of the animals, since they worshiped the animals.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Exodus, 11:5.</i> There was a great outcry at night, since there was a firstborn in every house. However, Pharaoh remained alive so that he should see the wonders at the sea and tell them to the other nations. Moses said to Pharaoh: your servants will come to you and will plead that I should take Israel out of Egypt. Moses angrily went away from Pharaoh.
“<i>In the land of Egypt</i>” [12:1]. God spoke to Moses outside the city of Egypt, since the city was full of foreign gods. Therefore, the Holy One did not want to command him to fulfill a commandment in the city.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Exodus, 12:1.</i> The Holy One said: you should go out of the city, because I want to command a commandment that you should <i>sanctify the month</i>, when the <i>moon</i> appears every <i>month.</i> Our sages say: if Israel would have no more than the commandment to <i>sanctify the month</i>, <i>the new moon</i>, every <i>month</i>, it would have been enough that they had received, just like when one greets his Lord with love. This is what we do when we <i>sanctify the new moon.</i> Therefore, we must stand and not sit when we sanctify the new moon, since the moon shows us that the Holy One created the world.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Sanhedrin,</i> 42a.</i>
“<i>Not a dog shall no snarl</i>” [11:7]. <i>Imre Noam</i> writes. The dogs did not bark at the Israelites because there were no corpses among the Jews, but among the Egyptians there were many corpses because the firstborn had been killed. Therefore, they barked at the Egyptians. Therefore, the Talmud says that when dogs frolic together in the streets, this means that <i>Elijah the prophet</i> had come to the city.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Baba Kamma,</i> 60b.</i> The <i>prophet Elijah</i> had killed four hundred false <i>prophets</i> and fed their flesh to the dogs. Therefore, when dogs see the <i>prophet Elijah</i> coming, they think that he will again give them meat to eat. That is why they were rejoicing.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Imre Noam, Exodus, 11:7.</i>
“<i>A lamb to a family</i>” [12:3]. The Holy One commanded to take a sheep for a <i>Paschal sacrifice</i> on the tenth day of <i>Nisan</i> and they tied up that sheep for four days until the fourteenth day of Nisan, which is the <i>eve of Passover. All of Israel</i> slaughtered a sheep as a <i>Paschal sacrifice.</i> The Holy One said: when a <i>householder</i> has a small household and a sheep is too much for them, then he should take a sheep with his neighbor for a Paschal sacrifice. From here we learn that the Torah teaches us that a person should not spend excessively, when he does not need it.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Exodus, 12:4.</i>
Bahya writes. They were commanded to slaughter a sheep because in the month of Nisan the zodiac sign in the sky is called sheep. Therefore, the Holy One commanded that they should slaughter a sheep so that Israel should not think that the zodiac sign in the sky for the month of <i>Nisan</i>, which is called sheep, helped them, but the Holy One Himself took them out of Egypt.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 12:7.</i>
They also slaughtered a sheep because the Egyptians worshiped a sheep and considered it a god. Therefore, the Holy One commanded that they should roast the sheep and not boil it, in the expectation that the odor would carry and the Egyptians would not be able to do anything. Therefore, you should also not break the bones of the sheep so that the Egyptians should recognize that this had been a sheep, one of their gods. Therefore, they roasted the whole sheep on a spit over the fire. The whole world should see that it was a sheep and you should eat the Paschal sacrifice in Egypt. You should be prepared for the journey, girded with your belt, your shoes on your feet and your staffing your hand. That is to say, you should eat the Paschal sacrifice on your way out of Egypt.
“<i>I will mete out punishments to all the gods of Egypt</i>” [12:12]. The Holy One said: I will kill the firstborn, and I will devastate their gods. A wooden god will rot and their iron or gold gods will be molten and dissolve in their <i>temples.</i> The Torah teaches us that when it wrote this together, the destruction of their idols and the death of their firstborn. This teaches us that when the Holy One himself destroyed the gods in the <i>temples</i>, the Egyptians did not know about this, since they did not come to their <i>temples</i> often. Therefore, the Holy One killed the firstborn the same night. The Egyptians had to bury their firstborn and they used to bury their <i>dead</i> in their <i>temples.</i> Thus, they would also see that their gods had been destroyed in their temples.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 12:12.</i>
The Holy One commanded that you should eat unleavened bread for seven days. You should clean out the <i>leaven</i> from your houses. Whoever will not do this, his years will be cut off from the world; he must die. The Holy One said: you should dip into the blood of the sheep and should spread it over the door lintel and the doorposts. No Israelite should go out of their house on that night, when I will kill the firstborn. I will see the blood on the door and I will pass over, so that none of the Israelites inside should be killed.
Bahya writes here. It was not the blood that saved them, but because Israel publicly put a sign on the outside of their house with blood and did not fear Pharaoh. How can one slaughter a god and also smear the blood on the house and Pharaoh will do nothing to us? Nonetheless, because Israel relied on God in heaven, therefore they were worthy that they remained alive that night.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 12:23.</i>
“<i>There was no house where there was not someone dead</i>” [12:30]. There was no house in Egypt. There was a corpse in every house in Egypt, even if there was no firstborn in it. In that case, the oldest one was killed.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Exodus, 12:30.</i> That is why the oldest one in each house used to fast on the <i>eve of Passover.</i>
“<i>He summoned Moses and Aaron in the night</i>” [12:31]. Pharaoh went from house to house and called for Moses and Aaron. He said: go with all your household and flocks and worship God.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Exodus, 12:31.</i>
Hizkuni writes. “<i>Not a dog shall no snarl</i>” [11:7]. It is customary that dogs bark after midnight. You Israel will go straight out of Egypt and each Israelite will have a staff in his hand and the dogs would not bark. It is customary that when a person walks with a staff the dogs bark, particularly at night.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Exodus, 11:7.</i> The Holy One paid the dogs that one should give them the animals of Israel found not to be kosher or when a wolf or other <i>wild animal</i> kills an animal.
Bahya writes. The Holy One brought the ten plagues for the evil things that the Egyptians did to the Israelites. First, they made the Israelites draw water to water their flocks, fields and vineyards. Therefore, the Holy One caused that the water changed into blood and they could not drink. The second one, they made the Israelites get up from their beds at night to work, to do heavy labor. The Israelites sighed in their hearts because of the heavy labor. Therefore, the Holy One brought frogs into the beds of the Egyptians, so that they could also not sleep in their beds, just like they did to Israel and not let them sleep in their beds. The third one, they did not allow the Israelites to go to the baths to wash themselves. Thus, the Israelites became full of lice. Therefore, the Holy One brought lice upon Egypt. The fourth one, the Egyptians commanded that the Israelites had to catch wild animals, like lions and bears. Therefore, the Holy One sent many wild animals to Egypt and they destroyed them. The fifth one, The Israelites had cattle in the field. Therefore, the Holy One sent <i>pestilence</i> on their cattle that they should die. The sixth one, the Egyptians made the Israelites warm water for them. Therefore, the Holy One sent mange on the Egyptians. The seventh one, the Egyptians threw stones when they saw a Jew. Therefore, the Holy One brought hail and stones from heaven upon the Egyptians. The eighth one, the Israelites had to carry manure to their fields. Therefore, the Holy One brought locusts that ate up everything in the fields. The ninth one is that the Egyptians placed the Israelites in prisons and dark pits. Therefore, the Holy one brought darkness upon the Egyptians. Tenth, the Egyptians wanted to destroy the Israelites who are called the Holy One’s firstborn. Therefore, the Holy one killed the firstborn of the Egyptians. The Midrash writes that the Holy One brought the plagues like a king who wants to conquer a land. When the king comes before the city, he takes away the water that flows into the city, in the expectation that the city would have no water to drink. They would soon surrender because of the water. So also did the Holy one. First he made the water of Egypt into blood, so that they could not drink the water. Afterwards, the king makes a big commotion with people and with horses so that the people in the city should become afraid. So too did the Holy One. He brought many frogs with a great noise, so that all the Egyptians all became afraid. Then the king brings the people who shoot with arrows and muskets. So too did the Holy One. He brought lice that stick the <i>body</i> like arrows. Then the king sends many nations, to run at the city and conquer it. So too, the Holy One sent all the <i>wild animals</i> to Egypt. Afterwards, the king sends wild horses that kill the cattle with their feet. So, the Holy One sent the <i>pestilence</i> on the cattle and they killed the cattle. Afterwards, the king captured some people from the city and tortured them on their <i>bodies</i> with fire so that they should <i>tell</i> how once could conquer the city. So, when the Holy One sent <i>boils</i> upon the Egyptians, which burned on their skin like fire. Afterwards, the king sends large catapults to throw down the walls. So too, the Holy One sent large stones from heaven and killed many people and cattle. Afterwards, the people come into the city. So too, the Holy One sent locusts into Egypt and they ate up everything. When the king comes to the city, he captures the people. So too, the Holy One brought darkness, just like a <i>prison</i>, upon Egypt. Afterwards, he kills the king and the leaders of the city. So too, the Holy One killed the <i>first-born.</i> All the plagues that were in Egypt, the Hoy One will again bring them upon the gentiles in the days of the Messiah.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 12:29.</i>
“<i>The Egyptians urged the people on</i>” [12:33]. The Egyptians had to send Israel out of Egypt, because the Egyptians had been afflicted with ten plagues. Pharaoh said to Moses: Who is your God, since all the gods have written me letters, but your God I do not know, since He has not written me a letter. Pharaoh called all of his wise men and they said: we have heard say that your God of Israel is a son of wise men. The Holy One responded: you call Me a son of wise men and you call yourselves wise men? Your wisdom will soon be removed and destroyed. You Pharaoh said: I do not know your God; you will soon shout that God is right. You say: I will not send out Israel; you will beg Israel to leave your land. A parable. A king says to his servant: go and buy me a fish. The servant goes and buys a dead fish that stinks. The king gets very angry and says to the servant. I will impose one of three things on you. First, eat the fish yourself. If you do not want to eat it, I will beat you with one hundred lashes. The servant responded: I will eat the dead fish. He started to eat, but could not eat any more and had to stop eating, so they beat him. When they had given him several lashes, he started shouting that they should stop; he would pay. He would rather give one hundred gulden; he was afraid that he would die. Thus, he did all three things. He ate the dead fish, was beaten, and had to give one hundred gulden. So too, Pharaoh was afflicted with the plagues and Israel took their money and they freely left Egypt. His evil heart caused all of this.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 12:33.</i>
“<i>Upon their shoulders</i>” [12:34]. The Israelites took their dough on their shoulders wrapped in a sheet. How is it that the Israelites had many cattle and they could have put the dough on the animals? The Israelites loved the <i>matzot</i> very much and that is why they carried the dough on their shoulders.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Exodus, 12:34.</i>
“<i>Objects of silver and gold and clothing</i>” [12:35]. The Israelites took the Egyptians’ golden vessels and beautiful clothes. Bahya writes here. The clothing was more valuable that the gold. Therefore, silver is written first, then gold and then the clothing. It is known that gold is much more valuable than silver. The Torah first wrote silver and then gold. This teaches us that what is written last is the most valuable. The clothes are written after gold, thus they must be more valuable than gold.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 12:35.</i>
Hizkuni writes. “<i>On the tenth day of this month</i>” [12:3]. They took a lamb for the <i>Paschal sacrifice</i> on the tenth day of the month of Nisan. This time the same day was on a Sabbath and they tied the lamb to the bedpost on the Sabbath, not with a permanent knot, because one is not supposed to tie a permanent knot on the Sabbath. Similarly, there was a <i>miracle</i> that the lamb did not tear itself away, but remained standing. The other <i>miracle</i> was that the Egyptians could not say anything against Israel that they had tied their god to the bed, in a lowly place, to slaughter it. Therefore, the Sabbath before <i>Passover</i> is called the <i>Great Sabbath</i>, because of the great <i>miracle</i> that the Egyptians did not say anything.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Exodus, 12:3; <i>Pesikta de Rav Kahana</i>, 5.17.</i>
“<i>Your lamb shall be without a blemish</i>” [12:5]. One should take a lamb without a <i>blemish</i> so that the Egyptians should not say that they took a lamb with a <i>blemish</i> because it is not <i>appropriate</i> for the foreign gods. Therefore, we have nothing to be angry about at the Israelites. Therefore, it is written, “<i>a yearling male</i>” [12:5]. That is, a <i>male</i> lamb that is one year old, which is certainly appropriate for the foreign gods, so that the Egyptians could not speak against Israel. The lamb was tied for four days, in the expectation that the Egyptians should hear their god making noise and they should not say anything.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Exodus, 12:5.</i>
“<i>All the assembled congregation of the Israelites</i>” [12:6]. They should all slaughter together, in the expectation that no Jew should be able to explain to an Egyptian and say, I did not slaughter your god. Nobody needs to do this.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Exodus, 12:6.</i>
“<i>At twilight</i>” [12:6]. They should slaughter it at sunset when all the people come from their work to see that their god is being slaughtered. They should sprinkle the blood on the door to show the whole world. Therefore, they sprinkled it on the lintel and the two sides of the door. This looked like the letter <i>het.</i> That is to say, the <i>het</i> points to life.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Life in Hebrew is <i>Hayyim,</i> which begins with the letter <i>het.</i></i> That is to say, <i>life to Israel.</i> They should roast the lamb so that the aroma would spread and the Egyptians did not say anything.

“<i>There was no house where there was not someone dead</i>” [12:30]. There was a corpse in every house. One asks a question. Was there a living firstborn in every house? Perhaps he had died long ago. The explanation is that when a firstborn died in Egypt, they used to paint his face on the wall in order to remember him forever. However, on the night when the firstborn were killed, the Holy One caused that these images and paintings of their firstborn were erased. This was as if that firstborn had now died. Therefore, there was no house where someone was not dead. Another explanation is that the Egyptians used to bury their firstborn in their houses. That night, when the firstborn were being killed, dogs came and dug up the dead firstborn and dragged them from their house. It appeared to the Egyptians that they had also been killed that night. Therefore, there was no house where there was no corpse.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Pesikta de Rav Kahana</i>, 7.6.</i>
“<i>Upon their shoulders</i>” [12:34]. They carried it on their shoulders because their donkeys were heavily loaded with silver and gold. They could not load any more on them.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Exodus, 12:34.</i>
“<i>You shall not break a bone of it</i>” [12:46]. You should break no bone of the lamb that you ate with satiety. If one would break the bone to take out the marrow, then it seems as if he had not eaten enough of the meat, like a glutton who is not satiated.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Exodus, 12:46.</i>
“<i>Nor had they prepared any provisions for themselves</i>” [12:39]. Israel did not take provisions. They relied on God, <i>Blessed be His Name</i>, who will feed them, even in the <i>wilderness</i> where nothing grows.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Exodus, 12:39.</i>
“<i>Consecrate to Me every firstborn</i>” [13:2]. The <i>Holy One</i> commanded to take and make holy the first child that is a male of every woman to be a firstborn. Bahya asks a question here. Why did the Torah write to take a f<i>irstborn</i> of the mother? Why did the Torah not write to also make the firstborn of the father, since in Egypt even the <i>firstborn</i> of the father was killed? The explanation is that one does not know with certainty if this is the first drop of semen of the father, that this should be his firstborn. He may have <i>secretly</i> had children previously from <i>illicit relations.</i> However, with a woman it can be known that this is her first son from her body.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 13:2.</i>
“<i>Into the land of the Canaanites</i>” [13:11]. The Holy One said: you should keep My commandments when I will bring you into the <i>land of Israel.</i> Bahya asks a question here. There were seven nations in the land of Israel. Why was the land called after the Canaanites and not another nation? The explanation is that the Canaanites were cursed to be eternal servants. That is to say, because the Canaanite was called a servant, the land of Israel was not sold to him. A servant cannot buy anything, since it all belongs to his master. That is to say, Israel immediately took it away from the Canaanite, who was a servant.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 13:5.</i>
Hizkuni gives an explanation. The children of <i>Het</i> honored Abraham and thus they became aware that the Holy One had given the land of Israel to the children of Abraham. The Canaanites left the land of Israel eventually and left the land for Israel. The Holy One said: since you left the land of Israel by yourself, I will give you a better land, which is called <i>Africa</i> and I will call this land Israel. That is to say, it should not be called the <i>land of Canaan</i> forever.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Exodus, 13:11.</i>
“<i>Every firstling ass</i>” [13:13]. When an ass will have a firstborn, you should redeem it with a sheep. Why was only the firstborn of an ass holy and not a horse or other <i>unclean domestic animal?</i> The explanation is that asses helped carry much money and goods out of Egypt to Israel, since each Israelite had had ninety asses who carried silver and gold to Israel, in the wilderness.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 13:13.</i>
“<i>A sign upon your hand</i>” [13:16]. You should place the phylactery on your left hand, since the right hand does all work and is smeared with all sorts of uncleanness and disgusting things. Therefore, the <i>phylactery</i> should be placed on the left hand.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Exodus, 13:16.</i>

<i>“When Pharaoh let the people go God did not lead them”</i> [13:17]. Pharaoh sent out Israel and the Holy One did not take Israel through the land of the Philistines, even though it was quite close to the <i>land of Israel.</i> The Holy One did this because he wanted to test Israel in the <i>wilderness.</i> They left with their wives and children, where there were large snakes, thick as beams. The Holy One said: I will lead them into the wilderness, in the expectation that Israel should not be afraid when they will see war and will want to return to Egypt. Therefore, the Holy One led them on the other side of the sea, in the expectation that they should not return to Egypt. Even though Amalek came against Israel in the desert, but that war was not big and it was not justified that Israel would return to Egypt because of it. <i>Rabbenu Hananel</i> said: The Holy One always wants to do <i>miracles and wonders</i> with the righteous. So too, the Holy One wanted to show Israel <i>miracles in the wilderness</i> with the <i>manna.</i> He brought many good birds that are called quail, that Israel should eat meat. Afterwards, He brought water from a rock, to give enough water to Israel. We also find that when <i>Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah</i> were thrown into the furnace, the Holy One could have saved them and could have extinguished the fire. However, the Holy One allowed the fire to burn strongly. With this, the Holy One showed that He could protect them from the hot fire, and even the hair on their heads was not singed. Similarly with <i>Daniel</i>, when he was thrown into the lion pit, among the <i>wild animals.</i> The Holy One could have easily killed the wild animals in the pit so that they should not do anything to Daniel, but the Holy One allowed the <i>wild animals</i> to live and caused that the lions could do nothing evil to Daniel. He sent angels who closed the mouths of the lions. With this the Holy One showed His wonders. So too the Holy One did in the wilderness. He would split the sea so that they should see the wonders of the Holy One. Afterwards, the Israelites came to the city of <i>Marah.</i> Previously, there had only been sweet water there for many years. The Holy One made the water bitter so that Israel could not drink it because of great bitterness. The Holy One again showed the wonders and ordered that they throw a wood into it and the water again became sweet. God did this because He wanted to test them, if Israel would trust in God. Similarly, He gave them <i>manna</i>, a measured amount each day. He could have given them enough at one time, but the Holy One wanted to convince them to trust and rely on God that they should ask God every day to give bread.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 13:17.</i>
Hizkuni writes that the Holy One did not want to lead Israel through the land of the <i>Philistines.</i> The Philistines said that Israel is coming to wage war with us, since the Philistines killed the children of <i>Ephraim</i> who left the <i>Egyptian exile</i> early, before the proper time had come. They had not properly understood the <i>calculations</i> when the <i>Egyptian exile</i> was supposed to end. Therefore, the Philistines attacked the children of Abraham and killed them. Now, the Israelites were supposed to go against the Philistines who thought that they were coming to kill and avenge against them because they had killed the children of Abraham. Therefore, the Holy One did not lead them to the land of the <i>Philistines.</i> Another explanation of “<i>it was nearer</i>” [13:17]. <i>Abimelech</i>, the king of the <i>Philistines</i>, was a <i>relative</i> of Pharaoh. Abraham had sworn that he would have no war with <i>Abimelech</i>’<i>s relatives.</i> Therefore, the Holy One did not want to lead them through the land of the <i>Philistines.</i> Perhaps they would want to wage war with them. The Egyptians would pursue the Israelites and the Philistines would see and would want to go to them and wage war with Israel. They would want to help their <i>relatives</i>, the Egyptians.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Exodus, 13:17.</i>
“<i>The Israelites went up armed</i>” [13:18]. They went up with swords, bows and arrows, and spears from Egypt, just like <i>soldiers</i> go. Even though Israel did not need to kill, since the Holy One Himself killed the Egyptians. Furthermore, the Torah teaches us that the person should always do what is just to do and the Holy One will help them, as the verse says, “<i>readied for the day of battle, but victory comes from the Lord</i>” [Proverbs, 21:31]. That is to say, the horse should be readied for war, but God has the help in His hand, to help. The Midrash says, “<i>went up armed</i>” [13:18]. Only a fifth part of Israel went out of Egypt and four parts of Israel died in Egypt during the darkness. Why in the darkness, in the expectation that the Egyptians should not see that Israelites are also dying. Otherwise, they would say that even though Egyptians are dying, Israelites are also dying. Another explanation of “<i>The Israelites went up armed</i>” [13:18]. They went out of Egypt expecting that they would receive the Torah after fifty days. That is, the fifty days from <i>Passover</i> until <i>Shavuot.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 13:18.</i>
“<i>Moses took the bones of Joseph</i>” [13:19]. Moses immediately took the bones of Joseph to take with them to the <i>land of Israel</i>, since Joseph had commanded Israel that they should take his body and bring it to the <i>land of Israel.</i> All of Israel ran to take silver and gold and borrow it from the Egyptians, but Moses the righteous one wanted to quickly fulfill the vow and keep God’s commandment. Because Joseph had buried his father Jacob with great honor, therefore Joseph also merited that an important person, that is Moses, who was much better and important than Joseph, buried him. Moses was also worthy that he was buried by someone who was much more important than he was. This was the Holy One who buried Moses, since no man knows where Moses was buried, because the Holy One buried him. The sea split because of the merit of Joseph, since as soon as the sea saw the coffin of Joseph coming, the sea split and ran backwards, because Joseph ran away from his master’s wife, not wanting to sleep with her. As a result of this merit, the sea also ran away before Joseph and split.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 13:19.</i>
“<i>The Lord went before them</i>” [13:21]. The Holy One led two fiery pillars before Israel by day and by night, to protect Israel and to burn the Egyptians.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 13:21.</i>
“<i>That they might travel day and night</i>” [13:21]. Israel went day and night in the expectation that they would quickly receive the Torah. There was a pillar at night that shined the whole night and waited until the other pillar of fire arose to shine for Israel during the day.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 13:21.</i>
When Moses wanted to bury Joseph he went to the river, since the Egyptians hid Joseph in an iron chest in the Nile, so that they should not take him out. Moses shouted at the river, Joseph come out and show yourself, wherever you are. We gladly want to fulfill our oath to take you to the <i>land of Israel.</i> If you will not appear, then we will be absolved of your <i>oath.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Deuteronomy Rabbah</i>, 11. 7.</i>
Some sages say that they wrote the <i>name of God</i> on a silver tablet and also wrote on it, <i>arise ox</i>, <i>arise ox.</i> That is, arise Joseph, you are called ox. The chest with Joseph appeared and Moses took Joseph to the <i>land of Israel.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Midrash Sekhel Tov</i> (ed. S.

“<i>Encamp before Pi-hahiroth</i>” [14:2]. The Holy One commanded the Israelites that they should go back toward <i>Egypt</i>, until the city of <i>Pitom</i>, in the expectation that the <i>Egyptians</i> should say that the Israelites are lost and do not know what they are doing. Therefore, the Holy one ordered that the Israelites should rest before a foreign god called <i>Baal Zephon.</i> That is, as if the foreign god was holding up the Israelites and did not allow them to run away. The Egyptians would praise their god and with this the Holy One caused the nations to lose and become lost. They said that no person could run way because of their god, in the expectation that the Egyptians should take heart and pursue Israel, even though they had gladly sent them away. However, now they said that they are lost, and the wilderness is locked before Israel. Israel immediately did what God had commanded and went back toward Egypt; even they did not want to run back into the hands of their enemies.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 14:2.</i>
“<i>The king of Egypt was told</i>” [14:5]. The third day had arrived when Israel had said in Egypt to Pharaoh: we will only tarry in the wilderness for three days and we will return to Egypt. Pharaoh sent along his representatives in the expectation that Israel would return after three days. However, Israel did not want to return after three days. The representatives went back and said to Pharaoh: Israel does not want to come back to Pharaoh. The representatives took one day to go back to Egypt that Israel had taken two days, because there were not many representatives. Therefore they went quickly and said to the king that Israel does not want to come back. Pharaoh went with a large group and that is why Pharaoh went in two days what the representatives did in one day, even though the Israelites turned toward Egypt. Therefore, one can ask. Why did Pharaoh go in two days when Israel was waiting nearby? The explanation is that they only turned slightly toward Egypt. However the Holy One did a miracle that they went in one day what Pharaoh took two days. Israel came to the sea on the seventh night after leaving Egypt. The recited the Song [at the Sea]<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus, 15:1–19.</i> on the seventh night of Passover, at the sea. Therefore we also recite the <i>Song</i> [at the Sea] on the seventh day of <i>Passover</i> every year.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Exodus, 14:5.</i>
“<i>He ordered his chariot</i>” [14:6]. Pharaoh, the king himself, harnessed the chariot because he wanted to encourage his people that they should also go quickly. He spoke to his people, and said: I will not hold myself as a king, but I will go in front, not like other kings who stay in the back. I will share equally with you what we will take from Israel. Pharaoh opened all the treasuries that all the kings had gathered and gave them much gold and silver. They took everything with them into the war.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Exodus, 14:6.</i>
“<i>The rest of the chariots of Egypt</i>” [14:7]. Six hundred important noblemen and great generals along with many valuable horses. Here one asks a question. If all the animals in Egypt were destroyed, where did they now take the animals? The explanation is that there were a few good Egyptians who feared the Holy One and took their animals from the fields into their homes, since Moses had warned that all the animals should be taken from the fields, and nothing happened to these animals. Even though these Egyptians were pious and feared God, yet these same good Egyptians also gave their horses for the war to pursue Israel.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mekhiltah de Rabbi Ishmael</i>, <i>Beshallah</i>, <i>de-Vayehi</i>, 1.</i> From here we learn that the piety of the best gentiles is as nothing.
“<i>The Lord stiffened the heart of Pharaoh</i>” [14:8]. He was thinking if he should pursue them. God strengthened his heart that he should pursue them. The Israelites were going freely and openly out of Egypt. The Egyptians found Israel by the foreign god of <i>Baal Zephon.</i> Even though, all the foreign gods in Egypt were destroyed, but the Holy One allowed the foreign god of Baal Zephon to remain standing, in the expectation that He wanted that the Egyptians should err. They would say, how very strong is <i>Baal Zephon</i> that the Holy One could not do anything and the Israelites cannot run away from the idol. The Holy One causes the nations to be destroyed by their mistakes.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mekhiltah de Rabbi Ishmael</i>, <i>Beshallah</i>, <i>de-Vayehi,</i> 2.</i>
“<i>As Pharaoh drew near</i>” [14:10]. That is to say, he approached Israel himself. Another explanation: Pharaoh the evildoer made Israel become pious and they prayed to God and brought their hearts near to God with great supplications. When the Holy One wants to cause Israel to become pious, the Holy One places evildoers to harm Israel. When Haman came and wanted to destroy Israel, Israel quickly became pious and repented greatly. Similarly, when Pharaoh was pursuing Israel, Israel became very frightened and prayed much and brought their hearts near to God.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 14:10.</i>
“<i>The Egyptians advancing</i>” [14:10]. Here one asks a question. It says <i>advancing</i> [in the singular]. This means, just like one Egyptian pursued, since the Egyptians all had one heart to wage war against Israel. The Midrash writes that it is written <i>advancing</i>, because the <i>angel of the Egyptians</i>, who is called <i>Azzah</i>, also wanted to wage war with Israel and wanted to pursue them, to help the people of Egypt.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Exodus, 14:10.</i>
Israel saw all this and were very frightened. Israel said: were there not enough graves in Egypt to bury us there? Why should we die in the wilderness? Bahya writes. There were four groups among the Israelites. One group shouted to God. The second group said that they wanted to wage war with the Egyptians. The third group said: we will return to Egypt. The fourth group prayed and shouted loudly.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 14:11.</i>
“<i>The Lord will battle for you</i>” [14:14]. Moses said: the Holy One will battle for you and wage war since the Egyptians saw at the plague of the firstborn that the Holy One Himself killed and the Egyptians did not turn away. It was like the Egyptians wanted to wage war with the Holy One. Therefore, the Holy One Himself will wage war for you and you should remain silent. Another explanation. You Israel should remain silent, since you have also done evil in Egypt with worshiping foreign gods, so that the Holy One also not punish you.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 14:14.</i>
“<i>Why do you cry to Me</i>” [14:15]? God said to Moses: now is not the time for long prayers and supplications, since Israel is in great trouble. Another explanation. The Holy One said: why are you crying out to me? I have known for a long time that it depends on Me, but allow Israel to go to the sea. It will split before Israel because of the <i>merit of the ancestors</i> and the merit of the <i>faith</i> that Israel will have in Me, in the wilderness.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Exodus, 14:15.</i>
“<i>Lift your rod</i>” [14:16]. <i>Imre Noam</i> writes. The Midrash<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Exodus Rabbah</i>, 21.6.</i> says that Moses came to the sea and said to it, split yourself. The sea said: you have no authority over me. Go to the river Nile, which is your river. Moses went to the Holy One and said that the sea does not want to split. The Holy One said: when a servant does not want to obey his master, then he should be beaten on the head with a stick. Therefore, lift your staff and hit the sea, and let it split. The sea did not want to split and did not retreat from Moses’ blows. The Holy One Himself came, and as soon as the sea saw that the Holy One had come, the sea split and retreated backwards. Moses said: you sea, why are you running? The sea said: Moses, you are mistaken. I am not running from you, but before the Holy One who had created the world. I am running before Him.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Imre Noam, Exodus, 14:27.</i>
Bahya writes, “<i>Lift your rod</i>” [14:16], means. The Holy One said to Moses. Put the staff away from your hand, since the people are saying: Moses can do no wonder without the staff. Therefore, put the staff away from your hand and say to the sea that it should split, without the staff.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 14:16.</i> Hizkuni also writes this.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Exodus, 14:16.</i>
“<i>One could not come near the other all through the night</i>” [14:20]. The Egyptians and the Israelites did not come together the whole night, even though they were close to each other. The Holy One caused that the cloud went before Israel to illumine for them. However, when the Egyptians were pursuing them and had reached Israel, the same cloud of fire was behind Israel. It should have gone before Israel. Israel soon ran away from the Egyptians, following the cloud. Thus, Israel could not go since it was dark for them, and all of this was at night. Israel had come to the <i>sea</i> when night fell.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 14:20.</i>
“<i>The waters were split</i>” [14:21]. All the waters of the <i>world</i> were split when the <i>sea</i> was split. Ten <i>miracles</i> occurred at the sea. First, that it split. Second is that it was made like a dome or a roof and Israel walked under the water. The water was under, on the sides of and over Israel. Third, it was dry under them, so that Israel should not smear their feet with mud. Fourth, for the Egyptians, the earth was all mud and slime and they sank into it. Fifth, the water was congealed and hard as stone. Sixth, the water was not congealed completely, but it was congealed a section at a time. It was like large boulders, in the expectation that when the Egyptians would drown, the hard water would smash their heads, like stones. These pieces were on top of each other, like a brick wall. Seventh, it was split into twelve sections, so that each tribe had a separate path to go through the sea. Eighth, the water was clear as glass so that each tribe could see their friends crossing the sea near them. Ninth, the water in the sea was sweet as sugar. The Israelites drank from the water. When they took it, the water became soft, so that they could take some. As soon as they took the water into their hands, it became hard again so that it should not drip and become muddy under the feet of Israel. Therefore, as soon as they took the water it became hard again so that it should not drip down. This was the tenth miracle.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 14:21.</i>
Hizkuni writes. One third of the water of the sea remained below, awaiting that Israel would walk on it. If it had been dried out completely, there would have been a deep pit in the sea. They would have gone down with difficulty and then up again. That is why the water was under them, like a bridge, so that they could easily walk on it.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Exodus, 14:21.</i>
Bahya writes. When they were walking in the sea and their children cried, the mother took an apple or a pomegranate and gave it to the child. There were apple trees and other fruit in the sea. The Holy One made them grow quickly and had fruits in the sea.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 14:22.</i>
“<i>The waters forming a wall</i>” [14:22]. The waters were like a wall on all sides for the Israelites. The Midrash says that Israel had merit on all sides. On the right hand the Torah would be given. On the left hand was the <i>merit of phylacteries.</i> In front of them was the <i>merit of circumcision.</i> Behind them was the <i>merit of zizit</i>, since one puts <i>zizit</i> on the <i>talit</i> that is behind one. <sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 14:22.</i>
“<i>He locked the wheels</i>” [14:25]. The Holy One causes that all the wooden parts that the Egyptians had in their wagons and their spears and guns were burned by the fiery cloud. The cloud made the earth wet and it became completely muddy. Afterwards, the fiery pillar came and heated the mud and the horses’ hooves and horseshoes fell off.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 14:25.</i>
“<i>At daybreak the sea returned to its normal state</i>” [14:27]. By dawn the Israelites had already come out of the sea. Moses raised his and over the sea and the sea returned to flowing. The Egyptians wanted to go back and wanted to run out of the sea. The Holy One caused the Egyptians to become confused and they ran into the sea.
Bahya writes. “<i>Its normal state</i>” means that the water flowed again as it had flowed previously, as the Holy One had stipulated with it. The Holy One had stipulated with the sea when He made it, that it would split before Israel when they left Egypt and it should stand still, even though its nature was to flow constantly. Similarly, the sun and the moon had to stand still in the days of Joshua, and the sun in the days of Moses, when it is customary for them to move. Furthermore, they must stand still since the Holy One stipulated with the sun and the moon that they should stand still when they will be needed.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 14:27.</i>
“<i>The Egyptians fled at its approach</i>” [14:27]. The water ran toward them and pulled them into the sea. Hizkuni writes. The water was hard as stone and the Egyptians ran on it after the Israelites. They thought that they would run across. When they came into the middle of the sea, the water melted and they ran out, but the water would not let them.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Exodus, 14:27.</i>
“<i>Israel saw the Egyptians dead on the shore of the sea</i>” [14:30]. The sea threw out the dead Egyptians out of the sea on the side where the Israelites had come out, in the expectation that Israel should see that the Egyptians were drowned and should not say that just like we came out, so too the Egyptians went out. Why did the sea throw them out before Israel? The sea also threw the Egyptians out before Israel, in the expectation that each Israelite would see his master who was over him in Egypt. Now he was lying dead before him. The Israelites rejoiced that now they would not torment them anymore. Whenever a slave runs away from his master, he is afraid that he would be pursued. Therefore, the sea threw out the Egyptians before the Israelites in the expectation that Israel should take the gold and silver that the Egyptians had on them.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mekhiltah de Rabbi Ishmael</i>, <i>Beshallah</i>, <i>de-Vayehi,</i> 6.</i>
“<i>Israel saw the wondrous power</i>” [14:31]. Israel saw the Holy One smiting with his full hand at the sea, since in Egypt, it is written, “<i>this is the finger of God</i>” [Exodus, 8:15]. This means, the Holy One smote them with one finger in Egypt, but at the sea it was the full hand.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mekhiltah de Rabbi Ishmael</i>, <i>Beshallah</i>, <i>de-Vayehi,</i> 6.</i> This teaches us that at the sea the Egyptians were afflicted with fifty plagues.
“<i>Then Moses and the Israelites sang</i>” [15:1]. <i>All of Israel</i> sang <i>the Song.</i> The children at their mother’s breast sang. They know that God is our Lord. We will praise Him with love. All the children in their mother’s womb sang praises. They said: God rules over all the rulers.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Sotah,</i> 30b.</i>
“<i>Horse and driver He hurled into the sea</i>” [15:1]. The Holy One caused the man and the horse to be joined where he sat. The man and the horse went down and up in the sea. Bahya writes that the Midrash says: the man said to the horse. What is the meaning that yesterday I led you to the Nile River to immerse you and you did not want to go into the river? Now, you are dragging me into the water. The horse responded: I see the Holy One in the sea. Therefore, I must run into the sea.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 15:1.</i>
“<i>The Lord, the Warrior</i> – <i>Lord is His name</i>” [15:3]. The Holy One wages war and campaigns for Israel and sustains the whole world with His Holy Name, not like a king on the earth. When he wages war, then he cannot do more than wage war. He has enough to send for the war, but when the Holy One wages war, at the same time He does much good and sustains the whole world.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Exodus, 15:3.</i>
“<i>The God of my father and I will exalt Him</i>” [15:2]. Bahya writes. The person should compare his deeds to the deeds of the Holy One. Just as the Holy One is compassionate, so too the person should be compassionate to other people. Just as the Holy One makes clothes for people, so too the person should do to other people. Just as the Holy One buries the dead, so too the person should bury the dead.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 15:3.</i>
“<i>Drowned in the Sea of Reeds</i>” [15:4]. The bottom of the sea became muddy. The Holy One repays everything <i>measure for measure.</i> Because the Egyptians made the Israelites make mud in Egypt, therefore the bottom of the sea became muddy for the Egyptians and they got stuck in it.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Exodus, 15:4.</i>
“<i>They went down like a stone</i>” [15:5]. The evil Egyptians lived for a long time in the sea before they were drowned. Just like a straw floats easily on the water, so were the evildoers in the sea, floating before they were killed. Concerning this, the verse says, “<i>consumed them like straw</i>” [15:7]. They were destroyed in the sea like straw, with a difficult death. The middling evildoers quickly sank like a stone and their death came quickly. Concerning this, the verse says, “<i>They went down like a stone</i>” [15:5]. The best of the Egyptians were like lead that is much heavier than stone.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Exodus, 15:5.</i>
“<i>The Lord, the Warrior</i> – <i>Lord is His name</i>” [15:3]. The Holy One does not wage war with swords and guns, but He wages all the wars with the nations with His Holy Name.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Exodus, 15:3.</i>
“<i>You break your opponents</i>” [15:7]. The enemies who hate Israel are like they are the enemies of the Holy One. The Holy One brings the enemies together and destroys them.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Exodus, 15:7.</i>
“<i>The waters piled up</i>” [15:8]. The water became high, like a wall, in the sea. Bahya gives another explanation. The waters were intelligent. They made themselves like a wall for the Israelites and when the Egyptians came, they became water and drowned the Egyptians.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 15:8.</i>
“<i>The foe said</i>” [15:9]. Pharaoh said to his people. I want to pursue Israel and want to share the spoils with you.
“<i>Who is like You, O Lord, among the mighty, who is like You, majestic in holiness</i>” [15:11]. Where is there a God who is silent and does not immediately repay the evildoers, those who do evil to Him?<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Exodus, 15:11.</i>
“<i>Awesome in splendor</i>” [15:11]. It is awesome when one is to love God. Perhaps the person will not love Him enough, as it is appropriate to love Him.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Exodus, 15:11.</i>
“<i>The earth swallowed them</i>” [15:12]. The earth covered all the Egyptian dead equally. They were worthy to be buried because the Egyptians shouted at the sea, “<i>the Lord is in the right</i>” [Exodus, 9:27]. God is righteous and they are evildoers. Thus, they were all buried.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Exodus, 15:12.</i>
Bahya writes. They were worthy to be buried because the Egyptians went up with Joseph to bury Jacob in the <i>land of Israel.</i> The Holy One repays <i>measure for measure.</i> Since the Egyptians honored the burial of Jacob, therefore they were worthy of burial.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 15:12.</i>
“<i>You put out Your right hand</i>” [15:12]. The earth did not want to accept the dead to cover them. The earth said: I was cursed when I accepted the blood of <i>Abel.</i> Thus, the Holy One raised His hand and swore that He would not say anything about this; she should accept the dead.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 15:12.</i>
<i>Imre Noam</i> writes. “<i>Then sang</i>” [15:1] teaches us that the Holy One will make the <i>dead</i> alive again in the days of the <i>Messiah</i>, since the word <i>yashir</i> means, they will sing in the end, in the days of the Messiah. <i>Imre Noam</i> writes about this that when the woman gives birth, there is no <i>angel</i> appointed over this. The Talmud in [tractate] <i>Ta</i>’<i>anit</i><sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Ta</i>’<i>anit,</i> 2a.</i> says that three keys are in the hands of the Holy One and not given into the hands of any angel. The first is the key of the mother when she should give birth. This key is not in the hands of any angel. The second key, that of rain, is also not in the hands of any angel, but in the hands of the Holy One. The third key, to make the dead alive again, is in the hands of the Holy One.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">Imre Noam, Exodus, 15:1.</i>
<i>Imre Noam</i> writes further. “<i>They sank like lead</i>” [15:10]. There were many Egyptians who knew magic. When they came into the sea, they flew out of the water toward the sky. <i>Michael</i> and <i>Gabriel</i> came and hit them on their heads and they immediately fell into the water like lead.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">Imre Noam, Exodus, 15:10.</i>
<i>Imre Noam</i> writes. “<i>Moses caused</i>” [15:22]. This means, Israel did not want to go away from the sea. They were removing much gold and silver from the dead Egyptians. Therefore, Moses caused them to leave quickly, so that they should not tarry, since there was more gold and silver at the sea than in Egypt. Here he asks a question. It is written, “<i>they stripped the Egyptians</i>” [12:36]. Israel emptied Egypt of silver and gold that they borrowed when they left Egypt. The explanation is that they borrowed all the gold and silver that they had in their houses. However, when Pharaoh was to pursue Israel, the Egyptians put on their treasures and they took out all the gold and silver that the kings had accumulated over a long time.<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">Imre Noam, Exodus, 15:22.</i>
“<i>The peoples heard</i>” [15:14]. All the nations heard the great wonders and they were all frightened. The Philistines were also afraid. They thought that Israel would take revenge for killing many hundreds of the children of <i>Ephraim</i>, before the coming of the proper redemption, thirty years before the proper redemption. The rulers of Edom were also very afraid because Esau had hurt Jacob. They thought that they would take revenge on them. The rulers of <i>Moab</i> were afraid because the herders of <i>Lot</i> argued with the herders of Abraham and the Moabites were descended from Lot. The rulers of Canaan were afraid because they knew that Israel would take their land, the land of Israel. Therefore, the Philistines, <i>Moabites</i>, <i>Edomites</i>, and <i>Canaanites</i> were mentioned in the Song.<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 15:14.</i>
“<i>Till your people cross over</i>” [15:16]. God help us until we cross the <i>Arnon</i> and also until we cross the Jordan, which was dry when the priests put their feet into the Jordan. The water moved away and all of Israel crossed the dry Jordan. The priests stood with the ark until all of Israel crossed the Jordan. Therefore, we say two times in the Song, “<i>till Your people crossed, O Lord, till your people cross whom you have ransomed</i>” [15:16], referring to the two rivers, <i>Arnon</i> and <i>Jordan.</i>
“<i>Your people whom you have ransomed</i>” [15:16]. When Israel received the Torah, God bought them forever, like a slave to his master.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 15:16.</i>
“<i>You will bring them and plant them</i>” [15:17]. Moses said: You God should bring Israel into the <i>land of Israel.</i> However, he said Israel but did not mention himself, since the prophecy about him was that he would not be worthy to come to the <i>land of Israel.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Exodus, 15:17.</i>
“<i>The Lord will reign for ever and ever</i>” [15:18]. God should reign over us forever like He reigned at the splitting of the sea. The Holy One did good for the righteous and destroyed the evildoers, so should He be over us forever. That is why “<i>will reign</i>” is written without a <i>vav.</i> That is to say, the Holy One does not come with great labors that he should burden His people with heavy labors. Rather, the Holy One comes with good, soft, comforting words to the people.<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 15:18.</i>
Bahya writes that there are eighteen verses in the Song “<i>Then Moses sang</i>”<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew phrase is “<i>az yashir.</i>” Depending on context, it can be read as being either in the past or future tense. This whole discussion revolves around this grammatical point and its homiletical implications.</i> [15:1–18]. This teaches us that there are eighteen vertebrae in every person’s spine. They will come to life when the Messiah will come, when the dead will come back to life. These eighteen vertebrae will sing the Song. Therefore, it is written, <i>then will sing.</i> This means that in the end Moses and the children of Israel will again sing in the days of the Messiah. It should have written, <i>then Moses sang.</i> This would have meant, he sang at the time when they crossed the sea. However, because it is written <i>then will sing</i>, this means that they will again sing in the days of the Messiah.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 15:1.</i>
“<i>For the horses of Pharaoh</i>” [15:19]. Israel sang the Song while the Egyptians were still in the sea and when Israel had already gone out on to the dry land.<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Exodus, 15:19.</i>
“<i>Then Miriam the prophetess, Aaron</i>’<i>s sister, took a timbrel</i>” [15:20]. The verse tells us that she was the sister of Aaron, even though she is also the sister of Moses. Aaron is not mentioned above in the Song. Therefore, he must be mentioned here and it must say that Miriam is the sister of Aaron. With this, Aaron is mentioned in the Song.<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban, Exodus, 15:20.</i>
The Midrash says that it says, “<i>Then Miriam the prophetess, Aaron</i>’<i>s sister</i>” [15:20]. That is to say, Miriam was a prophetess. When Miriam was the sister of Aaron and Moses had not yet been born, Miriam prophesied that her mother would give birth to a son who would take Israel out of Egypt. Bahya writes further that one should not be surprised that a woman could be a prophetess. They are also people, just like a man, since she was created from man. Similarly, Sarah was a prophetess, much more than her husband <i>Abraham.</i> Miriam sang the Song and all the women followed her, singing praises of the Holy One. Bahya writes further that one should not hold women as nothing and lowly. They are as important as a pious man or a prophet, as we find in the Torah that <i>Abigail</i> was a <i>prophetess.</i> She said and showed that there is definitely a <i>world to come.</i> The <i>world to come</i> is not explicitly written in the Torah. It was through <i>Hannah</i>, who pointed to the <i>resurrection of the dead</i>, that no prophet had demonstrated. This shows us that one should consider women important and keep them before one’s eyes. When she is pious, she is pious without measure. The Talmud says in [tractate] <i>Megillah</i><sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Megillah,</i> 14a.</i> that seven women were <i>prophetesses: Sarah, Miriam, Hannah, Deborah, Huldah, Abigail, and Esther.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 15:20.</i>
“<i>With timbrels</i>” [15:20]. <i>Miriam</i> took a timbrel in her hand and drummed and all the women danced together with joy. Why did <i>Miriam</i> take a timbrel and not another <i>musical instrument?</i> The explanation is that the women should not allow their <i>voices</i> to be heard by the men, since it is a great sin when a strange man hears the singing of a strange woman. It is like he slept with her illicitly. Therefore, since the women and Miriam were singing songs, Miriam thought that the men would hear her voice. Therefore, she took a timbrel and drummed, in the expectation that the men would not hear her voice. Therefore, it is still the custom today at a wedding that when the women sing, they clap with their hands, expecting that the men would not hear their voice. When they pray and the men hear their voice, this is also a sin. The man will have evil thoughts about that woman. The man abrogates his prayers. They should learn from Hannah who prayed silently and only her lips moved and no sound was heard from her mouth, and God accepted her prayer immediately. Our sages learn from her that we should also pray silently and not with shouting.
“<i>They found no water</i>” [15:22]. Israel went for three days in the wilderness and did not find water to drink. It was very warm in <i>Nisan</i> and it was very difficult to go without water for three days. God did all this because He wanted to test if they would speak ill about God. They came to the city of <i>Marah</i> and the water was very bitter, so they could not drink it. Bahya writes that the water was previously sweet, but now the Holy One made the water bitter. Israel was shouting. The children and pregnant women were in pain and difficulty without water, since Israel had taken water with them at the sea. Now, on the third day they finished that water. Therefore, they were shouting to God. Thus, God said to Moses: take a bitter wood and throw it into the water and the water will become sweet. The Holy One made a miracle on top of the earlier miracle. The water had been bitter and the Holy One had him throw the bitter wood into the water and it became sweet. He wanted to show Israel that they should rely on God, who can give them enough of what they need at all times.
“<i>There He made for them a fixed rule</i>” [15:25]. Moses was a king in Israel and he made rules about how they should behave toward each other and also with the many nations who brought all kinds of food and good fruits to sell to the Israelites. Moses made rules about how they should deal with these nations and that they should not engage in <i>falsehood</i> with them. Bahya writes further that Moses taught them which plants were good for remedies and which plants were bad and made someone sick. Therefore, it is written, “<i>there they were tested</i>” [15:25]. They tested the plants to see if Moses was right. Therefore, the verse says so soon, “<i>if you will heed the Lord Your God diligently</i>” [15:26]. That is to say, even though the plants are good and certainly heal, nonetheless, you should not rely on them. You should trust God, Blessed be He, who can help you and heal you of your illness. Therefore, you should not neglect prayer to ask God to heal you.<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 15:25.</i>
“<i>For I the Lord am your healer</i>” [15:26]. I am God your helper and healer from illness and not the plants. <i>Hezekiah</i>, king of Israel, hid the <i>Book of Remedies</i> in which were written all sorts of remedies, for this reason. He hid this book so that people should not rely on the <i>book with remedies</i> and they would not want to call on the Holy One during their illnesses. The Midrash says that the <i>Tree of Life</i> stood near the water. Satan came and took away that Tree of Life, in the expectation that Israel would speak ill of the Holy One. The Holy One immediately showed <i>Moses the Tree of Life.</i> Moses threw it into the water and the Tree of Life immediately removed Satan, and the Holy One made Satan small so that he should not incite Israel. They could not withstand him.<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 15:25.</i>
“<i>If you will heed the Lord Your God diligently</i>” [15:26]. When you will keep the Torah and the commandments, you will never be sick; no form of illness that comes from various forms of food or other forms of illness that comes from the <i>air.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 15:26.</i>
Baal ha-Turim writes. <i>Illness</i> [<i>mahalah</i>] has the same letters as <i>the bread</i> [<i>halehem</i>] and also of <i>the salt</i> [<i>ha-melah</i>]. That is to say, the illnesses that are in the body are eighty-four types of illness. The word <i>mahalah</i> plus one has this numerical value. Thus, one can stop this illness with bread, salt and water. Therefore, the Torah wrote about twelve wells of water, here by <i>mahalah</i>, to show that through salt, bread, and water, one can stop the disease.<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">Baal ha-Turim, Exodus, 15:26.</i>
“<i>Twelve springs</i>” [15:27]. There were twelve springs in the city of Maratha, so that each tribe had its own spring. There were seventy date palms, so that each elder should have a date palm. The water was very sweet, since it is customary that where date palms grow, the water is sweet.<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Exodus, 15:27.</i>
“<i>On the fifteenth day of the second month</i>” [16:1]. Israel ate from the dough that they took out of Egypt for thirty days. When the thirty days ended, it was in the middle of the <i>month of Iyyar.</i> Israel shouted, cried and said that it would have been better if we had stayed in Egypt with our pots of meat that we ate in Egypt. Here we will die from hunger. The Holy One sent down the <i>manna</i> from heaven on the sixteenth day of <i>Iyyar</i>; the manna began to fall on Sunday.<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 16:1.</i>
“<i>Rain down bread from the sky</i>” [16:4]. The Torah calls the <i>manna</i> bread, since even though no bread came down from heaven. The Torah calls the <i>manna</i> bread because they made bread from it. The manna was like small coriander kernels and it was white and sweet as honey. <i>Rabbi Eliezer</i> said. The <i>manna</i> fell to a height of sixty measures. It fell at night when Israel was sleeping in their beds. In the morning, the Israelites came and collected the <i>manna.</i> The Holy One does much good for the righteous while they sleep in their beds. When the <i>Temple</i> stood, the rain always fell on Friday night and Wednesday night and it never rained during the day, in the expectation that it should not disturb their work. So too Hezekiah said to the Holy One. <i>Lord of the Universe</i>, I am not strong enough to defeat the enemies and cannot pursue them. I am also not strong enough to sing songs of praise. I can sleep in my bed and lie in bed for a long time. You, Holy One, should do as You can do The Holy One said: I will do your will. The Holy One did so and sent an angel at night and killed the people of <i>Assyria.</i> Hezekiah slept in his bed, as the verse says, “<i>he provides as much for His loved ones when they sleep</i>” [Psalms, 127:2]. That is to say, the Holy One gives the righteous one when he sleeps in his bed and it does not help the evildoer to wake up early.<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 16:4.</i> “<i>Each man ate a hero</i>’<i>s meal</i>” [Psalms, 78:25]. That is to say, the <i>manna</i> was absorbed in the person’s organs and they had no excrement.<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Yoma</i>, 75b.</i>
“<i>Each day that day</i>’<i>s portion</i>” [16:4]. The <i>manna</i> fell every day in the amount that they needed to eat. The Holy One could have let much <i>manna</i> rain down at one time, but the Holy One wanted to test Israel that they should trust in God every day, to raise their eyes toward heaven to send them the <i>manna</i> and to accustom them to trust in God. <i>Rabbi Eliezer</i> said that a person who has food for today and says, where will I have to eat tomorrow, he has no <i>faith</i> in the Holy One. The Holy One predestined each person’s food. <i>Rabbi Simeon</i> said: why did the Holy One not allow it to rain down at once enough <i>manna</i> for Israel for a year? Because each Israelite and his wife and children should lift their eyes to God to ask for <i>manna.</i> Another explanation is, expecting that Israel should have warm and fresh <i>manna</i> every day. Another explanation, if enough manna would have fallen for a whole year, Israel would have had a heavy load when they traveled. Also, the <i>manna</i> fell by the houses of the righteous, that they should take it immediately. The middling people had to go out to collect it. The evildoers had to go even further.<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 16:4.</i>
“<i>Thus test them, to see whether they will follow My instructions or not</i>” [16:4]. God said: I will give <i>manna</i> to Israel to test them if they will keep My commandments, the several commandments that I commanded concerning the <i>manna.</i> The first is that they should not leave the <i>manna</i> until the next day. They were also warned that they should not go out on the Sabbath to collect <i>manna.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Exodus, 16:4.</i>
On the <i>eve of the Sabbath</i> they should collect <i>double.</i> Each person collected manna on the eve of the Sabbath without measuring and when they came home, each one found two measures for their needs.<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Exodus, 16:5.</i>
“<i>By evening you shall know</i>” [16:6]. Moses and Aaron said to Israel, you will come to know that God has taken you out of Egypt and not I or Aaron, since you said, Moses and Aaron have brought us to the wilderness to kill us. He said: God will give you meat to eat in the evening, since you are not justified in asking for meat. You could easily live without meat. Therefore, He will give it to you at in the evening, at night. However, they justifiably desired the <i>manna</i>, therefore the Holy One gave it to them early in the morning, in the expectation that they should have to prepare for their needs.<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban, Exodus, 16:6.</i>
Bahya writes. “<i>I may thus test them</i>” [16:4]. The <i>manna</i> was given to Israel so that they should be able to study Torah. Therefore, the priests and levites were given the <i>terumot</i> and <i>tithes</i> and from the sacrifices to eat, in the expectation that they should have enough food and should study Torah without hindrance. The Holy One tests the people if they will be pious. Even though the Holy One knows well how it will go. He needs no testing, but the Holy One wants to show the people that the righteous one endures the test. They should also learn from him to do the same, and not to speak ill against the Holy One when He punishes them. Therefore, the Holy One punishes the righteous, as the verse says, “<i>the Lord tests the righteous</i>” [Psalms, 11:5], expecting that they should learn from the righteous one, how he endures what God tests him with, even if he is pious. So should each person also be. He should always praise and serve God, even when he is ringed with troubles. We also find that the Holy One tests the <i>wealthy</i> and the <i>poor.</i> He tests the wealthy one; will he <i>behave</i> properly with his wealth that God has given him. Does he give much charity or not? He tests the <i>poor one</i>, if he will accept his <i>poverty</i> and will not speak against God. The Holy One similarly tests the <i>soul</i>, which comes into the body. Will the soul follow the body and the Evil Inclination or will the soul only follow Torah and commandments, the <i>good inclination?</i> The Holy One does this as a test for the person, to repay each one a good reward for the test.<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 16:4.</i>
“<i>On the sixth day, when they apportion</i>” [16:5]. Moses said to Israel: you should prepare yourselves on Friday. This was the sixth day that the <i>manna</i> started to fall, since the <i>manna</i> started to fall on Sunday.<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 16:5.</i>
“<i>Your grumbling is not against us</i>” [16:8]. From here we learn that whoever argues with a rabbi or a <i>scholar</i> is as if he has argues with the Holy One.<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Sanhedrin</i>, 110a.</i> Therefore, Moses said: your war that you are warring with us, it is as if you were warring with the Holy One.
“<i>In the morning you shall have your fill of bread and you shall know that I the Lord am your God</i>” [16:12]. From here our sages learn that Moses instituted that one should recite the grace after meals after eating. Therefore, the verse says that when you are satiated from eating bread, you should know that God is the one who has sustained you and you should recite the <i>grace after meals.</i> From here our sages learn that the grace after meals is an ordinance from the Torah. However, <i>who brings forth bread from the earth</i><sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote">This is the formula for the blessing before eating bread.</i><i>,</i> was commanded by the sages. They said that one who has eaten is obligated to recite the grace afterwards. All the more so, before he has eaten, he must recite, <i>who brings forth bread from the earth,</i> and praise God.<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 16:12.</i>
“<i>In the evening the quail appeared</i>” [16:13]. A great many good birds called <i>quail</i> came to the Israelites. The Israelites ate the meat and they had the <i>quail</i> for the whole forty years in the desert. The <i>quail</i> came at night and the <i>manna</i> in the morning. Why did the Torah write that the <i>manna</i> was there for forty years and did not write that the <i>quail</i> was for forty years? This is because the <i>manna</i> was full of <i>novelty</i> for them for many months, a new creation from heaven. However, the <i>quail</i> was not a new creation. Therefore, the Torah did not need to say that it was there for forty years. The Midrash writes that the <i>manna</i> fell in the following way. First dew fell from heaven and made the earth smooth and afterwards the <i>manna</i> fell on it and them dew fell again on the <i>manna.</i> Thus it was covered both on top and bottom. Therefore, on the Sabbath, we put a tablecloth on the table, on top of that the cake and on top of the cake another tablecloth, so that one should remember how the <i>manna</i> fell in the wilderness.<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 16:13.</i>
“<i>What is it?</i>” [16:15]. Israel called it <i>manna</i>, which means, a gift given from God from heaven.<sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 16:15.</i>
“<i>As much of it as each of you requires to eat</i>” [16:16]. Our sages said: Moses said to Israel: you should not say that the strong men of Israel will come and take much <i>manna</i> by force and the <i>poor person</i> will have little. Therefore, the verse says, “<i>As much of it as each of you requires to eat.</i>” Each person will eat their fill with a measure called “<i>an omer to a head</i>” [16:16]. If a person would eat this amount, then he will be healthy. However. If he will eat more, he will become sick and will be called a glutton.<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 16:16.</i>
“<i>For those in his tent</i>” [16:16]. That is to say, each one should gather enough that his wife would also have enough to eat, since his wife is called <i>ohel</i> [tent]. This is because she should sit in the house and should not run out.<sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 16:16.</i> From here we learn that each one is <i>obligated</i> to sustain his wife and small children.
“<i>They gathered it every morning</i>” [16:21]. The <i>manna</i> stayed for four hours. The sun came out and made the <i>manna</i> dissolve like water. If a person tarried to collect the <i>manna</i>, they then distributed it to him as one distributes charity, so that the person had enough to eat for that day. There were many <i>miracles</i> connected to the <i>manna.</i> It informed Israel of many <i>secrets</i>, just like a <i>prophet prophesied</i> to the people. When the servant of an Israelite ran to another Israelite’s house, and they had an argument. The Israelite said, I bought the servant from you and the other one said: he ran away from me. They learned through the <i>manna</i> who had told the <i>truth.</i> Where they found an extra measure of <i>manna</i> that is whom the servant belonged to. A certain measure of <i>manna</i> fell before each <i>householder</i>, equal to the number of children, servants or maids that were in his house. The servant was returned to the one where the extra manna was found. Similarly, when a woman argued with her husband and ran away from the house and ran to her father’s house. The woman said that her husband behaved unjustly to toward her. The <i>manna</i> said that the woman was guilty; she began the argument. Moses said: tomorrow morning there will be a <i>judgment.</i> The next morning when <i>manna</i> fell and the extra measure was in her husband’s house, then they understood that woman was guilty. If they found the extra measure in her father’s house, then they understood that the husband was guilty.<sup class="footnote-marker">83</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 16:21.</i>
Similarly, when a woman married a man three months after her husband’s death or divorce, and gave birth to a child six months after the wedding, they did not know if it was a nine month pregnancy from the first husband, or is it a child born in the seventh month from the second husband. They could not understand if the first one or the second one was the father. When the manna fell and the extra measure was in the first husband’s house, then they understood that the child was from the first husband. If the measure was in the second one’s house, then they understood that the child was from the second husband.<sup class="footnote-marker">84</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Yoma</i>, 75a.</i>
<i>Baal ha-Turim</i> writes. When the manna remained and it dissolved like water, great rivers flowed from that <i>manna</i> and the animals drank from these rivers. When the <i>nations of the world</i> ate the animals, the taste of the <i>manna</i> was still in the animals and they wondered how good it was. They said: what a favor the Holy One did for Israel in the wilderness with the eating of the <i>manna.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote">Baal ha-Turim, Exodus, 16:21.</i>
“<i>There were no maggots in it</i>” [16:24]. When a person left extra manna during the week, there were worms in it the next morning. However, on the Sabbath, when <i>manna</i> remained from Friday until the next morning on the Sabbath, there were no worms in it. From here we learn that on the Sabbath the dead in the next world and also in the grave have <i>rest</i> that the worms do not eat them in the <i>grave.</i> So writes Bahya.<sup class="footnote-marker">86</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 16:24.</i>
“<i>Eat it today</i>” [16:25]. “<i>Today</i>” is written three times in the verse. This teaches us that one should make three meals on the Sabbath. One on Friday night, the second meal in the morning and the third meal at the time of the afternoon prayer on the Sabbath. It is an important commandment for the one who observes the three meals on the Sabbath.<sup class="footnote-marker">87</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 16:25.</i>
“<i>Mark that the Lord has given you the Sabbath</i>” [16:29]. The Midrash writes that all the things were <i>doubled</i> on the Sabbath. Each person had a double measure of manna on the <i>Sabbath.</i> The sacrifice for the Sabbath was also doubled, two sheep as a sacrifice on the Sabbath. The one who does not properly observe the Sabbath, his death is inscribed twice. “<i>He who profanes it shall be put to death</i>” [Exodus, 31:14].<sup class="footnote-marker">88</sup><i class="footnote">In the verse it says, “<i>mot yumat.</i>” That is, death is mentioned twice.</i> The one who observes the Sabbath properly, his reward is double and the soul is doubled on the Sabbath. One has two souls on the Sabbath.<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 16:29.</i>
“<i>In order that they may see the bread</i>” [16:32]. The <i>manna</i> was hidden, to be shown in the days of the Messiah. It was hidden in a glass. Aaron’s staff was also hidden and the <i>Ark</i> with its poles. Also other <i>holy vessels</i> were hidden in a cave under the <i>Temple.</i> A glass of manna always stood in the Temple until <i>King Josiah</i> came and hid it in a cave under the Temple. The <i>prophet Jeremiah</i>, when he wanted to punish Israel, said to them: why do you not study Torah? They said: where will we get food when we will study Torah? Jeremiah went and took the glass with <i>manna</i> and showed it to them. See the glass of <i>manna</i> that the Holy One feeds whoever keeps His Torah and commandments; he does not have to worry.
“<i>The Israelites ate manna forty years</i>” [16:35]. The Israelites ate the <i>manna</i> for forty years in the wilderness. Bahya writes here. There is one month missing, since the manna began to fall for Israel in the middle of the <i>month of Iyyar</i> and it should have ended falling in the middle of Iyyar. The Torah says that the <i>manna</i> stopped falling in the middle of the month of <i>Nisan.</i> The explanation is that since it was only less than a month, it is as if it was full. The <i>manna</i> fell for thirty-eight days after the death of Moses, since Moses died on the seventh of <i>Adar.</i> Joshua led Israel and as a result of his merit the <i>manna</i> fell for thirtyeight days until the middle of <i>Nisan.</i> Rashi writes<sup class="footnote-marker">90</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Exodus, 16:35.

Moses died on the seventh of <i>Adar</i> and the manna stopped falling for Israel in that day. However, the <i>manna</i> that fell the day before Moses died was enough for Israel to eat until the middle of <i>Nisan.</i> Also, the <i>unleavened bread</i> that Israel ate when they left Egypt tasted like the <i>manna</i> before the <i>manna</i> began to fall. This lasted until the middle of <i>Iyyar</i> and thus it was a full forty years.<sup class="footnote-marker">91</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 16:35.</i>
“The <i>omer</i> is a tenth of an <i>ephah</i>” [16:36]. The Torah tells us how big a measure of the <i>manna</i> was that the Israelites had in the wilderness, a tenth of an <i>ephah.</i> An <i>ephah</i> was the volume of four hundred and thirty-two eggs. Once can easily measure what a tenth part was, the volume of forty-three and one fifth eggs. This is the amount of dough from which one takes <i>hallah.</i> It must be as big as forty-three and one does the same for unleavened bread on Passover.<sup class="footnote-marker">92</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 16:36.</i>
“<i>The people thirsted there for water</i>” [17:3]. When Israel came to the city of <i>Rephidim</i>, they shouted that they had no water to drink and they said to Moses. Why have you taken us out of Egypt to kill us with thirst? Moses shouted to God. The Israelites are close to stoning me; it lacks little. The Holy One responded to Moses: go before Israel and see if they will stone you. That is to say, I can certainly rescue you and why do you suspect that Israel want to stone you?<sup class="footnote-marker">93</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Exodus, 17:4–5.</i>
“<i>The rod with which you struck the Nile</i>” [17:5]. Take your staff in your hand, the one you hit the Nile with and turned it into blood and evil. However, now the staff will be reversed for good, that out of a rock much good water will flow through the staff with which you will strike the rock. <i>Bahya</i> writes. No prophet had this staff in his hand to do wonders, other than Moses. Even <i>Joshua his disciple</i> did not have this staff. Joshua had a spear in his hand when he waged war after the death of Moses. A staff alludes to the <i>authority</i> that ministers and kings have in their hands. However, a spear alludes to someone who sacrifices himself in war and does not allude to authority. The Israelites said that the staff was prepared only to bring evil and plagues. The Holy One said: take the staff and hit the rock and water will flow from it and this will be good for Israel. That is to say, they should not say that the staff only causes evil and no good.<sup class="footnote-marker">94</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 17:5.</i>

“<i>Amalek came</i>” [17:8]. Amalek came to wage war with Israel because Israel said much ill that God was not always with them, and with that they sinned. The Holy One said: I am always prepared to help Israel with their needs and they speak ill of Me. Therefore, I will send <i>Amalek</i> against them to attack them.

Bahya writes that Amalek was a great astrologer and very wise. He chose such men for his war who would certainly not die in that year, expecting that Israel would not be able to kill them. Therefore, Moses said: choose such men that we will be able to kill Amalek. Therefore, it is written here, “<i>Joshua overwhelmed</i>” [17:13]. That is to say, <i>Joshua</i> only made the Amalekites weak, but Joshua was not able to kill them, since they were destined to remain alive that year.<sup class="footnote-marker">98</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 17:9.</i>

“<i>Moses, Aaron and Hur</i>” [17:10]. They went to the top of the hill and were fasting and repenting. Therefore, the three of them went to pray. When Moses raised his hands to heaven, the Israelites defeated the Amalekites. When Moses lowered his hands, the Amalekites defeated the Israelites. When Moses’ hands became too heavy to hold up to heaven, they took a stone and placed it under Moses and he sat on it. Aaron and Hur supported Moses’ hands that they should be raised to heaven. Why did Moses’ hands become heavy? Because he told Joshua to go and did not go to war himself, therefore, he sinned and his hands became heavy. Moses sat on the stone and did not put a cushion under him, so that it was hard. He said: Israel is in <i>pain</i>, then I must also suffer.<sup class="footnote-marker">102</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Exodus, 17:10–12.</i>
“<i>Until the sun set</i>” [17:12]. Moses held his hands and with his prayers caused that the sun and the moon changed and they were not in their proper place.

Therefore, Moses caused the sun and the moon to change, so that they should not be able to rely on the sun or the moon.<sup class="footnote-marker">103</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Exodus, 17:12.</i>

“<i>Inscribe this in a document as a reminder</i>” [17:14]. God said to Moses: write in the Torah that Amalek hurt Israel. Therefore, Israel should eternally take revenge on Amalek. Hizkuni writes.

However, we do not have this book in our <i>generations</i>; it has been lost.<sup class="footnote-marker">105</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Exodus, 17:14.</i>
“<i>I will utterly blot out the memory of Amalek</i>” [17:14]. The Holy One said: erase his name on the earth. That is to say, erase his angel in heaven and then his name on the earth. Many <i>nations</i> will come in the days of the Messiah to <i>convert</i> and will have a share in the Holy One, to worship Him properly. However, <i>Amalek</i> and Esau will never have a share in God. When the Holy One will have a proper <i>revenge</i> on Esau and Amalek, at that time the <i>throne</i> of the Holy One will become just and will be sanctified, as the verse says, “<i>For liberators shall march up on Mount Zion to wreak judgment on Mount Esau; and dominion shall be the Lord</i>’<i>s</i>” [Obadiah, 1:21].

Amen.<sup class="footnote-marker">106</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 17:14, 16.</i>

Yitro

“<i>Yitro heard</i>” [18:1]. <i>King Solomon</i> said: “<i>a healing tongue is a tree of life</i>” [Proverbs, 15:4]. That is to say, the tongue is a great remedy for the soul when it is sinful. The tongue makes healing words for the <i>soul.</i> A <i>sickness</i> for the soul is the sin that he does not properly believe in the Holy One with his whole heart. With his tongue he can heal the soul, with that which he speaks with his tongue, how the Holy One is a God over all gods and a truthful God. He repays each one his proper reward, as we find concerning Abraham our Patriarch. Our sages say that a beautiful pearl hung from Abraham’s throat. Every sick person who looked at it was healed. When Abraham died, he hung the pearl on the sun in heaven. That is to say, the sages <i>alluded</i> to a pearl that hangs on the throat. That is to say, good words that come out of his throat, like a beautiful pearl. This was where Abraham spoke to the people that they should convert and he brought them to worship the Holy One with truth. When Abraham died, he did not leave anyone behind who could convince the people to convert. Thus, he hung the pearl on the sun in heaven. That is, when the people will know that there is one God in heaven. One can understand this from the sun, which always rises in the east and sets in the west. Thus, there must be a God who always guides the sun. Similarly, the good words from the tongue of Moses that he persuaded Yitro that he should convert. He told <i>Yitro</i> all the signs that the Holy One had done for Israel and as a result, <i>Yitro</i> converted. Concerning this, the verse says here, “<i>Yitro heard all that God had done for Israel</i>” [18:1]. Yitro heard all the signs and wonders that the Holy One had done for Israel and therefore he converted.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, Yitro Introduction.</i>
Bahya writes. There are some sages who say that Yitro came to Moses when the Torah was given on Mount Sinai. This is shown from the verse “<i>I made known the laws and teachings of God</i>” [18:16]. That is to say, Moses said to Yitro: I am teaching the Torah to Israel. Thus, it was heard that the Torah must been given. Furthermore, it is written, “<i>Moses bade his father-in-law farewell</i>” [18:27]. Moses sent his father-in-law away. Thus, from this is heard that the Torah must have been given. If the Torah had not yet been given, how is it possible that Moses would send his father-in-law away? He should have let him wait at Mount Sinai to see how God would give the Torah with wonders and God would appear. However, if the Torah had previously been given, then it was proper to send Yitro. Bahya asks a question. How could it be that the Torah was already given and why did Moses tell Yitro all the wonders of Egypt and did not tell him about the wonders, noise and fire that God had done on Mount Sinai. If he had told him the wonders of the Torah, he would have quickly converted. Therefore, Bahya and also Ramban write that <i>Yitro</i> came before the Torah was given.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 18:1.</i> Therefore, Moses did not tell Yitro about the Torah that would be given later and the signs that would be at Mount <i>Sinai.</i> He might believe them or not, but the signs happened. The whole world heard that the sea split. All the waters in the world split. In the war with Amalek the sun stood still and the whole world knew that this was for the sake of Israel.
Therefore, Rashi writes, “<i>Yitro heard.</i>” He heard the war on Amalek,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Exodus, 18:1.</i> that the sun stood still, and heard that the sea was split, and also all the waters in the world split. Yitro saw this with his own eyes. Therefore, he converted and here it is written, Moses said to Yitro. He taught the Torah to Israel before it had been given. The explanation is that several commandments were given before the Torah was given on Mount Sinai, as <i>laws</i>, Sabbath and Moses taught some more commandments of this type, before the <i>giving of the Torah.</i> Moses sent Yitro away when the Torah had not yet been given. He should have let him wait until the Torah was given. The explanation is that Yitro went home and soon turned around and returned to Mount Sinai. There he found <i>all of Israel</i> at Mount <i>Sinai.</i> Why was the section about <i>Yitro</i> written near the section about <i>Amalek?</i> This teaches that Amalek was related to us through Esau, who did much evil to Israel. Yitro was a stranger, not related to Israel, and joined Israel and did much good for Israel. Therefore, Yitro was written for much good in the Torah, and God commanded that Amalek’s name be erased from heaven and earth. Another explanation is that it is known that Esau was an evildoer to Israel all the time in all generations. It was the first war of Amalek. Nobody had ever waged war with Israel first, but Esau, that is Amalek, began first. Similarly, the last war will be with Esau in the days of the Messiah. Just as <i>Moses and Joshua</i> helped Israel, similarly in final <i>war</i> with Esau the helper will be the prophet Elijah, and the Messiah of Joseph. The <i>prophet Elijah</i> who is from the <i>tribe of Levi</i>, like Moses was from the tribe of Levi, and the Messiah of Joseph will be from the tribe of Ephraim, just like <i>Joshua</i> was from the tribe of Ephraim. Just as by the first war many converted, so too in the days of the Messiah many will convert. Therefore, it is written in the portion of giving the Torah on Mount Sinai. When the Messiah will come, the Torah and great intelligence will come to Israel and afterwards will be the <i>Day of Judgment.</i> Therefore, the portion of “<i>These are the rules</i>” [Exodus, 21:1–24:18] follows the portion of “<i>Yitro heard</i>” [Exodus, 18:1–20:26]. This shows that the Holy One will give <i>rules</i> and <i>laws</i> to the people in the days of the Messiah.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 18:1.</i>
Yitro had seven names in the Torah. He was called <i>Yeter</i> first and when he converted the Holy One added a <i>vav</i> to his name and called him Yitro.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Exodus, 18:1.</i>
“<i>For Moses and for Israel</i>” [18:1]. The Torah teaches us that Moses’ <i>merits</i> were equal to those of all of Israel.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Exodus, 18:1.</i>
“<i>After she had been sent home</i>” [18:2]. When the Holy One first told Moses to leave Midian for Egypt, Moses took his wife Zipporah and his children. Aaron came toward him and asked: who are they? Moses answered: These are my wife and children. Aaron asked: we are anguished over the wives and children that we have in Egypt, and you want to bring more of them to Egypt into exile? Immediately, Moses sent his wife and children again to Midian, to her father.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Exodus, 18:2.</i>
Now Yitro was again taking Zipporah and her children to Moses in the desert. One son was called <i>Gershom.</i> Moses said: I was a <i>stranger</i> in a strange land. The other one was called <i>Eliezer.</i> Moses said: God was my help and saved me from the sword of Pharaoh. Here one asks a question. Why did Moses not call his first son <i>Eliezer</i>, that God had helped him from the sword of Pharaoh? The explanation is that Yitro stipulated to Moses that the first son should be for the worship of a foreign god. Therefore, Moses did not want to mention the name of the Holy One for his first son. Therefore, Moses also did not circumcise him. He was afraid of Yitro, and the angel wanted to kill him. <i>Zipporah</i> went and <i>circumcised</i> him. Yitro forgave his daughter that she had circumcised her son. Therefore, it is written, “<i>that is to say, I have been a stranger</i>” [18:3]. That is to say, Moses was defending himself why he did not circumcise him, and why he did not call his first son <i>Eliezer.</i> He did it all because of Yitro, who had forbidden him to circumcise him. Concerning Eliezer it is not written, “<i>that is to say.</i>” He did not want to reveal and show that he had called him Eliezer. That is, because he was protected from Pharaoh, so that people would not inform on him to Pharaoh.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mekhiltah de Rabbi Ishmael</i>, <i>Yitro</i>, 1.</i>
Hizkuni asks a question. Why is it written, “<i>the one was named Eliezer</i>” [18:4]. This means, one son was called Eliezer. It should have said, <i>the name of the second one</i>, because he was the second son. The explanation is because it was appropriate that they should have named the first son <i>Eliezer</i>, because he was saved from the sword of Pharaoh. Therefore, it is written, “<i>the one was named.</i>” That is, just like he was the first one because he was named Eliezer for the first <i>miracle.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Exodus, 18:4.</i>
“<i>He sent word to Moses, I, your father-in-law Yitro, am coming to you</i>” [18:6]. Yitro said to Moses. I, your father-in-law, am coming to you. Here one asks a question. How could Yitro come in to Moses? Israel was completely surrounded by clouds and no person could enter. The explanation is that he shot an arrow from a bow with a letter tied to the arrow. It flew through the cloud and Moses read the letter. I, Yitro, your father-in-law, am coming to you.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanhuma</i>, <i>Yitro</i>, 6.</i>
Yitro said to Moses. Come out for my sake. If you do not want to come out for my sake, come out for your wife’s sake. If you do not want to come out for your wife’s sake, come out for your children’s sake. Then Moses came out. When <i>Moses</i> went out, <i>Aaron, Nadav and Avihu</i> followed him. When <i>all of Israel</i> saw that Moses and Aaron went out, then many important people from Israel also went out. Thus, Yitro received great honor that many important Israelites went to meet Yitro.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Exodus, 18:6–7.</i> Moses bowed down and kissed Yitro, his father-in-law.
“<i>Yitro rejoiced</i>” [18:9]. Yitro rejoiced at the good things that the Holy One had done for Israel. At the same time, Yitro was upset that so many gentiles were killed. From this we learn that we should not embarrass any gentile before a convert, since he is nostalgic that he was also once a gentile.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Exodus, 18:9.</i>
“<i>Now I know</i>” [18:11]. Yitro said: now I know that God in heaven is over all the gods on the earth. Yitro had worshipped all the foreign gods in the world. Therefore, I know well that God in heaven is the best God of all gods.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Exodus, 18:11.</i>
“<i>By the result of their schemes against [the people]</i>” [18:11]. The Holy One repaid the Egyptians as they did to Israel. They wanted to drown their children in the water. The Holy One rescued the children and what the Egyptians had intended; God did to them and drowned them all in the water.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Exodus, 18:11.</i>
“<i>Before God with Moses</i>’ <i>father-in-law</i>” [18:12]. Yitro made a banquet and brought it before God. He made a banquet that he had circumcised himself and <i>immersed</i> in water. The food was so that the body should <i>rejoice</i> and that the <i>Shekhinah</i> should rest on them. The <i>Shekhinah</i> does not rest on a sad body, as we find concerning <i>Isaac.</i> He wanted to bless <i>Jacob</i>, so he had good food made for himself, so that the <i>Shekhinah</i> should be with him at the blessing of Jacob.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 18:12.</i>
“<i>Before God</i>” [18:12]. The banquet was before God. That is to say, this teaches us that when a person eats at a banquet where there are <i>scholars</i>, this is like he derived pleasure from the Holy One Himself.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Exodus, 18:12.</i>
“<i>Next day</i>” [18:13]. It was one day after <i>Yom Kippur</i> when Moses sat down to act as judge for the people. <i>All of Israel</i> were standing before Moses, like one stands before a king. Yitro saw this and it saddened him that <i>all of Israel were disregarded.</i> Yitro said: Why are you sitting and <i>all of Israel</i> is standing?<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Exodus, 18:13.</i>
<i>Hizkuni</i> asks a question. Why did <i>Yitro</i> say to Moses, why are you sitting and <i>all of Israel</i> should stand? The <i>rule</i> is that the <i>judge</i> must sit and those who come before the <i>judge</i> must stand. He asks further. How is it appropriate that Yitro should punish such an important person like Moses? The explanation is that Yitro said: why are you sitting alone? That is to say, take more <i>judges</i> in addition to you who will help <i>judge.</i> Yitro did not say, why are you sitting Moses and <i>all of Israel</i> is standing? He knew very well that all of Israel had to stand, but Yitro said: do not sit alone. Take more judges and Moses did not understand Yitro. Moses thought that he was asking why the Israelites were standing. Therefore, Moses answered: the Israelites want judgment and therefore I must let Israel stand.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Exodus, 18:14.</i>
“<i>From morning until evening</i>” [18:13]. <i>All of Israel</i> were standing from morning until evening. Rashi asks here. How is it possible that Moses should have judged the whole day? When did he teach Torah to Israel? The explanation is that this teaches us that when a <i>judge</i> dispenses proper justice for one hour, it is as if he had studied Torah the whole day. It also teaches that when a judge gives a proper judgment, that judge is comparable to the Holy One with his good deeds. It is like he helped create heaven and earth, since the world stands on justice.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Exodus, 18:13.</i>
“<i>You will surely wear yourself out</i>” [18:18]. Yitro said to Moses: you will not be able to endure this. You want to judge the people alone. You will collapse and, <i>heaven forbid</i>, Israel with you. If <i>Aaron</i> and <i>Hur</i> would still be alive and would be with you, it would not help you. That is to say, <i>Hur</i> had been killed previously, during <i>the episode of the Golden calf.</i> Therefore, Yitro said: even if Hur had been alive, it would not help you. You will not be able to endure and it is very difficult for the people to stand for a whole day, until each one’s case would be adjudicated.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Exodus, 18:18.</i>
Bahya writes. Moses responded: many Israelites come and each one desires that I should pray about their illnesses. Some want to know where they will find things that they lost. Some desire that I should give them justice. Yitro responded: pray to God for Israel and teach Torah, but to give justice you will not be able to endure alone. You must take other wise men of Israel.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 18:19–20.</i>
“<i>You shall seek out</i>” [18:21]. You should choose wise men to sit in judgment. Bahya asks a question here. Why is it not written, <i>select</i>, which means choose? The explanation is that <i>seek out</i><sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew term is <i>tehaze,</i> which comes from the same root as <i>hazon</i>, or vision in the prophetic sense.</i> is written, because this means prophecy. That is to say, one should choose wise men who are pious. One cannot immediately know which ones are pious, except with prophecy. <i>Seek out</i> shows us that Moses was wise and could understand from a person’s face, who was pious. Therefore, it is written, “<i>You shall seek out.</i>” That is, you yourself must choose with your wisdom, since you understand from a person’s face if they are pious. “<i>Capable men</i>” [18:21]. The <i>judge</i> should also have good attributes. He should always think that there is a sword at his throat and Gehenna is open under him. He must give proper judgments, then he is protected from both deaths. If he does an injustice, then the sword falls on him and he falls into Gehenna. “<i>Truthful men</i>” [18:21]. The <i>judge</i> must always adhere to the truth. “<i>Who spurn ill gotten gain</i>” [18:21]. The judge should hate money, even the money of strangers. He should not fear any person, even if a person would say to the <i>judge</i>, I will burn your house if you will not help me with the judgment. Even more so, the <i>judge</i> should not fear and should risk his money and give a proper judgment.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 18:21.</i>
“<i>Let them judge the people at all times</i>” [18:22]. Other <i>judges</i> will be able to give proper judgments at all times, since they have the time. However, you Moses do not have the time. You must often speak with the Shekhinah. Also, the number of people is too large that they should all come to you for judgment.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Exodus, 18:22.</i>
“<i>Chiefs of thousands</i>” [18:21]. Moses chose a <i>judge</i> for every thousand Israelites to judge them. Thus, there were six hundred <i>judges.</i> Similarly, for every hundred men a judge and there were six thousand <i>judges.</i> Moses also chose a <i>judge</i> for every fifty men and there were twelve thousand of these judges. Moses then chose a <i>judge</i> for every ten men in Israel and there were sixty thousand of them.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Exodus, 18:21.</i>
<i>Hizkuni</i> asks a question. According to this <i>calculation</i> there were seventyeight thousand and six hundred <i>judges.</i> The Israelites were a full six hundred thousand men. Were there a full six hundred thousand men, if that many judges were taken away and were not in the number of six hundred thousand? The explanation is that the <i>judges</i> were always beyond the six hundred thousand. That is, there were six hundred thousand without them. Another explanation is that all the <i>judges</i> were older than sixty years old and these were not counted among the Israelites. They only counted those who were over twenty until sixty. Those under twenty and more than sixty were not counted. Another explanation that <i>Hizkuni</i> gives is that the <i>judges</i> were among the six hundred thousand, and were included in that <i>calculation.</i> Each judge of a thousand was included in his thousand. Similarly, each one over a hundred was counted in his hundred, and so with all the others.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Exodus, 18:21.</i>
“<i>On the third month</i>” [19:1]. The Israelites came to the <i>wilderness of Sinai</i> on the <i>first day of Sivan.</i> On that day the Israelites left <i>Rephidim</i> and came to the <i>wilderness of Sinai</i> and they rested opposite the mountain. Therefore, it is written, “<i>he rested</i>,” as if one person rested opposite the mountain. It should have said: <i>they rested.</i> This means, they all rested. The explanation is that they all rested with one heart and one mind, like it was one person who would receive the Torah, all together with good will. However, when it is written, <i>they rested</i>, this means that they argued and there were many opinions among them.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Exodus, 19:2.</i>
Bahya writes. The <i>first day of Sivan</i> was a Monday and they came to the mountain on Tuesday, where the Holy One commanded several commandments. On Wednesday, Moses said to God that Israel would receive the Torah with their whole hearts. On Thursday, Moses said to Israel that they should separate from their wives for three days, Thursday, Friday, and <i>Saturday</i>, which was the sixth day of <i>Sivan.</i> The Holy One gave the Torah on the Sabbath. Therefore, we recite, “<i>Moses rejoiced</i>”<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">The opening words of a prayer in the Sabbath <i>shaharit Amidah.</i></i> on the Sabbath. This is because the Torah was given on the Sabbath through Moses.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 19:2.</i>
“<i>Say to the house of Jacob</i>” [19:3]. You Moses should tell the commandments very slowly and beautifully to the women. Therefore, the Holy One told him to go to the women first, since the women have weak minds to receive the Torah. Therefore, one must first tell them about some commandments, since they do not have as much <i>sense</i> as the men to study Torah and commandments. Bahya writes another explanation. The woman is a big help in the study of Torah. She accustoms her son very early to study Torah and takes her son to the <i>teacher</i> with good words, more than her husband, because she is always in the house. She is also compassionate to her son and therefore, the woman should pray when they light the candles on the Sabbath that God should give her children who should shine in the Torah, since the prayer will be accepted. When a person performs a commandment, the person should pray at the same time. So too, when the woman lights candles on the <i>eve of the Sabbath</i>, she should pray that her son should shine in the Torah like a candle. Therefore, the verse here says, first command several commandments to the women and afterwards to the men.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 19:3.</i>
“<i>You have seen what I did to the Egyptians</i>” [19:4]. The Holy One said that He first pays each one their reward that he earned. Therefore, he said to Israel: you should keep My commandments, then you will have a good reward. I will punish the one who will transgress My commandments, since you have seen that I have taken you out of Egypt, so that you will receive the Torah. I punished the Egyptians for their evil deeds.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 19:4.</i>
“<i>How I bore you on eagles</i>’ <i>wings</i>” [19:4]. I carried you in My hands, like an eagle carries its children. All of the birds carry their children from the nest between their feet. They are afraid to carry their children on their wings, because another bird might come and take away their children from their wings, from above. However, the eagle flies much higher than the other birds. Therefore, he carries his children on his wings. He is not afraid of the other birds. However, the eagle does not want to carry his children between his feet. He says that the will shoot with arrows at my children. Therefore, I will carry them above, on my wings. It is better that they shoot at me than at my children. So too says the Holy One. It is better that they should shoot at My clouds and not at the children of Israel. The cloud carried them like an eagle carries its children.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Exodus, 19:4.</i>
“<i>You will be My treasured possession</i>” [19:5]. You Israel should be the most beloved of all nations and therefore, the verse says, “<i>treasured possession.</i>” That is to say, just like the king hides a treasure of <i>precious stones</i> near himself. So too, are Israel close to the Holy One. He is their protector. However, other nations are in the hands of the angels in heaven.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 19:5.</i>
“<i>All the earth is Mine</i>” [19:5]. The Holy One said: you should serve Me. I can repay you a good reward. The whole earth is Mine to do good to the one who worships Me properly.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 19:5.</i>
“<i>Summoned the elders of the people</i>” [19:7]. Moses came and called the elders and told them everything that God said about giving them the Torah. All of Israel responded together, we will receive the Torah. Moses returned to God and said that Israel would receive the Torah. Bahya asks a question. The Talmud says<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Shabbat,</i> 88a.</i> that the Holy One raised a mountain over Israel and said: if Israel would not accept the Torah, then I will throw the mountain on them and bury them. Here one asks a question. It says explicitly here that Israel willingly received the Torah from God. The explanation is that the Torah that is written about here is the <i>Pentateuch</i> that the Israelites gladly received. However, the Talmud that Moses received orally, they did not want to receive, since many difficult and harsh commandments were written in it. Therefore, the Holy One wanted to throw a mountain on Israel when they did not want to receive the Talmud. “<i>Moses reported</i>” [19:9]. Bahya writes that Israel desired that the Holy One should speak and they would hear the words from God. That is to say, we will see and hear ourselves.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 19:8.</i>
“<i>I will come to you in a thick cloud</i>” [19:9]. The Holy One said: I will appear in a thick cloud that <i>all of Israel</i> will see and recognize Me. You, Moses, come alone in the fiery cloud and let <i>all of Israel</i> hear that you are speaking with Me. Thus, <i>all of Israel</i> will also be <i>prophets.</i> They will hear Me speak and they will always fear Me and will believe that God speaks with a person. If someone will arise and want to claim to be a better prophet than Moses, then you will all be able to testify that no prophet is comparable to Moses, since you have seen explicitly that Moses was in the fiery cloud and spoke directly with the Holy One, something that no person had been worthy of. All will believe forever that the Holy One speaks with a person and he remains alive. Therefore, the Holy One said: you, Moses, come alone to Me in the cloud and all of Israel will certainly believe you that you are a proper prophet, <i>a trustworthy one.</i> They will keep your prophecy.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 19:9.</i>
“<i>Stay pure today and tomorrow</i>” [19:10]. Each man should not sleep with his wife and they should wash their clothes and they should immerse themselves in water.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 19:10.</i>
“<i>Man or beast</i>” [19:13]. No man or no beast should come to the mountain. Bahya writes. The verse teaches us, neither an evildoer, who is compared to a beast, or a righteous person, they should not touch the mountain. Whoever will touch the mountain with their hand should be killed; they should be stoned. Make a sign around the mountain. “<i>When the ram</i>’<i>s horn sounds a long blast</i>” [19:13]. When a long blast will be sounded with the ram’s horn, then Israel may go on the mountain, since the Shekhinah will have left.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 19:13.</i>
The horn was the horn of the <i>ram</i> that was brought as a sacrifice in place of <i>Isaac.</i> Bahya writes that they burned that ram with horns, flesh and hide. How is it that a horn was made from the horn on Mount <i>Sinai?</i> The explanation is that the Holy One created another <i>ram</i> from the ashes of that ram.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 22:13.</i> So too writes <i>Pirke de Rabbi Eliezer.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Pirke de Rabbi Eliezer</i>, chap. 31.</i> There was nothing in the <i>ram of Isaac</i> that was not utilized for some commandment. First, from the bones a foundation was laid for the <i>altar</i> in the <i>Temple.</i> The sinews were made into the strings of the harp that <i>King David</i> used to play. The hide of the ram was made into the girdle on the back of the <i>prophet Elijah.</i> The horn of the left side was the one blown at Mount <i>Sinai</i>, and the horn of the right side will be blown when the Messiah will come. The right side horn is larger than the left horn. Therefore, it is written, “<i>in that day, a great ram</i>’<i>s horn shall be sounded</i>” [Isaiah, 27:13]. That is, when the Messiah comes, they will blow a great horn. “<i>No hand shall touch him</i>” [19:13]. Bahya asks a question. It is written previously, “<i>whoever touches the mountain shall be put to death</i>” [19:12]. Why doe the verse have to say again, whoever touches the mountain with their hand? The explanation is, “<i>No hand shall touch him</i>” [19:13], means that whoever touches the mountain, should not be put to death with the hand. That is to say, to strangle him or chop off his head. Rather, he should be put to death with stones, so that his body is no touched.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 19:13.</i>
“<i>There was thunder and lightning</i>” [19:16]. There was much <i>noise</i> from the angels that came with the Holy One to Mount <i>Sinai.</i> There was also much lightning and fire. These were all angels, who are lightning and fire. The Holy One made a great cloud between the angels and Israel, in the expectation that Israel should not see the angels since they would be very frightened of the angels.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 19:16.</i>
“<i>Moses led the people toward God</i>” [19:17]. Moses led Israel out toward the angels, close to the mountain. There were twenty-two thousand angels very close to the Holy One. This was equal to the twenty-two thousand <i>Levites</i> who were also close to the Tabernacle, by the Shekhinah. The Midrash writes. On the day that the Torah was given, the sun stood still in the sky. Many dead were resurrected, since many Israelites died of fright and the Holy One brought them back to life. The Midrash writes that the sun stood still in the sky five times. Once at the exodus from Egypt. The second time, at the sea. The third time, with Amalek. The fourth time, at the <i>giving of the Torah.</i> The fifth time, at the river <i>Arnon.</i> All of this occurred during the lifetime of Moses.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 19:17.</i>
“<i>They took their places at the foot of the mountain</i>” [19:17]. Israel stood under the mountain on the place where they were assigned. The Holy One was at the top of the mountain. Moses went up the mountain into the cloud and even into the thick cloud where the Holy One himself was. The mountain was full of smoke. The smoke was not out of the fire that came with the Holy One, since that fire had no smoke, but it was ordinary smoke, not from fire.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 19:17.</i>
“<i>As Moses spoke, God answered him in thunder</i>” [19:19]. It was a great wonder. Israel stood on a place that was three miles long and three miles wide. Moses spoke something on Mount Sinai and <i>all of Israel</i> heard each word clearly. The horn was also continually blowing a strong blast. Nonetheless, they heard Moses speaking and the sound of the horn did not drown out the words of Moses. The Holy One had given Moses the strength to raise his voice very high so that Israel should hear what he was talking with the Holy One.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 19:19.</i>
“<i>The Lord came down upon Mount Sinai</i>” [19:20]. A great fire came down on the mountain when the Holy One came down on Mount Sinai. The Holy One said to Moses: go to Israel that they should be careful not to touch the mountain. They will be killed if they approach the mountain too closely. The <i>priests</i> should also not get too close to the mountain. They should not rely on their importance. Moses responded: I have warned them for three days; they will certainly not touch the mountain. The children of <i>Aaron</i>, <i>Nadav and Avihu</i>, went quickly and saw everything on the cloud where the Holy One was. A person was not supposed to see this and they were guilty of death. However, the Holy One did not want to mar His celebration at Mount Sinai and if He had killed them, it would have been a great anguish for Aaron and Moses. Therefore, the Holy One waited until the <i>month of Nisan</i>, when they were bringing sacrifices that the Holy One killed them.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanhuma</i>, <i>Beha</i>’<i>alotekha</i>, 16.</i> They were burned with a fiery thread into their nostrils so that their <i>body</i> was not burned.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Sanhedrin</i>, 52a.</i>
“<i>The smoke rose to the very skies.</i>”<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">A conflation of Exodus, 19:18 and Deuteronomy, 4:11.</i> When the Holy One came on Mount Sinai there was a great smoke to the heaven, clouds and fog and there was a great rain. The mountain was swaying, wandering and trembling, and many mountains were jumping and dancing. The Israelites were also trembling and swaying, since the earth under them was shaking. They stayed far away from the mountain and they were very afraid of the fire, thunder and lightning.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 19:24.</i>
“<i>Break through to come up</i>” [19:24]. The Holy One said: say to Israel and to the priests that they should not look too much at the cloud where I am.
“<i>All these words, saying</i>” [20:1]. The Holy One said the <i>Ten Statements</i> to Israel completely. Our sages said that the Holy One only said the first two <i>Statements</i> and Moses said the other <i>Statements</i> to Israel and not the Holy One. The explanation is that the Holy One said all the Statements to Israel. Israel only understood the first two, but Israel did not understand the rest of them. Moses had to clearly state the other statements and explain them.<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Exodus, 20:1.</i>
“<i>I the Lord am your God</i>” [20:2]. The Holy One said: know and think in your heart that I am God.
“<i>Who brought you out of Egypt</i>” [20:2]. The Holy One said: it is just that you must accept Me as God because I brought you out of Egypt, and you saw the wonders in Egypt that I did it before your eyes. Therefore, the Holy One did not want to say, you should know that I created heaven and earth, since Israel did not see it with their eyes. However, he said: you should accept Me as God because you saw the wonders in Egypt. Thus, you can also understand that I created heaven and earth. I also watch over every person to pay the one who served Me well to pay them their good reward. I have done much good for you, expecting that you will accept the Torah. I have again punished Pharaoh because he did evil against Me.<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 20:2.</i>
“<i>From the house of bondage</i>” [20:2]. It is just that you should be my servants because I brought you out of the house where you were servants in Egypt.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Exodus, 20:2.</i>
“<i>You shall have no other gods</i>” [20:3]. You should not accept any other god that you will worship, an angel or a constellation in heaven. Why are they called “<i>others</i>” in the verse? That is to say, they are foreign to the people who worship them. That is to say, the person calls on them to help him and they cannot help him because they themselves have no <i>strength.</i> Another explanation, they are called “<i>others</i>” because they are always made different. He makes a god out of wood and then he thinks about it and makes a silver or gold image.<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 20:3.</i>
“<i>You shall not have</i>” [20:3]. Why is it written “<i>to you</i>”? This means, to you alone. It should have said, “<i>you [plural] shall not have.</i>” This would have meant, to you all. The Holy One did speak with many people. The explanation is that the Holy One wanted to give Moses an excuse by the Golden Calf, where Israel sinned. Thus, Moses said to the Holy One: why is Israel guilty that they made the calf? You said on Mount Sinai, “<i>you [singular] shall not have.</i>” That is to say, it is as if you had forbidden me alone not to make a foreign god and not all of Israel.
“<i>Besides Me</i>” [20:3]. As long as I live, you should not make a foreign god. Israel should not think that only those who were at Sinai were forbidden to make foreign gods, but those who will come later will be allowed to make foreign gods. Therefore, the verse says, “<i>Besides Me.</i>” As long as I am here, make no foreign gods.<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Exodus, 20:3.</i>
“<i>An impassioned God</i>” [20:3]. God counts the worship of a foreign god against a person forever, and He does not forgive this sin.<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Exodus, 20:4.</i>
“<i>You shall not make for yourself a sculpted image</i>” [20:4]. The Holy One said: I told you, “<i>You shall not have</i>” [20:3]. You should not have in your thoughts to worship another god. Afterwards, I told you that you should not make a foreign god. You will think of a <i>reason to permit</i> making and to painting an image of the sun or moon or angel. You will say that this is no sin. Through this I will remember that God has created everything. The sun shows that God guides the world because the sun always rises in the east and sets in the west. Thus, there must be a God who always guides it properly. You will similarly say that we make the sukkah to remember that God led us out of Egypt. Similarly, we eat <i>matzoh</i> to remember that God had redeemed us from Egypt. You want to think this way and want to make a picture or a sculpture to remember each of the commandments that are forbidden to you. Later you will make that same thing a god and will worship it. “<i>What is in the heavens above</i>” [20:4]. You should not make an image of heaven. These are the angels. “<i>On the earth</i>” [20:4]. You should not make an image of a person, or domestic and wild animal, or bird that is on the earth. “<i>In the waters</i>” [20:4]. Do not also make any images of demons that are in the abyss under the earth. There are three types of demons. Some live in the <i>ether</i> under heaven. These demons cause people to have dreams at night. There are some demons that live with us on the earth among people. These demons cause a person to sin and transgress. Some are in the abyss of the earth. If they had the power to leave the abyss, they might destroy the world.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 20:4.</i>
“<i>Visiting the guilt of the parents upon the children</i>” [20:5]. The Holy One remembers the sin of the father for the son and punishes the son for the sin that the father had done when the son also does these deeds, he is punished double for the sin of the father and for his sin.<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Exodus, 20:5.</i>
“<i>Showing kindness to the thousandth generation</i>” [20:6]. However, if the father is pious, then his children benefit from his merit until the thousandth <i>generation.</i> From here we learn that the good attribute of the Holy One is much greater than His evil attribute. When the father is an evildoer, then the Holy One remembers the sin for four <i>generations.</i> However, when the father is pious, the Holy One remembers his merit for the children for a thousand generations.<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Exodus, 20:6.</i>
“<i>You shall not swear falsely by the name of the Lord your God</i>” [20:7]. You should not swear falsely. Bahya writes. The verse should have said, “<i>you shall not swear by Me.</i>” This would mean, you should not swear by My name, because the Holy One Himself said everything. <i>Ramban</i> gives this explanation. This teaches us that the Holy One said the first two <i>Statements</i>, “<i>I</i>” and “<i>you shall not</i>” to Israel Himself. These are the <i>essential Statements</i> that one should accept God to serve Him, and one should serve no false gods. However, Moses said the other Statements, from his mouth to Israel. Therefore, it is written, “<i>You shall not swear falsely by the name of the Lord</i>,” and it is not written, <i>My name</i> since the Holy One did not say the <i>Statement</i> Himself. Why is the statement of swearing falsely stated near the worship of foreign gods? Because they are both against the Holy One. Whoever swears falsely is like one who worshiped a foreign god. When he swears that God is just, so he is also just with his swearing. When he swears falsely, then, heaven forbid, the Holy One is also false. He falsifies the Holy One with his false swearing. We find concerning <i>King Saul</i> that he wanted to kill his son <i>Jonathan</i> because of an oath, which <i>Jonathan</i> did not hear. Yet, Saul wanted to kill him, but all of Israel said and pleaded for Jonathan. They said that he did not hear the oath. We also find that when someone swears falsely, it is as if one had sexual relations with a <i>married woman.</i> It is written here, “<i>will not clear one</i>” [20:7]; he is not cleared by God, and concerning a <i>married woman</i>, it is also written, “<i>will not clear one</i>” [Proverbs 6:29]. We also find that the Holy One brought a great famine in <i>the land of Israel</i>, because of false oaths that Saul had sworn. As soon as the guilty ones were killed, the famine ended. We find no reward for the <i>Ten Statements</i> except concerning the one who honors father and mother. It is written how this will lengthen their life. Again, concerning the worship of foreign gods and <i>false oaths</i>, it is written how God will sternly punish them. This shows that <i>false oaths</i> are comparable to the worship of foreign gods, and many people think that the sin is not. However, in truth it is worse than all the sins, than murder or engaging in illicit sexual relations. A person cannot always do this, because he is afraid of people. However, swearing falsely, he does a thousand times a day. He is not afraid of any person and there is no sin that is more common in Israel than swearing falsely. Thus, it is not newsworthy why the Messiah does not come. When a person at times commits a murder, he does this because he wants revenge. Similarly, he engages in illicit sexual relations to satisfy his lusts and desires. The one who steals wants to have the money. The one who gives false testimony is seeking revenge, but the one who swears falsely, what benefit does he have from it, and he <i>desecrates the name of God.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 20:7.</i>
“<i>Remember the Sabbath day and keep it holy</i>” [20:8]. Since the Holy One has commanded us to honor Him and not worship another god. Therefore, God again commanded us that one should endeavor to rest one day in the week, to remember that God created the world and did many wonders for us in Egypt. “<i>Keep it holy</i>” [20:8]. You should keep the Sabbath holy. You should not do or even think about your money or body, but you should do holy things and properly observe the Sabbath. One should study Torah on the Sabbath. The Holy One forgives the sins of whoever properly observes the Sabbath. A story happened. <i>Turnus Rufus</i> the evildoer encountered <i>Rabbi Akiva</i> on the Sabbath. He said to him: why is this day better than other days? <i>Rabbi Akiva</i> said to him: why are you more important than other people? He responded: the lord made me important. Rabbi Akiva responded: The Holy One who is our Lord, also made this day important. Turnus Rufus said: if the Holy One wanted that this day should be more important than other days, why does He Himself work on the Sabbath? He makes the rain fall on the Sabbath. He leads the clouds from afar on the Sabbath. Rabbi Akiva responded: You are indeed an expert in the Torah of Israel. When two <i>householders</i> live in one courtyard, they must make an <i>eruv</i> if they want to carry things. However, when one <i>householder</i> owns a courtyard, even if it is three miles long, he is allowed to carry without an <i>eruv.</i> So too, the whole world belongs to the Holy One, so He can carry in the whole world, since no creature has a share of the world. Therefore, the Holy One can let the rain fall and bring clouds to carry the water in the world on the Sabbath. Furthermore, <i>Rabbi Akiva</i> said: The Israelites did not collect the <i>manna</i> on the Sabbath. It did not fall on the Sabbath and also the river <i>Sambatyon</i> rests on the Sabbath, but flows the rest of the week. The evildoer said: leave aside the <i>manna</i> since I have not seen it and the <i>Sambatyon</i> is also not found among us. Rabbi Akiva said: go to your father’s grave and let him be brought up alive and see if he will arise through magical means on the Sabbath? During the week when one would use magic, he would rise. This story is found in the <i>Torah portion of Bereshit</i>, and on the Sabbath the evildoers in Gehenna have rest. When the eve of the Sabbath comes, a <i>heavenly voice</i> goes forth. Let the evildoers rest. An angel who is called <i>Dumah</i> is appointed to judge them during the week. When the Sabbath ends and Israel have recited <i>Vayehi Noam</i> and <i>Ata Kadosh</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">Two prayers in the evening prayers that mark the end of the Sabbath.</i> the same angel shouts, you evildoers go into Gehenna again, since Israel have finished <i>Vayehi Noam</i> and <i>Ata Kadosh.</i> Therefore, it is the custom that one should not immediately recite <i>Vayehi Noam</i> and <i>Ata Kadosh</i> when it becomes fully dark. On should say it slowly and not rush through the recitation, expecting that those in Gehenna should enter it, only when one finishes <i>Ata Kadosh.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 20:8.</i>
“<i>Six days you shall labor and do all your work</i>” [20:9]. When the Sabbath begins, you should think that you have completed all your work. That is to say, do not think about your work. The Holy One can easily make it happen that you will not have to work.<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Exodus, 20:9.</i>
“<i>Honor your father</i>” [20:12]. The Holy One wrote first that one honor Him, since He is the first father to people. Afterwards, one should honor one’s own father and mother. The father and mother helped bring him into the world. So too, like his father the person should recognize that God exists, just as he recognizes his father and mother and does not deny them. He should also not swear falsely by the life of his father and mother, just as with the Holy One. He should also not honor and serve his father because of money that he will inherit from him. Similarly, he should not serve the Holy One because of money. He is also obligated to give his father food, drink, and clothes, and keep him in his house. Similarly, he is obligated to honor the Holy One with his money. That is, to give <i>charity and tithes.</i> Why did the Torah write that when he will honor his father, he would live long, more than any other of the <i>Ten Statements? Rabbi Saadia</i> writes an explanation. It sometimes happens that the father lives a long time with his son. Thus, it is difficult for the son to always honor his father. Therefore, the Torah writes, honor your father and mother so that you will live long. That is to say, you must honor your father. If you will not want to honor him, then you will remember that he is with you for a long time. Therefore, know that you are troubling yourself about your own life; you are living long for the sake of your father.<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 20:12.</i>
<i>Toldot Yizhak</i> gives an explanation. When you will honor your father and mother you will be worthy that you will be honored. The same is when you will become old. They will stand for you and other honors that one does for an elder. Therefore, the Torah said: honor your father and mother and you will live long and become old.<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Exodus, 20:12.</i>
“<i>You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor</i>” [20:13]. You should not give false testimony against your fellow. Bahya asks a question. Why is it not written, <i>you should not give false testimony against your brother?</i> The explanation is that He wants to show us that one should not even testify falsely against a gentile, who is not your brother, but nonetheless is your fellow. Another explanation is that it is not written <i>your brother</i> is because they understand that one should not give false testimony about his brother, and true testimony one is allowed to give. The truth is that on should not testify, not even true testimony about his brother or a relative, even when it is not false.<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 20:16.</i>
“<i>You shall not covet</i>” [20:14]. It is known that the lusts that a person covets and desires, money and goods from his friend, this depends on the heart and the sin is great. The whole world commits this transgression. Therefore, it is not written in the <i>Ten Statements</i> that one should not rob because it is written, “<i>You shall not covet.</i>” One should not covet; since this is like he robbed it and the person should see that the Torah prohibited even coveting. How much more so, it is forbidden to rob. However, we find that a lust is permitted and one is allowed to have lust for studying more and fulfilling more commandments than his friend. That is, he sees his friend studying and fulfilling commandments, and also causes the community to study Torah. He has desire for this, and may <i>envy</i> his friend over this, and to fulfill commandments. It is also permitted that one should covet that he should have his friend’s daughter as a wife for his son. So writes Bahya. Bahya writes further. It first says, “<i>you shall not murder</i>” [20:13]. One should not kill a person to decrease the number of people who are too numerous in the world. Afterwards, it says, “<i>you shall not commit adultery</i>” [20:13]. The person should remind himself; I have been commanded that I should not decrease the number of people in the world, but to increase many people is a positive commandment. Therefore, he would commit adultery. He wants to increase the number of people in the world. Therefore, the verse says, “<i>you shall not commit adultery.</i>” You should not commit adultery to increase people in the world. “<i>You shall not steal</i>” [20:13]. The person would think; I was commanded not to destroy people, but to steal people and sell them in strange lands, as long as they remain in this world. A person would want to do this, and therefore, the Torah wrote, “<i>You shall not steal.</i>” This means, one should not steal a person in order to sell him and if the person would think, one should not harm the person physically, but I would gladly take his money through false testimony. Therefore, it says, “<i>you shall not bear false witness</i>” [20:13]. Do not give false testimony; that one should not even damage his friend with his words. If a person would think that speaking with his mouth to give false testimony, one should not do it, but to have good thoughts about his friends, this he would be allowed to do. Therefore, the verse says, “<i>you shall not covet</i>” [20:14]. You should not have any desire for the money and goods of your friend.<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 20:17.</i>
The Torah wrote <i>honor</i> in the fifth Statement [20:12], since the person comes into being through five things. One father and one mother, and there are four <i>elements.</i> That is, the person comes from earth, water, fire and air. These are called the four <i>elements</i> from which the person is made. The time that it must lie in its mother’s womb is nine months. The Holy One gives the soul, understanding and speech. The father gives the veins and bones, that which is white. The mother gives everything that is red in the person, blood, flesh, hair and the dark part of the eye. There are also five kinds of creation in people, animals, birds, fish and insects. That is why “<i>on the earth</i>” [20:12] is written in this <i>Statement</i>, since there are five types of gardens and fields on the earth. The first is a field on which wheat and other grains grow. Then there is a field where onions and green and yellow vegetables and all kinds of food grow. Then there is a garden where fruits grow. Then there is the forest where the wood grows. Also, what grows in the earth, like iron, are also five; they are gold, silver, copper, iron and lead. “<i>You shall not murder</i>” [20:13]. This was said as the sixth <i>Statement</i> because murder happens because of six types of things. Because of <i>envy</i>, <i>desires</i>, hatred, anger, when the person is <i>reckless</i> and is lightheaded and kills impulsively, from drunkenness, and since the person was created on the sixth day. “<i>You shall not commit adultery</i>” [20:13] was stated in the seventh Statement, since there are seven types of illicit sexual relations that are forbidden. The first is a <i>married woman.</i> The second is when his wife is menstruating. With a widow, a virgin, an animal, and <i>homosexual relations.</i> The seventh is with a gentile woman. There are also seven prohibitions regarding illicit sexual relations. One should not look at a strange woman. One should not hear her voice. One should not be in a room with her. One should not talk too much with her. One should not touch her with his hand. One should not kiss her and one should not sleep with her. “<i>You shall not steal</i>” [20:13] is stated in the eighth <i>Statement</i>, since there are eight types of theft. The first is that one steals through <i>accounts</i>, one shortchanges him with money, also steals with false measures. Also with false weights. He finds something that belongs to his friend and he does not return it. He kidnaps a person and sells him. He steals money. He also steals an idea and presents it as his own. He says, I want to invite you to eat with me, when he knows that he cannot eat with him. The eighth one is when one is the <i>guardian</i> of an <i>orphan</i>’<i>s</i> money and takes the <i>orphan</i> as a wife for his son, so that the money should remain with the friend and uses the money as his own. This is also called stealing.<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 20:17.</i>
“<i>All the people witnessed</i>” [20:15]. <i>All of Israel</i> was healed. Whoever was blind could see at Mount <i>Sinai.</i> Whoever was deaf and could not hear, was also healed, as the verse says, “<i>we will see and we will hear</i>” [Exodus 24:7]. Whoever was mute and could not speak was also healed as the verse says, “<i>when the people saw it, they fell back</i>” [20:15]. Israel was frightened by the great thunder and lightning. They fell back twelve miles. The <i>angels</i> came and brought them back to Mount Sinai. The Israelites said to Moses: you speak to us and not the Holy One, since we will die. Moses said to Israel: do not be afraid. God wants to test you that the fear of the Holy One should always be with you, so that you serve Him properly. The people stood afar and Moses went into the cloud and fog, where he received the Torah. God said to Moses: say to Israel that they have heard Me speaking with you. Therefore, they should not make a foreign god of the angels.<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">A combination of Exodus 20:15–20 and <i>Mekhiltah de Rabbi Ishmael</i>, <i>Yitro</i>, 9–10.</i>
“<i>You shall not make any gods of silver</i>” [20:20]. Do not make someone a <i>judge</i> because he has silver or gold or a <i>head of a community</i> because of money. Another explanation, do not hold Me as a God when you have much silver and gold. That is, when things are going well for you, you will consider Me a God. However, when things are going badly for you, you will not hold Me as a God. Therefore the verse says, “<i>You shall not make any gods of silver.</i>” Hold Me as a God whether it is going good or bad for you. One should love God at all times, whether it is going good or bad for him.
“<i>Do not build it of hewn stones</i>” [20:22]. When you will make an <i>altar</i> of stones, do not hew the stones with iron, since the altar was given to lengthen the life of the person and iron shortens life. That is to say, a person is killed with iron. Therefore, it is not right that one lifts iron over the altar. Another explanation is that the altar makes peace between Israel and the Holy One. Therefore, it is not right to lift iron, which causes war and death for the person. From here we learn that when the Holy One said that we should not lift up iron over the altar, because he makes peace. <i>Even more so</i>, when a person makes peace between husband and wife, or between one <i>family</i> and another <i>family</i>, or between friends, evil never comes upon him.<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Exodus, 20:22.</i>
Bahya writes. One should not lift iron to hew the stones because the stones became holy for the altar. Thus, one should not hew from it to make paving stones.<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 20:25.</i>
<i>Imre Noam</i> writes that the altar should be made of earth and not from hewn stones with great arrogance and haughtiness. When you will want to build of hewn stones, it will have to cost you much. Perhaps your money to buy the expensive stones will run out and you will have to steal and pick up your sword to steal the money of strangers. With this, you will desecrate the altar. God hates a sacrifice on an altar of theft. This is the meaning of the verse “<i>for by wielding your sword upon them</i>” [20:22]. That is to say, you will have to draw out and raise your sword to steal money to build it from hewn stones.<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">Imre Noam, Exodus, 20:21.</i>
“<i>Do not ascend My altar by steps</i>” [20:23]. When you will build the pathway to the altar, do not make the pathway with steps. If there will be steps and you will want to ascend, you will have to spread your feet because of the steps, and you will uncover your private parts before the altar. Even though the priest had <i>pants</i>, yet do not make steps but an <i>inclined</i> and smooth ramp. From here our sages learn that when the Torah forbade that one should not embarrass the stone. Even more so, that one should not shame and embarrass a person who has intelligence and is created in the image of the Holy One.<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Exodus, 20:23.</i>

Mishpatim

“<i>These are the rules</i>” [21:1]. <i>King Solomon, of blessed memory</i>, said: “<i>These also are by the sages: it is not right to be partial in judgment</i>” [Proverbs, 24:23]. That is to say, it is not good that one should <i>flatter</i> with judgment. Whoever gives proper judgments; he causes the throne in heaven to stand properly. However, when he, <i>heaven forbid</i>, does not judge properly, he causes the throne of the Holy One to be moved from his city. Justice causes peace and therefore, Yitro advised Moses that he should dispense justice. Concerning him it is written, “<i>will go home in peace</i>” [Exodus, 18:23]. Because there is peace, there is existence in the world. Therefore, justice was given to the scholars who make peace in the world. It is not right to bring judgments before the nations of the world, but before the sages of Israel. Therefore, it is written, “<i>These are the rules that you shall set before them</i>” [21:1].<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, <i>Mishpatim</i> Introduction.</i>
The Talmud writes in [tractate] <i>Gittin.</i> “<i>Before them</i>,” that is to say, before Israel and not before gentiles. Furthermore, “<i>before them</i>,” before sages and not before <i>ignoramuses.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Gittin,</i> 88b.</i> The verse should have said, <i>that you will give to them</i>, and instead it writes, “<i>before them.</i>” This teaches us that we should not take judgments before <i>ignoramuses</i>, and also not before gentiles, even if the gentiles rule the same way that <i>Jews rule.</i> It is a very great sin to have judgments with another Jew before gentiles. It is more severe than murder, and murder is severe because he destroys a person, and this is like he destroyed the whole world. One can understand that murder is very serious, and stealing and <i>profaning the Name of God</i> is much more severe than murder, since <i>repentance</i> helps with murder, but no repentance helps with stealing. Similarly, <i>profaning the Name of God</i> is not helped by repentance. The two sins of <i>stealing and profaning the Name of God</i> are on the person who has judgments before gentiles, because when he has judgments before gentiles, one makes their foreign gods important. There is stealing among the gentiles. They rule in favor of much stealing. Therefore, the person should be warned not to have judgments before the gentiles. “<i>Set before</i>,” teaches us that each <i>judge</i> must say what his ruling was <i>before the litigants</i>, and should give them in writing why he <i>ruled</i> in this way. The <i>Torah portion of Mishpatim</i> is written near the <i>portion concerning the altar.</i> This teaches us that one should place <i>judges</i> near the Temple. <i>Rabbi Eliezer</i> said: when there is proper judgment on the earth, there is no judgment on heaven. However, if there is no judgment on the earth, there is judgment in heaven. The sages said: Israel was only destroyed because they did not properly keep the Torah and judgment. “<i>That you shall set</i> [21:1].” When the judge gives proper judgment, the judgment is an <i>elixir of life</i> for him. If he gives an unjust judgment, then the judgment is a <i>poison.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 21:1.</i>
“<i>When you acquire a Hebrew slave</i>” [21:2]. The Torah begins the portion of <i>Mishpatim</i>, when someone buys a Hebrew slave. This is compared to the first Statement of the <i>Ten Statements</i>, “<i>I am the Lord your God</i>” [20:2]. I took you out from the house of Pharaoh to be My slave. How is it that you should sell yourself as a slave? Just as the Sabbath shows that we rest and that God had created the world in six days and rested on the seventh day. So too the slave should serve for six years and go free from their master in the seventh year, as a <i>remembrance</i> of the seventh day, that God had rested on the seventh day. “<i>He shall serve six years</i>” [21:2]. The verse means, when a slave was sold through the <i>court</i> because he had stolen and did not have the money to repay, so he must serve for six years. However, in any event his master should not make the slave do heavy labor or disgusting work, but he should only work during the day and not at night. “<i>Without payment</i>” [20:2]. When the slave becomes sick at his master’s, the master should not say: give me the money that you lost me during your illness and what you ate and what the <i>physician</i> cost. However, when he is sick for more than three years, then the slave must pay everything.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 21:2.</i>
“<i>If he came single</i>” [20:3]. If the slave came alone without a wife, then his master should not give him a wife because he had served him. “<i>If he had a wife</i>” [20:3]. If the slave previously had a wife, an Israelite woman, then the wife should go free with him. Rashi asks a question. It is obvious that his wife goes free, since she had not served the master. The explanation is that when a Jew had bought an Israelite slave, the master had to feed the slave’s wife and child the whole time that the slave served the master. When the slave previously had a wife, the master may also give him a <i>Canaanite female slave</i> to have children with her, because the master may keep them as slaves.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Exodus, 21:3–4.</i>
“<i>I love my master</i>” [20:5]. When the slave says, I love my master and my wife and child. I do not want to go free from my master. The master should take the slave to the court before the <i>judges</i> and should have a hole bored in his ear with an awl, near the door. The slave should continue to serve the master until the <i>Jubilee</i> year, every fifty years when all are freed. Why does he bore the ear? The explanation is that the ears of the Israelites heard on Mount <i>Sinai</i> that Israel are the servants of the Holy One. They should not be slaves to any other one, because He took them out from being the slaves of Pharaoh. Therefore, because he wants to remain a slave and does not want to keep what he heard with his ear, that he should not be a slave, therefore a hole should be bored in his ear. Why do they bore his ear by the door? This is because the door was a witness in Egypt that I passed over the doors of Israel on the night that the <i>firstborn</i> were killed and the <i>firstborn</i> of Israel were allowed to live. I told Israel that they should be My slaves. Therefore, they now bore by the doorpost of the door.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 21:6.</i>
“<i>His master shall pierce</i>” [21:6]. The master must bore it himself, not his son or his representative. Therefore, the master should shame him before the <i>judges</i>, to bore his ear, because he committed the sin that he heard on Mount Sinai that one should not be a slave to any person, but to God alone. Therefore, it is written, “<i>a Hebrew slave</i>” and it is not written, <i>an Israelite slave.</i> This is a good name that we were called children of Israel after the <i>giving of the Torah.</i> Before the <i>giving of the Torah</i>, we were called <i>Hebrews</i> in Egypt, as it is written, “<i>the God of the Hebrews</i>” [Exodus, 3:18]. Therefore, the slave who sold himself was also called a <i>Hebrew slave.</i> That is, it is not just to call him an <i>Israelite slave.</i> Therefore, they should cause blood to come out of his ear because he did not want to remember that the blood was splattered on the doors of Israel in Egypt. The Midrash writes. The Holy One said: I opened a door for him that he should go free after six years and he does not want to go. Therefore, they should bore his ear by the door.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 21:6.</i>
“<i>His daughter as a slave</i>” [21:7]. The Torah gave permission that the father is allowed to sell his daughter to serve a Jew, when she is still a minor. If the master has knocked out a tooth or an eye, he should not be free of obligation. He should free her, as the custom is when he knocks out a tooth or an eye of a Canaanite slave. The master must free her, but a Jewish maidservant, when he knocks out a tooth or an eye, he must pay her for the tooth or eye, and must keep her until her time is concluded.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Exodus, 21:7.</i>
“<i>If she proves to be displeasing to her master</i>” [21:8]. The <i>law</i> is that when one purchases a Jewish maid, he may marry her. He does not need to <i>betroth</i> her with silver. The money that he gave to the father when he purchased her is instead of the <i>betrothal.</i> If she displeases him and he does not want to take her as a wife, he must let her go free and must leave some money. If he bought her for twenty-four gulden and she goes out free after six years, her service for one year is four gulden, and if she served two years, the master gives him sixteen gulden and deducts eight gulden.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Exodus, 21:8.</i>
“<i>He shall not have the right to sell her to outsiders</i>” [21:8]. He should not sell his daughter to a gentile, even though one may sell a <i>Hebrew [male] slave</i> to a gentile. However, an Israelite maid may not be sold to a gentile, since they will engage in illicit sexual relations with her.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Exodus, 21:8.</i>
Toldot Yizhak asks a question. Why did the Torah say that when the slave previously had a Jewish wife, the master is allowed to give him a <i>Canaanite female slave</i> to have children? When he does no have a wife, the master should not give him a wife? Furthermore, he asks, how appropriate is it that he should be given a gentile woman? He is still a Jew; should he marry a gentile? He asks further, how appropriate is it that he should sell his own child, his daughter, to serve. The explanation is that a <i>Hebrew slave</i> engaged in theft, and was sold by the <i>court</i>, in the expectation that he would redeem himself from the one he had stolen from. When that slave previously had a Jewish wife and children, who will buy him? He will have to feed the wife and children even if that wife will not work for that master. Thus nobody will want to buy that slave. He will not be able to redeem himself from his theft. Therefore, the Torah said that the master may give the slave a <i>female Canaanite slave</i> to have children and the children will belong to the master. Then, each master will gladly buy a <i>Hebrew slave</i>, even though he will have to feed the Jewish wife of the slave that he previously had, and she would not work for him. Furthermore, the master thinks to himself and he will have many children from this slave. It will not damage me. However, when the <i>Hebrew slave</i> does not have a Jewish wife, he would not have to feed his wife. Therefore, he does not need to give a <i>Canaanite female slave</i> to the slave, since many others will want to purchase him. However, the master should not give him a Jewish wife, since if he will take a Jewish wife then the children will not belong to the master. He will have a loss. He would have to feed them and they would not work for him. Another explanation. When the slave previously had a Jewish wife, then he may take a Canaanite female slave. He will not love her, since he already had a wife that he certainly loves. Each person has his love for his first wife. Similarly each woman has her love for her first husband. Therefore, the slave will also not love the Canaanite female slave; he can also sleep with her, because the master desires this. Afterwards, he will drive her away from himself. However, if he had no wife and the Canaanite female slave would be his first wife. Perhaps he will love her and will keep her permanently as a wife. She will convince him to do much evil. We asked how appropriate is it that the father should sell his daughter? The explanation is that he does not sell her, but he thinks that the master will take her as a wife or his son would take her as a wife. He does not need to give her silver for the <i>betrothal.</i> The son says to the maiden, be betrothed to me with the silver that my father gave for you when he bought you. The man had intended all this, that his daughter should have a husband through the sale. <i>Toldot Yizhak</i> asks another question. When they had to bore the slave’s ear because the Holy One said to Israel that they should be My slaves and not slaves to a person. Thus it would have been just that each slave’s ear should be bored as soon as he sells himself and wants to serve longer than the six years. The explanation is another reason why the slave’s ear is bored at the door, and why does one bore it after six years. The reason is that the slave was a thief. That is why he was sold for six years by the <i>judges.</i> If he was a thief, how appropriate is it that the master will want to love him and desire to keep him in service after the six years, It can only be that he became pious. During the six years he did not touch anything or steal anything from his master. Therefore, he considers him <i>trustworthy</i> and desires to keep him and have him serve longer. Therefore, he takes him to the door. He wants to show that he is not a thief. Just like when the door is open, the thief comes in and steals from the house. However, when the door is locked, no thief comes in. So too is the slave. He has changed and is no longer a thief. So too, the ear of the person is like the door. Sometimes it should be open to hear good words and sometimes it should be closed, not to hear evil words, as our sages said. Why is the ear hard as a bone and the lobe is soft, expecting that when the person hears something evil, he should close his ear with the lobe, which is soft, expecting that he should not hear evil words. Just like the door is sometimes open and sometimes closed.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Exodus, 21:2–9.</i>
“<i>He shall deal with her as is the practice with free maidens</i>” [21:9]. When the son takes the maiden as a wife, he should behave with her as if he had taken the daughter of another <i>householder.</i> The master is obligated to give her a <i>dowry</i>, just like to his daughter, and also when he takes her as a wife. He can also take another wife, but he should not decrease sleeping with her and also not decrease her food and clothing. If he wanted to hold the other wife to be more important and to keep her lower because she was a maid sold to his father and does not want to sleep with her, he is not allowed to do this. “<i>Her food</i>” [21:10]. Bahya writes that the custom in the <i>Persian</i> lands is that the man has sexual relations with his wife, with his clothes on. Therefore the verse writes that he should sleep with her properly, without clothes.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 21:9.</i>
When one has not done all three things for the maiden, that he did not take her as a wife. Or, if his son did not take her as a wife, or if the father did not redeem her, then the maiden shall go free from her master. [Exodus, 21:11]
If a person kills someone accidentally, but the Holy One wanted it this way that the person should be killed, the person runs to the <i>cities of refuge.</i> One cannot harm him. One asks a question. What sin did a person do that he killed the person, even if the Holy One had wanted this to happen, and why should he run to the <i>cities of refuge?</i> The explanation is that when a person had killed his friend willingly and there are no witnesses present, then he is not killed. Later, a person killed his friend accidentally and he did not run to the <i>cities of refuge.</i> The Holy One causes the two murderers to come to an inn. The one who accidentally killed his friend goes up on a ladder and falls down on the person who killed willfully and kills the murderer. The people saw that the Holy One paid each one his reward. The one who was guilty was killed and the other one who was obligated to run to the <i>cities of refuge</i>, he now has to run to the <i>cities of refuge.</i> There were not yet <i>cities of refuge</i> in the wilderness. When a person killed someone, he ran to the gate of the Levites and nobody was supposed to harm him.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Exodus, 21:13.</i>
“<i>When a man schemes</i>” [21:14]. When a person deliberately kills his friend, with the exception of a physician who treats a person and kills him, or a <i>communal official</i> who gives a person <i>thirty-nine lashes</i> and he dies, or when a father hits his son, or a <i>teacher</i> who hits a <i>student</i> and they die, <i>heaven forbid.</i> They should be absolved of the death penalty. This is like a master who hits a slave and he dies. The master is absolved of the death penalty.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Exodus, 21:14.</i>
“<i>You shall take him from My very altar</i>” [21:14]. You shall take the murderer from the altar, even if he is a priest and wants to bring sacrifices on the altar.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Exodus, 21:14.</i> Similarly, take the murderer from the altar and put him to death. Also similarly, when he is not a priest and runs to the altar, as we find concerning <i>Joab.</i> He ran to the <i>Tabernacle</i> and thought that because the king was having him put to death, he would be absolved if he would hold on to the altar. However, the truth is that it does not help and he must be put to death, even when taken away from the altar.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 21:14.</i>
“<i>Strikes his father or his mother</i>” [21:15]. He who strikes his father or mother and wounds them should be put to death.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Exodus, 21:15.</i>
“<i>He who kidnaps and sells him</i>” [21:16]. If someone kidnaps a person and sells them, he should be put to death. Bahya asks a question here. Why did the verse write, when someone sells a person, between the <i>sections</i>, when someone strikes his father or mother, and writes immediately afterwards, when someone sells a person? Then it writes again that when someone curses father or mother. He should have written the laws of father and mother together. The explanation is given by <i>Rabbenu Saadia.</i> It is because they used to kidnap small children, since one cannot easily kidnap an adult. Therefore, they kidnaped children. It sometimes happens that the same child comes again into the city where his father and mother were. He hits and curses his father and mother sometimes, when they come to battle. He does not know his father and mother. Therefore, the Torah wrote, when somebody sells a person close to the one who curses his father or mother. Ramban writes. The Torah wrote about kidnaping a person near the beating of one’s father because the death penalties are also similar. Just as one who beats his father or his mother is strangled, so too the one who kidnaps a person. However, when one curses his father or his mother, he is stoned with stones, a very severe death. With the cursing, the person has quickly transgressed. It happens immediately with his mouth. Therefore, the Torah imposed a severe death for cursing his father or mother, in the expectation that he would be fearful. Another explanation is that the sin of cursing is a severe death because the name of God is mentioned by the one who curses.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 21:16.</i>
“<i>Has to take to bed</i>” [21:19]. When a person beats his friend with his fists or with a stone and he takes to bed, and as a result cannot do his work. The aggressor is put in prison until he is healed. However, in any event he has to pay what he would have earned during the illness. If he chopped off a hand or a foot, then they value what the hand or foot is worth to a person and he should pay for the hand or the foot. They value the work that he could have done during the illness, when he is without hand or foot. That is, he can at least guard a garden, then he must pay him what someone who guards a garden is paid.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban, Exodus, 21:24.</i>
“<i>His idleness and his cure</i>” [21:19]. He should hire a physician to help him to heal. However, when he is used to have much money and does not allow himself to be healed, the assailant is not obligated to give it to him. So writes Ramban.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban, Exodus, 21:19.</i>
Bahya writes. In the whole Torah we find that the word <i>heal</i> always has a dot [<i>dagesh</i>] in the letter <i>peh.</i> Here, when healing is mentioned in connection with the Holy One, it is without a dot in the word <i>healer.</i> The explanation is because healing by a person is very difficult and painful, before a physician heals him. Therefore, there is a dot [<i>dagesh</i>], which means difficult and painful. However, the healing from the Holy One is easy and immediate, without pain. That is why there is no dot in the <i>peh</i> concerning the healing from the Holy One.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 21:19.</i>
Rashi writes. <i>He should pay the physician</i>’<i>s fee.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Exodus, 21:19.</i> He should pay money and hire a physician. However, when he will bring a physician to heal for free, without paying him, he should not do this. He could say, he who heals without money does not take proper care. Also, if the one who hit him was a physician, he should not heal him. He could say: you are my enemy. I cannot stand the sight of you.
“<i>When a man strikes his slave</i>” [21:20]. When a master strikes his male or female slave with a stick and the male or female slave dies as a result of this beating, the master should be put to death with a sword, even if the male or female slave were <i>Canaanite.</i> However, if the male or female slave lives for a day or two and then dies, then he is not guilty.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 21:20.</i>
“<i>A miscarriage results</i>” [21:22]. When two people are fighting and one of them pushes an uninvolved woman so that she miscarries, then they should value the child as the husband desires, but in any event they should go to the <i>judges.</i> Why is it not written, as the woman desires? The explanation is that the woman is not related to the child. It is the husband’s child, since the woman has the child within her, just like a pledge within her. It was given from her husband until its term is finished. If the husband wants a lot of money, then the judges should recognize it. If the woman would die from the blows, some sages say that the person should be put to death, and some sages say that because he did not have the intention to hurt the woman, they should take money from him as would be determined by the <i>judges.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 21:22–23.</i>
“<i>Eye for eye</i>” [21:24]. When someone knocks out the eye of his friend, then his eye should be knocked out.
“<i>When a man strikes the eye of his slave</i>” [21:26]. If a master knocks out the eye of his slave, or his female Canaanite slave, the master should let them go free. Bahya writes here that this is because Canaanites must serve because they committed a sin with their eye or tooth. Because Ham saw his father lying uncovered, he committed a sin with his eye, and did not cover his shame. Afterwards, he went and said with his mouth to his brothers how their father was uncovered. Thus, he committed a sin with his teeth. He uncovered his teeth with his talking. Therefore, when he knocks out a Canaanite’s eye or tooth, he must let the slave go free, because the slave has suffered travails in his eye or tooth. Thus, the sin that he had committed with his eye or tooth has been forgiven.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 21:26.</i>
“<i>When an ox gores a man</i>” [21:28]. When an ox gores a person and he dies, they should stone the ox and no benefit should be derived from that ox. However, if the ox used to gore and he was warned three times and the ox killed a person, then they will put that person to death because he had not locked up the ox. Bahya asks a question. Why is it written, “<i>if it will gore</i>,” when it gores a person, and when an ox gores another ox it is written, “<i>if it bumps</i>” [21:35]? The explanation is that the person has a <i>constellation</i> in heaven, so that the ox cannot immediately gore him and kill him. Therefore, it is written, <i>if he gores.</i> That is to say, he must come with great power to gore the person, but the animal has no constellation in heaven. Therefore, the ox can kill another animal immediately. Therefore, it is written, <i>if he will bump.</i> That is, he kills him as soon as he encounters him. The Talmud in [tractate] <i>Ta</i>’<i>anit</i>, <i>chapter one</i>, said. When three people die in one day, it is not called an <i>ether.</i> However, when three people die in three days, one after another, this is called an <i>ether.</i> Also, when the ox gores three times, one after another, the ox is not yet declared <i>dangerous</i>, that he should be called a goring ox and the owner should be responsible for him. However, when the ox gores three days in a row, once every day, then he is called a dangerous ox, and he is responsible if her does not lock him up.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 21:28.</i>
Even though we do not pass judgment now when an ox gores a person, yet we excommunicate the person who keeps an animal or vicious dog in his house who does damage to people. Each person should be warned not to throw things in the street where people go, so that they should not stumble over it or become besmeared with it. The pietists used to pick up broken glass, not to throw it in the street, and they buried this broken glass deep in the earth so that no person should stab himself with it. A story occurred to a person who was throwing stones from his field into the street where many people used to go. A <i>pietist</i> came and said to him: why are you throwing things from a field that is not yours? That person mocked him. Not long afterwards, that same person had to sell his field and fell over the same stones that he had thrown into the street. The person said: the pietist spoke very truthfully that I should not throw things out from a stranger’s field that is not mine into the street which I have a share in it. The street is free to the whole world; the whole world walks on it.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 21:29.</i> From here we should learn to be warned not to pour or throw things into the street where many people go. There are many kinds of unclean water that harm the person who steps in it. The Holy One will punish him with great suffering, just like the person was punished and had to sell his field.
“<i>When a person opens a pit</i>” [21:33]. When a person opens a pit or digs a pit and does not cover it and an ox falls into it, he must pay the whole damage.
“<i>When a man steals an ox</i>” [21:37]. When a person <i>steals</i> an ox, he must repay five oxen for the one he had stolen. If he steals a sheep, he must repay four sheep. Rashi writes. <i>Rabbi Yohanan</i> said: an ox follows the thief when he leads it. It is an easy thing to do. Therefore, he must repay five oxen instead of one ox. However, a small animal that he steals, he must carry on his shoulders. He becomes <i>embarrassed.</i> He becomes ashamed that he must carry it. Therefore, he should instead repay four times for the sheep, since the Holy One always said that the person should retain his <i>dignity</i> and should not be shamed. Another explanation is that the ox plowed and did other work for its original owner. Now, the thief has inconvenienced the original owner’s work. Therefore, he must pay five oxen for one ox.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Exodus, 21:37.</i>
Bahya writes. When someone steals something out of the house, clothes or silver and gold, then he must repay <i>double.</i> However, animals go about freely in the field without a <i>guard.</i> Therefore, the Torah made the penalty two times <i>double</i> for one who steals an animal because the Torah punishes him for a transgression that can be done quickly. That is to say, an animal is easy to steal; it goes about in the field. Therefore, everyone will steal them. That is why he must repay two times double. This is for sheep, for one sheep that he steals. However, larger animals go even further afield, and the herder cannot keep them together. Therefore, the Torah ordered that five oxen should be repaid for one ox, because they are quickly stolen. So writes <i>Ramban.</i> Why does a thief repay double and a robber does not repay double? This is because the thief considers people to be more important than the Holy One. He makes sure that the person should not see that he is stealing in the dark, but he is not afraid of the Holy One who forbade him to steal. Therefore, because he shames the Holy One, he must repay double for the theft. However, the one who openly steals considers the Holy One and the people equal. He does not shame the Holy One any more than the people. That is why the robber does not pay double. The Midrash writes. Israel stole an ox. That is to say, they made the <i>Golden Calf</i>, which is called an ox. Therefore, they had to pay five times as much. That is to say, many Israelites died and that is why there were <i>five kinds of death</i> and punishments at the Golden Calf [incident]. The first was that they were killed with the sword through the hand of the children of <i>Levi.</i> The second was a <i>plague</i> through the Holy One. Many Israelites died at the Golden Calf [incident]. The third was that the faces of many turned green and yellow because of the Calf, when Moses gave them the water that is given to the <i>suspected wife.</i> The fourth was that the <i>Temple</i> was destroyed. The fifth was that the Holy One remembered the sin to repay for it in all generations.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 21:37.</i>
“<i>Four sheep for the sheep</i>” [21:37]. Four sheep for the lamb that they stole. <i>Joseph</i> is called a <i>sheep.</i> Therefore, we, Israel, were in exile for four hundred years in exile in Egypt.
“<i>You shall not tolerate a sorceress</i>” [22:17]. Bahya writes. The Torah forbade the practice of magic because the Israelites were in Egypt and learned magic. Therefore, the Holy One forbade the practice of magic in Israel and that is why the Torah wrote, <i>do not let live.</i> You should not let them live. That is to say, whichever form of death you can inflict on them, you should do it to them. Therefore it says, <i>sorceress.</i> This means a woman. That is to say, a woman who practices magic. The magic of a <i>necromancer</i>, to bring up the dead person, can only be done when a woman is present at it. The magic is as follows. A woman stands over the <i>grave</i> of a dead person, at the head, and a man stands at the feet. A youth stands in the middle of the grave. The youth has a bell in his hand and rings it. Sometimes the dead person comes to life and tells what will happen. The custom has remained with <i>Edom</i> that they ring bells in their <i>impure places</i>, where the dead are buried.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 22:17. The term <i>Edom</i> is a common term for Christianity, and <i>impure places</i>, a term for a church.</i>
<i>Imre Noam</i> writes. It is not mentioned which form of death should be done to the <i>magician</i>, expecting that they will not count on it. The magician would have magic for that form of death and it would not be possible to kill them. Therefore, it is written, “<i>You shall not tolerate a sorceress</i>” [22:17]. That is to say, you should kill them with whichever form of death you can use to kill them.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Imre Noam, Exodus, 22:17.</i>
“<i>You shall not ill-treat any widow or orphan</i>” [22:21]. You should not persecute a widow and an orphan. The Torah forbids us strongly that we should not persecute a stranger, a widow or an orphan, since they do not have anyone to speak for them. Therefore, everyone should be warned not to persecute them or cause them anguish. They cry out to Me, and I will hear their outcry, and will kill that person with the sword. Your wives will be widows and your children will be <i>orphans.</i>
Rashi asks a question. It is obvious that his wife will be a widow and his children orphans. The explanation is that her husband will disappear and she will not know if he is alive or dead. The wives will be <i>living widows.</i> There will be no witnesses about what happened to her husband. Therefore, she will not be able to remarry, and the children will remain orphans forever. They will not be allowed to inherit their father’s goods or money, because they do not know if their father is alive or dead.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Exodus, 22:22.</i>
“<i>Any widow</i>” [22:22]. This teaches us that even a widow, who is very rich, should also not be tormented, just like a poor widow, since widows cry easily and their tears are not shed in vain. Therefore, one should be warned not persecute them with <i>communal taxes</i>, even if they are rich. Even if they have much money, if she does not have a husband, the money is insignificant, and she cries all the time. Concerning this, <i>Jeremiah</i> compared <i>Jerusalem</i> to a widow, as the verse says, “<i>is become like a widow</i>” [Lamentations, 1:1], and shortly afterwards is written, “<i>bitterly she weeps in the night</i>” [Lamentations, 1:2]. Therefore, he said, she weeps at night, since there are many rich widows who can have everything they desire with their money and can forget their husband. However, she weeps at night when she wants to lie down. That is why he says, “<i>bitterly she weeps in the night</i>” [Lamentations, 1:2]. So writes <i>Baal ha-Turim.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Baal ha-Turim, Exodus, 22:21.</i>
“<i>If you lend money to My people</i>” [22:24]. Bahya writes. King Solomon said. “<i>A gift in secret subdues anger, a person in private, fierce rage</i>” [Proverbs, 21:14]. The one who gives charity secretly, he removes the anger of the Holy One from himself. However, the one who takes <i>bribes</i>, thinking that he will make much money, the Holy One will become upset. He will repay him his reward in time. However, the one who goes bankrupt and loses his money, but gave charity, he has a good <i>profit</i> from it. God repays him <i>many times over.</i> Therefore, we were commanded in the Torah that we should lend to the poor. This is the meaning of the verse, “<i>If you lend money to My people</i>” [22:24]. You are obligated to lend to a Jew. If a gentile comes to borrow from you and a Jew also comes to borrow from you, you are obligated to lend to the Jew. If the gentile wants to give you interest and the poor Jew wants it without interest, then you are obligated to lend to the Jew without interest. When a rich person and a poor person come to borrow from you, it is just to give the poor person priority. If a poor person comes from your city, and another poor person from another city, the priority is to the poor person from your city. If a poor person from your city and one from your family, also from your city, the poor person from your family has priority. “<i>The poor among you</i>” [22:24]. If you will not lend to the poor person, you will also become a pauper. When you lend to the <i>poor person</i>, you should relate to him as if he does not owe you anything. You should not take any <i>interest</i> from him, since the sin of <i>interest</i> is very severe. We find concerning <i>Obadiah</i> who was very rich and was the <i>superintendent</i> of the household of <i>Ahab</i>, king of Israel. He took all of his money and gave it to feed the prophets that he had hidden a cave, since <i>Ahab</i> had wanted to kill all the prophets. There were one hundred prophets. A great famine came upon the <i>land of Israel</i> and <i>Obadiah</i> spent all of his money. <i>Obadiah</i> came to <i>Jehoram, the son of Ahab</i>, and borrowed money from him and promised to give him <i>interest.</i> However, his heart was not in it that he should give <i>interest</i>, since it was a very great sin for the one who pays <i>interest</i> and for the one who takes <i>interest. Jehoram</i> had intended to take <i>interest</i> from him. The Holy One sent <i>Jehu</i> who shot <i>Jehoram</i> and the arrow went through his heart. This was because he had intended to take interest. “<i>My people</i>” [22:24]. The poor are called the people of the Holy One, as the verse says: “<i>for the Lord has comforted His people, and has taken back His afflicted ones</i>” [Isaiah, 49:13]. It is customary that when a person is rich and has poor relatives, he denies that he has them. However, if he has rich relatives, he keeps good relations with them and honors them greatly. However, the Holy One is the opposite. He hates the rich and loves the poor.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 22:24.</i>
“<i>If you take a pledge</i>” [22:25]. If you will take a pledge from your friend, and that pledge is a garment that one has to have during the day, you have to leave it all day with the person from whom you took the pledge, but at night you are allowed to take it back.
“<i>I will pay heed, for I am compassionate</i>” [22:26]. The person should not think, the pauper from whom I have taken a pledge is an evil person, and I will not return the pledge. Thus, I will not commit a sin. Therefore, it is written, “<i>for I am compassionate.</i>” That is to say, I act with kindness for nothing, even if the person has no merits and I am compassionate toward him when he is poor.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban, Exodus, 22:26.</i>
“<i>You shall not revile God</i>” [22:27]. You should not curse any <i>judge</i> when he judges you guilty in a judgment. You should also not curse any king because of a judgment.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban, Exodus, 22:27.</i>
“<i>You shall be holy people to Me</i>” [22:30]. You are holy to me. Therefore, you should not eat animals torn by beasts. You should give it to the dog to eat, since in Egypt when I killed the Egyptian firstborn at night, the dogs barked at the Egyptians when they buried their firstborn. No dog barked at the Israelites when they left at night from Egypt with their staffs in their hands. The custom is that when a person has a staff in his hand, the dogs bark at him. However, in Egypt, the dogs did not bark at the Israelites. Therefore, one should give them meat torn by beasts.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Exodus, 22:30.</i>
“<i>You must not carry false rumors</i>” [23:1]. You shall not cause a person to swear when you can understand that he might swear falsely. You should also not listen when someone comes before you and complains about his friend with whom he is having a lawsuit. It can happen that the friend is also there. Perhaps he might tell you a lie beforehand, but when his friend is there, he will deny it. The verse teaches us that one should not listen to <i>gossip</i> and <i>slander.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Exodus, 23:1.</i>
“<i>You shall neither side with the mighty to do wrong</i>” [23:2]. When you see many people doing evil, you should turn aside and do not do what they do. Our sages learn from here that when an Israelite is judged guilty of the death penalty, each member of the <i>Sanhedrin</i> gave his opinion. If there was one <i>judge</i> more who said he was guilty, then they do not follow the one. That is to say, there are seventy-one in the <i>Sanhedrin.</i> Thirty-five said that he is not guilty and thirty-six that he is guilty, they do not follow the thirty-six. However, when a majority of thirty-six was in favor of the person in the judgment, then they do follow it, even if there is only one more who voted in his favor.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Exodus, 23:2.</i>
“<i>You shall not give perverse testimony</i>” [23:2]. The <i>judge</i> who will sit in <i>judgment</i> should not teach him <i>arguments</i>, how he should speak in court, to one who is a litigant. Also, when the <i>judges</i> are sitting in <i>judgment</i>, a <i>judge</i> should not <i>argue</i> on behalf of a litigant, but the litigant should argue on his own behalf, and the litigant should also answer on his own behalf.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 23:2.</i>
“<i>You must nevertheless raise it with him</i>” [23:5]. When you see your fellow with his heavily loaded donkey, which is on the verge of falling, you should immediately help him unload, even if this fellow is your enemy. When you see a donkey or ox belonging to your fellow, who is your enemy, is wandering in the field and will become lost, you are obligated to bring the ox or the donkey back home.
“<i>Nor shall you show deference to a poor man in his dispute</i>” [23:3]. When a poor person comes before you in a court, you should not help the poor person. You will think that he is a poor person. I will help him expecting that he will have to eat with dignity. Do not do differently to the poor one in the judgment against the rich one.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Exodus, 23:3.</i>
“<i>Do not bring death on those who are innocent and in the right</i>” [23:7]. When a person goes out from the <i>court</i>, guilty of death, and a person comes and says: I will show that this person is not guilty. They take him back into the <i>court</i>, because he might be found not guilty. However, when a person leaves the <i>court</i> innocent, and a person comes and says: I will show that he is guilty, then he is not taken back to the <i>court.</i> He remains innocent, as the verse says, “<i>Do not bring death on those who are innocent</i>” [23:7]. That is to say, because he could be innocent, and the Holy One said: “<i>for I will not acquit the wrongdoer</i>” [23:7]. I do not make any evildoer innocent in the <i>court.</i> That is to say, the court should not be afraid that he would not be brought back to the court, since the Holy One will find the evildoer and pay him his reward with the death of which he is guilty.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Exodus, 23:7.</i>
“<i>You shall not boil a kid in its mother</i>’<i>s milk</i>” [23:19]. This verse is written three times in the Torah. This teaches us that one should not eat meat with milk and one should not derive enjoyment from it and we should not even cook it. Therefore, the Torah wrote that you should not boil milk with meat and does not write that you should not eat meat with milk, because we show that the eating of meat with milk is not similar to the other <i>prohibitions</i> of eating. Specifically, when you have enjoyment from the eating, but when you derive no enjoyment from it, then the person is not guilty. However, concerning eating meat and milk together, he is guilty even if he derives no enjoyment from the eating. It might happen that a person might swallow milk, hot from the fire, along with meat and he might burn his esophagus. He certainly has no enjoyment from this eating, yet he is still <i>guilty of thirty-nine lashes.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 23:19.</i>
<i>Toldot Yizhak</i> also writes thusly. It was the custom of gentiles to boil meat with milk and pour it on the roots of a tree, expecting that the tree would grow quickly. Therefore, the verse says that you should not boil meat with milk. The Holy One will give, in any event, that your grain should grow quickly. Therefore the Torah wrote, “<i>the choice first fruits of your soil</i>” [23:19], the first grain.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Exodus, 23:19.</i>
“<i>I am sending an angel before you</i>” [23:20]. The Holy One said to Moses that Israel would commit sins with the Golden Calf. Therefore, an angel will go with you in the wilderness and it is not right for the Shekhinah to go among you. However, Moses prayed that no angel should go with Israel in his days, while Moses was still alive, but the Holy One Himself should be among them. Here, the Holy One did the will of Moses. However, in the days of Joshua, after Moses died, an angel went before Israel. <i>Rabbenu Hananel</i> writes that the name of the angel who went with Joshua was called <i>Michael.</i> “<i>He will not pardon your offenses</i>” [23:21]. You should be careful not to commit sins, since the angel does not have the power to forgive sins, since nobody else can forgive sins, only the Holy One Himself. Be warned, keep his words; all the things that the angel will say. If you will do what the angel will tell you to do, your enemies will fall before you and the angel will bring you to the <i>land of Israel.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 23:20.</i>
“<i>I will remove sickness from your midst</i>” [23:25]. Bahya writes. There are some diseases in the body that come from too much eating or drinking. There are also other diseases that come from the ether. Therefore, the Holy One said: whoever will study and keep the Torah <i>for the sake of heaven</i>, he does not need to fear the disease. The Torah is a remedy for all diseases.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 23:25.</i>
“<i>A plague</i>” [23:28]. The Holy One sent a wasp, that is, an evil bee that would blind the eyes of the <i>Hivites, Canaanites, and Hittites</i>, three nations that have the <i>land of Israel.</i> Rashi writes. The wasp did not cross the <i>Jordan</i>, only the nations that lived in the land, <i>Sihon and Og</i>, which was this side of the Jordan. One was called <i>Hittite</i> and the other was called <i>Canaanite.</i> They lived this side of the Jordan and the wasp blinded them and they all died. Even though the <i>Hivites</i> lived on the other side of the Jordan, how could the wasp blind them when the wasp could not cross the Jordan? The explanation is that the wasp stood at the edge of the Jordan and threw its poison over the Jordan, and blinded they eyes of the nation called the <i>Hivites</i> and they all died.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Exodus, 23:28.</i>
The Holy One said: I will not expel the nations from the <i>land of Israel</i> quickly or chase them out at one time, so that the land should not become desolate, without people, since you Israel are not numerous and you could not fill the land with people. I will wait until you will increase and then I will expel them, since when people do not in habit the land, many wild animals are found in the land.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus, 23:29–30.</i>
“<i>Come up to the Lord, you and Aaron</i>” [24:1]. In this Torah portion it is said that the Torah was given on Mount Sinai on the fourth of <i>Sivan.</i> Moses went alone into the fog on Mount Sinai and told Israel everything that he heard from the Holy One. Israel responded: we will receive everything and obey it. Moses wrote the Torah from “<i>in the beginning</i>” until here, the <i>giving of the Torah.</i> Moses went early on the morning of the fifth of <i>Sivan</i> and made an altar at the foot of the mountain, and the <i>first-born</i> sons brought <i>sacrifices.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Exodus, 24:1–5.</i>
Bahya writes. The <i>first-born</i> were all the youths who did not yet have wives. Therefore, they were very pure. With the offering of the sacrifices, Israel made a covenant with the Holy One that they would keep the Torah. With three things the Israelites entered into the covenant of the Torah with the Holy One. The first, with <i>circumcision</i>; the second was <i>immersion.</i> They all <i>immersed</i> themselves before <i>receiving the Torah.</i> The third was that they brought a sacrifice, as is appropriate for every convert who converts must have these three things. He must <i>circumcise</i> himself, must <i>immerse</i> and he will bring a sacrifice when the Messiah comes. Each convert must also be told about some commandments, expecting that he will not convert since converts cause <i>Israel to commit sins.</i> They are not <i>serious</i>, they are lightheaded and they are not <i>punctilious</i> about the commandments. The Israelites learned from them in the wilderness. The <i>mixed multitude</i> made the <i>Golden Calf</i>, through which many Israelites were killed, because of them. They converted when they ran after the Israelites when they left Egypt into the wilderness and did much evil. Some sages say that therefore the converts are told some commandments, expecting that they should not be able to say: I did not know that there are so many commandments, I would not have converted. As the Talmud said: converts are bad for Israel. This was not said because the converts are evil, but the explanation is that it is because the Holy One sees their deeds, that they have converted and left their family, father and mother, and attached themselves to the Holy One. The Holy One says: you Israel do not want to be pious and converts attach themselves to Me. Therefore the Holy One punishes Israel, <i>heaven forbid</i>, because of the converts.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 24:5.</i>
“<i>Moses took one half of the blood</i>” [24:6]. An angel came and divided the blood of the sacrifices so that it was equally divided. Moses took half of the blood and put it in a basin to sprinkle it over the Israelites and the other half he poured on the altar.<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Exodus, 24:6.</i>
“<i>The likeness of a pavement of sapphire</i>” [24:10]. <i>Moses, Aaron, Nadav and Avihu</i>, and seventy elders went up Mount <i>Sinai</i> and saw the <i>Throne of Glory</i> of the Holy One and they also saw a brick pavement that the Holy One paved to remember the troubles of Israel, that they had to work hard to make many bricks in Egypt. The Holy One said: I will redeem them from their heavy work.<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Exodus, 24:10.</i>
Hizkuni writes. There was a woman whose name was Rachel and was helping to knead clay with her husband. A child came out of her body and fell into the clay. She could not find it and screamed to God. The <i>angel Michael</i> came and made a brick from the clay that had the child in it, and placed this brick under the <i>Throne of Glory.</i> It was called “<i>pavement of sapphire.</i>” This means, a brick of the membrane in which the child lay. These elders were guards. That is to say, guardians over Israel at the work of making bricks in Egypt. The guards made the work of making bricks easier, so that Pharaoh did not know about it. That is why the elders were now also worthy to see the bricks before the Holy One and were worthy that the Holy One made the elders important over Israel.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Exodus, 24:10.</i>
“<i>They beheld God</i>” [24:11]. The elders, <i>Nadav, and Avihu</i> ate and drank and they gazed at the Holy One. Because of this, they were <i>guilty of the death penalty</i>, but the Holy One did not want to mar His joy at the giving of the Torah that was happening at that time. He waited with <i>Nadav and Avihu</i> until the eighth of <i>Nisan</i> when he killed them for their sin. He killed the elders in the wilderness, because all of Israel spoke ill of the Holy One with the eating of meat. The Holy One killed the elders because of their sin.
“<i>Come up to me on the mountain</i>” [24:12]. It was after the <i>giving of the Torah</i> and Moses went up again on Mount Sinai and learned the whole Torah, with <i>six hundred and thirteen</i> commandments. Joshua accompanied his <i>teacher</i>, <i>Moses</i>, to the foot of the mountain, since he did not have permission to go up the mountain. Joshua pitched his tent at the foot of the mountain the whole forty days while Moses was on Mount Sinai. Moses had commanded the elders that they should remain with the Israelites and should judge them. <i>Hur</i>, the son of Miriam, should also sit in judgment. When Moses went up on Mount Sinai, a cloud came and covered the whole Mount Sinai. This lasted for six days, until the Torah was given on the sixth day. On the seventh day after the <i>giving of the Torah</i>, he tarried for forty days and forty nights. The verse teaches us the greatness of Moses, to compare him to an angel who did not eat or drink. Because Moses was on Mount Sinai and studied Torah for forty days, he merited having a light in his face for forty years, so that no person could look at Moses. He had to cover the light with a cloth, despite the fact that it was a great honor for him. The light lasted until Moses died. Moses lived as long as he was on Mount Sinai. We find that he was on Mount Sinai for three times forty days. This is one hundred and twenty days all together. He lived for one hundred and twenty years. Moses was covered in a cloud all the six days of the <i>giving of the Torah.</i> However, he was not seen in the cloud, but on the seventh day the Holy One made a pathway that Moses used to ascend into the cloud and spoke with the Holy One in the cloud.

Terumah

<i>King Solomon, of blessed memory</i>, said: “<i>Accept my discipline rather than silver</i>” [Proverbs, 8:10]. The verse teaches us that the person should exert himself and endeavor to accept the discipline of the Torah and should not exert himself to accumulate money and silver, since with the Torah he buys this world and the next world for himself. However, with much money the person has much harm and much worry. Therefore, the verse says, “<i>Accept my discipline.</i>” Accept discipline with enthusiasm and not with laziness. The person who fulfills a commandment, who does not have positive thoughts and joy when he does it, then this commandment is considered as nothing. Similarly, when he gives charity, he should have good thoughts, since there are many people who do not give or one needs to force them. This charity is certainly not a good thought, since he does not do it <i>for the sake of heaven.</i> Therefore, the verse says here in the Torah portion, “<i>take for Me gifts</i>” [25:2].<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Terumah, Introduction.</i>
That is to say, take the gifts for My name, not that you should be pressured, or that you should do it for fame. Therefore its says, “<i>Take for Me.</i>” That is to say, when you want to give charity, give it to Me, so that no person will know of it, only you and I. That is why it says, <i>take</i> and it does not say, <i>give.</i> It teaches us that you should cause other people to give, and should take charity from them for the poor. He has done a very meritorious deed with this, that he pressures other people that they should give charity more than he gives himself. Concerning this, our sages said, “<i>he who causes others to do good is greater than the doer.</i>”<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Baba Bathra</i>, 9a.</i> Therefore, he also says, “<i>take for Me.</i>” That is to say, with the charity you also take Me to yourself. When the poor person is with you, then the Holy One is with you, as the verse says, “<i>He stands at the right hand of the needy</i>” [Psalms, 109:31]. Therefore, the Torah wrote the portion of <i>Terumah</i> near the giving of charity. That is why it is first written in this portion that the Holy One gave the Torah on Mount Sinai. This teaches us that the Holy One rests and is always where Torah is studied, and where charity is given.
<i>Baal ha-Turim</i> also writes. “<i>Take for Me</i>” [25:2]. This means, the Holy One said to Israel. You will take Me to yourself, when you study Torah I will be able to rest near you. The Torah showed this to us in this Torah portion that tells us that we should build a Tabernacle in which the Holy One will rest. The Torah showed us that when the Tabernacle and Temple will be destroyed, the Holy One rests where the Torah is studied and where charity is given. <sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Baal ha-Turim, Exodus, 25:2.</i>
<i>Toldot Yizhak</i> also writes. “<i>Take for Me</i>” [25:2]. This means, with the charity you betroth Me, just like the groom betroths the bride. That is why it does not say, <i>and they will give</i>, and that is why it does say, “<i>take for Me a gift</i>” [25:2]. That is to say, the person who gives charity takes from the Holy One a much greater reward than what he spent. Therefore, it also says, <i>My gift.</i> This means, the Holy One said: the gift and charity are Mine. The person should let himself think that he is the manager and should properly disburse to each poor person the money that the Holy One had given him, since the wealth is from the Holy One. “<i>Whose heart so moved him</i>” [25:2]. The person should give terumah with the good will of his heart. <i>Toldot Yizhak</i> writes here. This teaches us that just like the heart feeds the other organs of the body, but it does not take in any food, since there are many organs in the body. Some give food from themselves to other organs and do not take in food. Some accept food and do not give others food. So do not take and do not give. However, the heart gives but does not take. Therefore, he hangs giving charity on the heart. That is to say, he should be like the heart, which only gives and does not take. When he will give charity, he will be worthy that he will not need to take, like the heart. Therefore, it says, “<i>Whose heart so moved him</i>” [25:2], and does not say, <i>whose heart so moved.</i> This would mean that the heart moved. Therefore, it says, <i>his heart.</i> This means, move his heart. There are many people who give charity when they see others giving, but his heart has not yet been moved, but he must give out of embarrassment. Therefore, the verse says here that his heart should be moved to give charity.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Exodus, 25:2.</i>
Midrash <i>Tanhuma</i> writes and Yalkut and Bahya cite the midrash on “<i>Take for Me a gift</i>” [25:2]. Because I have given a Torah that is called a <i>good instruction,</i> therefore we also bring a gift. The Torah is called a good purchase, more than all the merchandise, silver and gold. It is a parable. There were two merchants; one had pepper and the other had ginger. They exchanged with each other. One had ginger and he had no more pepper. Similarly, the other one had pepper and lost his ginger. However, the one who studies Torah is not like this. When there are two <i>scholars</i>, one of them can teach a chapter and the other one can teach another chapter, and they study together, then each one can know both chapters. Furthermore, the Torah is called a <i>good gift</i>; one cannot lose it. There was a story that happened to a <i>scholar</i> who was on a ship along with many merchants. They said to the <i>scholar</i>, where is your merchandise? He said: my merchandise is better than all of your merchandise. They searched the ship and did not find it, and mocked him. Robbers boarded the ship and stole all of the merchandise. They went to a city and had no bread to eat. The scholar went to the house of study and they honored him greatly because of his Torah. The merchants saw that they were honoring him. They asked him if he would speak with the <i>communal leaders</i> on their behalf. The <i>scholar</i> said: I had told you previously that my <i>merchandise</i> is better than your <i>merchandise.</i> Furthermore, the one who has merchandise, sometimes he loses the merchandise, but the Torah remains with the person in this world and in the next world.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Midrash Tanhuma</i>, <i>Terumah</i>, 2; <i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, <i>Terumah</i>, <i>Remez</i>, 363; Bahya, Exodus, 25:2.</i>

“<i>And these are the gifts</i>” [25:3]. Rashi writes that there were three types of <i>gifts.</i> The first was that each person gave a coin from which were made the sockets for the <i>Tabernacle.</i> The second <i>gift</i> was that each one would give a coin that was used to purchase the <i>sacrifices</i> for the <i>altar.</i> The third <i>gift</i> was that each person gave what they wanted from good will, silver or gold, blue and purple wool. Thirteen types of things were brought for the building of the <i>Tabernacle.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Exodus, 25:2.</i> Silver, gold, and copper, blue and purple wool, crimson threads, linen threads, goat hair, tanned ram’s skins, hides of an animal called <i>Tahash</i>, which is called <i>techsen.</i>
The Talmud writes in [tractate <i>Shabbat</i>] <i>chapter two.</i> The Holy One sent the <i>animal tahash</i> in the wilderness to Moses, so that he should make a covering for the <i>Tabernacle.</i> This animal had many colors that shined beautifully. This animal disappeared and no animal like it was found afterwards. The animal had a horn in its forehead.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Shabbat</i>, 28a-b.</i>
There was no silk in the Tabernacle, since silk comes from a small worm, and the worm is <i>impure.</i> Therefore, there was no silk in the Tabernacle. Bahya writes here. The verse says, “<i>crimson yarns</i>” [25:4]. This is the red thread from a worm, and they dyed it with the worm’s blood, which is impure. The explanation is that they did not take the blood from the worms, but from the shells in which the worms grew. They took the shells and dyed the thread. Bahya also writes they mixed together wool and linen threads in the <i>Tabernacle</i>, even though the Torah had forbidden <i>shatnez</i>, but for the Tabernacle, <i>shatnez was permitted.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 25:3.</i>
“<i>Acacia wood</i>” [25:5]. The Midrash asks: how did Moses get acacia wood in the wilderness? The explanation is that Jacob had seen <i>prophetically</i> that Israel would build a <i>Tabernacle</i> in the wilderness. Thus, he planted acacia wood in Egypt and commanded his children that they should take these acacia trees into the wilderness. So write Rashi and Bahya.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Exodus, 25:5; Bahya, Exodus, 25:5.</i>
Bahya, <i>Toldot Yizhak</i>, and the Midrash write that Scripture first writes <i>gold</i> concerning the gifts. This teaches us that the building of the Tabernacle was an <i>atonement</i> for the <i>Calf</i> that the Israelites made out of gold. Therefore, also in the section on <i>sacrifices</i> it first mentions “<i>an ox or a sheep or a goat</i>” [Leviticus, 22:27]. This means, the ox, the sheep and goat. You should bring these as <i>sacrifices.</i> The ox is mentioned first and this shows that the sin of the Golden Calf was forgiven, since the Golden Calf was a calf, like the ox. Even though the sin of the Golden Calf was on the <i>seventeenth of Tammuz</i> and the Tabernacle was finished on <i>Yom Kippur</i>, yet the Torah writes about the building of the Tabernacle first. This teaches us that the Holy One first gives the atonement for the sin of the Golden Calf. The Holy One always sends the cure before the plague. The Midrash also says that <i>gold</i> refers to the <i>kingdom of Babylon.</i> It is written concerning it, “<i>you are the head of gold</i>” [Daniel, 2:38]. This interprets the dream and says, you are the golden head. <i>Silver</i> relates to the <i>kingdom of the Medes. Haman</i> said: I will give ten thousand pieces of silver for the Jews. <i>Copper</i> refers to the <i>kingdom of the Greeks.</i> He was a common king, like copper is common, compared to gold. “<i>Tanned ram skins</i>” [25:5]. Tanned hides of sheep that were in the Tabernacle refer to the <i>exile of Edom</i>, our exile. It is written concerning Edom, “<i>the first one emerged red</i>” [Genesis, 25:25]. Esau came out red from the womb. “<i>Oil for lighting</i>” [25:6] refers to the Messiah, who will illumine us like a good oil, to redeem us from the darkness of the exile. It is written concerning the Messiah, “<i>I have prepared a lamp for My anointed one</i>” [Psalms, 132:17]. I have prepared a light for the Messiah who will illumine you. This teaches us that everything was found in the <i>terumah.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 25:8; Toldot Yizhak, Exodus, 25:3–8; <i>Midrash Tanhuma</i>, <i>Terumah</i>, 8.</i>
When Israel are in exile, they should give <i>terumah</i> and charity. Thus, they will be redeemed from the exile, since when one does not give to Jacob, one gives it to Esau, silver and gold as <i>bribes</i> because of <i>false accusations.</i> So writes Rashi in the <i>Torah portion</i>, <i>Ki Teizei.</i> The Torah wrote that one should deal honestly with weights, that one should not give false weights, and nearby wrote the story of <i>Amalek</i> in which many Israelites were killed.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Deuteronomy, 25:17.</i> That is, when one does not do business properly with money and false weights, the enemy comes, <i>heaven forbid</i>, against Israel and kills them and takes their money. The Midrash teaches us that when the <i>Tabernacle</i> and <i>Temple</i> existed, this protected from the exile. However, when it was <i>destroyed</i>, charity will protect from the exile. Therefore, the Torah showed all the exiles by the <i>gifts</i> of the <i>Tabernacle.</i>
“<i>Lapis lazuli and other stones for setting</i>” [25:7]. Bahya writes. They took whole <i>precious stones</i> as they found them, since the <i>virtue</i> of each <i>precious stone</i> is when it is whole, as it was created. They did not need to touch any of them to chip them. One can ask a question. How did they write on these stones, if one could not throw away any part of them? When one wants to engrave something on a stone, then one must throw away the small bits that are dug out. The explanation is as the Talmud writes in [tractate] <i>Sotah.</i> They first drew the <i>letters</i> with ink and then they took a worm called <i>shamir</i> and laid it on the <i>letters.</i> The worm imprinted the <i>letters</i> on the <i>precious stones.</i> These <i>precious stones</i> were then set in gold. This teaches us that the Torah is over all the gold and silver, since the <i>names</i> were on the <i>precious stones</i> above them. The gold was under the precious stones, set in gold.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 25:7.</i>
“<i>Let them make for Me a Sanctuary</i>” [25:8]. The <i>Yalkut</i> writes that it is written in <i>Pesikta</i><sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Pesikta de Rav Kahana</i>, 2.10.</i> that Moses heard three things that frightened him. The Holy One said: make a sanctuary for Me in which to rest. Moses said: will all the wood and all the stone; the whole earth will be too small on which to build a house for You to live in? You are greater than the whole world and all the heavens. The Holy One responded: It is not as you, Moses, think. Make it only twenty boards for the <i>north</i> side, and twenty to the <i>south</i>, and make it in the <i>west.</i> I will dwell in it among you. The second time Moses was frightened was when the Holy One said to him: bring me sacrifices. Moses said: all the cattle and all the animals are not enough for one sacrifice for you. The Holy One responded: It is not as you, Moses, think. Every day only two sheep and not at one time, but one sheep early in the morning and another sheep at evening. The third time, the Holy One said to Moses. Let each person give his redemption for his body. Moses said: one cannot redeem the body with all the money in the world. The Holy One said: it is not as you think, but each one should give one small coin and his body will be redeemed. It is a parable. A person has a daughter and when she is small he speaks with her in the streets and the market, before the whole world. However, when he grows up, he is ashamed to talk with her and only speaks with her in the house, and not in front of the whole world. So too were Israel in Egypt. The Holy One showed everything, as the verse says, “<i>I will go through the land of Egypt</i>” [Exodus, 12:12]. Here the Holy One spoke with them publicly in the streets. Afterwards, again at the <i>sea</i>, the Holy One appeared publicly. When they came to Mount <i>Sinai</i> to accept the Torah, Israel became something important. The Holy One said: it is not just that I should speak with Israel publicly. Therefore, God commanded to make a sanctuary in order to speak with Israel in the sanctuary.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, <i>Terumah</i>, <i>Remez</i>, 365.</i>
Bahya writes that the sanctuary had three parts. First is the innermost part, behind the curtain, there was the <i>Ark</i>, the <i>Tablets</i>, and the <i>Cherubs.</i> This referred to the world above in heaven where the angels live. Just as the angels are pure intellect and wisdom, so too the Ark and Tablets are also pure intellect and inner wisdom. In relation to the person, it is the head; it is the mind and within it is speech. That we can speak with the mouth that is in the head, and speaking is pure wisdom. One recognizes a person immediately, if he is a fool or is wise, through his speech. The <i>primary wisdom</i> is in the mind. The second part was in the tabernacle in front of the <i>curtain.</i> It was called the <i>Tent of Meeting.</i> The Table, <i>Menorah</i>, and the <i>incense</i> [altar] stood in it. They were all important <i>vessels.</i> However, they were not as important as the first vessels that were on the inside. That is, the <i>Ark</i>, <i>Tablets</i>, and the <i>Cherubs.</i> This section is related to the <i>world of the spheres.</i> This is the lower heaven in which are the sun, moon, and other stars, which are also somewhat important. In relation to this in the person is the heart. It is also inside and is essential to life. Just like the life of the world depends on the sun and moon and their movement along with their airs. The third part of the Tabernacle was the <i>courtyard of the Tabernacle</i> in which all the animals were slaughtered for sacrifices. This relates to the world in which we live. The world and everything that is in it will disappear and must die from the world. This relates to the person’s organs, below the heart and further down. They burn and digest all the food and drink that the person eats and drinks. So writes Bahya.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 25:9.</i> This teaches us that when the person is pious, he is compared to the three <i>worlds</i>, of <i>angels</i>, <i>spheres</i>, and this world, and is compared to the Tabernacle. That is to say, the Shekhinah rests on the person when he is pious, just as the Holy One rests on the Tabernacle.
“<i>They shall make an ark of acacia wood</i>” [25:10]. Bahya asks a question. Why is it written concerning the Ark, “<i>they shall make</i>”? This means, they should make it together. Concerning the other vessels it is written, “<i>you shall make.</i>” The explanation is that concerning the Ark it is written, “<i>they shall make</i>,” they should make it together. That is to say, The Torah was in the <i>Ark</i> and the whole world has a share in it, for all of Israel to study, expecting that nobody in Israel should have an excuse that they have no share in the Torah. Therefore, it is written, “<i>they shall make.</i>” They should all together make a <i>Holy Ark</i> for the Torah.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 25:10.</i> <i>Imre Noam</i> and <i>Baal ha-Turim</i> write the same.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Imre Noam, Exodus, 25:10; Baal ha-Turim, Exodus, 25:10.</i> Therefore, it is written to make an ark before the other vessels. So too, the person should first study Torah for an hour or two, <i>with regularity</i>, every day. Afterwards, he should engage in business or his <i>work.</i>
Bahya writes another explanation. It is written, “<i>they shall make</i>” concerning the Ark. This teaches us that everyone in the world should support the study of Torah. If he himself does not study, then he should support <i>scholars</i>, so that the <i>scholars</i> should be able to remain at their studies. Thus, he will also have merit, just like a <i>scholar.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 25:10.</i>
“<i>Overlay it with pure gold</i>” [25:11]. This teaches us that the Holy One will make a canopy for the <i>scholars</i> along with those who helped them to study and gave him <i>provisions</i>, as the verse says, “<i>to be in the shelter of wisdom is to be also in the shelter of money</i>” [Ecclesiastes, 7:12]. That is to say, it was a canopy where the one who had studied Torah and the one who had helped him to study were together, as the verse says, “<i>she is a tree of life to those who grasp her</i>” [Proverbs, 3:18]. This means, the Torah is a long life for those who strengthen and help the study of Torah, even if he did not study himself. That is also why on the Ark all the measurements were half, as it is written, “<i>two and a half cubits long</i>” [25:10]. The Ark was two and one half cubits long and one and one half cubits wide, and one and one half cubits high. The verse only tells of measurements of halves. That is to say, the scholar should be humble and brokenhearted. He should not be arrogant because he knows how to study.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 25:10.</i>
<i>Toldot Yizhak</i> writes. “<i>Overlay it inside and out</i>” [25:11]. You should cover the Ark with gold inside and outside. That is to say, the <i>scholar</i>’<i>s</i> heart should be the same inside as he speaks outside with his mouth. There are <i>scholars</i> who speak and preach as if they were very pious, but in their heart it is not so. Therefore, our sages said that the Torah is compared to a clear glass, like a mirror that one sees through, and through it inside and out, so should be the <i>scholar.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Exodus, 25:11.</i>
<i>Imre Noam</i> writes. The Ark was made of wood and covered with gold. That is to say, when you see a <i>scholar</i> who is poor, you should help him and cover him with gold.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Imre Noam, Exodus, 25:10.</i>
Bahya and <i>Toldot Yizhak</i> write. It is written concerning the Ark, “<i>make upon it a gold molding</i>” [25:11], and concerning the <i>Table</i> and the <i>Altar</i> it is written, “<i>make for it</i>” [25:23]. This teaches us that the <i>Table</i> shows us, the Table points to the crown, the <i>kingship to wealth.</i> The <i>Altar</i> points to the <i>priesthood.</i> The <i>priests</i> performed their <i>service</i> there. There are two things, <i>kingship</i> and <i>priesthood</i>, that are inherited from one’s father. Concerning kingship it is written, “<i>written for him</i>” [Deuteronomy, 17:18], and concerning the priest it is written, “<i>it shall be for him and his descendants</i>” [Numbers, 25:13]. However, the Torah is not an inheritance for any person. Even though his father is a <i>scholar</i>, it is also possible that his son would be an <i>ignoramus.</i> However, a priest’s son will certainly be a priest. Similarly, a king who has a son, he will certainly be a king. Therefore, it is written concerning the <i>Table</i> and the <i>Altar</i>, <i>make.</i> That is to say, the crown of the <i>priesthood</i> is inherited from his father. However, the Torah is not inherited by the person. Therefore, it is written, <i>make upon it.</i> You should make a crown. The word <i>upon it</i> teaches us this. That is to say, the Torah must be upon him alone and not through inheritance. The Midrash writes, “<i>make upon it</i>” is written concerning the Ark of the Torah that contained the Tablets. This teaches us that the Torah is a crown over all the crowns. There are crowns of kingship and crowns of <i>priesthood.</i> When the king or the priest do not have Torah, then their crown is made meaningless.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 25:11; Toldot Yizhak, Exodus, 25:11.</i>
“<i>Make the Cherubim</i>” [25:18]. You should make two birds out of gold on the <i>Ark.</i> Bahya writes. It is written <i>two</i> [<i>shnayim</i>] and not <i>two</i> [<i>shnei</i>] concerning the Cherubs. This teaches us that the birds were not similar. One bird was like a male and the other was like a female. That is to say, their <i>appearance</i> was not similar. However, concerning the Tablets it is written, “<i>two tablets of the Pact</i>” [Exodus, 31:18], because they were the same. One Tablet was the same as the other Tablet. Concerning the birds it is also written, “<i>from between the two cherubim</i>” [Exodus, 25:22]. This shows us that the birds showed us the love of the Holy One. He loves us like a man and a woman who love each other. So the Holy One loves us very much, as the <i>Talmud</i> writes in <i>tractate Yoma.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Yoma</i>, 54a.</i> When Israel would come for the pilgrimage festivals in the <i>Temple</i>, the curtain was opened and they were shown the birds and they were told, God loves you very much, like a man loves a <i>woman.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 25:18.</i>
“<i>You shall make a table</i>” [25:23]. The Holy One commanded to make a Table in the Tabernacle on which to place the bread that the <i>priests</i> ate. There was enough for many priests. When a priest ate an amount the size of a pea, he was satiated. Therefore, the Table was called <i>Shulhan</i>, because the Holy One sent His <i>blessing</i> on it. It is written, “<i>acacia wood</i>” [25:23] concerning the Table. This teaches us that from the Table, P<i>eace,</i> G<i>oodness,</i> S<i>alvation,</i> F<i>orgiveness,</i> came to the world. This was from the word <i>acacia.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">In Hebrew, the word for acacia is “<i>shittim.</i>” Thus, shittim is seen as an acronym for these four words, which have as their initial letter the letters of the word <i>shittim.</i></i> It is written similarly concerning the Ark and Altar. This shows us that from these come the blessings in the world. This shows us that the Table was compared to the Altar, and forgives the sins of the person, just like the Altar. When one gives bread to a poor person to eat at his table, this is like a sacrifice. Therefore, it is the custom in the land of <i>France</i> that when one of the <i>pietists</i> dies, they make his casket for his burial from his table. That is to say, the person does not take with him from this world when he dies, except for the charity that he did with his bread at his table.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 25:23.</i>
“<i>Make its bowls</i>” [25:29]. You shall make bowls. This was an iron form into which the bread was placed into the oven. When the bread was taken out of the form, it was placed into a golden form and placed on the Table until the Sabbath morning.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Exodus, 25:29.</i>
“<i>You shall make a lampstand of pure gold</i>” [25:31]. You should make a golden lampstand with seven branches. God had commanded this so that the person should be fearful when he will come into the Tabernacle and will see beautiful lights standing before him. He will consider the Sanctuary to be important. Therefore, the lampstand stood in front of the <i>curtain</i>, before the people. That is to say, the Holy One Himself does not need light, but it should illumine for the people. It is known that the soul has great pleasure when it sees much light. Each person’s soul was taken from heaven, which is purely a great light. Therefore, the <i>soul has pleasure</i> when it sees light, and therefore, <i>King Solomon, of blessed memory</i>, compared the soul to a light, as the verse says, “<i>the lifebreath of man is the lamp of the Lord</i>” [Proverbs, 20:27]. Therefore, the lampstand had seven branches for the seven great stars that rule the world. The lampstand stood on the <i>south</i> side, since wisdom and Torah is with the people who live on the <i>south</i> side. The lampstand was compared to the Torah, as the verse says, “<i>for the commandment is a lamp, the Torah is a light</i>” [Proverbs, 6:23].<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 25:31.</i>
The Table was in the <i>north</i> of the lampstand and the Table was about wealth, since the essence of gold comes from the north, as the verse says, “<i>by the north the golden rays emerge</i>” [Job, 37:22]. This teaches us that the person cannot study the Torah alone; he must have something with it. That is to say, he must also eat. Therefore, the Table stood near the lampstand, which is compared to the Torah.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 25:38.</i>
<i>Baal ha-Turim</i> writes. It is written that the letter <i>samech</i> is not found in the section on the lampstand. This teaches us that where there is light, there is no <i>Satan</i> and no evil encounters. Therefore, each person is warned to go with a light at night whenever possible.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Baal ha-Turim, Exodus, 25:31.</i>
The Midrash writes, as well as Bahya in the <i>Torah portion Bereshit.</i> It is known that on <i>Friday</i> the <i>Satan</i> is found, as the Talmud writes in [tractate <i>Gittin</i>] <i>chapter five.</i> The <i>Satan</i> incited two <i>householders</i> that they always had to argue with each other. <i>Rabbi Meir</i> came to them and made the <i>Satan</i> remain outside for three consecutive <i>Fridays</i> and <i>Rabbi Meir</i> made peace between the two <i>householders</i> and the <i>Satan</i> had to go away from there. The Satan was heard to say, <i>Rabbi Meir</i> has taken away my dwelling because the <i>householders</i> are at peace.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Gittin</i>, 52a.</i> Now I cannot live there. It was heard that Satan’s primary activity is on Friday. If one wants to ask why specifically on Friday, Midrash <i>Rabbah</i> writes that the Holy One created the demons late on Friday, just as the Sabbath was about to begin.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Genesis Rabbah</i>, 7.5.</i> Therefore, there are many demons on the eve of the Sabbath. This is also why we recite [the prayer] <i>Magen Avot</i> [shield of the Patriarchs] when the Sabbath begins to protect us from the demons. We should be warned to listen to this prayer when the cantor recites it and not to have conversations, as <i>Rabbi Hertz</i> writes in his prayer book.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">This is a reference to the prayer book, <i>Maleah ha-Aretz Deah</i>, published by Rabbi Naphtali Hertz of Treves, with his commentary, Thuengen, 1560. I could not find this comment in the comments on the prayer <i>Magen Avot</i> (p. 194).</i>
A story happened that a rabbi died. The rabbi appeared to his student in a dream. The student saw a sign a stain on that they put on the rabbi’s forehead in the other world. The student asked: what is the meaning of the stain on your forehead? The rabbis responded that he always used to have conversations when the cantor recited <i>Magen Avot</i> on Friday evening. He also chatted when the <i>cantor</i> recited the <i>Kaddish.</i> He also did not cut his fingernails for every Sabbath. Therefore, he was disgraced in the next world and he had to have a sign on his forehead. <i>Sefer ha-Gan</i> writes that one should not cut his nails on Thursday, as they will grow again on the Sabbath. We will now put this aside and explain again why the women must light and bless the lights. The explanation is because the Satan was created with her. Therefore, she lights the lights on the eve of the Sabbath in order to chase away the Satan. He was created on the eve of the Sabbath, <i>at twilight</i>, as is written in the <i>chapters.</i>
“<i>Note well and follow the patterns</i>” [25:40]. The Holy One said: make the Lampstand in the same form as you were shown. The Holy One had shown <i>Moses Our Teacher</i> a Lampstand of fire that he should copy in gold. Even though Moses could not copy a Lampstand, the Holy One said: throw the gold in the fire and a finished Lampstand will come out of it.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanhuma</i>, <i>Beha</i>’<i>alotekha</i>, 3.</i>
Bahya asks a question. Because it is written in the verse, <i>with their pattern</i>, with a <i>bet</i>, and it is not written, <i>like their pattern</i>, with a <i>kaf,</i> this teaches us that Moses could not copy as he had been shown. He was shown a heavenly fire and that fire is not like our fire, since our fire can be comprehended, but the fire from heaven is not so. It is pure <i>spirituality.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 25:40.</i>
Toldot Yizhak writes. The Ark alludes to a scholar, who should be with his heart as he is with his mouth. He should know that if he will have the proper <i>faith</i> in his heart, so that he can have this world and the next world. He can become like an angel, since the Cherubs refer to angels. They were on the Ark, even though the Ark was made of wood. So too, the person is flesh and blood, yet he can attain the level of an angel in the next world. The <i>Table</i> alludes to wealth of this world. The <i>Lampstand</i> alludes to the next world, which is pure light. The boards of the Tabernacle refer to the students who study with the rabbis and stand around him, like the boards around the Tabernacle. The sheets of the Tabernacle refer to the householders who bring students and protect them, like the <i>sheets</i> protected the Tabernacle, so that no wind or rain went into the Tabernacle.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Exodus, 25:31.</i>
“<i>Make for Me an altar of earth</i>” [20:21]. Bahya writes. There was a miracle with the <i>copper Altar.</i> It was made of very thin copper, thin as a golden gulden. Underneath it was wood, and under the wood was earth. The fire was on the thin copper, day and night constantly, and it was not burned. Moses was very afraid that the copper would be burned. The Holy One said: you were on Mount Sinai where there was a great fire and I was there and you were not burned. With such pure fire, I can also protect the altar of copper so that the copper and the wood that is underneath it will never be burned.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 27:8.</i>

Tetzaveh

Bahya writes. <i>King Solomon, of blessed memory</i>, said: “<i>Oil and incense gladden the heart, and the sweetness of a friend is better than one</i>’<i>s own counsel</i>” [Proverbs, 27:9]. The verse teaches us that one should feed the stranger and the poor and one should speak positively with them. King Solomon compared the food to oil and incense that smells nice. This teaches us that one should honor the poor person with good food, well prepared and good tasting, to rejoice the heart of the poor person. He should speak nicely to the poor person. This is the meaning of “<i>the sweetness of a friend.</i>” That is to say, he should speak with him as if he was his good friend. Therefore, the verse also says, “<i>than one</i>’<i>s own counsel.</i>” That is to say, the good words to the poor person should be with his whole heart. There are many who speak with their mouth to the poor person, that he should eat, but his heart is not in it. The Midrash says about the verse, “<i>Oil and incense gladden the heart.</i>” The oil and the incense gladden the heart of the Holy One. So too, with the Holy One’s creatures it is written, “<i>may the Lord rejoice in His works</i>” [Psalms, 104:31]. The Holy One was also joyous. After the completion of the building of the Tabernacle the Lampstand was lit with oil and <i>incense</i> was brought. The Holy one was also happy, just like after the Holy One’s creation of humanity, which was the most important creation of all things. So too, after the completion of the Tabernacle, the Holy One commanded the <i>high priest</i> to light [the Lampstand] in the Tabernacle. Therefore, the portion says here.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, <i>Tezaveh</i>, Introduction.</i>
“<i>You shall further instruct the Israelites</i>” [27:20]. They should light lights and are commanded that they should take olive oil and not oil from sesame seeds or nuts. The first oil was taken for the Lampstand. The other oil that came out was taken for <i>meal offerings.</i> “<i>Beaten oil for lighting</i>” [27:20]. This teaches us that the first Sanctuary stood for four hundred and ten years and the second Sanctuary stood for four hundred and twenty years. This is found in the word <i>beaten</i>, which has the numerical value of eight hundred and thirty years, the length of time that both Temples stood. It is written <i>beaten</i>, that is to say, the two <i>Temples</i> were destroyed and demolished by the enemies. However, the third Temple will remain standing forever. Therefore, it is not mentioned along with the two Temples, but it is mentioned in the word, <i>for lighting.</i> That is to say, the Messiah will light Israel with a great light.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 27:20.</i>
<i>Baal ha-Turim</i> writes. Moses’ name is not mentioned in this Torah portion. This teaches us that because Moses said to the Holy One when Israel made the Golden Calf, if you will kill the Israelites because of the Golden Calf, then erase me from Your book and do not write me in the Torah. Therefore, the Holy One did not write the name of Moses in this portion. The <i>curse</i> of a sage is never without effect.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Baal ha-Turim, Exodus, 27:20.</i>
<i>Zeror ha-Mor</i> writes. Israel in the exile are compared to <i>olive oil.</i> Just as an olive that is beaten, so too are Israel in exile. One beats them and hits them from all sides. However, in the end they will go out from the exile and will light, like the olive oil lights, from the merit of the Torah, which is compared to an olive. Therefore, the portion says here, “<i>to bring you</i>” [27:20]. That is to say, the Torah that you keep and fulfill properly, it is for you alone and not for any stranger. It remains yours forever in this world and in the next world. Nobody can take away from you the commandments that you have fulfilled. Therefore, it also says <i>to you.</i> That is to say, I do not need the light. I have enough light in heaven, but make a light for yourself, that it should light for you. It is a parable. A blind person is walking with someone who is guiding him. The one who is guiding says to the blind person, light a light for me. The blind person responded: you are supposed to lead me and show me the right way in the darkness. Now you tell me to light a light? The one who was guiding him responded: nonetheless light a light for me so that it should be seen that you are also serving me. So too, Israel are like the blind one and go in the darkness, but the Holy One illumines for them and says to Israel that they should light a light, expecting that through this they should be <i>worthy of blessings</i> from God because they served Him and do His will.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Zeror ha-Mor, Exodus, 27:20.</i>
“<i>These are the vestments they are to make</i>” [28:4]. You should make garments for the <i>high priest</i>, for when he will perform the service. The high priest is compared to an angel. Therefore, he should have garments that are different from those of other people, when he performs the service. Just as an angel is beautifully dressed, so too the high priest should be beautifully dressed.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 28:2.</i>
Bahya and <i>Toldot Yizhak</i> write that the Talmud writes in [tractate] <i>Erubin.</i> Just as the sacrifices atoned for the sins, so too the garments of the <i>high priest</i> atoned for sins. The breastpiece was a garment that the high priest wore over his heart. This atoned for the sins that were done with <i>laws and judgments.</i> The <i>ephod</i> atoned for those who worshipped foreign gods. The <i>robe</i> was a shirt that atoned for <i>slander.</i> The <i>fringed tunic</i> was another shirt of the high priest. This atoned for <i>murder.</i> The <i>headdress</i> was a cap on the head of the high priest. This atoned for the person’s <i>arrogance.</i> The <i>sash</i> was a belt that <i>atoned</i> for the evil thoughts that a person has in his heart. “<i>Gold plate</i>,” this was a golden plate on his forehead of the high priest and this atoned for <i>insolence.</i> “<i>Pants</i>” atoned for illicit sex.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 28:4; Toldot Yizhak, Exodus, 28:4.</i>
<i>Bahya</i> writes that the verse lists six garments, even though there were eight garments. The explanation is that he lists all the garments that Moses dressed <i>Aaron the priest</i>, publicly before the whole community. However, the pants, the priest put them on himself and no person saw this. Therefore, he does not count here the pants and also does not count the gold plate. This was a gold plate for the high priest. He wore it on his forehead. Since it was an ornament and not a garment, therefore it is not listed among the garments.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 28:4.</i>
“<i>They shall make the ephod</i>” [28:6]. <i>Bahya</i> asks a question. Earlier in the portion, the verse lists the breastpiece first and here it talks about the ephod first. The explanation is that the ephod was a proper garment for the high priest and the breastpiece was a garment under the ephod. Therefore, the verse says here ephod first, and above the verse lists the breastpiece first, because holy names were written on the breastpiece.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 28:6.</i>
There were also six names of the tribes on one part of the breastpiece, <i>Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah, Dan, and Naphtali.</i> They were inscribed on a <i>precious stone</i> of the breastpiece, and <i>Issachar, Zebulon, Gad, Asher, Joseph, and Benjamin</i> were written on the other <i>precious stone</i> of the breastpiece, and the two <i>precious stones</i> were onyx stones. They took a worm that was called <i>shamir</i> and they laid it on the stone and it engraved the names of the tribes. The ephod was a garment as wide as the person’s back, down to his feet. Two shoulder bands were on each side, and on each shoulder band was an onyx set in gold and on each onyx was written the names of six tribes.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 28:10.</i>
The breastpiece was a garment woven with silk and gold. Four rows of <i>precious stones</i> were on the breastpiece. Each row had three stones; all together twelve stones. On each stone was written the name of a <i>tribe</i> and <i>Abraham, Isaac, Jacob</i>, and other <i>holy names</i> were written on it. Each <i>precious stone</i> had six <i>letters.</i> There were seventy-two <i>letters</i> for the seventy-two hours that are in the six days of the week that were created in six days. The world exists through the merit of the tribes. Therefore, there were seventy-two letters.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 28:15.</i>
Bahya writes. The breastpiece was on the heart of the high priest, and the ephod was a garment in back, on his back. The breastpiece and the ephod were attached together, like a <i>four-cornered garment</i> is made. The twelve names of the tribes were opposite the heart of the high priest. The twelve names of the tribes were also on the shoulders of the high priest, and the names were called <i>urim</i> and <i>thumim.</i> When a person had to ask something, he came to the high priest and stood before the high priest. The high priest looked at the breastpiece on his heart, and the letters of the <i>breastpiece</i> stood out and from the letters the priest thought and learned what word the letters meant. Then the high priest answered the person what he needed. The <i>high priest</i> did not give answers through the breastpiece to anyone except if it was a king or a community that needed something.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 28:30.</i>
Bahya writes. The twelve <i>precious stones</i> were the most precious of all <i>precious stones.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">The modern names of the stones mentioned are not always clear. Translations and dictionaries differ on the names assigned to the Hebrew terms. I have followed the names given in the NJPS English translation of the Bible, as found in Exodus, 28:15, except where the Yiddish terminology in the text gives a different term that is clear.</i> They took a <i>precious stone</i> called <i>carnelian.</i> This is a ruby, a red stone, and they wrote on it the name of Reuben. Since he was shamed by his brothers and his face turned red, because he had disturbed the bed of his father with his stepmother Bilhah, therefore, his name was written on the precious stone that is called ruby, which is red. The characteristic of this precious stone is when a woman is having a difficult pregnancy; a ruby on her body will prevent a miscarriage. When a woman is having a difficult birth, the same precious stone called ruby should be hung on this woman. When a woman cannot get pregnant, they should grind up the stone finely and give it to the woman to drink, and she will become pregnant. This was all an <i>allusion</i> to <i>Reuben</i> who brought mandrakes from the field to his mother, <i>Leah. Leah</i> gave these mandrakes to <i>Rachel</i>, and <i>Rachel</i> loaned the bedding of her husband to <i>Leah</i>, for the mandrakes. <i>Leah</i> did this because she wanted to make her husband <i>Jacob</i> lusty in bed with the mandrakes, and the mandrakes are good for making a woman get pregnant. Therefore, they wrote the name of <i>Reuben</i> on the precious stone that is called ruby, which is also good for women to get pregnant.
The name of <i>Simeon</i> was on the <i>precious stone</i> that is called <i>chrysolite.</i> This is a stone that is green and yellow. <i>Simeon</i> was shamed that they <i>sinned</i> through <i>illicit sex</i> with the daughters of <i>Midian.</i> The <i>characteristic</i> of this <i>precious stone</i> is that it makes the body cold; one that is, feverish and hot. Therefore, the person is always with women because he is feverish and engages in <i>illicit sex</i>, but the <i>precious stone</i> makes the feverish body cold, and that he should not go after illicit sex. Therefore, these stones are very numerous in the land of <i>Ethiopia</i>, which is a very warm land, and the people engage in much sex. They chase away the heat of their body with the stone.
<i>Levi</i> was inscribed on a precious stone that was called <i>emerald</i>; a carbuncle that shines like a light. Noah had placed it in the ark so that there was light in the ark. Therefore, because Levi was a scholar and made Israel’s eyes light through the Torah. Therefore, his name was written on the carbuncle of the <i>breastpiece</i> of judgment. The characteristic of the carbuncle is that it makes people clever, that they have great understanding and wisdom.
Judah was written on a <i>turquoise.</i> This is a “shamrock”<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">The meaning of this word is unclear.</i> that has a green color, because his face was shamed that he slept with his daughter-in-law, <i>Tamar</i>, and his face became green, like a “shamrock.” The characteristic of this <i>precious stone</i> is that when someone goes to war, he kills his enemies. Judah won all the wars of <i>King David</i> and in the day of the <i>Messiah, the son of David</i>, he will also win all the wars.
<i>Issachar</i> was in a <i>precious stone</i> that is called <i>sapphire,</i> because from <i>Issachar there were only scholars.</i> They studies Torah that was written on sapphire. <i>Moses Our Teacher</i> chopped out in heaven from under the <i>Throne of Glory</i> two tablets of sapphire and wrote the <i>Ten Statements</i> on them. Therefore, whoever studies Torah, he comes to the <i>Throne of Glory</i> after his death. <i>Measure for measure.</i> Since he studied Torah that was written on <i>sapphire</i>, he also comes to the place where there is <i>sapphire.</i> This precious stone is good if a person has an illness, and it is on his body, he is healed. The Torah is also a remedy for the body.
<i>Zebulon</i> was written on mother of pearl. This alludes to wealth. Its characteristic is that one has great luck to attain wealth when one carries it. It also has the characteristic that it puts a person to sleep. Zebulon was named this because it was said about him, “<i>this time my husband will exalt me</i>” [Genesis, 30:20]. This means, my husband will sleep with me and spend the night with me.
<i>Dan</i> was written on <i>turquoise.</i> There was a face of a person with his face turned away on it. This alluded that the <i>tribe of Dan</i> turned their faces away from God and worshiped foreign gods.
<i>Naphtali</i> was written on a <i>topaz</i> and its characteristic was that he rides a horse and sits well on it and does not fall off. Therefore, knights and nobles had this precious stone with them. Because Naphtali was called Naphtali, which means to join, just as the precious stone also made the man join with the horse on which he rode.
<i>Gad</i> was written on a <i>crystal.</i> This precious stone has the whole world within it, and each child know sit well. The tribe of Gad was very large and had many people. All the nations recognized his blows. He chopped off the head and arm of a man. The characteristic of the crystal is that it makes the heart of the person strong so that he is not fearful and will not flee in the war.
<i>Asher</i>’<i>s</i> name was written on a precious stone that was called <i>beryl.</i> Its characteristic was that it helped a person’s digestion. So too, Asher had good food that was soon digested.
J<i>oseph</i> was written on lapis lazuli. The characteristic of this precious stone was that one had favor in the eyes of people. So too, <i>Joseph had favor</i> in the eyes of all the people and whoever carries it, his words will be heard before kings and ministers.
<i>Benjamin</i> was written on a stone that was called <i>jasper.</i> It has three colors, red, black and green. The characteristic of this precious stone is to stop blood. Therefore, the stone was given to Benjamin who had many thoughts in his heart, if he should tell his father that the brothers sold Joseph. However, he did not want to say, but he knew well that the brothers sold Joseph. Therefore, the stone is called <i>jasper</i> [<i>yeshpeh</i>]. This is two words, <i>yesh peh.</i> That is to say, Benjamin had a mouth to speak, but he did not want to speak. Bahya also writes that the precious stones have to be kept very clean, since if they are not kept clean, they lose their characteristics and do not help.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">The discussions of the stones, beginning from “Bahya writes” until here are all from Bahya, Exodus, 28:15.</i>
<i>Toldot Yizhak</i> also writes about the precious stones and asks a question about Bahya. How is it that one gives a topaz to Simeon and should cause a disgrace to the <i>breastpiece of judgment</i>, which was given for atonement and joy for Israel. Therefore, the Toldot Yizhak gives an explanation. This topaz was given to Simeon because this topaz removes illicit sex from the one who pursues illicit sex. There was a story about a <i>nobleman</i> who was on a long journey, far from his wife. The nobleman took a precious stone named topaz. He commanded his wife: take the topaz and wear it on your neck, expecting that you should remember me, since I will be away. The woman took the topaz and hung it on her neck. She engaged in illicit sex while her husband was away. When the nobleman came home, the nobleman said: where is the topaz? She showed it to him and it was split apart, since the topaz cannot tolerate illicit sex. It will split if someone wears it and has illicit sex. The nobleman said to his wife: why is the stone split? She was so embarrassed that she did not know what to answer. That is why the topaz was given to Simeon. That is to say, he was shown that he should guard against illicit sex and should repent for it. Then the Holy One will forgive him the sin. Therefore, see that your topaz should not be split in the <i>breastpiece of judgment.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Exodus, 28:17–20.</i>
The Talmud writes in <i>tractate Sotah.</i> The <i>shamir</i> was a worm with which the names of the tribes were engraved. The worm was as small as a barley grain and was created during the <i>six days of creation.</i> The worm was kept in wool and in a lead vessel. They put a barley paste in the vessel. When the worm was placed on a stone or iron or anything hard, it split everything.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Sotah</i>, 48b.</i>
The <i>Jerusalem Talmud</i> writes in <i>tractate Yoma.</i> A woman by the name of <i>Kimhit</i> had seven sons and they all became <i>high priest</i> in the Temple. The sages sent to that woman and asked of her. What kind of meritorious thing did you do that you were worthy of sons who became <i>high priest?</i> She responded that she was very careful all of her days that she did not show the hair of her head, even for the beams of her house. Therefore, she was worthy of this.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">J. <i>Yoma</i>, 1.1.</i>
We find many <i>righteous</i> women who bring pious children into the world through their prayers and through their modesty. We find concerning Hannah that she prayed to God that she should have children, since she could not have children. She came to the Temple and prayed and said: <i>Lord of the universe</i>, see my pain and my troubles. Give me a child, and you will not listen to me to give me a child, I will sequester myself with a stranger, expecting that my husband, <i>Elkanah</i>, should see this. He will think that I engaged in illicit sex and will bring me to the Temple to the <i>high priest</i>, to make me drink the <i>bitter water.</i> These are the bitter waters that were used to test if a woman had engaged in illicit sex when she sequestered herself with a stranger, and there were no witnesses that she slept with him. The high priest said to each woman who was given the water to drink: if you engaged in illicit sex the water should make your body swell. If you are not guilty and are innocent of this sin, God should give you that you should have good children. If she previously had no children, God gave her after the water drinking that she was able to give birth to good children. Therefore, <i>Hannah</i> said that she would sequester herself with a strange man, expecting that God would give her children. So Hannah spoke in her prayer. The Holy One accepted her honest words and her prayer and gave her a pious son who was a prophet for all of Israel, whose name was Samuel the prophet.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Berakhot,</i> 31b.</i>
“<i>You shall make the robe of the ephod</i>” [28:31]. They made a shirt for the <i>high priest</i> and at the bottom of the shirt there were seventy-two bells, expecting that when the <i>high priest</i> went into the inner part of the <i>Temple</i>, he rang with the bells. That is, it is like he notified that he wanted to go into the inner part of the Temple, into the holy place. It is the custom among <i>kings</i> that whoever wants to go to them, into their <i>room</i>, he must first announce himself. His neck might depend on it, if he does not announce himself. Therefore, the priest wore them, even though before the Holy One and before His angels everything is open and is known without the bells. However, this was done for the honor of the angels who used to be in the <i>Temple</i> all the time. That is, they should leave and allow the priest to do the service in the Temple and also so that the angels should not harm him. When the priest left, he also jingled, as if he was asking the <i>angels</i> to come back to do their service. It was this way all year that he jingled in order to ask permission to come in and again for permission to go out.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 28:35.</i>
“<i>You shall make a frontlet of pure gold</i>” [28:36]. The priest had a golden plate on his forehead to his ears and there were holes on the edges into which silk strings were put, to tie it on the back of his head, so that it lay firmly on his forehead.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Exodus, 28:36–37.</i>
Bahya also writes that it was a great wonder for the priests. They worked every day in the Temple in a simple shirt and barefoot. They suffered much cold, summer and winter. Therefore, they had to appoint experts who oversaw which ones were weak. There were many of them who were weak in their innards from the cold. They always had to immerse in the cold water and afterwards they had to go barefoot and in a shirt to do the <i>service.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 28:43.</i>
“<i>This is what you shall do</i>” [29:1]. Bahya asks a question. Why does the verse have to say, “<i>the thing</i>”? The explanation is that this teaches us that the sacrifices will be abrogated. Speech and prayer will be accepted by God, just like the sacrifices. Therefore, the verse says here, “<i>this thing.</i>” That is to say, words are substituted for the sacrifices.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 29:1.</i>
The Levites sang a different <i>Psalm</i> every day at the sacrifices. On the first day of the week, they sang, “<i>The earth is the Lord</i>’<i>s and all that it holds</i>” [Psalm 24]. That is to say, that God created the earth on the first day. It was dark and desolate. On the second day of the week, the Levites sang a psalm that began, “<i>A song. A psalm of the Korahites</i>” [Psalm 48]. That is to say, the Holy One separated the Levites from the Israelites since the Levites were holier than other Israelites. On the second day the Holy One separate the waters of the earth from the waters that are in heaven, close to the Holy One. On the third day of the week, the Levites sang a psalm, “<i>Among the divine beings, He pronounces judgment</i>” [Psalm 82]. On the third day the Holy One created all sorts of trees in the Garden of Eden. That is to say, when the person commits sins, the Holy One will pronounce judgment to expel him from the Garden of Eden. On the fourth day the Levites sang, “<i>God of retribution, Lord</i>” [Psalm 94]. The gentiles worshipped the sun and the moon as idols, which were created on the fourth day. The Holy One takes retribution on them. On the fifth day they sang, “<i>Sing joyously to God, our strength</i>” [Psalm 81]. It is written in it, “<i>who brought you out of the land of Egypt</i>” [Psalms, 81:11]. That is to say, Pharaoh compared himself to a great fish that was compared to the fifth day when the fish were created. On the sixth day they sang, “<i>The Lord is king, He is robed in grandeur</i>” [Psalm 93]. Man was created on the sixth day in the image of the Holy One. That is to say, when he is pious the person has dominion over everything in the world. On the Sabbath they sang, “<i>A psalm. A song for the Sabbath</i>” [Psalm 92]. God rests and we should also rest on the Sabbath.
<i>Ibn Shuaib</i> writes in this portion. “<i>Remember what Amalek did to you</i>” [Deuteronomy, 25:17]. Our sages made four portions: the <i>portion of the shekels</i>, the <i>portion of remembrance</i>, the <i>portion of the red heifer</i>, and the <i>portion of the month</i>, during the <i>month of Adar.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">These are four additional readings that are added to the regular Sabbath Torah portions.</i> Immediately after the <i>portion of the shekels</i>, the <i>portion of remembrance</i> is read, concerning Amalek. That is to say, first they gave the shekels. That is a silver coin [given] to the Temple for the sacrifices. With this, one erased Amalek from the world. The shekels were an atonement and redemption for Israel, from the shekels that Haman wanted to give for Israel, ten thousand weight of silver to <i>Ahasuerus</i>, for the destruction of Israel. The Holy One always sends the remedy before the plague. So too, the Holy One commanded to give shekels to abrogate Haman’s shekels. Therefore, we must remember Amalek and his descendant Haman for ill every year. Therefore, the verse says, “<i>Remember what Amalek did to you</i>” [Deuteronomy, 25:17]. Remember Amalek with your mouth and curse him. He dwelled very far from Israel, behind seven kings, and he went over all seven kings and killed many Israelites. He took the men and cut off their <i>private parts.</i> He told the Holy One to take his <i>circumcised organs</i> that He had commanded and threw their organs toward heaven. Even though he had seen the great miracles that the Holy One had done for Israel. All of the kings were afraid to touch Israel. However, Amalek gave all the kings heart to attack Israel. The Midrash asks a question. Why did Amalek not come against Israel when they were few in number? When Israel went down to Egypt, they were still few in number. Some sages said; Amalek said, because he could not do evil with four hundred people that went to meet Jacob. Therefore, Amalek was afraid to do anything to Israel. Some sages say that he did not want to attack such a small group. He thought it would be an embarrassment. Some sages say that Amalek said: If I were to destroy Israel from the world, and they would not serve Egypt, then I would have to serve Egypt, since the Holy One said to Abraham, your descendants have to serve Egypt. Amalek was also a descendant of <i>Abraham. Isaac</i>’<i>s</i> son was <i>Esau</i>, the father of Amalek. When the <i>Israelites</i> are negligent in the <i>commandments</i>, then <i>Amalek has power</i> over <i>Israel.</i> So too, even though Israel had the cloud around them in the wilderness, so that no bow and arrow could not do anything to Israel, since the cloud did not allow anything evil to happen to <i>Israel.</i> However, the cloud threw out the Israelite evildoers who were in the wilderness and it is these that <i>Amalek</i> killed. So too with <i>Haman</i>, the <i>descendant of Amalek.</i> The <i>Israelites</i> were evil and ate at the banquet of <i>Ahasuerus.</i> Haman rose up and wanted to kill them. Some sages said that they bowed down to the image. Therefore, Haman had some power to kill them, as the verse tells us about Haman three ways, “<i>to destroy, massacre, and to exterminate</i>” [Esther, 3:13]. The first, <i>to destroy</i>, means that is Haman wanted to destroy the <i>Torah and commandments</i> from <i>Israel. To massacre</i> means he wanted to destroy their bodies. <i>To exterminate</i> means he wanted to destroy their goods and money. Therefore, Israel does three things on <i>Purim.</i> First, we read the Book of Esther. This is related to their desire to remove the Torah from us. The second is that Haman wanted to destroy their bodies. Therefore, we drink and eat well to make the body rejoice on <i>Purim.</i> The third thing Haman wanted to destroy was the goods and money of Israel. Therefore we send presents to the <i>paupers</i> and poor people. <i>Ibn Shuaib</i> asks a question. Why did our sages make eating and drinking wine an essential part of <i>Purim</i>, and with other <i>holidays</i> they did not make eating and drinking essential? How appropriate is it that they should be commanded to drink much, since much evil comes from drinking, as we find concerning <i>Noah</i>, and concerning <i>Lot</i>, who slept with his daughters through drinking wine? How appropriate is it that the Talmud writes that one must drink until one becomes drunk?<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Megillah</i>, 7b.</i> <i>Maimonides</i> wrote that one must drink until one falls asleep from the drinking.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mishne Torah, Hilkhot Megillah</i>, 2.15.</i> An incident happened that <i>Ravah</i> was so <i>drunk on Purim</i> that he slaughtered his friend <i>Rabbi Zeira.</i> Afterwards, he prayed and brought him back to life. Another year on Purim, <i>Ravah</i> called <i>Rabbi Zeira</i> that he should drink with him. He did not want to. He said: the Holy One does not cause a <i>miracle</i> every day. Who knows? You might want to slaughter me again. However, the explanation is therefore they made that one should drink on <i>Purim</i> because the <i>story of Ahasuerus</i> was from the beginning to the end, only about drinking. There were four <i>banquets</i> by <i>Ahasuerus.</i> The first banquet was made by <i>Ahasuerus and Vashti</i>, and through this <i>Vashti</i> was killed, expecting that <i>Esther</i> would take the <i>crown</i> and redeem the Jews from the hands of Haman. The second banquet was when <i>Esther</i> married Ahasuerus. The king made a banquet and through it was learned that two noblemen, <i>Bigthan and Seresh</i>, wanted to <i>poison</i> the king. They spoke a language that nobody understood, except for Mordecai. He heard that they wanted to poison the king and Mordecai told this to the king. As a result, it was written that Mordecai had protected the king from death. Haman had wanted to hang Mordecai, but at that time they read in the <i>chronicle</i> of the king how Mordecai had protected the king from death. The king became angry with Haman and said: you want to hang a good man who protected me from death? Therefore, the king had Haman hanged. All of this happened as a result of drinking at the second banquet of Ahasuerus. “<i>He disdained</i>” [Esther, 3:6]. The Midrash writes. The Holy One said: I could not destroy Israel in the wilderness when they made the Golden Calf, and you <i>evil Haman</i> wanted to expel and destroy them? A parable. A bird made a nest by the sea. A wave came from the sea and flooded the nest. The bird said: I want to make your water dry, so that there should not be any more sea. The bird took a little water and threw it on the dry land. He took earth and threw it on the sea. That is, he wanted to make the sea dry. Another bird came to this bird and said to him; what are you doing? The bird responded: let me tell you what the sea did; it drowned my nest. Therefore, I wanted to destroy it and make it dry. The other bird said: you will be destroyed and will not be able to do it. So too, Haman wanted to destroy Israel, but the Holy One protected Israel. “<i>There is a certain people</i>” [Esther, 3:8]. Haman said: Israel was a people different in their beliefs, in the Torah and with their holidays. They observe the Sabbath every seventh day, and every thirty days, a <i>New Month.</i> Afterwards, <i>Passover</i>, <i>Shavuot</i>, <i>Rosh Hashanah</i>, <i>Yom Kippur</i>, <i>Sukkot</i>, and <i>Shemini Azeret.</i> The Holy One said: you evildoer, you shout at Israel that they have many <i>holidays.</i> I will give Israel more holidays. This is <i>Purim</i>, that they will hang you. They will be very happy on <i>Purim.</i> The third banquet was that the king and Haman sat down to eat and drink and the king gave him the signet to destroy Israel. As soon as Israel became aware that the king had given the ring to Haman, Israel did a great act of repentance. They were very frightened. The Holy One redeemed them because of that repentance. All of this came from the banquet. <i>Mordecai</i> and <i>Esther</i> fasted on Passover. Therefore, it is written in the Book of Esther, “<i>fast on my behalf and do not eat</i>” [Esther, 4:16]. Fast and do not eat. <i>Ibn Shuaib</i> asks a question. Why does the verse need to say, you should not eat, when he said that they should fast? The explanation is that he said that they should fast, even on Passover and should not eat matzoh on the first night of Passover when this too was a positive commandment, to eat matzoh on the first night. It is also a positive commandment to drink <i>four cups of wine</i> on Passover. Thus, do not eat matzoh and do not drink wine. The fourth banquet was the one Esther made for <i>two consecutive days</i> for <i>Ahasuerus.</i> Haman was hanged as a result of it. <i>Rabbi Abraham</i> [ibn Ezra] asks a question. Why did Mordecai state that he ordered all the <i>Amalekites</i> to be killed? Is it not enough that Israel remained alive? The explanation is that <i>Ahasuerus</i> had said to Mordecai, be smart in this matter to protect Israel. Ahasuerus said: I have written letters through Haman to destroy Israel. This letter cannot be called back or change what the king had written once cannot be altered. Mordecai said; I must write letters on behalf of the king, about how the king had told Haman to write letters, so that the Jews should kill the Amalekites who wanted to harm the Jews on the thirteenth day of <i>Adar.</i> However, Haman did not do as the king told him. He wrote that the Amalekites should kill the Jews on the thirteenth day of <i>Adar.</i> Now, when the king learned of this, that Haman had not done as he had ordered, the king had Haman hanged. Therefore, now the king commanded that they should keep the first command to kill the Amalekites on the same day. <i>Ibn Shuaib</i> asks a question about the Talmudic passage that says that the children of Haman were all hanged at one time and their souls left them at one time. In the verse it says, “<i>In the capital Shushan, they killed</i> … <i>Parshandatha</i>” [Esther, 9:6–7]. That is to say, they killed the children of Haman with the sword. Afterwards, it is written that Esther asked the king that they should be allowed to hang Haman’s children. The explanation is that the children of Haman were first killed with the sword. However, they were still alive, so Esther asked that they should be hanged, before their soul left them. So we should also be worthy to see our enemies in the days of the <i>Messiah.</i> The story of <i>Mordecai and Esther</i> was written in this Torah portion because we read this portion every year in the week of Purim, when it is not a leap year.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Ibn Shuaib, <i>Derashot</i>, <i>Tezaveh</i>, I: 161–168.</i>

Ki Tisa

Bahya writes. <i>King Solomon</i> said: “<i>The fear of the Lord prolongs life, while the years of the wicked will be shortened</i>” [Proverbs, 10:27]. This teaches us that the Holy One always does hidden <i>miracles</i> for the person. The person does not see these miracles and does not think about them. From this we can learn that the Holy One does miracles every day, that He allows the righteous to live long and shortens the life of the wicked. It is known that fear and worry shorten the life of the person, so that he must die soon. The righteous one is always fearful that he should not transgress the word of God. Furthermore, when he has great worries and fear, yet the Holy One causes that he can live long and the worry does not harm him. This is the meaning of the verse “<i>The fear of the Lord prolongs life.</i>” It is known that the person who eats good food, he should properly live long. Therefore, the verse says, when the evildoer also eats well, yet the Holy One makes his life shorter. Even though some righteous people do not live long and similarly some evildoers live long, he may not have been completely righteous or completely evil. Or, the Holy One lets the righteous one die soon, expecting that he should have more <i>pleasures</i> in the next world. The person must know and believe this, that the Holy One always does miracles for the person that he does not see himself and does not think about them. The one, who does not believe, does not believe in the Torah and is not a Jew. Therefore, our sages said that the blessing comes only on something that is unexpected or not aimed for. However, what is expected or aimed for, no blessing comes from that. The sages have told us that the Holy One does hidden and secret miracles for everything, every day, for the person. Therefore, our sages said: when someone measures and recites a blessing, this is a <i>false prayer.</i> The <i>evil eye</i> comes on something that is counted or measured. Therefore, the Torah wrote in this portion that one should not count Israel, but through the <i>shekels.</i> Each Israelite gave a coin and afterwards the coins were counted. That way they would know how many Israelites there were, expecting that no evil eye should come on Israel through the census.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, <i>Ki Tisa</i>, Introduction.</i>
Therefore, the verse says, “<i>each shall pay the Lord a ransom for himself</i> … <i>that no plague may come upon them</i>” [30:12]. That is to say, when the Israelites would be counted separately, and they would be separated from the totality of Israel, the Holy One would see each person’s sins and deeds separately, and would kill him. However, when the person is part of the whole community, then perhaps there are many <i>mitzvot</i> and good deeds among them, and they would protect each other.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Exodus, 30:12–13.</i>
“<i>A half-shekel</i>” [30:13]. Moses made a coin out of silver for himself because he was a king in Israel. The custom of the kings was that each one made a separate coin as a memorial. It was called the <i>holy shekel</i> because weights of holiness were weighed with this coin. When someone had a firstborn son to redeem, they weighed five shekels and also other positive commandments used this coin as a weight. Therefore, it was called the <i>holy shekel</i> because it was used for positive commandments from the Torah. We call the language of the Torah the <i>holy language</i>, because it is the holy language that the Holy One spoke with the <i>prophets</i>, only in the holy language. Similarly, the names of the Holy One are only in the <i>holy language.</i> The name of the angels are also only in the <i>holy language.</i> The world was created in the <i>holy language</i> and when the Messiah will come again, the whole world and all the nations will speak the holy language, as the verse says, “<i>for then I will make the people pure of speech, so that all invoke the Lord by name</i>” [Zephaniah, 3:9]. Why did they give a coin of a half shekel? This is because Israel had worshiped the Golden Calf and transgressed ten commandments of the Holy One. Each half shekel had ten <i>gerah.</i> Therefore, each one brought ten <i>gerah</i> to atone for the ten commandments that they transgressed. Therefore, they brought a half shekel because Israel transgressed in the middle of the day, just as they made the Golden Calf for half a day.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 30:13.</i>
<i>Zeror ha-Mor</i> writes. The portion of <i>Ki Tisa</i> is written near the portion of the incense, because the incense stops the plague so that no person dies.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Zeror ha-Mor, Exodus, 30:12.</i> The plague comes into the world from the counting that the people are counted. Therefore, they are written together to show us that the Holy One wants to lead us on the right path, so that we should not be harmed. Therefore, the verse says, “<i>each shall pay the Lord a ransom for himself</i>” [30:12]. That is to say, I want to teach you so that no plague should come on Israel, since the plague comes through counting. Rather, you should give a silver coin, which will stop the plague in Israel, just like the incense. That is to say, when the Temple stood, the incense stopped the plague. However, when the <i>Temple</i> was destroyed the charity stopped the plague, as the verse says, “<i>charity saves from death</i>” [Proverbs, 10:2]. This means, charity protects from death. Our sages also say that in the portion above it is written that the Holy One forgives the transgressions once a year on <i>Yom Kippur.</i> Therefore, he writes about it in <i>Ki Tisa.</i> That is to say, You, Holy One, should bear their sins and should forgive their transgressions through the charity that is given. Therefore, the verse says here that one should give only half a <i>shekel.</i> This teaches us that the Holy One does not desire much charity, but a half shekel from poor and rich alike.
<i>Bahya</i> also writes that the person divide half for the body and half for the soul, equally for each one. That is to say, he should eat and drink with measure and not excessively, but he should be able to serve the Holy One with the body. They made silver thresholds to hold the boards of the <i>Tabernacle</i> from the shekels that Israel gave. That is, this should be atonement for the sin of the Golden Calf. Just as a <i>penitent</i> lays himself on the threshold so that others might step on him, similarly, they made thresholds from the shekels in the Tabernacle as an expiation. Israel should have regret for their sins, not to do them anymore.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 30:13.</i>
The Torah wrote about the lavers for washing the hands near the shekels. That is to say, the shekels were charity from the people; the same thing should be on the table where the hands are washed, to give food to poor people. This is the greatest charity, to honor guests at one’s table.
Another explanation for why the laver to wash the hands is written about near the shekels. That is to say, whoever does not give charity and shekels will come to <i>poverty.</i> So too, whoever does not properly wash his hands comes to <i>penury</i>, as our sages said: whoever washes his hands with much water, the Holy One gives him great blessings.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Shabbat</i>, 62b.</i>
The priests washed their hands and feet at the same time from the laver. He put his right hand on his right foot and his left hand on his left foot. He poured water on his hands and feet. There were twelve spouts in the laver so that twelve priests could wash at one time, since twelve priests went in with the sacrifice that was brought every day. The thirteenth priest slaughtered the sacrifice. He did not have to wash. That is why there were only twelve spouts and not thirteen spouts.
“<i>This shall be an anointing oil sacred to Me</i>” [30:31]. Bahya writes in the name of <i>Ramban.</i> The verse should have said that one should take the oil to anoint the priests and to smear with it in order to make holy. Why does the verse say, “<i>this should be for Me</i>” [30:31]? This means, God says that the oil should be for Me. The explanation is that they did not only anoint and smear the priests, but with it they also made holy the kings, like <i>King David</i> and other kings.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 30:31.</i>
Afterwards, the Torah said to make spices for the incense. They took eleven kinds of good spices and made a smoke from it in the Tabernacle. Among the spices they took was <i>galbanum</i>, even though it smelled very bad. This was so that the Holy One should not embarrass the evildoers, when they repent and mix among the righteous through fasting and prayer. Our sages said: in a community that repents and there are no evildoers among them, this is not called a proper community. That is to say, the Holy One is praised when the evildoers repent and let themselves be counted among the righteous Israelites. When the evildoer is not among them, to repent, then the righteous one is punished, since all of Israel is responsible for each other. Therefore, also with the commandment of the <i>lulav</i>, we also take several <i>willow branches</i>, which have no smell and are not good to eat. This represents the evildoers who have nothing good about them. They have no Torah and have no commandments fulfilled. The others all have something good about them. The <i>etrog</i> is good to eat and smells nice. The <i>myrtle</i> smells nice and dates grow on the <i>lulav.</i> Just as we take everything together, this shows that the Holy One desires repentance from the evildoer.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 30:34.</i>
“<i>See, I have singled out by name Bezalel</i>” [31:2]. The verse teaches us that there was nobody among the Israelites who was <i>appropriate</i> to work on the Tabernacle. They were like peasants in Egypt. They could only dig clay and make bricks. However, they could not work with silk and gold. Therefore, the verse praises <i>Bezalel</i> that he was very wise and could do all the skills for the Tabernacle with gold and silk and other skills. He was only twelve years old when the prophecy came to him.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 31:2.</i>
“<i>Son of Achisamach, of the tribe of Dan</i>” [31:6]. The Holy One ordered them to take <i>Oholiab</i> to work with <i>Bezalel</i> on the Tabernacle, even though <i>Oholiab</i> was from a very insignificant tribe, the <i>tribe of Dan.</i> Bezalel was from the most important tribe, the <i>tribe of Judah.</i> This teaches us that nobody should consider himself important, just because he is from an important family. He should always join an insignificant family, since before the Holy One; everyone is equal, rich or poor.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 31:6.</i>
They were ordered to make garments for the <i>high priest</i> and they were called “<i>the service vestments</i>” [31:10]. That is to say, through them Israel is protected and remain in the world. The Talmud in <i>tractate Yoma</i><sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Yoma</i>, 69a.</i> tells a story about the king, <i>Alexander of Macedon. Simeon the Righteous</i>, the high priest went to meet him and put on the garments of the Temple. When the king saw him, he stood up from his wagon and bowed down to the high priest. The servants said to the king: why are you giving this Jews such a great honor? The king responded: when I was in the war, I saw a man near me in the war, and I won the war. That is, an angel appeared to me in the war, in the same garments as the high priest used to wear.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 31:10.</i>
“<i>Nevertheless, you must keep My Sabbaths</i>” [31:13]. The verse teaches us that even though the Holy One commanded us to work on the Tabernacle, but nonetheless you should keep the Sabbath and do no work, not even for the Tabernacle. Our sages said that therefore the Torah wrote, “<i>Nevertheless, you must keep My Sabbaths</i>” [31:13]. That is to say, sometimes you should <i>desecrate the Sabbath</i>, when it is <i>life threatening.</i> Know that the Sabbath was the first commandment that was given to Israel, even before the Torah was given. The Sabbath is weighed against the whole Torah. Our sages said that Jerusalem was destroyed only because they did not properly keep the Sabbath. The sages also said that if Israel would properly observe two <i>Sabbaths</i>, then the Messiah might come soon. Our sages also said: if an Israelite worships foreign gods and if he properly observes the Sabbath afterwards, then the Holy One forgives his sins.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 31:13.</i>
“<i>You shall keep the Sabbath</i>” [31:14]. The Torah said again that one should properly observe the Sabbath. That is to say, one should keep the eve of the Sabbath, before the Sabbath begins. One should also keep the Sabbath for a little while after the end of the Sabbath. “<i>He who profanes it shall be put to death</i>” [31:14]. The verse tells us that one who does a forbidden act on the Sabbath; he should be put to death, if there were witnesses and he had been warned. However, when there are no witnesses and he does a forbidden act on the Sabbath, the Holy One will cut off his years.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 31:14.</i>
“<i>Observe the Sabbath</i>” [31:16]. To prepare everything for the Sabbath. The Holy One also blesses the person’s money in this world, for the sake of the Sabbath.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 31:16.</i>
Zeror ha-Mor writes. It is written here two times to properly observe the Sabbath. This teaches us about two Sabbaths in the year. The first is the <i>Great Sabbath</i>, that Israel went free out of Egypt. They no longer had to work in Egypt with their bodies for Pharaoh. That is to say, their bodies became free on the Great Sabbath. The other Sabbath is the <i>Sabbath of Repentance,</i> between <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> and <i>Yom Kippur.</i> The soul of the person becomes purified of its sins that he had done. That is to say, through the Great Sabbath, the body was redeemed from the exile. On the <i>Sabbath of Repentance</i>, the person’s soul was redeemed from the sins. Therefore, because Israel went free from Egypt and did not work anymore, it was proper that Israel should think about it, that the Holy One did miracles and wonders for them that they should rest and not work on the Sabbath.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Zeror ha-Mor, Exodus, 31:13–17.</i>
<i>Bahya</i> writes. The Talmud writes in [tractate] <i>Yom Tov.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Bezah</i>, 16a.</i> <i>Rabbi Simeon bar Yohai</i> said: all the commandments were given publicly and the commandment of the Sabbath was given secretly and not publicly, as the verse says, “<i>it shall be a sign for all time between me and the people of Israel</i>” [31:17]. Bahya asks a question about the Talmudic passage. How is it that the Sabbath was given secretly? The Sabbath was written in the <i>Ten Statements</i>, which were given publicly. The explanation could be that he teaches us that the Sabbath was given secretly, that is to say, about secret things.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 31:17.</i>
This is like the soul, which is secret and hidden in the body. That is to say, the Sabbath was not given for the rest of the body alone, but the soul should make one rest. This is, one should study Torah on the Sabbath. With this, one rests the soul, which desires to study and fulfill commandments. Therefore, our sages said: “<i>half of it is for God and half is for yourselves.</i>”<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Bezah</i>, 15b.</i> That is, one should eat and drink for half a day to make the body happy. One should study for half a day and fulfill commandments to make the soul happy. However, not like some people who engage idle chatter and gossip and not <i>words of Torah.</i> Our sages forbade this, to gossip about kings and nobles. Therefore, the verse says, “<i>it shall be a sign for all time between Me and the people of Israel</i>” [31:17]. That is to say, the Sabbath should only be between Me and you, to speak religious words. Therefore, the verse says, “<i>observing the Sabbath</i>” [31:16]. This means that one should repent on the Sabbath. That is to say, one should study Torah and think about the worship of the Holy One on the Sabbath. The whole week the person does not think about this because of his work or his business. Zeror ha-Mor writes in the Torah portion. “<i>Observing the Sabbath</i>” [31:16]. The Talmud said in [tractates] <i>Shabbat</i> and <i>Kiddushin.</i> When a person has even one hundred servants, yet the person must work himself on the eve of the Sabbath for the Sabbath. We find that <i>Rabbi Joseph</i> was a <i>communal leader</i> and an important rabbi and on the eve of the Sabbath he would singe a calves head, expecting that he would also work himself. <i>Raba</i> was also a communal leader and also had many servants, yet he salted the fish himself, <i>in honor of the Sabbath.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Zeror ha-Mor, Exodus, 31:13–17.</i>
“<i>When He finished speaking</i> … <i>He gave Moses</i>” [31:18]. The verse teaches us that the Holy One gave the Torah to Moses as a present, like one gives a bride a present. It was very difficult for Moses to learn the Torah in forty days, in such a short time. However, the Holy One gave Moses strength and understanding so that Moses understood the whole Torah in forty days. <i>Resh Lakish</i> said: if a person talks about the Torah and the people who hear it from him and the Torah is not sweet and tasteful for them, it is better if he had not been created. When Israel received the Torah, it was very beloved to them, like the groom loves the bride. <i>Rabbi Simeon</i> said: just as a bride is adorned with twenty-four adornments and <i>ornaments</i>, so too should a <i>scholar</i> be adorned with the twenty-four books [of the Bible].<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 31:18.</i>
<i>Zeror ha-Mor</i> writes. The verse “<i>When He finished</i>” [31:18] teaches us that Israel sinned. As soon as the forty days ended on Mount Sinai, Moses did not tarry for a moment and came down to Israel with the Torah immediately. However, the Israelites were angry and they thought up that he was tarrying long and they said falsehoods. Therefore, the Holy One punished them that they made the Golden Calf. The verse showed us this, “<i>When He finished</i>” [31:18]. That is to say, as soon as God had finished speaking with Moses about the Torah, he came down to Israel.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Zeror ha-Mor, Exodus, 31:18.</i>
“<i>Two tablets of the Covenant</i>” [31:18]. The tablets were a testament to Israel that the Shekhinah rests among Israel. The tablets were like a canopy that the king sends to the people to let them know that he is among them. Bahya asks a question. Why did the Holy One not write the <i>Ten Statements</i> on one tablet? The explanation is that the witnesses have to be two to testify. Therefore, there were also two tablets. Also, the tablets were made of stone, which is from the earth, and the writing was from heaven. That is to say, heaven and earth should both testify when Israel will not keep the Torah, as we find written in the Torah, “<i>that I may call heaven and earth to witness against them</i>” [Deuteronomy, 31:28]. Heaven and earth would testify against Israel when they would not keep the Torah. The earth would not allow its grain to grow and the heaven would not give rain. Why were the tablets made out of stone? Because the majority of commandments that one transgresses [are punished] by stoning with stones.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 31:18.</i>
“<i>When the people saw that Moses was so long</i>” [32:1]. Israel saw on the seventeenth of Tammuz that Moses had tarried on Mount Sinai. The Torah had been given on the sixth of Sivan. The mountain had been covered with clouds all six days [of <i>Sivan</i>] and after the sixth day Moses again went up on Mount Sinai. He was there for forty days and forty nights Forty days was on the seventeenth of Tammuz and Moses had said to Israel that he would stay on Mount Sinai for forty days. That is, after forty days and six hours in the day. However, the Israelites were mistaken. They counted the day that Moses went up among the forty days. Therefore, when the sixteenth of <i>Tammuz</i> came, the Israelites said that the forty days ended and Moses was not coming. However, they were not supposed to count the day that Moses went up, but the forty days began one day after his going up. Therefore, Israel said: “<i>Moses was so long</i>” [32:1]. That is to say, more than the six hours of the day have passed and Moses has not come. He must be dead. The Midrash writes that Satan brought darkness into the world on that day, and showed a bed under the heaven. That is to say, Moses had died. They made the Golden Calf on the sixteenth of Tammuz. The next morning on the seventeenth of Tammuz Israel offered sacrifices to the Golden Calf. After six hours, Moses came down from heaven, as he had said. He brought the tablets and he saw that Israel had made the Golden Calf. On the eighteenth day, Moses killed those who had made the Golden Calf and burned the Golden Calf. On the nineteenth of Tammuz Moses went up again on Mount Sinai and prayed to forgive Israel for the sin of the Golden Calf. He remained for forty days on Mount Sinai and prayed continually. The forty days ended on the <i>first day of Elul.</i> Moses went up Mount Sinai again to receive the tablets again from the Holy One. The forty days ended on <i>Yom Kippur.</i> The Holy One forgave him for the sin of the Golden Calf and he received the second tablets from the Holy One. Immediately after Yom Kippur the Israelites donated silver, gold, silk and precious stones to the Tabernacle. From here we learn that the Golden Calf occurred before the portion of <i>Ki Tisa</i>, before Israel made the Tabernacle.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 32:1.</i>
“<i>Made it into a molten calf</i>” [32:4]. Bahya writes in the name of Ramban that Aaron made the form of an ox, since the ox is in the Throne of Glory, on the left side to the north, and from the north much evil comes into the world, particularly, in the wilderness where Israel were. This is completely desolate and nothing grows there. Therefore, Aaron made the form of an ox. That is to say, the Holy One should help Israel and should cause a good wind to blow for Israel from the left side, where the ox is on the <i>Throne of Glory.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 32:4.</i>
“<i>Aaron said to them, take off the gold rings that are on the ears of your wives</i>” [32:2]. Aaron said to the Israelites: take the golden earrings that your wives have on their ears and I will make you a god who will lead you. Aaron thought to himself. The wives will not want to give their gold earrings and as a result the matter will be delayed, so that I will not have to make a foreign god. In the meantime, Moses will come down from heaven. Aaron certainly knew well that Moses would come tomorrow, but the Israelites were angry and did not want to listen to him. Aaron was afraid that they would kill him if he would not do what they wanted. Aaron saw that the Israelites came to <i>Hur.</i> He was an important person. He was Aaron’s sister’s son. They wanted from Hur that he should make them a god, and Hur did not want to do it. The Israelites killed him. Therefore, <i>Aaron</i> was afraid and did their will.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Sanhedrin</i>, 7a.</i> However, in any event, Aaron’s <i>intention</i> was for the good of God. The women were much more pious than their husbands and they did not want to give their golden rings. The men took the golden rings themselves and brought them to Aaron to make a god. Aaron tied up the gold in a cloth and threw it into the fire. The <i>magicians</i>, who had gone out of Egypt with the Israelites and had <i>converted</i>, did their <i>magic.</i> A calf emerged from the fire. Some sages say that a man named <i>Micah</i> who was drawn out of the wall in Egypt. Pharaoh had the Jewish children bricked into the walls when the Israelites did not make enough bricks for the number of bricks they were obligated to make. Moses said before the Holy One: <i>Lord of the Universe</i>, what sins have the children done that they are killed in this way? The Holy One said: these children will be complete evildoers. Test it, take one child out and bring it back to life and you will see this. Moses took a child and they named it <i>Micah.</i> This means, it was squeezed into the wall. This was a great evildoer. He took the silver <i>plate</i> on which Moses had written a <i>holy name</i> in order to bring up the <i>coffin of Joseph.</i> The Egyptians had put Joseph in an iron coffin after his death and placed it in the <i>Nile</i> river, so that Israel should go out of Egypt. Moses could not find the casket and he made a <i>plate</i> and wrote a holy name, arise you <i>ox.</i> That is to say, <i>Joseph</i> was called ox. Micah took the same plate and threw it into the fire and an ox emerged, and the Israelites considered it a god.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Exodus, 32:2–4; Bahya, Exodus, 32:4.</i>
“<i>When Aaron saw</i>” [32:5]. Aaron saw that the Calf was alive and was jumping. He could not dissuade the Israelites from worshiping it.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Exodus, 32:5.</i>
“<i>He built an altar</i>” [32:5]. Aaron built an altar. He had thought that he would delay a while with the building, so that Moses should come. He said: when the Israelites would build an altar, each person would bring a stone and the altar would be quickly built. However, I want to build the altar slowly. He was afraid that they should not kill him, as they had killed Hur. Therefore, he had to build an altar. Aaron thought: if I will allow myself to be killed, then all of Israel would be destroyed because of the sin. Therefore, it is better that I should commit as sin. The Holy One will soon forgive me the sin. Therefore, I will build it myself. Bahya also writes. Aaron said: my intention is in any event for the sake of God, but with the building I am doing a sin, the transgression of “<i>you shall not make for yourself a sculptured image</i>” [Exodus, 20:4]. One should not make a <i>statue</i> or an image.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 32:5.</i>
“<i>Aaron announced: tomorrow shall be a festival of the Lord</i>” [32:5]. That is to say, Aaron said: tomorrow we will have a holiday. Moses said: <i>Lord of the Universe</i>, have the Israelites committed another sin and are guilty to be burned? Remember <i>Abraham</i> who allowed himself to be thrown into the fire for the sake of God. Are they guilty to be killed with the sword? Remember <i>Isaac</i> who stretched out his neck to allow himself to be slaughtered for the sake of God. Are they guilty to be driven into exile? Remember <i>Jacob</i> whose children had great exiles and Jacob also often ran away from Laban and from Esau.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Exodus, 32:13.</i>
“<i>As You swore to them by Your Self</i>” [32:13]. That is to say, he said: You swore by Your name and not by heaven or earth or the <i>sea.</i> Therefore, it is not just to transgress Your oath, because You have sworn by Your name that You will eternally not allow Israel to be destroyed. Moses said: a parable, a king plants a garden of good grapevines. The king comes the first year and sees that the wine from that garden is not good. It all became vinegar, and he wanted to have it torn out. A wise gardener came and said that the first year it grows in the garden it is not very good, but the might be better the next year. So too, Moses said to God. Israel will become pious in the following year. Moses also said: You said that Israel should be like the stars in heaven and you want to give them the land of Israel. The Holy One consented and forgave their sin.
“<i>Moses turned and went down</i>” [32:15]. Moses turned to go down and he walked backwards before the Holy One to take his leave, so that Moses’ face was always toward the Holy One. We also do this when we end the <i>Amidah</i>; we walk backwards. That is to say, as if the Holy One was standing before us.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 32:15.</i>
The Midrash is cited in the <i>Yalkut.</i> When Moses was supposed to go down from heaven, evil angels began to attack him because Israel had made the Golden Calf. He was very afraid and he held on to the Throne of Glory. The Holy One protected him and spread His cloud over Moses. From here we can see how evil it is when one commits a sin. Before Israel sinned, Moses ascended to heaven and he encountered no evil. Now that Israel had sinned, Moses was afraid of five angels that he encountered. They were called, <i>anger</i>, <i>wrath</i>, <i>waves</i>, <i>destruction</i>, and <i>fury.</i> As soon as Moses mentioned the three <i>Patriarchs</i>, <i>Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob</i>, three evil angels ran away, leaving the two angels <i>anger</i> and <i>fury.</i> Moses said to the Holy One: take one of them to take him away and I will deal with one of the evil angels, as the verse says, “<i>rise, O Lord, in your anger</i>” [Psalms, 7:7]. Rise, God, by the evil angel who is called <i>anger.</i> The Holy One said to Moses: go down from heaven. Your people have done evil. Moses responded: now, when they are evil, You tell me that they are my people and when the Israelites were in Egypt, You said: I will take out My people Israel. They are My children.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Ki Tisa, <i>Remez</i>, 391.</i>
“<i>They rose to dance</i>” [32:6]. The Israelites danced and made merry. <i>Tanna debe-Eliyahu</i> writes. <i>Rabbi Akiva</i> said: merrymaking and laughter bring a person to many sins and always to sexual licentiousness. This causes laughter and mockery. “<i>Hear the word of the Lord</i>” [Jeremiah, 2:4]. You should hear the words of God who mocks you. The Holy One said to Israel: My children, I sat for nine hundred and sixty-four generations before the world was created and I studied the Torah and thought about it. From the day that the world was created I sit on My throne of Glory and for eight hours a day I study Torah, eight hours a day I <i>judge</i> the whole world, and eight hours I do charitable acts and I feed the whole world. I do not mock or laugh, except for one hour when the nations say: we want to wage war against the Holy One, as the verse says, “<i>why do nations assemble</i>” [Psalms, 2:1]. The nations assemble to wage war with God. Concerning this, it is written, “<i>He who is enthroned in heaven laughs</i>” [Psalms, 2:4]. That is to say, God sits in heaven and laughs and mocks that the nations want to wage war with Him. Another time we find that God laughs concerning the incense. One takes only good smelling spices and one takes devil’s dung along with it, which stinks. Here God laughs. God also laughs when the evildoer schemes against righteous ones, as the verse says, “<i>the wicked man schemes against the righteous</i>” [Psalms, 37:12]. The evildoer wants to do evil to the righteous one. “<i>Then God laughs at him</i>” [Psalms, 37:13]. God laughs at him. Aaron knew well that he would have great merit because he taught Torah to Israel. Aaron went to teach all of Israel. He taught the one who could not pray how to pray. Whoever could not learn, Aaron taught him Torah. It was not said that Aaron alone, but each Israelite who teaches his friend Torah or prayer or reproves him for good, the Holy One gives him a great reward that he can understand the wisdom of the Torah himself.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanna debe-Eliyahu Raba</i> [ed. M. Ish-Shalom], chap. 14.</i>
Moses was on Mount Sinai three times for forty days. The first forty days that Moses went was to receive the Torah. This was the time that Israel made the Golden Calf. The second forty days Moses prayed that God should forgive them for the sin of the Golden Calf. At this time Israel was like someone who was excommunicated. Moses had taken his tent out from among the Israelites. He did not want to be among them. The Holy One said: the paupers have been excommunicated enough; take your tent again to the Israelites. The third forty days, Moses went to receive the second tablets and Israel fasted and cried the whole forty days. For the last forty days they all fasted day and night. They went to Mount Sinai, toward Moses, and all cried together. Moses also cried with them. The Holy One had compassion and forgave them for their sins. The Holy One said that the crying should become <i>joy and happiness.</i> This day should be one to forgive your sins forever, every year. This day was like Yom Kippur, when he brought the second tablets. Moses had broken the first tablets because they had made the Golden Calf. Moses had seen the letters of the first tablets fly up from the tablets, since Israel had not been worthy to receive the Torah. Moses had thrown away the tablets and they were broken. Moses immediately became mute and could not respond. The same time there was a decree before the Holy One that Israel learn Torah only with anguish, worry, sadness, exile, wandering from city to city like a <i>penitent</i>, and through poverty, that they should not have enough food. The one who is rich cannot study Torah properly and must become weak through the study of Torah. When the Messiah will come, the same ones will again have great joy. They also have great joy in the next world. The <i>Yalkut</i> writes more in the Torah portion. Moses went down and said: <i>Lord of the Universe</i>, I want to do justice to those who worshiped the foreign gods. Moses went and burned the Golden Calf and stood in the gate before Israel and called out: whoever worshiped the Holy One should come to me. The Holy One has told me that I should kill whoever worshiped the foreign gods. Even though the Holy One had ordered to kill them, that is to say, the people should remember that the Holy One ordered this. Afterwards, Moses prayed and said: <i>Lord of the Universe</i>, only three thousand have sinned and worshiped the foreign gods with their whole heart. Because of this you want to kill six hundred thousand people? The Holy One had compassion. A parable. A king became angry with his eldest son. He took him and gave him into the hands of his <i>minister</i> that he should kill him and feed him to the dogs and wild animals. The minister went and took him to another city and allowed him to live. He told the king nothing about this. After thirty days, the king made a banquet and was happy and he saw that his oldest son was not there. He became very sad and no servant knew why the king was sad. However, the minister who had hidden the son understood that the king was sad because of his oldest son. The minister went and brought the oldest son before the king. The king became happy and took his crown and gave it to that minister. So too was Moses. He had prayed four or five times for Israel and had protected them from death. The Holy One took the crown of the Torah and gave it to Moses, as the verse says, “<i>the Israelites saw the face of Moses</i>” [34:35]. The children of Israel saw Moses’ face and they could not look at Moses because his face shone like the moon and the sun. The light shone on Moses forever, even after his death, as the verse says, “<i>his eyes were undimmed</i>” [Deuteronomy, 34:7]. That is to say, when Moses died his eyes and his face still shined. So too, every scholar who studies day and night, the Holy One gives him light in his face in the next world, as the verse says, “<i>the life of my lord will be bound up in the bundle of life in the care of the Lord</i>” [I Samuel, 25:29].<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Ki Tisa, <i>Remez</i>, 391.</i> That is to say, the soul of the righteous one is with the Holy One. The righteous one is like the Holy One in that he shines like the Holy One.
“<i>Now, let Me be</i>” [32:10]. <i>Rabbi Eliezer</i> said: if the verse had not written this, it would not be possible to say that Moses Our Teacher had grasped the Holy One and was holding the Holy One and said: I will not let You go until You will forgive the sin of the Golden Calf.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Ki Tisa, <i>Remez</i>, 392.</i>
“<i>Two tablets of the Pact, tablets inscribed on both their surfaces</i>” [32:15]. It was a great thing and a miracle with the tablets. The writing was the same on both sides, so that one could read the same thing on both sides. This is not possible when a person writes on one side; one cannot read it on the other side, since the script is backwards.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 32:15.</i>
“<i>The tablets were God</i>’<i>s work</i>” [32:16]. That is to say, they were made in honor of the Holy One. Another explanation is that they are called “<i>God</i>’<i>s work</i>” [32:16]. That is to say, the Holy One exerted Himself and rejoiced day and night, as with the Torah.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Exodus, 32:16.</i>
Bahya asks a question. Why does the verse have to say here that the tablets were very important? The Torah should have said in the Torah portion that God had given the tablets to Moses. It should have said that they were very important. The explanation is that the Torah wants to show us that even though the tablets were very important, written by the Holy One, yet Moses went and broke them because Israel worshiped the Golden Calf. Therefore, the Torah must say here that Moses broke the tablets. Bahya asks a question. What did Moses think that he broke the tablets, the holy writings of the Holy One, on his own? Even though Israel had sinned, so that they were not <i>worthy</i> to take the holy tablets, because of their great sins, Moses should not have broken the tablets. He should have given them back to the Holy One and have asked the Holy One what he should do with them. A parable. A king who sends his letter and his seal to several nobles, and the nobles do not want to accept the letter. The messenger goes and brings them back to the king. This is what Moses should have also done with the tablets. The explanation is that Israel made the Golden Calf and the letters flew out because of the great sin. It is also known that when a king gives a letter and his seal is not on that letter, then the letter is considered as nothing. Moses saw that the letters had flown out. This was like the seal of the king had been taken away. Therefore, he did not want to give them to Israel. It is known that the writing on the tablets was like the soul in relation to the body. So too was the writing in relation to the tablets. The tablets were like a body and when the soul leaves the body, then it is appropriate that the body should be buried. So too, Moses did with the tablets. He saw that the letters had flown away. That is, just like the soul has left the body. The sages said that the tablets became heavy in Moses’ hands. He could not hold them in his hands because they had become heavy. Therefore, since the tablets did not have their soul, which were the letters, just like in the soul of a living person. As long as the soul is within him, he is light and when the person dies and his soul leaves him, he is very heavy. It is written in the Torah portion “<i>bearing the two tablets</i>” [32:15]. That is to say, Moses was carrying the tablets in one hand. Afterwards, it is written that Israel made the Golden Calf. “<i>He hurled the tablets from his hands</i>” [32:19]. This means that he threw the tablets from his hands. That is to say, his two hands could not hold the tablets.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 32:15.</i>
“<i>The sound of the people in its boisterousness</i>” [32:17]. Joshua heard that the Israelites were dancing and singing before the Golden Calf with eight musical instruments, but Joshua was not with them. He was outside the gate near the mountain and was waiting for Moses. The Holy One had given him <i>manna</i> from heaven to eat.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 32:17.</i>
Joshua said to Moses: it is a great outcry, as if there is a war among the Israelites. Moses responded: This shouting is not what one shouts in the war. Those who are winning shout with joy and those who are losing shout with bitter shouts. However, here I do not hear such a shout, and they are shouting with joy and amusement. Moses became angry and immediately broke the tablets. Moses said: the Holy One said that a gentile should not eat the <i>Paschal sacrifice.</i> How much more so now that all the Israelites are <i>apostates.</i> They are worshiping the Golden Calf and how will they receive the whole Torah? Therefore, Moses broke the tablets.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Exodus, 32:18–19.</i>
Toldot Yizhak asks a question. Why did Moses not break the tablets immediately in heaven? The Holy One had said to Moses: go down, the Israelites have made the Golden Calf. The explanation is that Moses thought that perhaps the Israelites regretted it immediately. Moses came and saw that the Israelites were dancing around the Golden Calf and he immediately broke the Tablets.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Exodus, 32:19.</i>
Zeror ha-Mor writes an explanation. Moses broke the tablets when he came down and not in heaven, because he wanted to show Israel that they had important tablets made of precious stone and they did great sins. Therefore, they must lose the tablets. <i>Zeror ha-Mor</i> writes further. Moses broke the tablets because Moses said that the tablets were a testament about Israel that they had accepted the Torah. This was like a promissory note that is signed by witnesses. Now Israel had transgressed what was written in the tablets and they were all <i>guilty of death.</i> Therefore, I will break the tablets, just like there was no promissory note.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Zeror ha-Mor, Exodus, 32:19.</i>
Moses immediately took the Golden Calf and burned it to ashes, and spread the ashes over the water. Afterwards, Moses took that water and gave it to drink to the Israelites. That is to say, the foreign god should besmirch their bodies. Another explanation is that Moses tested which of them had whole-heartedly worshiped the Golden Calf, just like one tests the <i>Sotah</i>, who was suspected of adultery. She was given water in the Temple to drink. Moses had judged those who had worshiped publicly and there were witnesses present. Moses had them killed. There were some who only rejoiced and those that were guilty, their faces turned yellow and green. This was caused by the water that contained the ashes of the <i>Golden Calf</i> that had been burned.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Midrash Tanhuma</i>, Ki Tisa, 26.</i>
Some sages said: those who worshiped the Golden Calf and there were witnesses present and they had been warned, they were killed with the sword. When they were not warned, even though witnesses had been present, they could not be put to death. Instead, the Holy One sent a plague that they should die. When there were no witnesses and no warning, their face became green and yellow. Even though the Holy One could make the face of each person who had worshiped the Golden Calf yellow, but they did not know that he is green and yellow, because he had worshiped the Golden Calf. They said that it was not because of sin, but a sickness he had. Therefore, he was given the water to drink.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Yoma</i>, 66b.</i>
“<i>Moses stood up in the gate of the camp</i>” [32:26]. Moses stood there and called out, whoever wants to worship God should come to me. All the children of <i>Levi</i> gathered and came to Moses. None of the children of Levi had worshiped the <i>Golden Calf.</i> Moses had said to the sons of Levi: each of you take your swords and run among the Israelites and kill those who have worshiped the Golden Calf, even his friend or relative, even his son or father and mother. The children of Levi killed three thousand men. Moses said: you will be <i>worthy</i> that you will serve in the Temple because of this.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Exodus, 32:29.</i>
“<i>Erase me from the record</i>” [32:32]. Moses said: forgive the sin. If you do not want to forgive, then erase me from Your scroll of the Torah. The Holy One said: I will forgive the sin. However, I will make Israel pay for the sin a little at a time. No trouble comes upon Israel that is not related to the Golden Calf. That is to say, the Holy One repays Israel for the sin of the Golden Calf all the time.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Exodus, 32:34.</i>
“<i>The Lord sent a plague</i>” [32:35]. The Holy One killed some of the Israelites because of the Golden Calf, where there were witnesses, but no warning was given.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Exodus, 32:35.</i>
“<i>When the people heard this harsh word</i>” [33:4]. The Israelites heard that the Holy One wanted to destroy them and they became frightened. All of Israel cried and removed the crowns that they had received at Mount Sinai, when they had received the Torah. The Holy One had given each Israelite two crowns on their head.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Exodus, 33:4.</i>
“<i>Now, then, leave off your finery</i>” [33:5]. The Holy One said: remove your garments. That is to say, the garments that the Israelites wore at Mount Sinai. The Holy One had allowed them to sprinkle on each one’s garment from the sacrifices. These garments were like a seal of the king that one should recognize the servant of the king. So were the Israelites identified with drops of blood on their garments. That is to say, one should see that they received the Torah from the Holy One. However, now that Israel made the Golden Calf and violated the oath to observe the Torah. Thus, the Holy One said: remove these garments again. So writes Bahya in the name of <i>Rabbenu Hananel.</i> Bahya asks a question. It is written in the verse “<i>none put on his finery</i>” [33:4]. This means, they removed their garments by themselves and later the verse says that the Holy One ordered them to remove the garments. The explanation is that at first the Israelites removed, on their own, some of the garments that had been marked. However, now, when the Holy One said, remove your garments, Israel had to remove all the garments that had been marked. Our sages say that the <i>Ineffable Name</i> was on the Israelites when the Holy One gave [the Torah] from Mount Sinai, so that even the <i>Angel of Death</i> had no dominion over Israel because they had received the Torah. The verse says, “<i>incised upon the Tablets</i>” [32:16]. This means, Israel was free of the <i>Angel of Death</i> and Moses took for himself the crowns and beauty from all of Israel. Therefore, it is written nearby, “<i>Moses took the Tent</i>” [33:7]. Moses took the light from the word <i>Tent,</i> which means light, as the verse says, “<i>his lamp shone</i>” [Job, 29:3]. This also means a light.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 33:5.</i>
Moses placed his tent outside the people, a distance of two thousand cubits from the Israelite, since it was as if the Israelites had been excommunicated. Thus, whoever wanted to study Torah, he came out to Moses in his tent. Our sages learn this from here, since the verse says, “<i>whoever sought the Lord</i>” [33:7]. That is to say, he went out to meet Moses, just like he went to God. This teaches us that when a person goes to a scholar and receives him, it is as if he had received the Holy One himself. Therefore, it is written, “<i>whoever sought the Lord</i>” [33:7]. That is, whoever desires God.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 33:7.</i>
When Moses went to his tent, all of Israel stood before the doors of their tents and they stood that way until Moses came to his tent. A cloud soon came down from heaven and stood at the door and all of Israel bowed down; each one at his door toward the Shekhinah which was in the cloud at the tent.<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Exodus, 33:7.</i>
“<i>Moses took the tent</i>” [33:7]. The Talmud says in [tractate <i>Sanhedrin</i>], chapter ten. <i>Rabbi Yohanan</i> said: all of the Israelites suspected of Moses that he had slept with their wives.<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Sanhedrin</i>, 110a.</i>

<i>Tanhuma</i> writes. “<i>Whoever sought the Lord</i>” [33:7]. All the angels who wanted to leave heaven to do their service had to come to the tent and receive permission from the Holy One. The sun and moon also, when they were supposed to leave heaven to illumine, first had to come to the tent of Moses, to the Holy One, and had to ask permission if they should go to illumine the world.<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanhuma</i> (ed.

“<i>The Lord spoke to Moses face to face</i>” [33:11]. The Holy One spoke with Moses publicly before the whole world. Immediately after speaking with God, Moses went again to the gate, to the Israelites, and taught them the Torah that he had learned from the Holy One. Moses did this every day until the <i>first day of Nisan</i>, beginning on <i>Yom Kippur.</i> From the <i>first day of Nisan</i> onwards, when the Tabernacle had been erected, the Holy One no longer spoke with Moses in his tent, but He spoke with Moses in the Tabernacle. The Midrash said. The Holy One said to Moses. You are angry and I am angry at Israel. Who will bring Israel closer?<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Exodus, 33:11.</i>
“<i>See, you say to me</i>” [33:12]. Moses said to the Holy One: You told me that I should lead Israel and You did not let me know whom You want to send with me. That is to say, You told me that You want to send an angel with me. You will not go Yourself with me. I do not desire this. It would have been better for me if You came along Yourself. You, God, said to me: I will have more <i>importance</i> than other people, and let me know what kind of reward You are giving me, which have much <i>grace</i> in Your eyes. If you want to say, “<i>I will make you a great nation</i>” [Genesis, 12:2]. You want to make me a great nation and want to destroy Israel; I do not desire this, since Israel has been Your nation for a long time.<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Exodus, 33:12–13.</i>
“<i>And he said, I will go in the lead</i>” [32:14]. The Holy One said: I will go with you Myself and not an angel. Moses said: I desire this and with this is shown that You love us. Moses asked the Holy One that the Shekhinah should not rest on the gentiles. That is to say, let us be better and separate from the nations and do not appear to the nations. The Holy One fulfilled the will of Moses that the Shekhinah should not appear to the nations. If one wants to ask a question, did not the Shekhinah appear to Balaam? The explanation is that Balaam fell to the ground and could not see the Shekhinah. However, the Shekhinah does appear to an Israelite prophet and he stands and sees with his eyes.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Exodus, 33:14–17.</i>
<i>Ibn Shuaib</i> writes and asks a question. It is written, “<i>none put on his finery</i>” [33:4]. Israel themselves removed their jewelry. Why does the verse have to say, “<i>leave off your finery</i>” [33:5]? The Holy One Himself said: remove your jewelry. <i>Ibn Shuaib</i> gives an explanation. There were very beautiful garments that shined like a light. The garments were like those that the angels used to wear when they appeared in heaven to the <i>righteous</i> and the sages. The angel above in heaven has no garment since it is completely fire, but when it wants to appear to a person, it puts on a garment, like a person. The Holy One gave such garments to Israel on Mount <i>Sinai.</i> When Israel made the Golden Calf, they were ashamed to be wearing such important garments. The <i>Angel of Death</i> could not get close to Israel because they were wearing these garments. Therefore, it is written concerning the tablets, “<i>incised on the tablets</i>” [32:16]. That is to say, the Israelites were free before the Angel of Death because of the tablets that they had received. Now, when Israel made the Golden Calf, they were wearing the garments on top, but they wore them as an undergarment, like a <i>mourner</i>, as the verse says, “<i>none put on his finery</i>” [33:4]. That is to say, they did not wear their garments on top of their clothes, as they used to previously. The Holy One said to the Israelites: you must remove the garments completely from your bodies. Therefore, it says a second time, “<i>the Israelites remained stripped of the finery</i>” [33:6]. That is to say, the Israelites removed their garments, as God had ordered them. Moses took the garments. They were a sign of what the Israelites had lost because of their sins.<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">Ibn Shuaib, <i>Derashot</i>, <i>Ki Tisa</i>, I: 175–76.</i>
However, there were some <i>righteous people</i> and <i>scholars</i> over whom the <i>Angel of Death</i> had no dominion even after the worshiping of the Golden Calf, as the Talmud says in [tractate] <i>Baba Mezia</i>, <i>chapter seven.</i> Evildoers informed against <i>Rabah the son of Nahmani</i> to the king. They said that he was causing much damage to the king and halves his <i>taxes. All the Jews</i> gather before <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> and before <i>Passover</i> to hear his sermons and at that time the Jews are not found at home to give <i>taxes</i> to the king. Rabah ran away and the king had him searched for by a nobleman. This nobleman came to an inn where Rabah was. They brought a table for that nobleman and he was given to drink from two goblets. They took away the table from the nobleman and the nobleman’s face was turned around so that his face was in back near his spine. The staff of the inn came to Rabah and asked him; how can we heal the nobleman. Rabah said that they should again put the table before him and should give him a goblet to drink, and he will be healed. They did this to him and the nobleman was healed as before. The nobleman said: I know well that Rabah is here. He searched for him and found him. The nobleman said that he would allow himself to be killed before he would say where Rabah was. However, if he were to be <i>tortured</i>, he would have to tell where Rabah was. Therefore, the nobleman said: I have to lock up Rabah in a room. If I will be <i>tortured</i> because I did not find him, then I will take Rabah out of the room and will bring him to the king. The nobleman locked Rabah in a room. Rabah prayed that the wall of the room should fall down, and Rabah went out through a hole in the wall to a field, seated himself on a tree trunk and studied Torah. They were <i>debating</i> in heaven about when a <i>leprous spot</i> or a white hair appears on a person. The Holy One said that it was <i>pure.</i> All the angels in the heavenly <i>academy</i> said that he was <i>impure.</i> The whole <i>academy</i> asked, who is there that told the truth. They said: we will ask Rabah the son of Nahmani, and how he will say, so let it stand. They sent the <i>Angel of Death</i> for Rabah. However, the Angel of Death could not get near him because he was constantly studying Torah. A wind came among the trees and Rabah said that theer are certainly people looking for me. Rabah said that he would rather die than fall into the hands of the king. As he died he said the Holy One was right about what they were debating, that it was pure, since his soul left with the word, pure. A shout went out from heaven. It is good for you Rabah that your soul left with the word pure. A letter fell from heaven in the city of <i>Pumpeditha.</i> Know that Rabah has gone to the heavenly academy. Abaye and Rava and other sages wanted to find where he died, in order to bury him and eulogize him. They did not know where he lay and they saw many birds in the distance. There were in one spot, making a shade over him with their wings. The rabbis went and <i>eulogized</i> him for three days and three nights. Another letter fell from heaven. Whoever will go away and will not remain at the <i>eulogizing</i>, he should be excommunicated. They continued the <i>eulogizing</i> for seven days. Then another letter came down from heaven and said that each one should go home in peace.<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Baba Mezia</i>, 86a.</i> From this story we learn that the Torah protects from the <i>Angel of Death.</i>
The Talmud writes similarly in [tractate <i>Shabbat</i>], <i>chapter two. King David</i> was supposed to die, but the <i>Angel of Death</i> could not approach <i>King David</i> because he was constantly studying Torah. There were many trees behind his house and the <i>Angel of Death</i> went and made the trees shake. <i>King David</i> became frightened and stopped studying and wanted to see what this was. His foot slipped and his <i>soul</i> left him. However, because he was studying Torah, the <i>Angel of Death</i> could not do anything to him.<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Shabbat</i>, 30b.</i>
Even though the Holy One issues a decree, the scholars can abrogate the decree. <i>Ibn Shuaib</i> writes in this Torah portion. A story occurred to <i>Rabbi Simeon the son of Halaftah</i>, who went to the city of <i>Sepphoris</i> with several rabbis to attend a <i>circumcision.</i> When they were at the banquet, the father of the child asked the rabbis to eat and drink. He said: just as I have been worthy to give you wine at the <i>circumcision</i>; so too I should be worthy to give you wine at his <i>wedding.</i> The rabbis said: <i>amen</i>, you should be worthy to do this. When the rabbis left, they encountered the <i>Angel of Death</i> and he was very sad. The rabbis said to the <i>Angel of Death:</i> why are you sad? The Angel of Death responded: I heard it say at the banquet how the father asked God that he should be worthy to make a <i>banquet</i> and serve wine at his son’s <i>wedding</i>, and you responded <i>amen</i> to that. I have it written and <i>signed</i> in heaven that the child should come into my hands within thirty days. That is to say, I have a letter that I should kill the child. <i>Rabbi Simeon</i> said: do you have such a letter for us? Show us the letter. The <i>Angel of Death</i> responded: you study Torah and fulfill the commandments. I have no power over you. <i>Rabbi Simeon</i> again said: just as you have no power over our bodies, so too you should have no power over our words. That is to say, we said <i>amen to the blessing</i>, he should be <i>worthy</i>, and his children should live and so should it remain. The righteous person can change the decree of the Holy One. The Holy One commanded that people should only go on the earth and the angels should go in heaven. Moses came and went up to heaven and the Holy One came down on Mount Sinai. The Holy One commanded that the angels should not eat. Abraham came and commanded the angels that they should eat with him. The Holy One commanded that man must eat and Moses abrogated this. He went up to heaven and did not eat or drink for forty days. The Holy One commanded that the sea should remain whole and Moses made the sea split and made it dry. The Holy One commanded the day to remain day. Jacob came and made that the night must also be day. That is to say, he made the day longer than it used to be.<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibn Shuaib, Derashot</i>, <i>Ki Tisa</i>, I: 176–77.</i>
“<i>Let me behold Your Presence</i>” [33:18]. Moses saw that the Holy One was doing his will. Moses desired from the Holy One that He should show Himself to him. The Holy One responded: I will show you a part of Me. However, in any event, as I will tell you, so should you see. I must teach you how one should pray to Me. You should not mention, <i>Abraham, Isaac and Jacob</i>, when their merit will end, Israel will have no hope to God. Therefore, I want to teach you to pray that Israel will have a hope with it. You will be in a cave and I will appear by the rock near the cave. I will wrap Myself in a <i>prayer shawl</i>, like a <i>cantor</i>, and will show you how to pray and you will also teach Israel. Thus should they say, “<i>compassion and graciousness</i>” and “<i>The Lord, the Lord, a God compassionate and gracious, slow to anger, abounding in kindness and faithfulness</i>” [34:6]. The Holy One commanded Israel to say this in their prayers, as we say in the <i>penitential prayers.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Exodus, 33:18–19.</i>
The Holy One said to Moses. “<i>You cannot see My face</i>” [33:20]. That is to say, be warned in the cave where you will be, that you should not look at Me. No person who sees Me can remain alive. <i>Yalkut</i> writes a story that happened to <i>Andrinus Caesar</i>, who asked <i>Rabbi Joshua.</i> When you say that the Holy One created heaven and earth, why does the Holy One not appear twice a year so that the people should fear Him. <i>Rabbi Joshua</i> responded: the people cannot see Him; whoever sees Him must die. When it was midday and the sun shone brightly, Rabbi Joshua called to Caesar, look at the sun and you will see the Holy One. Caesar responded: how is it possible to look at the sun? Rabbi Joshua responded: when you cannot look at the servant of the Holy One, how do you want to look at the Holy One Himself? He is pure fire and a great light. When the Holy One will appear to the people? In the days of the Messiah, who will destroy the nations of the world, as the verse says, “<i>the Presence of the Lord will appear</i>” [Isaiah, 40:5]. Also, each person will see the Holy One when his soul leaves his body.<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Ki Tisa, <i>Remez</i>, 396.</i>
Yalkut writes. The Holy One showed Moses many treasures in heaven. Moses asked: to whom does this treasure belong? The Holy One responded: to the people who do charitable acts. Moses went further and asked: to whom does this treasure belong? The Holy One responded: to those who feed orphans. The Holy One answered about all the treasures. Then he came to a treasure and asked: to whom does this treasure belong? The Holy One responded: this treasure is for whoever in Israel has no merits. I give him a reward from this treasure and present him a reward, as the verse says in the Torah portion, “<i>grace that I grant</i>” [33:19]. I will grant it to the people for nothing.<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Ki Tisa, <i>Remez</i>, 395.</i>
“<i>Carve for yourself</i>” [34:1]. The Holy One showed Moses in his tent that he should carve <i>precious stones</i> called <i>sapphires</i> in order to write the Torah on them.<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Exodus, 34:1.</i>
Our sages say that Moses became very rich from carving out the tablets, from the <i>precious stones</i> that were chipped off when he was carving. Moses sold these pieces for much money and he became very rich. Therefore it is written, “<i>Carve for yourself</i>” [34:1]. That is, whatever will chip off from the sapphire should be yours.<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Exodus Rabbah</i>, 46.2.</i>
The Talmud says in [tractate] <i>Shabbat.</i> Why were the first tablets from heaven and the Holy One made them Himself and the second tablets were made by the hands of Moses?<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">The only source I could find for this statement is <i>Deuteronomy Rabbah,</i> 3.17.</i>
Rashi gives a parable as an explanation. A king traveled overseas and heard how his bride committed adultery among the maidservants. A <i>nobleman</i> went and tore up the ketubah. He thought, if the king will want to kill her, then I would say that she was not yet your wife. She has no ketubah from you. The king came and learned that the queen was just, but the queen’s maidservants were the one’s involved in sexual relations. The king was soon reconciled to the queen. The <i>nobleman</i> said to the king, write her a ketubah. The first one was torn. The king said: you tore the ketubah. Therefore, you write the second one and I will sign the ketubah. So too the king, the Holy One, and the maidservants were the <i>mixed multitude.</i> The <i>nobleman</i> was <i>Moses Our Teacher</i> and Israel was like the bride to the Holy One. They had a ketubah, which were the tablets that were broken by Moses when they made the Golden Calf. Therefore, the Holy One said, “<i>Carve for yourself</i>” [34:1]. You carve the tablets yourself because you broke them.<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Exodus, 34:1.</i>
“<i>No one else shall come up with you</i>” [34:3]. The Holy One said: you, Moses, come alone up Mount Sinai and let no man come with you. The first tablets were given with great noise. Therefore, an <i>evil eye</i> was given, so that they were broken. However, I want to give these tablets quietly. There should be no noise, so that they should last. Moses carved them out and went up Mount Sinai very early and he took the sapphire tablets with him. The Holy One came down in a cloud and stood before Moses. He taught Moses how to pray and told him to remember the names in his prayer.<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Exodus, 34:3–5.</i>
“<i>The Lord, the Lord, a God compassionate and gracious</i>” [34:6], should you say. That is to say, God is a compassionate God to the person before he commits a sin and is also compassionate to the person after he sins, if he repents. “<i>A compassionate God.</i>” A God who is compassionate. “<i>Slow to anger</i>” [34:6]. God does not punish the evildoer immediately. Perhaps he will repent.<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Exodus, 34:6.</i>
“<i>Moses hastened to bow low</i>” [34:8]. The Talmud writes in [tractate] Sanhedrin. Moses found that the Holy One had written, “<i>slow to anger.</i>” This means, God is slow to anger, to the righteous and to the evildoers. Moses said: let the evildoers be destroyed. Why are You so slow to anger? The Holy One responded to Moses: you will also need it. Israel had made the Golden Calf and Moses pleaded on behalf of Israel. The Holy One said to Moses: Did you not say that I should be slow to anger only to the righteous? Moses said to the Holy One: You did say that You are also slow to anger to the evildoers. Therefore, the verse says, “<i>let my Lord</i>’<i>s forbearance be as great, as You have declared</i>” [Numbers, 14:17]. That is to say, You should be compassionate toward Israel as You said. That is to say, also slow to anger toward the evildoers.<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Sanhedrin</i>, 111a-b.</i>
The <i>Jerusalem Talmud</i> writes. “<i>Forgiving iniquity</i>” [34:7]. The Holy One removes some sins from the scales and hides them, so that the merits should outweigh the sins. Rabbi Huna said in the name of Rabbi Abahu. Even though the Holy One does not forget and has a good memory, yet the Holy One makes himself as if he had forgotten some sins. Some sages say that the Holy One lifts up the scales with sins so that it goes up and outweighs the merits.<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">J. <i>Sanhedrin</i>, 17.1.</i>
“<i>Invite you, and you will eat of their sacrifices</i>” [34:15]. The Talmud writes in [tractate] Avodah Zarah. <i>Rabbi Simeon the son of Eliezer</i> said: The Israelites that are <i>outside the land of Israel</i> worship foreign gods to an extent with that the gentile makes a wedding and they eat at the banquet. This is like they had worshiped foreign gods, even if what they eat and drink is kosher. Therefore, one should be warned not to derive benefit from the banquets of gentiles.<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Avodah Zarah</i>, 8a.</i>
“<i>You shall not make molten gods for yourselves</i>” [34:17]. The Talmud says in [tractate <i>Pesahim</i>], <i>chapter ten.</i> From here we learn that when a person does not properly observe the festivals and works on them or does not honor them with food and drink, with his resources, he is like someone who worshiped a foreign god. Therefore, it is written, “<i>You shall not make molten gods for yourselves</i>” [34:17], and near it, it is written, “<i>You shall observe the feast of unleavened bread</i>” [34:18]. That is to say, one who does not properly observe the festival in that he works or buys merchandise or sells, he loves money and believes in the money like someone who believes in the idol.<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Pesahim</i>, 118a.</i>
“<i>All your males shall appear</i>” [34:23]. You should go to <i>Jerusalem on the pilgrimage festivals</i> to see the Shekhinah. Men are obligated to go to <i>Jerusalem on the pilgrimage festivals.</i> However, women, or a blind man, who has no eyes to see, are not obligated to go to Jerusalem. Bahya writes. A blind person, a woman or someone who is lame or had some other physical infirmity did not go. This was because the cloud appeared and it was clear like a polished mirror that illumines. Whoever looked at it, saw himself in it, just like in a mirror. Therefore, it is not correct that a person should approach the holy cloud who is blind or lame or a woman. Therefore, they are exempt from going to the pilgrimage festival.<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 34:23.</i>
“<i>For in accordance with the commandments</i>” [34:27]. Our sages learn from this verse that the Holy One said to Israel. The Torah that was written on Mount Sinai should not be studied by heart, but you must see the written text. You should not write down the <i>laws</i> that were taught to Moses orally. You must study these laws orally. Bahya writes that the explanation was because the Holy One did not order to write down the laws. This is the Talmud, which lays out and explains how the Torah is interpreted. Through the laws one can understand the Pentateuch. The Holy One wanted that the <i>nations of the world</i> should not understand the Torah properly, because they did not receive the Torah on Mount Sinai, but Israel did receive the Torah. Therefore, they should study these laws orally. They will understand the Torah and with this Israel will be better than the nations of the world. However, the Persian exile was very bad for Israel. Israel was separated and dispersed and they were not able to properly study the Talmud together orally. <i>Rabbi</i> [Judah the Prince] came and wrote the <i>Mishnah</i> in an abbreviated form, expecting that Israel should not forget it in the exile because of their great troubles.<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 34:27.</i>
“<i>And he was there with the Lord forty days and forty nights</i>” [34:28]. Moses was on Mount Sinai and he went up to heaven for forty days and forty nights.
Bahya writes. How did Moses know when it was day and when it was night? It is always light in heaven and never dark. How did Moses know when the forty days had ended? When the Holy One studied Talmud with him, Moses knew that it was night. Another explanation is that when the angels said, “<i>Holy</i>,” Moses knew that it was day. When the angels said, “<i>Praised be He</i>,” Moses knew that it was night. Another explanation is that when Moses saw them grinding the <i>manna</i> to feed the Israelites in the wilderness, Moses knew that it was day. When Moses saw the <i>manna</i> being lowered, Moses knew that it was night. When the sun bowed to the Holy One, Moses knew that it was day, and when the moon bowed to the Holy One, Moses knew well that it was night.<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 34:28.</i>
“<i>The skin on Moses</i>’ <i>face was radiant</i>” [34:30]. Moses came down from heaven to the Israelites and Moses’ face shined like the sun or the moon. No person could look at his face because of the light. Bahya writes. Why was Moses worthy of the light, now with the second tablets and not with the first tablets? The explanation is that with the first tablets all of Israel was at Mount Sinai and saw the <i>miracles and wonders</i> on Mount Sinai. They did not need any more signs for the tablets. However, with the second tablets, Moses went alone up to heaven to receive the Torah. Therefore, Moses had to have a sign that he had been in heaven and had received the Torah from the Holy One in heaven. Another explanation is that the Holy One did not give Moses a sign on his face with the first tablets since the Holy One knew that the first tablets would be broken. Therefore, the Holy One did not give an honor with the light on his face. However, the second tablets would remain forever, therefore the Holy One gave him the light with the second tablets.<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 34:30.</i>
The Midrash writes. From what was Moses worthy of the light? Moses was in the cave and the Holy One appeared to him. The Holy One covered Moses’ face with His hand and from this came the light that was on Moses’ face. Some sages say that it was because Moses studied with the Holy One face to face and from this his face shined. Some sages say that Moses wrote the tablets and some ink remained on the pen that Moses used to write the tablets and some of it smeared on Moses’ face and from this Moses’ face shined.<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanhuma</i>, <i>Ki Tisa</i>, 37.</i>
“<i>They shrank from coming near him</i>” [34:30]. Our sages say how very evil was the sin of the Golden Calf. Before Israel made the Golden Calf, they saw the Holy One on Mount Sinai through seven fiery walls and they were not afraid. However, now after they had made the Golden Calf, the Israelites could not even look at Moses with the light on his face, even though Moses’ light was not comparable to the light of the Holy One. Moses made a handkerchief for his face, so that the light should not shine through and should not harm the people.<sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Pesikta Rabbati</i> (ed. M. Ish Shalom), 15 (p. 69a).</i>
When he went into the Tabernacle, Moses removed the handkerchief. Similarly, when he went out again he also removed the handkerchief and told them the commandments that God had told him in the Tabernacle. However, when Moses did not tell Israel about the commandments, Moses put the handkerchief on his face.

“<i>Moses gathered</i>” [35:1]. <i>Moses</i> gathered <i>all of Israel</i> one day after <i>Yom Kippur</i>, the day he came down from Mount Sinai, from heaven. He brought the second tablets down on Yom Kippur. This was on a Thursday. Since he went up on the <i>first day of Elul</i> on a Monday, therefore, we fast on Thursday and Monday, because these days were for the forgiveness of Israel for their sins. Moses gathered all of Israel one day after Yom Kippur and he commanded them to build the Tabernacle.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanhuma</i> (ed. Buber), <i>Vayera</i>, 16.</i>
<i>Ibn Shuaib</i> writes in the Torah portion. When Moses erected the Tabernacle, he recited the <i>Psalm</i> “<i>May the favor</i>” [Psalms, 90:17], that the Shekhinah should rest in the Tabernacle. The Midrash said. <i>Rabbi Levi</i> said: the primary resting place of the <i>Shekhinah</i> is on the earth, as the verse says, “<i>they heard the sound of the Lord God moving about in the garden</i>” [Genesis, 3:8]. <i>Adam</i> came and sinned with eating the apple. The Holy One went from the earth to the first heaven above the earth. <i>Cain</i> came and killed his brother, <i>Abel.</i> The Holy One ascended to the second heaven. The <i>generation of Enosh</i> came and worshiped foreign gods. The Holy One ascended to the third heaven, to rest there. The evil people of the Flood came, and the Holy One ascended to the fourth heaven. The <i>generation of the Dispersion</i> came and built the Tower [of Babel] to heaven, and the Holy One ascended to the fifth heaven. The evil <i>Nimrod</i> came and the Holy One ascended to the sixth heaven. The Sodomites came and the Holy One ascended to the seventh heaven. However, when Abraham the righteous one came, he caused the Holy One to descend from the seventh heaven to the sixth heaven. When Isaac came, the Holy One descended to the fifth heaven. When <i>Jacob</i> came, the Holy One descended to the fourth heaven. When <i>Levi</i> came, the Holy One descended to the third heaven. When <i>Kehot</i> came, the Holy One descended to the second heaven. Then <i>Amram</i> came and caused the Holy One to descend to the lowest heaven. Then <i>Moses</i> came and caused the Holy One to come down to the earth, into the Tabernacle. Therefore, the Holy One commanded Moses that he should erect the Tabernacle for the Shekhinah to rest in it.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Ibn Shuaib, <i>Derashot</i>, <i>Vayakhel-Pekudei</i>, I: 180–181.</i>
“<i>On six days work may be done</i>” [35:2]. From here we learn that it is written, “<i>work may be done.</i>” This means, the work that a person does will be done by itself if the person properly observes the Sabbath. The Torah wrote about the Sabbath before it wrote about the Tabernacle. This teaches us that we should not work on the Sabbath, not even to build the Tabernacle. How much more so, the person should not work on the Sabbath.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Exodus, 35:2.</i>
<i>Ba</i>’<i>al ha-Turim</i> writes. The Torah wrote about the Sabbath near the light that Moses had on his face. This teaches us that the Holy One also gives light to each person on the Sabbath, that the person has a grace on his face on the Sabbath.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Ba’al ha-Turim, Exodus, 35:1.</i>
“<i>You shall kindle no fire throughout your settlements</i>” [35:3]. The <i>commentaries</i> ask why the Torah wrote that one should light no fire on the Sabbath and did not forbid other types of work that are prohibited on the Sabbath? The explanation is that most forms of work are done with fire. Therefore, as soon as the Sabbath ends and we can work, we do the Havdalah over fire. Also, when the Holy One created the world, the first creation was the light.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 35:2.</i>
Therefore, the Torah also wrote that one should not work with fire on the Sabbath. This teaches us that the women come to the synagogue on the Sabbath and talk about everything that they had cooked with fire. They do not listen to the prayers and disregard the prayers. Therefore, the Torah wrote, “<i>you shall kindle no fire</i>” near the Tabernacle. That is to say, the synagogue is like the Tabernacle. That is, the synagogue is like the Tabernacle. One should not engage in idle talk in it. Particularly on the Sabbath, all the women come to the synagogue and engage in idle talk. The Talmud says in [tractate] Kiddushin. The Holy One brought down ten measures of talk into the world. Women took nine measures and the rest of the world took one measure. One should also not talk in the synagogue. <i>Rav Huna</i> said: when the <i>Torah scroll</i> is opened to be read, one should not engage in <i>discussions</i> about <i>halakhah</i> or Rashi. In the synagogue one should not engage in any superfluous talk. <i>Menorat ha-Maor</i> writes that the <i>sages</i> said that one recognizes a person through his speech. Whoever speaks excessively is a fool. The one who speaks little is wise and is from a distinguished father and mother. The Talmud says in [tractate <i>Kiddushin</i>], <i>chapter four.</i> How does one learn if someone is of distinguished lineage? One should see when two people are arguing; the one who remains quiet is certainly of distinguished lineage. Rav said: <i>In Babylon, silence implies distinguished birth.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Kiddushin</i>, 71b.</i> Silence is noble, but saying <i>words of Torah</i> is good. Our sages similarly forbade talking; even <i>words of Torah</i>, in certain places, when the <i>Shema</i> or the <i>Amidah</i> is recited, or <i>Hallel</i> or the Torah is being read. The Talmud says in [tractate <i>Menahot</i>], <i>chapter three.</i> When someone talked during the prayers, he was told to leave the war. That is to say, they called out among the Israelites, when Israel went to war against the nations, they called out that whoever has committed many sins should go home and should not cause Israelites to fall into the hands of the enemy because of his <i>sins.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Sotah</i>, 44a-b. I did not find any references in tractate <i>Menahot.</i></i> Whoever chatted during the prayers should also leave the war, since this is a great sin. From here we should learn that even though to speak words of Torah is very good, yet the sages forbade talking in the synagogue, even words of Torah, when the <i>Amidah</i>, <i>Hallel</i> or the <i>Shema</i> are recited. However, the people are not warned about it and they speak uselessly. It is a great sin, particularly on the Sabbath, to speak unnecessary words. The Talmud says in [tractate <i>Shabbat</i>], <i>chapter fifteen</i>, that speaking on the Sabbath should not be like speaking during the week.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">J. <i>Shabbat</i>, 15. 3.</i> It is written in <i>Leviticus Rabbah.

<i>Ba</i>’<i>al ha-Turim</i> writes. “<i>You shall kindle no fire on the Sabbath day.</i>” [35:3]. The Holy One said: My fire in <i>Gehenna</i> will rest on the Sabbath. Therefore, your fire should also rest in this world. That is, you should not work on the Sabbath, even for the Tabernacle. How much more so, one should not perform ordinary work on the Sabbath.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Ba’al ha-Turim, Exodus, 35:3.</i>
<i>Toldot Yizhak</i> writes. The Torah first wrote that they should build the Tabernacle and they should give donations, to give silver and gold. The person should remember that the Sabbath points to the next world, which is purely Sabbath and one does not work on it. That is to say, the person does not spend money easily. Therefore, he should remember that this world is nothing compared to the next world. Through this, he will donate silver and gold to the Tabernacle.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Exodus, 35:2.</i>
“<i>Take from among you gifts</i>” [35:5]. The verse teaches us that the person should not say, when I will become rich, and then I will give charity and donations. Therefore, the verse says, “<i>from among you.</i>” That is to say, take from the one what you have, what God has given you.
“<i>Everyone whose heart so moves him shall bring them</i> – <i>gifts to the Lord</i>” [35:5]. <i>Toldot Yizhak</i> asks a question. Why does it have to say, “<i>shall bring them</i>”? That they should bring. He could have written more briefly, “<i>bring Me gifts</i>” [25:2]. That they should take gifts. The explanation is that when Moses went up to heaven to receive the tablets, the Holy One commanded Moses that Israel should give <i>gifts</i> of silver and gold to the <i>Tabernacle.</i> Moses said that they should appoint officials to go from house to house to take the silver and gold that each one would want to give of their own will. Moses had intended that the officials should go, but Israel made the Golden Calf. Each person brought silver and gold to the Golden Calf without officials collecting it. Moses became angry. He said: you could bring gold to the Golden Calf on your own, then you should also bring it to the Tabernacle alone, without <i>officials.</i> Just as you were enthusiastic to commit the sin, so should you be enthusiastic to fulfill the mitzvah.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Exodus, 35:5.</i>
“<i>Men and women brought</i>” [35:22]. Ramban writes that since the bulk of the gold and silver jewelry belonged to the women, which is why the verse says that the men came after the women. That is to say, the women brought gold and silver first and then the men came after them and each one brought his gold or silver rings.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban, Exodus, 35:22.</i>
Toldot Yizhak asks a question. The sages said: one does not take for charity from women, except for small things. How did they take so much gold from the women? The explanation is that the woman did not have to give her silver and gold that she brought from her father’s house. She also did not have to give away the silver that her husband had given her. Therefore, men and women went together to bring silver and gold to the Tabernacle. That is to say, the man took his wife by the hand and accompanied her to the Tabernacle. Therefore, it is written, “<i>Men and women brought</i>” [35:22]. That is to say, men and women came together.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Exodus, 35:22.</i>
From here we should learn that the women should not give charity without their husband’s knowledge. However, throwing in a penny or half penny or something similar, which is not a great amount, a woman can give this to charity. The Talmud says that a woman may give charity from her household foodstuffs to poor people and guests. The Talmud says in [tractate <i>Ta</i>’<i>anit</i>], <i>chapter three.</i> One time they needed rain and the sages sent two rabbis to <i>Abba Hilkiah</i> so that he should pray for rain. The rabbis came to his house. <i>Abba Hilkiah</i> was in the field, plowing for a <i>householder</i> who had hired him to work. The two rabbis said hello to <i>Abba Hilkiah.</i> He did not respond to them. When it was close to evening, he gathered some wood and carried the wood on one shoulder and on the other shoulder wore his garment. He walked barefoot and when he came to a body of water he put on his shoes. The rabbis asked: why did you not respond to our greeting? <i>Abba Hilkiah</i> said: he had been hired to work a whole day and he did not want to waste work time. Then they asked him: why did you remove your garment from your shoulder where you carried the wood? He answered: I borrowed the garment from a householder. Therefore, I did not want to put the wood on it, so that it should not be damaged. Why did you put your shoes on in the water? He responded: in the water, one cannot see what is lying there; a stone or a bone could stick me. Therefore, I put the shoes on, so that I should not be hurt. He went where there were thorns and he removed his garment. The rabbis asked: Why did you remove your garment? Your body will be hurt. He responded: the body will heal, if there will be a wound. However, when the garment is torn, it will be damaged. When they came close to the city, his wife came toward him in beautiful white garments with lovely adornments. The rabbis asked: why so? He said that he expected that he would think about his wife and if he would see other women in the city, he would only have thoughts about his wife. When he came to his house, his wife went in first, he followed, and the rabbis followed him. The rabbis asked him: why did you go first? He responded: I do not know you, if you are pious. I will not trust my wife with you. Therefore, I let her go ahead and I will protect her from you. That is why I placed myself between my wife and you. He went to eat bread and he did not invite the rabbis to eat. The rabbis asked him why he did not invite them to eat? He responded: he had little bread and he did not want to invite them to eat and <i>deceive</i> them. That is to say, there are many people invite to eat and their heart is not in it, because they do not have enough for themselves. However, I do not want to do this, because my heart cannot tolerate this. I do not have enough for my household. He divided the bread and he gave the older son one part and he gave the younger son two parts. The rabbis asked him: why do you give your older son one part and the younger one two parts? He responded: the older one is at home all day and eats when he wants. However, the younger one is at school all day. Therefore, I give him two parts. Then he said to his wife that the rabbis had come because of the rain. Then both of them went up on the roof and prayed. He stood in one corner and his wife stood in the other corner and they prayed. A rain cloud came over where the wife was standing. That is, her prayer was accepted more quickly than her husband’s prayer. The rabbis asked: how is it that her prayer was more accepted than your prayers? He answered: the wife is always at home and gives charity through feeding the poor. Therefore, her prayer is more accepted.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Ta</i>’<i>anit,</i> 23a-b.</i> From here we can learn that the woman should give charity and may give it without her husband, like Abba Hilkiah’s wife gave charity without his knowledge. Therefore, her prayer was accepted. If he had known of it, why was his <i>prayer</i> not accepted so quickly? From here we can also learn that even a poor person must also give charity, since <i>Abba Hilkiah</i> was also a poor person. He worked for people day and night.
The Talmud also says in [tractate <i>Ketubot</i>], <i>chapter six. Mar Ukba</i> gave charity to his poor neighbor. Every day he gave him four gulden. He placed it at the poor person’s door so that he would not know who was giving it to him. The poor person said: I will learn who is giving it to me. Once <i>Mar Ukba</i> came with his wife and placed the four gulden at the door. The poor person saw this and wanted to run after them. <i>Mar Ukba</i> and his wife ran away and came to a place where there was a kiln with fire. They hid from the poor person near the hot oven and Mar Ukba’s feet were singed. His wife said: put your feet on my feet and you won’t be harmed. That is, the fire from the kiln did not harm the wife, because she always gave charity, bread, salt and meat that were prepared for the poor. However, Mar Ukba gave money that the poor person had to exert himself to buy bread, meat or salt. Therefore, the furnace singed his feet. Why did they run from the poor person into the furnace? The explanation is that before one should embarrass a person, one should allow oneself to be burned.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Ketubot</i>, 67b.</i> From here we learn that the essential aspect of charity is that the woman gives food to the poor person in her house that is already prepared. It is just that one gives a woman charity first when she is poor, before one gives to a man. The woman is bashful to go and ask for charity. Charity protects from two deaths, from the <i>Angel of Death</i> and from Gehenna.
“<i>The whole community of the Israelites left</i>” [35:20]. Bahya writes. The verse teaches us that the Israelites were very zealous and quick to bring silver and gold to the Tabernacle. However, the women were much quicker to give their silver and gold earrings to the Tabernacle. Therefore it is written, “<i>Men and women brought</i>” [35:22]. That is to say, the men came and they found their wives already at the Tabernacle. This was very meritorious for the women. They did not want to give their gold and silver earrings for the Golden Calf.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 35:20–21.</i>
<i>Pirke de Rabbi Eliezer</i> writes. This is why the women were worthy that the Holy One gave <i>Rosh Hodesh</i> as the <i>holiday</i> of the women. The women are all obligated to observe <i>Rosh Hodesh</i> with fine clothes and not to do heavy work, more than the men. In the next world also, the Holy One will pay a good reward to the women to make them rejoice for this.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Pirke de Rabbi Eliezer</i>, chap. 44.</i>
Concerning this, King Solomon said, “<i>I found only one human being in a thousand and those I found among so many never was a woman</i>” [Ecclesiastes, 7:28]. That is to say, no woman was at the Golden Calf, who said, “<i>this is your god</i>” [32:8], that no woman wanted to give their gold earrings to the Golden Calf. However, the verse also has many other explanations. That is to say, among a thousand men there is one pious man, but among a thousand women not even one is pious. Therefore, the Talmud writes in [tractate] <i>Gittin, chapter four.</i> The daughters of <i>Rabbi Nachman</i> were stirring a boiling pot with their bare hands and did not need a cooking spoon. <i>Rabbi Ilish</i> came and said: the verse says, “<i>I found only one human being in a thousand and those I found among so many never was a woman</i>” [Ecclesiastes, 7:28]. That is to say, among a thousand women there is no good woman who is pious. How is it that with the daughters of <i>Rabbi Nachman</i> the fire can do nothing and they stir a boiling pot with their bare hands, without a cooking spoon? It happened that the daughters of Rabbi Nachman were taken captive. At the same time, Rabbi Ilish was also taken captive along with the daughters of Rabbi Nachman. Once, a Jew was sitting in prison with them who could understand the language of the birds. A raven flew by and was shouting. Rabbi Ilish asked him: what is the raven shouting? The Jew answered that Rabbi Ilish should run away from the prison. He would be able to run away successfully. Rabbi Ilish said: the raven is a liar and should not be believed. Then a dove came flying by and shouted that Rabbi Ilish should run away from the prison; he will escape successfully. Rabbi Ilish said: Israel is compared to a dove. Therefore, what it says is certainly true. The Holy One will perform a miracle to protect me from the prison. Rabbi Ilish said: I will first see if the daughters of Rabbi Nachman are still as pious as they used to me. He went very quietly to Rabbi Nachman’s daughters, so that they would not know about it and he heard what they were doing. One of them said to the other. What do we care if we stay here? We have men here like we have at home. That is to say, they were not upset that the gentiles were sleeping with them. They said, one to another, let us say to the gentiles who captured us that they should take us further away, so that our Jewish husbands should not know where we are, so that they should not redeem us. Rabbi Ilish went and wanted to run away from the prison. The same Jew who could understand the language of the birds went with him. There was a large body of water on the way and the Holy One made a miracle for Rabbi Ilish. He crossed the water and the other one could not cross. The gentiles pursued him and killed him. Rabbi Ilish escaped and came home in peace. The daughters of Rabbi Nachman came home again. They stirred the hot pots on the fire with their bare hands, using magic. <i>Rabbi Ilish</i> said: <i>King Solomon, of blessed memory</i>, told the truth that among one thousand women there is not one pious one. Therefore, every woman should be warned whenever they go among gentiles.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Gittin</i>, 45a.</i>
“<i>Everyone who would make gifts of silver</i>” [35:24]. It is written concerning the silver that they separated it to give it to the Tabernacle. However, concerning the gold, it is written, “<i>an elevated offering</i>” [35:22]. This means to lift up. That is, the one who donated gold, he lifts it high and the one who receives it also lifts it high. That is to say, he shows that he has brought a very good donation.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 35:24.</i>
“<i>And the chieftains brought lapis lazuli</i>” [35:27]. The highest chieftains of Israel brought <i>precious stones</i> that the <i>high priest</i> should make a garment from them to wear on his heart. It is known that the prince or the <i>head of the community</i> is arrogant and wants to hold himself high. Therefore, the <i>chieftains</i> brought the <i>precious stones</i> that the <i>high priest</i> wore on his heart to forgive the arrogance that the person pursues with his heart. The princes said: let all of Israel first bring silver and gold and everything. Afterwards, whatever will be missing, we will bring a sufficient quantity. However, the Israelites brought enough silver and all the other things and the <i>chieftains</i> did not have anything to bring. They had to bring the <i>precious stones</i> and therefore Scripture did not write the names if the chieftains in full in the Torah because they came last with their donation. Even though their intention was good, yet the Torah embarrassed them. From here one should learn that no person should remain behind when they want to do a mitzvah or give a donation. Each one should place himself in the front to help with the mitzvah. His reward is greater from the Holy One.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 35:27.</i>
Some sages say that the Holy One sent clouds from heaven which brought <i>precious stones</i>, since where could they have found enough precious stones if the clouds had not brought them? “<i>The chieftains</i>” [35:27] is translated as clouds. Some sages say that the precious stones fell down from heaven with the <i>manna</i> in the desert. The Israelites collected the precious stones from the <i>manna.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Yoma</i>, 75a.</i>
“<i>He had endowed him with a divine spirit</i>” [35:31]. The verse teaches us that the Holy One gave wisdom and understanding to each person who desired to work, even if he had never done that work before. The Holy One helped each person that he could do the good that he desired in all things, and even the domestic and wild animals that were at the Tabernacle, the Holy One gave them understanding.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 35:35.</i>
“<i>The people are bringing more than is needed</i>” [36:5]. The verse teaches us that the Israelites brought much silver and gold to the Tabernacle, and there was more than was needed in one day. As soon as something was brought, the <i>workmen</i> ran to Moses and said that they wanted to show that they would work <i>faithfully.</i> Moses did not desire the extra gold and silver. Therefore, he had them call out that there was enough gold and silver and they should stop bringing more.
“<i>Bezalel made the ark</i>” [37:1]. He made three <i>arks.</i> First he made an ark out of gold for the tablets. Then he made an ark out of wood inside the golden ark. Afterwards, he made another golden ark inside the wooden ark. Then he covered the wood with gold on top. That is to say, they made the wood inside the ark to show us that when a <i>scholar</i> is poor, you should hold him important in every way and also honor him with gold. Therefore, the broken tablets were also placed in the ark to show us that one should consider a poor scholar important.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 37:1.</i>
“<i>From the mirrors of the women</i>” [38:8]. The Israelite women brought their polished mirrors and gave them to the Tabernacle. Moses did not want to take them. He thought it was disgusting for the Tabernacle, since the women adorned themselves with the mirrors and it causes the person’s <i>evil inclination</i> to increase. Therefore, our sages forbade a man to look into a mirror to adorn himself. However, women are allowed to adorn themselves with a mirror. Moses did not want to take the mirrors and the Holy One said to Moses, take the mirrors. As a result of these mirrors many children were born to the Israelites in Egypt. The Israelites were working in the fields and they were very tired and they had no desire for their wives. The wives thought up something so that their husbands should desire to have sexual relations with them. Each one had a mirror and she showed her husband the mirror and said to him, I am more beautiful than you. Through this talk she aroused her husband even though he was tired and she became pregnant from her husband. Therefore, God said: take the mirrors from the women and make a hand laver for washing in the Tabernacle. The water was also given to drink to a woman who was suspected that she had slept with a strange man and there were no witnesses. The woman’s body became swollen if she had adulterous sexual relations. Therefore, the laver was made from the mirrors.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Exodus, 38:8.</i>
Bahya writes. The old women gave their mirrors, since they did not adorn themselves any more, and the evil inclination had disappeared from them. Therefore, they gave their mirrors to the Tabernacle. They prayed constantly, all the time, evening and morning. Therefore, they gave their mirrors to the Tabernacle.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 38:1.</i>
<i>Ibn Shuaib</i> writes. The goats came by themselves to the women that they should spin the hair of their bodies for the Tabernacle. The goats did not come on the Sabbath. They did not come to the women on <i>Rosh Hodesh.</i> This was a very wise thing for the goats that they knew when it was the Sabbath or <i>Rosh Hodesh</i> that they should not work. The clever women could spin directly from the goat’s bodies, while they were alive. From here we have that the women were worthy to have a <i>holiday</i>, which is Rosh Hodesh.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Ibn Shuaib, <i>Derashot</i>, <i>Vayakhel-Pekudei</i>, I: 184.</i>
Bahya writes. It is a great mitzvah to read and study about the building of the sanctuary, and how it was built. How large it was and how long, and to count its vessels. Even though the Temple was destroyed, our sages said that one who seriously studies the sacrifices and how they were brought; it is like he brought the sacrifices himself. The Holy One pays him a good reward for what he speaks with his mouth and thinks with his heart about how the sacrifices were brought. Similarly, when the person studies how the Tabernacle was built, the Holy One pays him a good reward. We will be worthy that the Holy One will again give us the <i>Temple</i> for His <i>Shekhinah</i> to rest in it. <i>Amen and so may it be His will.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 38:9.</i>

Pekudei

Bahya writes. “<i>Better a little with fear of the Lord than great wealth with confusion</i>” [Proverbs, 15:15]. King Solomon teaches us that it is better to acquire little money with the fear of God. That is to say, honestly accumulated is much better than accumulating great wealth unjustly through theft or usury. King Solomon said near this how one should acquire the honest [kosher] penny. He said: “<i>better a meal of vegetables where there is love than a fatted ox where there is hate</i>” [Proverbs, 15:17]. That is to say, the best honest penny is to be acquired where one can. Therefore, he says that it is better to eat vegetables without meat, if there is love in it. That is to say, no person hates him because he has not sworn falsely against any person, taken usury or stolen it. This much better than a person who eats fat ox meat and there is hatred with it. That is to say, he acquired much money and eats well and the people hate him because he had taken it from them or had sworn falsely or stolen it, since the worst sin is stealing. Our <i>sages</i> said that a full measure of sins is not so evil as <i>stealing.</i> The Holy One <i>signs</i> the <i>decree</i> against the people because of <i>stealing.</i> We find that the Holy One drowned the whole world with the <i>Flood</i> because of <i>stealing.</i> Though they engaged in illicit sexual relations and worshiped idols, yet the Holy One did not kill them except because of <i>stealing.</i> Bahya writes, “<i>Better a little with fear of the Lord</i>” [Proverbs, 15:15]. This means that the person should take an example from the fact that the person desires to eat vegetables without meat, if only there is love with it, with good friends or with a good wife who does not complain to her husband and there love for each other. Then the vegetables without meat are tastier than ox meat, and the enmity that goes with it.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, Pekudei, Introduction.</i>
However, in any event the person should not be despicable and stingy to rely on money, as the Talmud says in [tractate <i>Shabbat</i>], <i>chapter two.</i> Who is called wealthy? He who is satisfied with what God has given him.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Shabbat</i>, 25b.</i> It is also written so in <i>Pirke Avot.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">M. <i>Avot</i>, 4.1.</i>
The Midrash also writes. “<i>All the days of a poor man are wretched</i>” [Proverbs, 15:15].<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Proverbs, <i>Remez</i>, 953.</i> That is to say, the person who is poor, it is good for him to believe that he is always fearful that he does not have enough. He remembers that he is a <i>poor man.</i> He does not eat his bread to satiety. All of his days are painful and he is always sorrowful. “<i>But contentment is a feast without end</i>” [Proverbs, 15:15]. The one who relies on God is always happy. He eats and drinks all the time with a happy heart. The person who does not have enough money, according to his opinion, his thoughts are that he must steal from people. He always wants to increase his accounts. These are among the greatest of sins, as the Talmud says in [tractate] <i>Baba Kamma.</i> When someone steals even a penny from his friend, it is like he steals his soul.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Baba Kamma</i>, 119a.</i> Not only that, but when he owes him wages and tarries and does not pay him immediately it is like he stole his soul, as the Talmud says in [tractate] <i>Baba Mezia</i>, <i>chapter nine.</i> When someone owes his friend wages and says to him, come tomorrow, and he does this every day, it is like he stole his soul.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Baba Mezia</i>, 112a.</i> It is a much more severe sin when someone steals from his friend than when he steals from charity or the synagogue, as the Talmud says in [tractate <i>Baba Bathra</i>], <i>chapter five.</i> There are many people who steal and perform <i>mitzvot</i> with that money. They think they have done a <i>mitzvah</i> with that. However, the Talmud says in [tractate] Sukkah.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Sukkah</i>, 30a.</i> <i>Rabbi Yohanan</i> said in the name of <i>Rabbi Simeon.</i> The verse says, “<i>I hate robbery with a burnt offering</i>” [Isaiah, 61:8]. He hates the person who steals and brings a sacrifice from that money or performs a <i>mitzvah</i> with it. He cannot recite a blessing over the money that he stole, as the Talmud says in the first chapter of [tractate] <i>Sanhedrin.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Sanhedrin</i>, 6b.</i> <i>Rabbi Eliezer the son of Jacob</i> said. When someone steals a measure of grain or wheat and makes dough from it and gives hallah, how can he recite a blessing? He angers the Holy One with the blessing, as the verse says, “<i>the grasping man reviles and scorns the Lord</i>” [Psalms, 10:3]. That is to say, the one who steals and recites a blessing over it, angers the Holy One. The sin is great even for a gentile, as the Talmud says in [tractate] <i>Baba Kamma.</i> The sin is greater when one steals or robs from a gentile, than when he steals from a Jew, since it is a desecration of the Divine Name.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Baba Kamma</i>, 113b.</i>
Therefore, <i>Moses Our Teacher</i> showed in the Torah portion that nobody should suspect that he had stolen any silver or gold from the Tabernacle. Therefore, he gave an account and said, “<i>These are the records of the Tabernacle</i>” [38:21]. This is the amount of the Tabernacle.
The Midrash says “<i>Tabernacle, Tabernacle</i>” [38:21], two times. This teaches us that the Temple was destroyed twice and the Tabernacle fell into gentile hands twice.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanhuma</i>, <i>Pekudei</i>, 5.</i>
“<i>The Tabernacle of the Pact</i>” [38:21]. The Tabernacle was a testimony that the Holy One forgave the sin of the Golden Calf, because the Holy One allowed the <i>Shekhinah</i> to rest in the Tabernacle.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanhuma</i>, <i>Pekudei</i>, 6.</i>
“<i>And of the one thousand, seven hundred and seventy-five</i>” [38:28]. Bahya writes. <i>Moses Our Teacher</i> gave an account for the gold and silver. He used one thousand, seven hundred and seventy-five weight of silver. He forgot what he had done with it. Thus, a voice called out from heaven that they made the sockets for the Tabernacle from it. Therefore, do not suspect the pious man Moses, the official. He is trustworthy in all things.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 38:28.</i> From here we learn that each person should justify themselves before the people. When he is just before the Holy One, the Holy One helps each pious person that he remains <i>trustworthy.</i>
“<i>On the first day of the first month</i>” [40:2]. The Midrash writes that Moses erected the Tabernacle all three times. The first time that he was supposed to bring a sacrifice in the morning, he erected the Tabernacle and then he took it down. When they were supposed to bring the <i>afternoon</i> sacrifice, Moses again erected the Tabernacle. The third time that they were to bring the evening sacrifice, Moses again erected the Tabernacle. The Midrash says that all the wise people who worked on the Tabernacle could not erect the Tabernacle, but they brought the Tabernacle to Moses and Moses was anguished that he had not worked on the Tabernacle. The Holy One said: no person in the world will be able to erect the Tabernacle, but you Moses should help erect it somewhat. It will be erected by itself. It will appear to Israel as if you erected it yourself.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanhuma</i>, <i>Pekudei</i>, 11.</i>
Yalkut writes. Many miracles happened with the Tabernacle. There were no more than fifty cubits wide in the courtyard and six hundred thousand people stood in it and this was a great novelty. They saw that the fire came down from heaven into the courtyard and went into the <i>Tent of Meeting</i> and came out again and went on the altar and burned the sacrifices. The fire rested on the altar. When each person bowed down in the Tabernacle, there were four cubits of space between him and his friend.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, <i>Pekudei</i>, <i>Remez</i>, 420.</i>
Bahya also writes. The Holy One said: I have allowed My Shekhinah to rest among you. Your sins cause Me to take My Shekhinah away from you, but in the end, My Shekhinah will rest among you and will not depart from you. Now you see the Shekhinah through fire, but in the future, in the days of the Messiah, you will see the Holy One explicitly, as the verse says, “<i>for every eye shall behold the Lord</i>’<i>s return to Zion</i>” [Isaiah, 52:8].<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 40:38.</i>

Vayikra

“<i>The Lord called</i>” [1:1]. <i>Bahya</i> writes. “<i>The effect of humility is fear of the Lord, wealth, honor and life</i>” [Proverbs, 22:4]. King Solomon, of blessed memory, informs us in this verse that the best attribute among all attributes is that the person should be <i>humble.</i> That is to say, keep himself lowly. Since the best attribute is to be lowly, <i>Moses Our Teacher</i> was praised in the Torah with the <i>attribute of lowliness</i> and with no other attribute more than this. Even though Moses had many good attributes, yet in the Torah he is praised only that he held himself lowly, as the verse says, “<i>Moses was a very humble man</i>” [Numbers, 12:3]. That is to say, Moses held himself very lowly in relation to all people. Since Moses was a lowly person, he did not want to go into the <i>Tent of Meeting</i>, because a cloud covered it and the Shekhinah was in the Tent of Meeting. Even though the Holy One had previously told Moses, I will appear to you in the Tent of Meeting to speak with you. Yet, Moses did not come into the <i>Tent of Meeting</i> to pray or to prophesy or to offer sacrifices, until the Holy One called to Moses that he should come into the Tent of Meeting, as the verse begins, “<i>The Lord called to Moses and spoke to him from the Tent of Meeting</i>” [1:1].<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Leviticus, Introduction.</i>
<i>Rabbi Isserl</i> writes that the <i>aleph</i> of <i>Vayikra</i> [called] is written small in the <i>Torah scroll</i>, just like it had been written without an <i>aleph.</i> Thus, it is <i>vayakar</i>, which means cold. That is, Moses’ understanding was cooled and became quiet. He had previously been angry that he was not a priest. However, the Holy One spoke to Moses nicely, <i>he called</i>, like one used to speak to an angel. “<i>And one would call to the other</i>” [Isaiah, 6:3]. Moses said: even if I will not serve in the Temple on the earth, but in any event I will serve in the Temple above in heaven as an angel, because the Holy One compared me to an angel and said, “he called.” With people we find <i>vayakar</i>, as it is written concerning Balaam. “<i>God manifested Himself to Balaam</i>” [Numbers, 24:3]. That means, he appeared unexpectedly, like one encounters. <i>Yakar</i> also means impure. That is to say, to an evildoer, it is like one makes oneself <i>impure</i>, <i>heaven forbid.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Be’ure Maharai, Leviticus, 1:1.</i>
<i>Ba</i>’<i>al ha-Turim</i> writes. The Holy One told Moses to write <i>Vayikra</i> in the Torah scroll with the <i>aleph</i> as they used to talk among the <i>angels.</i> Moses thought to himself. If I will write <i>Vayikra</i> with the <i>aleph</i>, people will think that I am <i>arrogant</i> and am writing about myself. <i>Vayikra</i> with the <i>aleph</i> is a term of importance. If I were to write <i>Vayikra</i> without the <i>aleph</i>, then I would not be keeping the command of God, who told me to write it with an <i>aleph.</i> Therefore, Moses wrote it with a small <i>aleph</i>, smaller than the other <i>letters</i> of the <i>Torah scroll.</i> Thus, people would understand that it is as if no <i>aleph</i> was written because it is small. Also, the command of God was observed, that once an <i>aleph</i> was written, even though it was small.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Ba’al ha-Turim, Leviticus, 1:1.</i>
“<i>From the Tent of Meeting</i>” [1:1]. The <i>sound</i> that was in the <i>Tent of Meeting</i> was not heard outside the <i>Tent of Meeting</i>, even though the <i>voice</i> of the Holy One was very strong. However, when the Holy One wants, even the person standing nearby does not hear, as we find concerning <i>Samuel the prophet.</i> He was a servant of <i>Eli the priest.</i> The Holy One called to Samuel at night while he slept. Samuel thought that his master <i>Eli</i> had called him, and he ran to <i>Eli. Eli</i> said to him, I did not call you, and he went back to sleep. A voice came and called <i>Samuel.</i> However, he ran to <i>Eli</i>, and <i>Eli</i> responded: I did not call you, go back to sleep. <i>Eli</i> thought that the first time could have been a <i>mistake</i>, while he was asleep. He might have thought that he was being called. However, the second time when <i>Samuel</i> came to <i>Eli</i>, <i>Eli</i> thought that it must be that someone is calling him. Therefore, <i>Eli</i> remained awake in the darkness, quietly, and wanted to hear. He thought to himself that he would hear if Samuel was being called the second time. A person must be calling him. However, if <i>Samuel</i> would be called and I would not hear it, the voice would certainly be from the Holy One. When <i>Samuel</i> came the third time and said to <i>Eli</i>, somebody called me. Then <i>Eli</i> understood that it must be the voice of an <i>angel</i>, as we find concerning this hearing that the person does not hear <i>the voice</i> even if he is standing very close to him. It is the same with eyesight. God can cause one person to see the angel and his friend standing next to him does not see it. We find concerning <i>Daniel.</i> He said: I saw many angels and wonders and the men who were with me did not see. The prophecy of Moses was different from the prophecy of the other prophets in three ways. The Midrash writes. Other prophets when they were supposed to prophecy, the Holy One sent forth His voice in heaven and an angel brought that voice down to the prophet that the Holy One desired. However, the prophet did not hear the voice of the Holy One, but only through the angel. However, <i>Moses Our Teacher</i> heard the voice of the Holy One Himself. He was instead of the angel. Therefore, it is written, “<i>never again did there arise in Israel a prophet like Moses</i>” [Deuteronomy, 34:10]. That is to say, he was better with the prophecy. He responded to the Holy One immediately. However, other prophets were so frightened that they could not respond. They fell down from fright until the <i>Shekhinah</i> removed itself from these prophets. Then they could respond. The third way Moses was better than the other prophets. The other prophets saw the Holy One through many clouds and Moses saw the Holy One very close through one clear cloud.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Leviticus, 1:1.</i>
“<i>When any of you presents an offering</i>” [1:2]. Rashi writes. Why does the Torah say man [<i>adam</i>]? This teaches us that like Adam who was alone in the world at first and everything belonged to him and to nobody else, so too, the sacrifice should not be stolen, since the Holy One hates a person who brings a sacrifice through stealing or usury.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Leviticus, 1:2.</i>
“<i>Of cattle</i>” [1:2]. The Holy One commanded to bring [offerings] from cattle and not from animals from the wild. Cattle are quiet and do not kill other cattle, but wild animals kill people and other animals. The Holy One loves those who allow themselves to be hunted and are lowly. He hates hunting and killing others. Therefore, the Holy One commanded to only bring pigeons and turtle doves, which are very quiet. Among the cattle, sheep and cows are very quiet. These are appropriate for the altar. An animal that a person has slept with or has been taken for worship of a foreign god, or has killed a person, should not be brought as a sacrifice. They are despicable.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Leviticus, 1:2.</i>
“<i>If his offering is a burnt offering</i>” [1:3]. The Torah wrote about the <i>burnt offering</i> first because this sacrifice was brought for the sins that the person had in mind to do. Therefore, it is also proper to write about it first in the Torah, since the thought is the first thing in every sin. Therefore, the burnt offering is an ox, which is the sacrifice of a wealthy person. The wealthy person is always haughty thoughts and sins with his thoughts. Afterwards, it is written, a sheep for a sacrifice. This is the sacrifice of a middling person who is not arrogant; a sheep is enough. Afterwards, there was a sacrifice of a bird. This is the sacrifice of a poor person who holds himself very lowly in his thoughts. A bird, a turtledove, is enough.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Leviticus, 1:3.</i>
“<i>He will slaughter</i>” [1:5]. Since it is written, “<i>He will slaughter</i>” and it is not written, <i>they will slaughter</i>, this would have meant that the priest and his descendants are the ones who should slaughter. However, a <i>Levite</i> or an Israelite should not slaughter. Therefore it is written, “<i>He will slaughter</i>” whoever wants to, even a Levite or an Israelite who is not a priest. Similarly, a Levite or an Israelite may skin the animal to be offered as a sacrifice.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Leviticus, 1:5.</i>
“<i>The sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire on the altar</i>” [1:7]. The Talmud says in [tractate] <i>Yoma</i><sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Yoma</i>, 53a.</i> that <i>Nadav and Avihu</i> died because they gave a <i>halakhic ruling</i> in front of their <i>teacher</i>, <i>Moses.</i> They said that when the fire comes down from heaven on the altar, then one should also bring an ordinary fire from a person on the altar. <i>Rabbenu Saadia</i> writes how <i>Nadav and Avihu</i> did not understand the meaning of “<i>they shall put.</i>” They thought that it meant that they should put a fire that comes from heaven on the <i>altar.</i> The priests should light and prepare it with wood that it should burn properly. From here we should learn that each person should be warned to carefully listen in order to understand the teachings of his teacher. If <i>Nadav and Avihu</i> would have asked Moses, their teacher, what “<i>they shall put</i>” meant, they would have remained alive. A person should not be arrogant that he should hold himself high not to ask his teacher who is in his city, even if he is competent to study on his own.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Leviticus, 1:7.</i>
Bahya writes that the Holy One commanded to bring the <i>sacrifices</i> because the person is compared to an angel without sins. When he has committed sins, the Holy One made that he should have atonement so he can be like the angel. Therefore, the person should think about his sins that he committed with his body and with his soul. The person commits sins with three things, deeds, speech, and thought. Therefore, the person must bring a sacrifice and must place his hands on that sacrifice before it is slaughtered. The hands did the deeds with the sins. Therefore, he should lay his hands and show with the sacrifice forgiveness for his deeds, since one can do no deed without his hands. Afterwards, the person should confess with speech. Afterwards, he must burn the kidneys and other organs that bring the thoughts and ideas to the person and relate to the evil thoughts that he had. Afterwards, the blood of the sacrifice is sprinkled. This is in place of the person’s blood that he rightfully should have shed because he had committed the sin. Afterwards, when he has done all of this, the person should think that he is guilty of the four [judicial] forms of death, <i>stoning, burning, beheading, and strangulation.</i> Therefore, he should look at the sacrifice when it is being slaughtered. It is thrown on the ground forcefully, as if one was stoning it. That is, when they used to stone a person, they would put him on a wall and threw him down. Afterwards, all of Israel would throw stones on that person. Therefore, the person should stand near the sacrifice when it was thrown down to be slaughtered. He should think, so they should have done to me, to throw me from a wall because of my sin. Afterwards, he should think and see how they grab the throat, as if they were strangling it. This is related to the person who is guilty of <i>strangulation</i>, which means strangling at the throat. When they slaughter, this is <i>beheading</i>, cutting the throat. Afterwards, when they burn the organs of the animal, this is related to <i>burning.</i> That is to say, the person should think about how he was guilty of the four <i>deaths</i> and he has <i>regret</i> for the sins.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Leviticus, 1:9.</i>
“<i>From the turtledoves or pigeons</i>” [1:14]. The Holy One commanded to offer pigeons and turtledoves because they have relations with one female and if their wife, the female, dies, they never again have relations with another female. They remain without a female. So too are Israel; they relate to no other god, but only with the Holy One alone. Why did the Holy One not order roosters to be brought as sacrifices? The explanation is because they have relations with many others. There is no greater fornicator than the rooster.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Leviticus, 1:14.</i>
“<i>He shall remove its crop</i>” [1:16]. They threw away the crop of the birds that were sacrificed, because the birds fly into all barns and eat grain through theft. Therefore, the Holy One does not want to have organs on the altar that the birds used to steal. This is the crop and it did not help to wash it, but they threw it away on the ash heap. However, an animal that eats from its master but not through theft. Therefore, they do not throw anything away from the animal. From here we should learn how the Holy One hates stealing, even from a bird that has no understanding. The Torah forbade bringing it on the altar. Therefore, the person should be warned about stealing or usury, that he should not be excluded from the <i>Garden of Eden</i> where other righteous people are found, and cannot come to the <i>Throne of Glory</i> from which his soul was taken.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Leviticus, 1:16.</i>
“<i>No leaven or honey may be turned into smoke</i>” [2:11]. Bahya writes that one should not bring <i>leavened</i> dough products and honey as a sacrifice because the custom among the gentiles was that they brought honey and leavened products with all of their sacrifices.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Leviticus, 2:11.</i>
Therefore the Torah commands, “<i>you shall season them with salt</i>” [2:13]. They took salt with every sacrifice. It is not proper that food should be without salt. <i>Ramban</i> writes,<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">This is a mistake on the part of the author. Bahya cites “Rabbi Moses” which he assumes is Rabbi Moses ben Nachman. However, Chavel in his edition of Bahya’s commentary shows that this is a reference to Rabbi Moses Maimonides.</i> because the gentiles did not use any salt with their sacrifices, therefore the Holy One commanded that salt be brought with each sacrifice. The Midrash says that one brings salt because the waters on the earth are called <i>crying waters.</i> They cried and were anguished because the water was above in heaven. The Holy One then divided and put half on the earth and half remained in heaven. The lower waters began to cry and said: why should we be far from the Holy One, our creator. The waters wanted to forcibly go up again. They broke many walls in order to go up. The Holy One shouted at the waters that they must remain on the earth. The Holy One said: because you did this for My honor, the upper waters should not sing songs of praise until the lower waters on the earth first begin to sing songs of praise and they must ask permission from the lower waters. Another explanation that the Midrash gives is that the world is divided into three parts. One third of the world is wilderness, a third is the earth where people live and the third part is the sea. The sea came before the Holy One and said: <i>Lord of the Universe</i>, in one part of the world You gave the Torah on Mount Sinai, in the wilderness. In the other part of the world You had the <i>Temple</i> built, in which the sacrifices are brought and they pray. However, in the sea there is no Torah and no prayer. The Holy One responded: no sacrifice should be brought without salt, which comes from the water of the earth. The waters became quiet.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Leviticus, 2:13.</i>
“<i>When a person sins</i>” [4:2]. Bahya writes that the body with the soul is called a <i>person</i>, since they both sin together. The body does not exist without the soul. Bahya cites the Midrash, “<i>When a person unwittingly sins</i>” [4:2]. There were two false prophets. One of them was called <i>Ahab the son of Kulia</i> and the other was called, <i>Zedekiah the son of Masiah.</i> They committed great sins in <i>Jerusalem</i> and when Jerusalem was destroyed, these prophets were expelled to the land of <i>Babylon</i>, and in <i>Babylon</i> they engaged in many illicit sexual relations. <i>Ahab</i> went to an important minister and said: I am a prophet. God has sent me to tell your wife something. The minister said, go to her. He went to his wife and said: God has ordered you to sleep with Zedekiah the prophet. You will have children who will all be prophets. Zedekiah came and had illicit relations with her. Zedekiah did the same thing. He went and convinced important wives that they should sleep with Ahab, and he engaged in illicit relations with many important <i>noblewomen.</i> The two prophets developed a great reputation in <i>Babylon.</i> When a woman was pregnant, they told what kind of child she would have, a son or a daughter. The prophet said to the woman, you will have a son and went to the neighbor who lived near that woman and said that the woman would have a daughter. Afterwards, when the woman had a son, the woman said that the prophet had told the truth. If she had a daughter, the neighbor’s wife came and said that the prophet had told us that you would have a daughter. Thus, the prophet was right, but he did not want to trouble you by telling you that you would have a daughter. <i>In the end</i>, Zedekiah came to the wife of <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i> and said: the Holy One sent me to you, so that you will sleep with <i>Ahab</i> and you will have children who will be prophets. The queen said: I want to first ask <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i> the king, and she told him the news. <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i> immediately sent for Zedekiah and for Ahab. They came and they said: the Holy One wants to establish prophets through your wife. The king responded: I have known for a long time that your God hates whoever engages in illicit sexual relations. Twenty-four thousand Israelites were killed in one hour in the <i>wilderness</i> because of the illicit relations that <i>Zimri</i> engaged in with the <i>Midianite woman.</i> Now you tell me that your God wants illicit relations? I do not know if you are <i>false prophets</i> or <i>true prophets.</i> I tested <i>Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah.</i> I had a kiln heated up for seven whole days and they went out alive. For you I will heat the kiln for only one day. If you will emerge alive, then I will do, as you will tell me. They said to Nebuchadnezzar: they were three <i>righteous people</i> together. Therefore, they came out alive. However, we are only two prophets. The Holy One does a miracle through three <i>righteous people. Nebuchadnezzar</i> said: There is another righteous person here in the city. He is called <i>Joshua the son of Yehozadak the high priest.</i> Thus, you will also be three together. They thought that would be protected by the <i>merit of Joshua.</i> They were all thrown into the kiln. They were burned and Joshua went out alive.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Leviticus, 4:2.</i>
“<i>If the anointed priest</i>” [4:3]. The Torah first wrote about the sacrifice when a high priest commits a sin and brings a sacrifice. He is the best and most important person in Israel and because he brings a sacrifice for his sin and the Holy One accepts his sacrifice and forgives his sins, how much more so will Israel remember that the Holy One forgives our sins when we bring sacrifices. The high priest is very important and had committed sins. It would be just that the Holy One should not accept his sacrifice, yet the Holy One does accept the sacrifice. How much more so, the Holy One will accept the sacrifice of we ordinary people. When the person is important, the Holy One punishes him more greatly for his sins, even for his small sins. “<i>So that blame falls on the people</i>” [4:3]. The sin that the person is accustomed to do all the time, yet he should not be ashamed, but should desire repentance for it from the Holy One. The Holy One will forgive him, even for the sins to which he is accustomed. <sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Leviticus, 4:3.</i>
“<i>In case it is a chieftain who incurs guilt</i>” [4:22]. The Torah wrote concerning a chieftain, “<i>who will.</i>” This means that he will certainly commit a sin, since the chieftain is important and his heart is haughty, so he will quickly come to commit sins. Concerning the high priest it is written, “<i>if he will sin.</i>” The high priest is warned and he does not commit sins quickly. Similarly, concerning the <i>Sanhedrin</i> it is not written, “<i>if he will sin.</i>” This means, if they will commit sins, they will not quickly commit sins, since the Shekhinah rests on them. Therefore, they are pious. The Midrash writes, “<i>In case it is a chieftain who incurs guilt.</i>” Happy is the generation where the chieftain, the important person, desires to repent for his sins that he did not willingly do. How much more so will he repent for the sins that he willingly did. Our sages say, when a community commits sins, the Holy One punishes the chieftain, the head of the community, who did not warn them.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Leviticus, 4:22.</i>
“<i>If a person incurs guilt, when he heard a public imprecation</i>” [5:1]. The Midrash writes. The Holy One created heaven and earth, the angels and people, everything that was on the earth. The Holy One created this with half a <i>name</i>, which is called <i>YH.</i> Why did the Holy One not create them with a whole name, expecting not to mention the whole <i>name?</i> From here we should learn how the evildoers always mention the name of the Holy One in vain. Our sages say that a person should not swear often, even about the truth. A story happened in the land, <i>Mountain of the King.</i> It contained two thousand cities that were destroyed because of <i>true oaths.</i> That is to say, even when he had sworn truthfully. When someone swore that he wanted to go to <i>Babylon</i> and he went and fulfilled his oath, yet the two thousand cities were destroyed because they always mentioned the [divine] name needlessly. How much more so when a person swears falsely, does the Holy One punish him? The Holy One will punish those who swear falsely along with the people, who engage in sorcery and engage in illicit sexual relations, as the verse says, “<i>I will step forward to contend against you, and I will act as a relentless accuser against those who have no fear of Me; who practice sorcery, who commit adultery, who swear falsely</i>” [Malachi, 3:5].<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanhuma</i>, <i>Vayikra</i>, 7.

“<i>Able to testify</i>” [5:1]. When a person has testimony about his friend and he does not want to testify, the sin is very great when he is called to the <i>court</i> to testify. However, without a <i>court</i>, the sin is not so great. Bahya writes. “<i>Able to testify.</i>” That is to say, the Holy One is called “<i>He.</i>” He is a <i>witness</i> who has testimony and does not want to testify; the Holy One will punish him. The Torah wrote the word <i>lo</i> [not] with an extra <i>vav.</i> It teaches us that he who does not want to testify is like someone who has denied the Holy One who created the world in six days, since the numerical value of <i>vav</i> is six.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Leviticus, 5:1.</i>
“<i>For the sin of which he is guilty</i>” [5:6]. Our sages learn from here. When a person committed a sin and prepared to bring a sheep as a sacrifice and in the meantime became poor, so that he could not afford to bring a sheep, he is allowed to bring a turtledove, like a poor person. If he became completely impoverished, and cannot even afford to bring a turtledove, he should bring a tenth of a measure of flour and the Holy One will forgive him for his sins. Similarly, if he had separated a tenth measure of flour and in the meantime he became rich, he must bring a sheep as a sacrifice.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Leviticus, 5:6.</i>
“<i>When a person commits a trespass, being unwittingly remiss about any of the Lord</i>’<i>s sacred things</i>” [5:15]. Bahya writes. The Torah first wrote concerning the one who had some benefit from the sacred things. It is first written, <i>meilah</i>, which means embezzling from the Temple and afterwards it is written, <i>sinned.</i> When a person takes some money from his friend, it is written <i>sinned</i> and afterwards, <i>meilah</i>, which means embezzling. The explanation is, when a person has benefit from sacred things, that he takes something from it, the Holy One accounts the sin as if he did not do it willingly. In truth, he did it <i>willingly</i> and deliberately, and God is compassionate and makes the sin an accidental one, unwillingly, as if he did it <i>unwillingly.</i> Therefore, <i>sinned</i> is written afterwards, concerning sacred things, which means <i>unwillingly.</i> When a person steals something from his friend, <i>sinned</i> is written first and afterwards, <i>meilah</i>, which means embezzling from the sacred. That is to say, intentionally and willingly, since the Holy One is quicker to forgive the stealing that the person does from the sacred than He forgives the stealing that he does from his friend.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Leviticus, 5:15.</i>
“<i>Restore that which he got through robbery or fraud</i>” [5:23]. Bahya asks a question. Why did it have to say, “<i>that he stole</i>,” that he should return the robbery that he had stolen, but it says he should return that which he stole? The explanation is that this teaches us that he must return what he stole. However, if he wants to return money, he should not do this. The Talmud says in [tractate] <i>Baba Kama.</i> If a person has stolen a beam and had built it into his house, he is obligated to tear down the whole house and take out the beam in order to return it. However, he cannot pay money for the beam; that does not help. However, the <i>House of Hillel</i> says that they made a regulation that one should accept money for the beam, expecting that the person would quickly repent. He should not say, I will gladly return the beam, but it is difficult to tear down the whole house. Therefore, one should accept money for the beam. It is known that there are two types of sins. One is that the person commits sins against the Holy One; he does this to his own soul. The other one are the sins that he does to his friend. He denigrates or assaults him. He only <i>sins</i> against a person. However, the one who steals, also sins against God. Therefore, the sin is more severe than all the other sins in the world. The Flood was caused for no other reason than stealing. <i>Ezekiel</i> had punished Israel for their sins. He said: you have spilled blood and have shamed My holiness, and have engaged in <i>slander</i> and taken <i>usury.</i> You have forgotten Me and at the very end says, you have stolen. Therefore, I want to kill you. Here it is heard that God kills and punishes the person because of stealing.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Leviticus, 5:23.</i>
“<i>He shall bring his penalty to the Lord</i>” [5:25]. The person, when he has returned the stolen object, still has to bring a sacrifice afterwards. The sin is very great and concerning this, <i>Job</i> punished his wise men. “<i>If there is iniquity with you, remove it, and do not let injustice reside in your tent</i>” [Job, 11:14]. That is to say, if you have something stolen in your hand, publicly give it back immediately. Also, if you have a stolen object hidden in your house, also give it back. “<i>Then, you will hold your head high</i>” [Job, 11:15]. That is to say, you will be able to freely hold up your head in front of all the people, when you will return the stolen objects to each one of them. Concerning this, <i>David</i> also said in his prayer, “<i>against You alone have I sinned</i>” [Psalms, 51:6]. That is to say, he said: I have sinned against You alone and not to any person. That is to say, I have not stolen from anyone. Therefore, he was worthy to come to the <i>World to Come</i>, and we should also be worthy, <i>amen.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Leviticus, 5:24.</i>

Tzav

“<i>Command Aaron</i>” [6:2]. <i>King Solomon, of blessed memory</i>, said. “<i>Visit your neighbor</i>’<i>s house sparingly, lest he have his surfeit of you and loathe you</i>” [Proverbs, 25:17]. The verse teaches us that the person should be careful to have friends and engage with them all the time. He should go to their homes sometimes, but should not go to their homes too often, even though the engagement with the friend is very good. It makes great peace between them. It is known that the one who can have good friends, that he can gather them to himself, he must have two good attributes. One is that he must be humble and not arrogant. When he is haughty, then all the people will separate themselves from him and hate him. The second one is that he should not be afraid of any person. However, in any event it is good to have many good friends. <i>King Solomon</i> also warns the people that they should not always go to their friend’s house, since it will become repulsive because he goes to his house often. Just like honey is sweet, but when one eats too much, then it is unhealthy. Too much of the good things of the world is not good. Even the rain which is the life of the world; the whole world depends on the rain. When there is too much rain, it is very bad and it does much damage, as the verse says, “<i>your neighbor</i>’<i>s house.</i>” That is to say, do not go too often to the house of your best and most beloved friend. How much more so, a middling friend, you should not go to your friend’s house when he is eating, drinking, sleeping, or when he is working or engaged in business. The Midrash says, “<i>visit sparingly.</i>” Do not go too often to the <i>Temple.</i> Here one asks a question. It is written, “<i>I enter Your house with burnt offerings</i>” [Psalms, 66:13]. This means, I will come to the <i>Temple</i> often with sacrifices. The explanation is that you should not commit sins, that you will bring sacrifices for them. The Holy One does not desire your sins and also not your sacrifices. When it is written that one should come often to the Temple, this means that when a person committed sins with his thoughts, since a person cannot completely protect himself from sins that come unexpectedly. Therefore, he should come often with a <i>burnt offering</i> that applies to the thoughts of the person. However, the <i>sin offering</i> or <i>guilt offering</i> which come because of sins that the person does through deeds; he steals or engages in illicit sexual relations. God does not desire these sacrifices. It is known that thoughts occur primarily at night. Therefore, the Torah wrote in this portion.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, <i>Tsav</i>, Introduction.</i>
Therefore the Torah wrote in the portion, “<i>Command Aaron and his sons thus, this is the burnt offering</i> … <i>upon the altar all night</i>” [6:2], to bring the burnt offering for the thoughts, which the person had at night, to bring a sacrifice for it at night. It is known that the burnt offering is more important than all the other sacrifices. They did not even give the priest from the sacrifice to eat, even though he did eat from the other sacrifices. However, no person ate from the <i>burnt offering</i>, but it was completely burnt on the altar. Since it was because of the thoughts, thus it was just that no body should have any benefit from the <i>burnt offering.</i> The person should hold himself humble to serve the Holy One, whether it is in prayer or with other commandments. He should lay aside his honor, but only for the honor of the Holy One, when he becomes humble through this. When the priest removed the ashes from the altar, he had to don his best clothes that he wore when he did other important tasks in the Temple. This teaches us that when a person prays or performs some other commandments, he should put on good clothes and keep himself clean. Though the ashes were an ordinary task, yet they had to don the garments. Our sages said: the one who gives great honor to the Holy One, he will also have great honor. However, the one who wants to hold the honor of the Holy One small, <i>heaven forbid</i>, he will be greatly punished by the Holy One. We find a story of someone called <i>Issachar high priest from Barkai</i> who honored himself greatly and held the honor of the Holy One small. What did he do? He did the service in the Temple. He put on silk gloves. This was not proper. He should have done the service with his bare hands. The Holy One punished him. It once happened that the king and the queen argued. The king said that a kid was better than any other animal for a sacrifice. The queen said that a sheep was better for a sacrifice. They both said: who can prove which one is better? They said: the high priest will know this. He brings sacrifices every day. They sent for Issachar. He came and he was waving with his hands and showed himself as one who held the king as nothing and said: if a kid is good as a sacrifice, why do we not bring a kid every day as a sacrifice, morning and evening, but one brings a sheep every day. The king said: because he protects and waves his hands before the king, thus he holds the king as nothing. It is just when one comes before a king or minister that one should not wave his hands. One should stand in awe before them. Thus, the king commanded that Issachar’s right hand should be chopped off. Issachar gave a bribe that his left hand should be chopped off. When the king learned of this, he commanded that they should also chop off the right hand. From here one should be warned that whoever wants to fulfill a divine commandment should serve the Holy One honestly. <i>Rabbi Joseph</i> said: praised be God that He paid Issachar for his sins in this world and not in the <i>world to come.</i> The third thing we learn from the <i>burnt offering.</i> There was a great miracle that the altar was made of wood and only covered with copper the thickness of a golden gulden. The fire always burned on it and the copper was not burned, so too, the wood on the altar. Therefore, the verse says here two times, “<i>not to go out</i>” [6:5], that the fire burned forever. That is to say, to show the miracle that the altar was not burned. The fourth thing we learn from the burnt offering is that God will punish the evildoers in Gehenna. Therefore, the verse says here the third time, “<i>the fire on the altar is kept going on it</i>” [6:2]. The fire burns constantly. It is known that the altar is for the forgiveness of sins, and the evildoers will not have expiation for their sins. Therefore, they are burned in Gehenna, because they did not desire expiation from the fire of the altar. “<i>It is the burnt offering</i>” [6:2]. The one who holds himself haughty and is arrogant is burned in fire, like the <i>generation of the Flood.</i> They held themselves haughty and therefore they were destroyed. The people of Sodom held themselves haughty. Therefore, they were burned in the fire; similarly with Pharaoh and <i>Sannecherib.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Leviticus, 6:2–3.</i>
“<i>Command Aaron and his sons</i>” [6:2]. The Torah here wrote Aaron first and then his children. In <i>Vayikra</i> [the previous portion], the children of Aaron are written first and then Aaron. Many times, Aaron is not even mentioned in <i>Vayikra.</i> The explanation is that Aaron did not appear at the sacrifices because he had made the Golden Calf. Moses said to the Holy One: <i>Lord of the Universe</i>, you love the children and the father should not be loved before you? Therefore, the Torah began here, “<i>Command Aaron and his sons</i>” [6:2]. <i>Aaron</i> was mentioned first, and then his sons. “<i>This is the ritual of the burnt offering, it</i>” [6:2]. This teaches us that the soul of the person comes very high in heaven because of the merit of the Torah, which is called “<i>it</i>,” as the verse says, “<i>it is a tree of life to those who grasp it</i>” [Proverbs, 3:18]. “<i>Where it is burned</i>” [6:2]. This teaches us that the soul goes higher than all the <i>spheres</i> and <i>angels.</i> Concerning this, our sages said that the righteous are higher than the <i>angels.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Leviticus, 6:3.</i> That is to say, through the Torah they come higher than the <i>angels.</i>
“<i>Every meal offering of a priest</i>” [6:16]. Our sages learn from here that only a man can be a priest, but not a woman, born of priests. As our sages say, “<i>sons of Aaron</i>,” but not daughters of Aaron. There is a great distinction between the men and women of the priests. Since women brought death into the world, therefore, the wives of the priests should not eat several sacrifices, but the men may eat them. Similarly, a male priest cannot marry a <i>divorcee</i>, but a woman of the priests may marry a man who has been divorced.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Leviticus, 6:16.</i>
“<i>The sin offering shall be slaughtered at the spot where the burnt offering is slaughtered</i>” [6:18]. The verse teaches us that we should not embarrass any person, since it is known that the <i>burnt offering</i> covers the sins that a person does with his thoughts that it is not possible to guard against. Therefore, the disgrace is not great when he brings a burnt offering because he did not commit the sin with his thoughts gladly. However, the <i>sin offering</i> is brought for those sins that the person does with deeds. Thus, the sin is disgraceful. Yet the Holy One commanded that the <i>burnt offering</i> and the <i>sin offering</i> should be slaughtered in one place in the Temple, expecting that one should not know which is the burnt offering. This was because of sins that the person did with his thoughts. The sin offering was because of sins that the person did through deeds. With this, the person is not shamed, that one does not know which is burnt offering or guilt offering, because both were slaughtered next to each other.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Leviticus, 6:18.</i>
“<i>The priest who offers it as a sin offering</i>” [6:19]. The priest, who is pure, without ritual impurity, may eat of the sin offering. However, a priest who is impure should not eat of it.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Leviticus, 6:19.</i>
“<i>If any of its blood is spattered</i>” [6:20]. If any of the blood of the offering should splatter on a garment, they should wash out the blood in the courtyard of the sanctuary. If the sin offering were boiled in an earthen vessel, they would have to break that vessel in the Sanctuary. A miracle always occurred that the earth swallowed up the shards of the vessel. The <i>Temple</i> was full of shards and they should not have been swallowed up.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Yoma</i>, 21a.</i> If it was boiled in a copper vessel, the vessel had to be well scoured and thoroughly rinsed.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus, 6:20–21.</i>
“<i>When he commanded that the Israelites present their offerings</i>” [7:38]. Bahya asks a question. The verse shows that the Holy One commanded to bring sacrifices. Why did the prophet say that God said, I did not command your ancestors to bring sacrifices? The explanation is, that it is certain that God commanded sacrifices, since the person is not possible without sins. Even the most righteous person must commit sins. Therefore, the Holy One did an act of kindness with the person and forgives his sins through sacrifices, so that the person should not be destroyed because of sins. That which the prophet says, God did not command bringing sacrifices, he means, to bring a sacrifice and not to listen to the words that God commanded. The Holy One does not desire this type of sacrifice. Concerning this, <i>King David</i> said, “<i>You do not desire sacrifice and meal offering</i>” [Psalms, 40:7]. That is to say, God does not desire sacrifices when one does not want to listen to God’s commandments. He said: it is much better to listen to the words of God than to bring sacrifices and not to keep God’s commandments.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Leviticus, 7:38.</i>
“<i>When the community was assembled at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting</i>” [8:4]. It was a great miracle that all of Israel stood before the door of the Tabernacle. There were six hundred thousand Israelites. How were they able to stand before a door that was not so big? Moses wondered about this and said at first, how is this possible to have all of Israel stand there? They are six hundred thousand men and their youths are also six hundred thousand. The Holy One responded: what kind of wonder is this for Me? I stretched the heavens very far from one thin thread. Similarly at Mount Sinai, how many millions of angels and how many thousands of Israelites were there? How could they all stand at Mount Sinai, but the Holy One said to the mountain, stretch and make yourself wide. So too at the door of the Tabernacle, the Holy One also said, expand and receive all of Israel. Similarly, when the Messiah will come, all the dead, from <i>Adam</i> until the coming of the Messiah, will be resurrected. These dead and also may other people will all be in Jerusalem. Should the Holy One not expand the city of Jerusalem, it would not be possible to receive all the people.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Leviticus, 8:4.</i>
“<i>On the thumb of his right hand</i>” [8:23]. He sprinkled blood from the sacrifice on the thumb. The person is compared to three <i>worlds.</i> First is the head, which has the understanding and wisdom. This relates to the <i>world of the angels</i>, which are pure intellect. Therefore, they first sprinkle blood from the sacrifice on the person’s earlobe, for the <i>world of the angels.</i> The ear is in the head where the intellect is found. The second thing the blood is sprinkled on is the thumb, which is related to the <i>world of the spheres</i> where the moon and the constellations circulate constantly and never rest. So too is the heart of the person and the essence of life is the heart. It must always move and beat. If it should stop beating and moving, the person would be dead. Similarly, the constellations, if they would stop moving and running, the world might end. Therefore, one must sprinkle blood on the thumb of the hand, since the hand is opposite the heart. The third thing they sprinkle is the thumb of the foot. This relates to the <i>lower world</i>, our world, which is ordinary and lowly. The foot is the lowest part of the body. This teaches us that the person should guard against sins. He should see how important he is, created in relation to three worlds. Therefore, this is shown to the person when the sacrifice is brought.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Leviticus, 8:23.</i>
“<i>You shall remain at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting day and night for seven days</i>” [8:35]. That is to say, when he performs the service, he should be warned that he should not go out from the service. However, one should not understand that he should remain for the full seven days and nights. This is not possible; the person must eat. The Midrash says that the Holy One commanded to engage in mourning for seven days for the deaths of Nadav and Avihu. The Holy One commanded similarly concerning the Flood. He commanded mourning for the Flood that the whole world would be destroyed. Here one asks a question. Why does one engage in mourning before there is a <i>deceased person?</i> The explanation is that a person does not know when he will have to mourn. He must wait until there will be a deceased person. However, the Holy One knows well what will be and when there will be a deceased person. Therefore, the Holy One commanded in advance to engage in mourning for seven days before Nadav and Avihu died.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Leviticus, 8:35.</i>
It is said in this Torah portion that the Tabernacle was erected on the twentythird day of <i>Adar.</i> Moses did the service for a full seven days. On the eighth day the Shekhinah came and rested on the Tabernacle. This was on the <i>first day of Nisan</i> and they brought a <i>sin offering</i> to atone for the altar and to sanctify the altar with it. Afterwards, they brought a burnt offering to permit the <i>priests</i> [to serve]. Then they also brought <i>peace offerings</i> to praise the Holy One.

“<i>Wisdom built her house</i>” [Proverbs, 9:1]. <i>King Solomon, of blessed memory</i>, said that our <i>faith</i> is compared to a wise woman, and the faith of the gentiles is compared to a foolish woman. Therefore, the verse began with “wisdom.” That is to say, our Torah contains only wisdom. It is compared to a clever woman who builds her house on many good pillars. She forbids her household many things. She finds ways to cook good food herself and to drink good drinks, and she prepares the table by herself. She works together with others. She calls her good friends to herself. So too is our holy Torah. It is prepared with all kinds of wisdom, like a table that is prepared with all sorts of good food. She invites all the people. She says: whoever is a fool and has no understanding, I will teach him wisdom. As the verse says, “<i>come, eat my food and drink the wine that I have mixed</i>” [Proverbs, 9:5]. Come to me and eat with me and drink my wine. Throw away your ways and accept wisdom. Thus, you will live long. He compares the <i>faith of the gentiles</i> to a foolish woman who talks about everything and causes many to stumble with her words, with her evil advice and her evil <i>deeds.</i> As the verse says, “<i>the stupid woman bustles about; she is simple and knows nothing. She sits in the doorway of her house</i>” [Proverbs, 9:13–14]. This means, the foolish woman is the <i>opposite</i> of the first, clever, woman that we mentioned above. The first one is clever and this one is foolish. She keeps talking and does not know about what she is talking. She is always looking out her door at the street. She has nothing prepared in the house. Therefore, she sits in the street. There is nothing to eat in the house, nothing to drink. So too is the faith of the gentiles. They left the shadow of the Holy One and they do not sit under the authority of the Holy One, like the foolish woman sits in the street before her door. The Midrash says about the verse, “<i>she has hewn her seven pillars</i>” [Proverbs, 9:1]. The wisdom of the Torah came from the seven heavens. If the person is worthy, he will inherit the world that has seven parts. That is to say, there are seven corners in the world. The Midrash says specifically that the Torah rests on seven pillars, since the number seven alludes to the heaven and also alludes to the creatures on the earth. The number seven is included in many commandments. The Sabbath is after seven days and the sabbatical year [<i>shemitah</i>] is after seven years. The Jubilee year is the fiftieth year after seven sabbatical years, and is after seven days. Sukkot is also seven days. The <i>etrog</i> has seven parts. The <i>etrog</i> is one; the <i>lulav</i> is the second. Then there are three <i>myrtle</i> branches. This is five all together, and there are two willow branches. All together this is seven. Mourning is seven days, and the wedding celebration is seven. Therefore, it is also shown here in the Torah portion that sacrifices were brought for seven days through the hand of Moses and through this he <i>dedicated</i> the altar. After the seventh day, Aaron and his children began to bring sacrifices on the eighth day. This was the <i>first day of Nisan</i>, when it was said.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Shemini, Introduction.</i>
“<i>On the eighth day Moses called Aaron and his sons</i>” [9:1]. He <i>dedicated</i> Aaron and his sons to bring sacrifices in the Tabernacle on the <i>first day of Nisan.</i> Therefore, Moses brought sacrifices for seven days and on the <i>first day of Nisan</i>; ten kinds of honor were done for Israel. The Midrash says, “<i>to the wanton men I say, do not be wanton</i>” [Psalms, 75:5]. The dancer should not rejoice with his dance. Who knows what will be afterwards? See what is written concerning <i>the creation of the world.</i> The Holy One created the world, as it is written, “<i>may the glory of the Lord endure forever; may the Lord rejoice in His works</i>” [Psalms, 104:31]. That is to say, the Holy One rejoiced greatly with his creatures. Afterwards, the verse says, “<i>His heart was saddened</i>” [Genesis, 6:6]. That is to say, The Holy One regretted that he had created the world, because it had become so evil. If the Holy One did not engage in His joy for very long, how much more so, a person who does not know how long his joy will last. Also concerning Abraham, there was great joy. He was very important. He has killed five kings and the Holy One had given him a son at the age of one hundred years. All of this was a great joy to him. However, afterwards his joy soon ended when the Holy One ordered him to slaughter that same son. As soon as he came home, he found that his wife Sarah had died, and he had no place to bury his wife Sarah. He had to buy a field for four hundred gulden in order to bury her. Isaac also had great joy with wealth. The king and his ministers said to him. We saw many wonders with your father and with you, and they held him very important, and the people of the city of Gerar protected him. They argued with him in the end, and he was blind in his old age. This is a great travail, since a blind person is compared to a dead person. When this happened to the good pious Isaac who had been a sacrifice on the altar, what should have happened with another person with his joy? Jacob also had great joy in that the Holy One showed him a ladder standing at his feet. The ladder reached to heaven and angels were going up to heaven and other angels from heaven were going down to earth. The Holy One was speaking with him at the same time. In the end, he had many troubles with Laban and with Esau. The trouble with Dinah and that Joseph was lost for many years. This shortened his joy. If this happened to Jacob, what should happen to an ordinary person and his joy? Joshua had great joy. He caused Israel to inherit the land of Israel and killed thirty-one kings. All of Israel considered him very important because of this. They said that whoever would say one word against Joshua would be killed. In the end, he became old and died without children. This is a great travail even for an ordinary person, how much more so for a pious and important person. Therefore, one should hold no joy as insignificant. <i>Eli the priest</i> had great joy. He was a king and a priest and <i>head of a court.</i> In the end, he was sitting on his throne and he was told that the Philistines had captured the Ark with the Tablets. He was very frightened and fell back on his throne and broke his neck and he died, and his two children were killed in that war. When this happened to <i>Eli</i>, it can occur to any person. Also <i>Elisheva</i>, the <i>daughter of Aminadav</i>, was the wife of <i>Aaron the priest.</i> She saw great joy that no person in the world had seen such great joy. Her husband was the <i>high priest</i> and her brother-in-law, <i>Moses Our Teacher</i>, was a king and a prophet. Her two sons, <i>Nadav and Avihu</i>, were the highest priests after Aaron, her husband. Her brother was the most important chieftain among the Israelites, and he was called <i>Nahshon the son of Aminadav.</i> However, her joy was short when her two sons were burned in the Tabernacle, at the sacrifices. Therefore, each person should reflect on how he should behave in his joy. When he is rich, he should not wait until the poor person asks him for money. “<i>Moses called Aaron and his sons</i>” [9:1]. Moses said to Aaron: come here my dear brother, the Holy One wants to make you a <i>high priest.</i> Aaron responded: you exerted yourself in building the Tabernacle. How is it appropriate that I should be the <i>high priest</i> and not you? Moses responded: It is as great a joy for me that you are the <i>high priest</i>, as if I had been a high priest. When the Holy One wanted to send me to Pharaoh, I said: Aaron is older, let him go on this mission. The Holy One said to me: Aaron is full of happiness and joy that you should have the honor of this mission to Pharaoh. Just as you rejoiced with my honor, so too I will rejoice when you will be a high priest. The Holy One said to Moses: do not think that since you offered sacrifices for seven days, you will be a high priest. Therefore, call Aaron immediately and he will be a high priest. You, Moses, should also call the elders, expecting that they will testify that I made Aaron for a high priest and he did not make himself a high priest.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Leviticus, 9:1.</i>
Aaron should take a calf as a sacrifice, expecting forgiveness for the sin of the Golden Calf, which was a calf.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Leviticus, 9:2.</i>
The Midrash says that Israel brought a kid because they slaughtered a kid and dipped Joseph’s garment into its blood and caused anguish to their father, Jacob. Afterwards, they made the Golden Calf. Therefore, Israel should also bring a calf for the Golden Calf. Since Aaron was only involved with the Golden Calf through actions, but his thoughts were not part of it, they were for God. Therefore, it is written that Aaron’s calf was the calf for a <i>sin offering.</i> This comes from actions. However, concerning Israel, the calf was a <i>burnt offering.</i> This shows that Israel’s thought was evil, to make a foreign god from the calf.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Leviticus, 9:3.</i>
“<i>Come forward to the altar</i>” [9:7]. The Midrash says that Aaron thought that the altar was like an ox and he was afraid to approach the altar. He saw an ox standing before him. Thus, Moses came and said to Aaron: my dear brother, do not be afraid. Go to the altar. <i>Ramban</i> writes that one should not understand that Aaron had seen an ox, but Aaron was a righteous person and always had before him, in his thoughts, the sin that he committed, and he had committed no sins except for the making of the Golden Calf. Therefore, the Midrash says, that is to say, that Aaron thought that the sin of the Golden Calf was standing before him. Thus, Moses said to Aaron, go to the altar; your sin has been forgiven. “<i>Making expiation for yourself and for the people</i>” [9:7]. You should make expiation for your sins and afterwards for the sins of the people. Each person should first repair himself and afterwards he should punish the people.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Leviticus, 9:7.</i>
Three sorts of things were offered from the sacrifice. First the fat of the sacrifice, since the fat brings him to all the sins through which he engages in arrogance.
That is to say, when a person is fat, he is quick to commit sins. Then they offered the kidneys, and it is known that the essential advice in the person comes from the kidneys. The person commits sins through the advice of the kidneys. Afterwards, one offers the red meat. This is the blood of the person, which leads the person to sins.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Leviticus, 9:9.</i>
“<i>Aaron lifted his hands toward the people and blessed them</i>” [9:22]. Aaron raised his hands toward heaven and blessed the people with the <i>priestly blessing.</i>
“<i>Moses and Aaron then went inside the Tent of Meeting</i>” [9:23]. Here one asks a question. For what reason did Aaron go in with him? The explanation is that Moses taught him how to bring the <i>incense.</i> On the eighth day he taught him how to offer the incense. Another explanation is that Aaron had brought the sacrifices and incense and the fire did not come down from heaven. Aaron said to Moses: all of this is because of me, because of my sins at the Golden Calf. You, Moses, caused me to be embarrassed. Moses went immediately into the <i>Tent of Meeting</i> and prayed. The Shekhinah appeared and Moses and Aaron went out and were saying, “<i>May the favor of the Lord</i>” [Psalms, 90:17], that the Holy One should cause the Shekhinah to rest on Israel. However, the whole seven days that Moses brought the sacrifices the Shekhinah did not appear. The Israelites were ashamed and said to Moses. We have exerted ourselves greatly so that the Shekhinah should appear to us, so that we should know that the sin of the Golden Calf has been forgiven for us. Moses responded: my brother Aaron is worthy that through him the Shekhinah will appear. With this you will know that the Holy One has chosen Aaron to be the <i>high priest.</i> Thus, the Shekhinah appeared and a fire came down from heaven and burned the sacrifices and burned them completely. The Israelites praised the Holy One and fell on their faces out of great fear.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Leviticus, 9:23.</i>
Bahya writes that the fire that came to burn the sacrifices remained and was not extinguished the whole time that the Temple stood, until the days of <i>King Solomon, of blessed memory.</i> We find twelve times fire came down from heaven on the earth. Six times the fire came for good to burn the sacrifices. Six times the fire came for evil and to punish the people. The first fire was now. It came to burn the sacrifices in the <i>Tabernacle.</i> The second fire came in the days of <i>Gideon.</i> He desired a sign from the Holy One. He slaughtered a kid and a fire came from a rock and burned the kid. The third fire came from heaven in the days of <i>Manoah</i>, when the <i>angel</i> came to his wife. <i>Manoah</i> took a kid and slaughtered it. A fire came on the altar and reached to heaven. The fourth fire came from heaven in the days of David. A <i>pestilence</i> came upon the people. David bought a threshing floor to bring sacrifices. He brought the sacrifices and a fire came down from heaven to receive his sacrifices. The fifth fire came down from heaven in the days of <i>King Solomon.</i> He finished building the <i>Temple</i>, and when he brought sacrifices a fire came down from heaven and burned the sacrifices. One asks a question. Why did fire come down in the days of Solomon? There was still fire on the altar from the days of Moses that was not extinguished, even to the days of Solomon. The explanation is that King Solomon brought many sacrifices on the copper altar that was from Moses. It could not accept all of Solomon’s sacrifices. Therefore, Solomon had to sanctify the courtyard in front of the Temple in order to bring all of his sacrifices. He made a <i>dedication of the altar</i> on that day. One was not supposed to take the fire of the altar outside the sanctuary and a strange fire was not supposed to be brought to any altar. Therefore, the Holy One had to send fire from heaven. The sixth fire came from heaven in the days of Elijah, who warred with the false <i>prophets.</i> Elijah asked God that He should send a great fire, since he had poured much water on the altar. Therefore, much fire had to come to also burn the water. These are the six fires that were for evil. The first was that <i>Nadav and Avihu</i> were burned. The second fire was when the Israelites were angry with Moses in the desert and a fire came and burned the important leaders. The third fire came when Korah argued with Moses and it burned two hundred and fifty men. The fourth fire came in the days of Job and burned all of his houses. The fifth and sixth fires were through Elijah. Two fires came in his days and burned his enemies.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Leviticus, 9:24.</i>
“<i>Put fire in it</i>” [10:1]. The sin of Nadav and Avihu was that they brought strange fire, not from the Tabernacle, and wanted to bring incense, and this was not right. They thought that one must have fire on the altar to burn the sacrifices, and that there must be enough fire for the sacrifices. Therefore, they took other fire and they did not want to take the fire from the altar. This was a sin, in that they did not think that the Holy One could easily make much fire out of a little fire when it would be needed. The Midrash says that they were drunk with wine and wanted to do the service at the altar. Therefore, it was soon forbidden to drink wine, after the death of Nadav and Avihu. The Holy One said: I want to honor you more that you honored me. You brought an unholy fire, and I will bring a holy fire from heaven. The Holy One immediately brought two threads of fire and each thread divided into two threads and the two fiery threads went into the nostrils of Nadav and the two fiery threads went into the nostrils of Avihu.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Leviticus, 10:1.</i>
Since their sin was fire, therefore, they were killed with fire. Their souls were not burned in their bodies, but the soul had to separate from the body. How is it possible that their souls should be burned, since they were very righteous people? Our sages say that Moses said to Aaron. I thought that this would happen to us, expecting that the Temple would be sanctified by important people. However, now we see that Nadav and Avihu were much better than us, since the house was sanctified through them. The Holy One said: through my important ones will I be sanctified, so that all of Israel will fear. Since they were important, we remember their death on Yom Kippur. Their death is mentioned in <i>Ahrei Mot.</i> The death of the righteous atones for Israel. Their bodies were also not burned, as is written here in scripture, that they carried the bodies of Nadav and Avihu out of the Tabernacle by their garments after their deaths. From here our sages learned that when a person is guilty of being burned, they also did the same. They melt lead and pour hot lead into the throat of the person who is guilty of being burned. Only this throat and lungs are burned. His soul goes out and the body of the person remains intact. The people of <i>Sannecherib</i> were also killed with this punishment, when they camped before Jerusalem. An angel came and blew a fiery thread into each of Sannecherib’s men and they were all killed. Thus, the people of Sannecherib merited that their garments and bodies remained whole. They were not burned because they were the descendants of <i>Japhet</i> and <i>Noah.</i> When <i>Noah became drunk</i> and lay uncovered in his tent, <i>Japhet and Shem</i>, his children, came and covered him. Therefore, Japhet merited that his descendants with Sannecherib now were killed and their garments remained on their bodies and also that their bodies were covered after their death. We are descended from Shem. Therefore, we were worthy to have <i>zizit</i> on our garments because Shem had covered his father.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Leviticus, 10:2.</i>
“<i>Aaron was silent</i>” [10:3]. Aaron was silent and did not cry when his two sons lay dead before him in the Tabernacle. Therefore, Aaron merited that the section on wine drinking was said to Aaron alone and not to Moses. The whole Torah was told through Moses, but this one section was told through Aaron alone.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Leviticus, 10:3.</i>
<i>Bahya</i> writes here that a <i>mourner</i> is obligated in five ways. The mourner is not supposed to bathe, and anoint with oil. He is not supposed to sleep with his wife, and should not engage in any kind of business. One should not study Torah as this is considered completely joyful. The <i>mourner</i> should not engage in anything joyful. Engaging in business is also called joyful.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Leviticus, 10:3.</i>
Moses called <i>Mishael</i> and <i>Elzaphan</i>, the children of <i>Uzziel, the uncle of Aaron</i> and commanded them to carry out Nadav and Avihu from the Tabernacle. They were buried outside the <i>gate of the Israelites.</i> Moses commanded <i>Aaron and Eleazar and Ithamar</i>, Aaron’s sons that they should not let their hair grow as the mourners used to do. They should also not <i>tear</i> their garments. Moses said that all of Israel would cry for Nadav and Avihu, since they were the most important after Moses and Aaron.
<i>Imre Noam</i> asks a question. Why does the Talmud teach that one should tear one’s garments from a verse in the <i>Prophets and Writings?</i> It would have been better if the Talmud had learned about tearing the garments from the verse relating to <i>Moses Our Teacher</i> in the Torah itself. The explanation is because the Talmud wants to learn more <i>rules</i> from the verse in the <i>Prophets and Writings</i> that relate to tearing the garments. All of this is learned from one verse in the <i>Prophets and Writings</i> and these rules are not shown in the Torah. The rule is that when one tears the garments, one should be standing. One should not sit and tear. The other rule is that one must tear the length of a fist. All of this is shown in the verse from the <i>Prophets and Writings.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Imre Noam, Leviticus, 10:6.</i>
<i>Baal ha-Turim</i> writes. “<i>And consumed them</i>” [10:2]. The word “<i>them</i>” contains an extra <i>vav.</i> This teaches us that <i>Nadav and Avihu</i> committed six sins. The first: they brought a strange fire. The second: they made <i>legal decisions</i> before Moses, their teacher. The third: they were drunk and wanted to do the service. The fourth: they did not have wives. They considered themselves very important and therefore did not have any children. Therefore, this was a great sin for them. The fifth: they wanted to become very rich. The sixth: they did not take any advice from any person.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Baal ha-Turim, Leviticus, 10:2.</i>

“<i>Wine or other intoxicant</i>” [10:9]. You should not drink wine or other drinks that make a person drunk. Similarly, when a person wants to issue a ruling about something, he should not be drunk.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Baal ha-Turim, Leviticus, 10:9.</i>
Bahya writes that wine has three aspects. It makes someone sleepy, brings a person to arrogance, and destroys the person’s reason. All three things are found in this passage. The first is sleep, about which the Torah writes here. “<i>When you enter the Tent of Meeting</i>” [10:9]. That is to say, do not sleep when you will come into the <i>Tent of Meeting.</i> This comes from drinking wine. Jacob also said that a ladder stood at his head that reached to heaven. Jacob said: if I had known that this was a holy place, I would not have slept. Therefore, the Holy One forbade drinking wine, expecting that you should not sleep when you come into the Tabernacle. The second thing was that wine leads to arrogance. Therefore, it says, “<i>to distinguish between sacred and profane</i>” [10:10]. That is to say, when a person is arrogant, everything is equally holy or not holy, impure and not impure, in his eyes. The third is that wine <i>confuses his reason.</i> Therefore, it is written here, “<i>you must teach the Israelites</i>” [10:11], since to issue rulings from the Torah one needs clear reason and clear wisdom. <i>King Solomon</i> wrote very negatively about one who is a drinker. The verse says, “<i>do not ogle that red wine</i>” [Proverbs, 23:31]. That is to say, do not let the wine entice you when it is beautifully red. “<i>As it lends its color to the cup</i>” [Proverbs, 23:31]. Whoever gives his eyes to the goblet to drink; he will not have anything left in his purse. “<i>As it flows on smoothly</i>” [Proverbs, 23:31]. He will sell everything from his house; he will not leave anything. That is to say, the house will be empty and cleared out because of his poverty.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Leviticus, 10:9.</i>
“<i>These are the creatures that you may eat</i>” [11:2]. The Torah wrote the laws with wisdom and in order. The Torah first tells us that one should not eat an animal that is not kosher, and does not have the proper signs. The animals were created from the earth. This is related to the earth since there are four types of creation. One is from the earth. The second is from water. The third is air. The fourth is fire. Therefore, the animals are mentioned first, which were created from the earth, how one should deal with them. Then it tells us in the next section about the creatures from the water, like fish, which ones are permitted to eat. The third section talks about creatures from the air. These are the birds and everything that lives in the heights. They fly through the air. It tells us which ones are permitted to eat. In the fourth section it talks about the creatures that are fire. The verse says, “<i>the lizards of every variety</i>” [11:29]. This means, <i>the turtles.</i> There are two types of turtle; one is called ‘<i>arod</i> in the <i>Talmud</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">The ‘<i>arod</i> is mentioned in B. <i>Hullin</i>, 59a and 127a. From the description in the Talmud, it seems to be a mythical animal.</i> and the other is called <i>salamander.</i> It is created when one heats a furnace constantly, day and night, for seven years. A creature comes out of this oven that is called a <i>salamander</i> and if this creature is without fire for a moment, it will die. Just like a fish that cannot live without water, so too the <i>salamander</i> cannot live for a moment without fire. When <i>Rabbi Akiva</i> came to this verse, he said: “<i>How many are the things You have made, O Lord;You have made them all with wisdom</i>” [Psalms, 104:24]. The Midrash says that the Holy One only commanded Israel not to eat non-kosher animals and not the <i>gentiles</i>, since the Holy One saw that they would not observe it. A parable. A person goes to his barn to load some grain. He loads up the donkey and the dog. The dog throws the grain from himself; he was never accustomed to this. The <i>owner</i> goes and removes the burden. So too, the Holy One saw that the gentiles would not keep the commandments, so He removed them from them. A parable. A physician goes to two sick people. One of them is very weak; he will not live. The physician says that he should be given as much food and drink as he wants. The physician goes to the other sick person who will live. He forbids that he should be given everything to eat and drink, but only cool things and not others, since it would harm him. The one who he ordered to be fed everything died, and the one who had had ordered not to be given everything to eat remained alive. The people asked him: what did you do? The physician said: I saw that the person would die. Therefore, I allowed him to drink and eat everything. However, I saw that the other sick person would remain alive. Therefore, I forbade him to eat and drink certain things. So too are Israel, who are prepared for the eternal life. Therefore, I command the commandments and Torah to him. However, the gentiles are prepared for Gehenna. Therefore, I do not command them any commandments and no Torah.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Leviticus, 11:2.</i>
“<i>Fins and scales</i>” [11:9]. Those fish that have scales and fins are permitted to be eaten. They can swim well in the upper parts of the water because they have scales. However, those that have no scales must lie on the bottom in the mud of the water. They are not healthy. Whoever eats them becomes cold from them and his heart becomes stopped up.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Leviticus, 11:9.</i>
“<i>You shall not eat of their flesh and you shall abominate their carcasses</i>” [11:11]. The Torah says that one should not eat the non-kosher fish and also should not buy or sell them. There are eight types that one should not deal with them. Four of them, because they are very important, therefore one should not do business with them. Four of the eight are because they are very despicable and it is not proper to do business with them. One should not do business with the first four with charity money, since the Holy One said that you should not make a profit for the charity. I have enough money; all the gold and silver is mine. Therefore, it is forbidden to do business with it. Perhaps it will become very necessary to use the money and it will have been lent out for interest and in the meantime, the poor people will die, <i>heaven forbid.</i> One should also not do business with the sanctified money from the Tabernacle or Temple. The third is that one should not do business with the firstborn of an animal that has acquired a defect. The fourth is that one should not do business with fruits from the <i>Sabbatical year.</i> Four things are disgusting and one should not do business with them. Meat of an animal that died of natural causes, or an animal killed by another animal, or <i>unclean creatures</i> and <i>insects.</i> When a dead animal occurs in his household, he is allowed to do business and sell it, but he should not buy dead animals as merchandise to do business with them. He is not allowed to do this.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Leviticus, 11:11.</i>
“<i>The following you should abominate among the birds</i>” [11:13]. The verse teaches us that there are more <i>pure birds</i> than <i>impure birds.</i> Therefore, we mention the <i>impure</i> ones in the Torah because they are few in number. The verse does not have to mention the <i>pure</i> ones. When one knows what is impure and their names, then one can know which ones are not mentioned are pure. Since the Torah wants to speak briefly, therefore the Torah tells us which are impure because they are few. Among the animals, the impure ones are more numerous than the pure ones. Therefore, the Torah tells which ones are pure, so that one should understand which are impure. Bahya writes here that the Holy One forbade some animals and birds because they are very evil and only have anger within them. They tear apart other domestic and wild animals with their anger. The Holy One does not love this and forbade bringing them as sacrifices. Therefore, He also forbade Israel to eat from them. Whoever eats from these animals and birds, he will also have bad attributes of anger and murder.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Leviticus, 11:13.</i>
Bahya asks a question. Why does the Torah count eight creeping things that are impure? That is to say, the person who touches them is impure. The verse did not count the snake among the creeping things. This teaches us that whoever touches the snake is not impure. Bahya asks a question here. How is it that the snake should not be impure? The explanation is that the snake is not impure so that the person should not be afraid to touch it and should kill it. If it had been impure, the person would have separated himself and not killed it. Similarly, a <i>lizard</i> also has poison like a snake that the Torah only forbade to eat, but one is allowed to touch it, expecting that one would kill it.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Leviticus, 11:30.</i>
“<i>You shall sanctify yourselves and be holy</i>” [11:44]. It is known that the person is born with an evil inclination and he has desires for all the delights of the world. However, the good inclination does not come immediately into the person and is a guest. He has no helper in the body that should support him. Thus, it is very difficult for the person to be able to do something good with his intellect. The evil inclination does not allow him; he has lived in the body for a long time. Therefore, the Holy One had to command commandments and prayer, fasts, charity, and <i>acts of lovingkindness</i>, expecting to torment the body so that the intellect and the good inclination should have some help to compel the body to do good. Thus, when the person wants to eat and drink, his evil inclination goes along with everything. His body will soon be destroyed. Therefore, the person must decide whether to engage in pleasure, and also not to have too much to do with women and engage in speaking <i>obscenity.</i> It is a great sin. He comes to Gehenna through speaking evil words with his mouth.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Leviticus, 11:44.</i>

<i>King Solomon, of blessed memory</i>, said: “<i>A ready response is a joy to a man</i>” [Proverbs, 15:23]. It is known that when the person speaks wise things with his mouth. This is a joy, since the words come from the intellect. It is also known that the speech of the person is from the Holy One, as the verse says, “<i>A man may arrange his thoughts, but what he says depends on the Lord</i>” [Proverbs, 16:1]. That is to say, to the person whose heart is prepared for all types of wisdom. However, God gives speech. Therefore, when the person speaks something with wisdom, this must be with the help of God. Therefore, the person has joy when he speaks with wisdom. “<i>And how good is a word rightly timed</i>” [Proverbs, 15:23]. When the words of a person are always good, but in any event when the <i>speech</i> is in its time, it is very good when the speech is appropriate. However, when a person would sing in the presence of a mourner, or the opposite, he would be mournful at a wedding, then it is not right. This is called speech not in its time. Similarly, when a person preaches on Sukkot about what relates to Passover. This is not right, since the speech is very good in its time. The Midrash says about the verse “<i>A joy to a man</i>” [Proverbs, 15:23]. This is the Holy One who is called <i>man</i>, who rejoiced with his words. Therefore, he was joyous and everything that he created was in its time. That is to say, at the appropriate time. Similarly, the person was created last; yet it was in its time, because the person is the most important creation. The whole world was only created because of the person who comes and knows the Holy One with his intellect. Similarly, the Sabbath is after six days, which is more important than the six days. Similarly, the world to come is after the world in which we live. It is more important than this world. Similarly, Israel was born last. The evil Esau came out of Rebecca first, and then Jacob came out. Similarly, the children of Esau were born first, since Esau took a wife at forty. Jacob took a wife when he was sixty years old. The sages say, <i>first the thought and the deed in the end.</i> That is to say, the beginning and the first is the thought and the deed is the end. A parable. A person wants to study Torah and has no house in which to study. He must build the house and afterwards he studies. That is, the study is at the end and the thought was first. That which was created was at the end and the thought was first. Therefore, he built the house. From this we can learn that the last is more important than the first. That which is created last was first in the thought to be created. As we find at the story of creation, that the trees, grasses, wild and domestic animals were created before the person was created. The person was first in the thought of the Holy One to be created. That is to say, the Holy One created everything for the sake of man. So too here, the Torah first told us how to behave with domestic and wild animals, which are kosher and which are not. The creatures are from the earth. Afterwards, the Torah tells us which fish in the water are kosher to eat. Then the Torah tells us about the birds that are created from the air. Lastly, the Torah tells us the commandments of the person and says that he should observe the commandment of circumcision, the first commandment for the person. That is to say, the person was created only to study Torah and keep the commandments.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Tazria, Introduction.</i>
“<i>When a woman at childbirth bears a male</i>” [12:2]. Our sages learn from this verse that if a woman has a child that is not full term and stillborn, she is impure just like if the child had been born alive. Some sages say that the child comes from the woman, but the husband separates from the seed of the woman what is not appropriate for the child. The husband makes the form of the child and causes that the seed of the woman will come together; it congeals like milk that one wants to congeal, one puts a piece of stomach into it. The sages brought a proof from a hen that lays eggs when she has relations with a rooster and chickens come from these eggs. However, when a hen warms herself in hot ashes, the hen also lays eggs from this warming, but the eggs cannot become chickens because no rooster was with this hen. The sages brought further <i>proof</i> from birds that only embrace and we do not see that <i>seed</i> enters her womb, yet she has children. This teaches us that the husband has a minimal part in the child, but he makes the form of the child. The sages brought a third <i>proof</i> from the fish that produce many eggs from their bodies and afterwards the male fish casts seed over the eggs and many fish come from this. On those eggs of the female fish that the seed of the <i>male</i> fish does not come, then nothing comes of the eggs. It is so, not only among the domestic animals, birds or wild animals. It is also so among trees that grow. When one takes a date palm that is male and mates it with a date palm that is female, the dates will grow on it. However, when one mates a male with a male or the opposite, nothing will grow from it. It is also so when the man gives heat and warmth to his wife; a child comes from this that has a form. Bahya writes further. Why is it that when the woman releases her seed first the child is a son? The explanation is that when the woman releases the seed first and the seed of the husband comes afterwards, the seed of the husband is strengthened; it is on top. Therefore, a son comes out who is like the husband. Also, the seed that comes first is like a field that is sown and the seed that comes afterwards is like the seed that is sown. Therefore, whichever seed comes last, that seed is strongest and the same person comes from it. That is, if male seed comes last, it is a son, and the opposite, a daughter. Bahya writes further. When the woman desires and loves her husband and her thoughts are on her husband when she has relations with her husband, and her thoughts in her heart are on her husband, then a son is the result of that act, since it depends on the thoughts. So too, Jacob placed speckled sticks before the sheep. They also had speckled sheep. When this works for animals, how much more so by a person who has intellect. Bahya writes. When a person can restrain his inclination so that his wife gives her seed first, the reward is that he will have a son, as the verse says, “<i>Sons are the provision of the Lord; the fruits of the womb, His reward</i>” [Psalms, 127:3]. The Midrash says that the Holy One does a miracle with the child. When a person is in jail for one day, he desires to get out. The child is locked in the womb for nine months and remains inside. The Holy One guards it. <i>Rabbi Meir</i> said: the Holy One does a <i>miracle</i> with the child before the child is born. The woman is only blood. As soon as the child is born, the same blood in the mother’s breasts becomes milk and the child nurses. Bahya writes that there are three worlds. The first world is in the womb where the child sees great wonders and <i>marvels</i> from the Holy One in the womb. A light shines above his head and he knows the whole Torah. He knows the <i>Garden of Eden</i> and all of its chambers and also <i>Gehenna.</i> He is told, be pious in the world into which you will be born, and you will come into the Garden of Eden and will have honor like our righteous ones have in the Garden of Eden. However, if you will be evil, then you will come to Gehenna where other evildoers are. The child desires all of its days not to leave the womb. His food is prepared. Whatever the mother eats, the child also eats. When it will be born, it cries and does not leave gladly, since the world is one of trouble and worry. When he acquires intelligence, he recognizes the Torah and commandments, and the wonders that the Holy One does with the person. However, when he will leave the world, he is mournful. He does not die gladly, but must die. The two worlds have a specified time. His time in the womb is nine months and sometimes twelve months. This world also has a time, seventy years. However, when he comes to the next world, it is a world that has no specified time, but the next world is eternal. This is shown that the person goes from one world to the next world for good. The last world is the best world.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Leviticus, 12:2.</i>
<i>Imre Noam</i> asks a question. When the Torah wants to properly tell the commandments after all of creation. The Torah should have first told the commandments of a man and afterwards those of a woman. The woman was created after the man. The explanation is that a woman having a child is an every day thing. However, the commandments of a man when he becomes leprous and how he should behave, the Torah writes this after the commandments of a woman because it is not common that a person should become, heaven forbid, leprous.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Imre Noam, Leviticus, 12:2.</i>
<i>Baal ha-Turim</i> writes. The Torah wrote, “<i>you shall sanctify yourselves</i>” [11:44], you shall be holy. Near this it is written, “<i>a woman at childbirth</i>” [12:2]. This teaches us that the person should keep himself clean when he has sexual relations with his wife. When a person has gone to the bathroom he should not have sexual relations with his wife immediately thereafter, but should wait a while. <i>Baal ha-Turim</i> also writes <i>male</i> has the numerical value of blessing.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Baal ha-Turim, Leviticus, 12:2.</i> That is to say, when someone has a son, it is a blessing from God. However, a daughter is, heaven forbid, a curse.
“<i>Unclean seven days</i>” [12:2]. The Torah commanded seven days of <i>impurity</i> for the woman, and seven days of <i>purity</i> after the seven days of impurity. These are like the seven days of <i>rejoicing</i> and the period of mourning is also seven days.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Leviticus, 12:2.</i>
“<i>Her menstrual infirmity</i>” [12:2]. The verse teaches us that no woman sees blood that is menstrual blood unless her head hurts first and all of her limbs become heavy. Therefore, she is called menstrual. One should separate from her, just like someone who has been excommunicated. One should not sit within four ells of her. No person should sit near a woman who is menstruating, but she should sit alone. This used to be the custom in ancient times even among the gentiles. They separated themselves from a menstruating woman; even where she stepped in the earth harms the person. Speaking with her also harms the person, as we find with Laban. He was searching for the images near Rachel, his daughter. She was sitting and said: I have my female time and I cannot stand up. The breath and the speech cause harm. It would have been just that Rachel should have stood up and kissed the hand of her father. It is also known that her looking at someone harms the one she looks at. The sages say that a woman who is menstruating and looks at a polished sword or she looks into a mirror, drops of blood are seen. This shows us that even looking cases harm.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Leviticus, 12:2.</i>
“<i>On the eighth day he shall be circumcised</i>” [12:3]. One should circumcise the child, even on the Sabbath, when the eighth day occurs on the Sabbath. The <i>evildoer Turnus Rufus</i> asked <i>Rabbi Akiva.</i> Which deeds are better, from the Holy One or from the person? <i>Rabbi Akiva</i> responded that the person’s are better. The evildoer said: can a person make heaven, as God made? <i>Rabbi Akiva</i> said: do not ask me what is above, that people cannot have dominion over, but ask about what is below, on the earth, among people. The evildoer asked: why do you circumcise yourselves? <i>Rabbi Akiva</i> responded: why is a child born and its navel is still attached to the womb and the mother must cut it off? The Holy One could have made the child be born so that its navel was not attached to the womb. So too, the foreskin is superfluous to the person. He must also fix it himself. Furthermore, the Holy One wants to test the people, if they will keep the mitzvah of circumcision.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Leviticus, 12:3.</i>
The woman must be impure for forty days for a son, and eighty days for a daughter. This is because a daughter is very cold, wet and damp in her nature and her phlegm is great. Therefore, the woman must wait longer to purify herself after a daughter than after a son.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Leviticus, 12:4.</i>
“<i>Make expiation on her behalf</i>” [12:7]. The woman brought a sacrifice after her lying in. What kind of sin had she committed that she brought a sacrifice? The explanation is that she brought a sacrifice for <i>Eve</i>, who committed a sin and caused that women would have difficulty in childbirth. If not for the sin of Eve, a woman would have had a child as easily as a tree makes its fruit grow every year. Therefore, women are commanded three <i>commandments</i> because of Eve, <i>menstruation</i>, <i>taking hallah</i>, and lighting candles. Our sages say that this is why the woman brings a sacrifice. When the woman is in childbirth, if she swears that she would not have relations with her husband because only anguish will come of it, her oath is meaningless. She can also not swear because she is obligated to do what her husband desires, but she brings a sacrifice to atone for her thoughts about the oath.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Leviticus, 12:7.</i> Therefore, at the present time the husband is called to the Torah and makes a donation when his wife comes to the synagogue.
“<i>When a person has on the skin of his body</i>” [13:2]. Bahya asks a question. Why did the Torah not write, <i>the Lord spoke to Moses, speak to the children of Israel</i>, concerning leprosy? The explanation is that the Holy One does not want to make any person guilty, as the verse says, “<i>declares the Lord, it is not my desire that the wicked shall die</i>” [Ezekiel, 33:11]. That is to say, the Holy One said, I do not desire to kill any person. What does God desire? That he should study Torah, as the verse says, “<i>The Lord desires His [servant</i>’<i>s] vindication, that he may magnify and glorify [His] teachings</i>” [Isaiah, 42:21]. Therefore, the Torah did not want to write here about leprosy, which is a major illness, and mention His name near it. Therefore, it does not say, <i>speak to the children of Israel.</i> The Holy One does not want to mention His name for evil. The Holy One created the light and the darkness. The Holy One gave each one a name by which it should be called. However, concerning the light it is written, “<i>God called the light Day and the darkness He called Night</i>” [Genesis, 1:5]. The Holy One mentions His name with the light and does not want to mention His name with the darkness, because the darkness is evil. When the Holy One blessed <i>Adam and Eve</i>, the Holy One mentioned His name. “<i>God blessed them</i>” [Genesis, 1:28]. When the Holy One cursed <i>Adam and Eve</i>, His name is not written or mentioned by the cursing. Our sages said: concerning three things the Holy One mentioned His name, even for evil things. The first is with the snake that spoke evil against the Holy One. The Holy One mentioned His name, as the verse says, “<i>the Lord God said to the serpent, because you did this</i>” [Genesis, 3:14]. The second one is when a person transgresses the commandments of the sages, as the verse says, “<i>Thus said the Lord the God of Israel: cursed be the man who will not obey the terms of this covenant</i>” [Jeremiah, 11:3]. The third is when the name of the Holy One is mentioned in connection with an evil thing. This is, when a person relies on a person and not on God, as the verse says, “<i>Thus said the Lord: cursed is he who trusts in man, who makes mere flesh his strength, and turns his thoughts from the Lord</i>” [Jeremiah, 17:5]. Nonetheless, leprosy comes upon the person because of illicit sexual relations and because of arrogance. Bahya writes that the section on leprosy is written near the section about a menstruating woman. This teaches us that whoever does not properly keep the rules regarding menstruation, then the child becomes a leper. This is where it comes from. So said the sages in the Talmud. A man who sleeps with a woman who is menstruating, the first day of her menstruation, the child will be a leper for ten years. Whoever sleeps with her the second day of her menstruation, the child will be leprous for twenty years and the third day of her menstruation, the child will be a leper for thirty years. So seven days, until the seventh day. The child will be a leper for seventy years. The leprosy came because of the person’s sins.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Leviticus, 13:2.</i>
A parable. The slave of an evil master is sold in the market and the master who buys him knows well that he is evil. He says: I will make him good and brings good chains and a stick to punish him when he will be evil. So too is the Holy One who knows well from his creation that man will commit sins. Therefore, he prepared <i>plagues</i>, <i>leprosy</i> and other diseases to punish him. Thus the Holy One brought the <i>plagues</i> and <i>leprosy</i> first on the stones of the house that became leprous. When the person repents, the Holy One forgives him. If he does not repent, then the Holy One sends leprosy on his garments. If he repents, the Holy One forgives him. However, if he does not repent, the Holy One sends leprosy on his body. The leprosy that He sends on the person’s body, He also sends with mercy. First, he sends a little bit. If he repents, then it is good. If he does not repent, He afflicts him with mange. If he repents, it is good. However, if he does not repent, the Holy One sends severe <i>leprosy, heaven forbid</i>, on his body. The Midrash says that the Holy One is merciful. He does not angrily punish the person, as we find with <i>Job.</i> The Holy One first punished his goods, afterwards his children, then his house, and afterwards, his body. So too in Egypt, first the animals and then the bodies of the firstborn. The punishments are from God, with the <i>Providence</i> of the Holy One. This did not occur <i>outside the land of Israel</i>, but only in the <i>land of Israel.</i> The Holy One showed that the person has committed transgressions. Therefore, the Holy One sent afflictions to the person’s house and then the garments and then on his body, in order to <i>warn</i> him that he should repent. This happened in the <i>land of Israel</i>, but in the city of <i>Jerusalem</i> there was no leprosy in the houses of the city because it was very holy and the Shekhinah rested there.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Leviticus, 13:58.</i>

Metzora

<i>King Solomon, of blessed memory</i>, said: “<i>A man</i>’<i>s belly is filled by the fruit of his mouth; he will be filled by the produce of his lips</i>” [Proverbs, 18:20]. The verse teaches us what a very good thing the tongue is when he speaks Torah and commandments and punishes the people for good. His reward from the Holy One is good. However, when he speaks slander and gossip, his reward is also prepared. He will have enough because of it. Therefore, the verse tells us here, first that the person will be satiated and have enough troubles and suffering when he will speak slander and gossip. Afterwards, he says that if he speaks positively, God will pay him well. Therefore, the verse later says, “<i>death and life are in the power of the tongue; those who love it will eat its fruit</i>” [Proverbs, 18:21]. That is to say, life and death depend on the tongue. However, the wise person who loves to talk with the tongue always thinks to speak Torah and commandments, in order to have a good reward. Similarly, the person who speaks much slander and gossip, he brings much trouble and suffering upon himself. Therefore, the Torah wrote [the portion of] <i>Mezora,</i> which is like the two words, <i>speaks evil.</i> That is to say, the one who speaks evil gets leprosy and the person brings a sacrifice for the slander. He is not purified except through the priest.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Mezora, Introduction.</i>
The priest had to go out to the person who had leprosy. The leprous person was alone, separate from the people. Slander is a great sin, more than when a person commits murder. When he commits murder, he kills one person, but by speaking slander he kills three people. First, he himself is killed, the one who speaks. The second one who is killed is the one who hears the slander. The third one who is killed is the one who is spoken about slanderously. See which is more severe, a sword or an arrow? A sword can only kill one person close to him and not at a distance. However, an arrow kills even at a distance. Therefore, the Torah called slander an arrow, as the verse says, “<i>their tongue is a sharpened arrow, they use their mouths to deceive</i>” [Jeremiah, 9:7]. Slander is a greater sin than the three sins of illicit sex, <i>worship of foreign gods</i>, and murder. Even Miriam who only spoke about her brother Moses; she only wanted that he should not separate completely from his wife. Yet, the Holy One punished Miriam that she was leprous for seven whole days. Aaron also became leprous, but the Holy One immediately healed him from his leprosy.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Leviticus, 14:2.</i> From here we learn how great a sin is slander. One must not forgive this sin, even if he is very important.
The person who became leprous must bring two clean birds. The Holy One said that the person should bring birds that sing and whistle with their mouths and should atone for the person who also spoke evil with his mouth. He should take a stick of a fir tree, which is very tall, to atone for the person who held himself very haughty and was arrogant. This led him to engage in slander. He should take a small worm that is very lowly and humble. That is, the person who held himself high as a fir tree should now hold himself humble as a small worm and he will be healed.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Leviticus, 14:4.</i>
“<i>The owner of the house shall come</i>” [14:35]. The Talmud says that leprosy comes to a house because the person does not want to lend utensils from his house. Therefore, the verse says, “<i>the owner of the house.</i>” That is, the house is his and he does not want to lend anything from it.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Leviticus, 14:35.</i>
“<i>The priest shall order the house cleared</i>” [14:36]. The Torah does not want that Israelites should have any damage. Even their earthenware vessels should not become impure in the house that has become leprous. Therefore, the priest should command the householder that he should first clean out the whole house of all the vessels. The priest should not declare the house impure before all the vessels have been cleared out, expecting that they should not become impure for the householder.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Leviticus, 14:36.</i>
Zeror ha-Mor writes. Just as the person’s body has diseases, so too the person’s soul has diseases, as the verse says, “<i>heal my soul for I have sinned</i>” [Psalms, 41:5]. That is to say, heal me and my soul. Since he says that his soul should be healed, it must be sick sometimes. Therefore, just as sometimes there are diseases of the person’s body that are called life threatening, there are some that are easy and last for a day. These are not <i>dangerous.</i> However, because they have no <i>remedy</i>, they are severe. So too is slander. The person thinks that he commits no sin in speaking <i>slander</i>, because he has done nothing but speaking with his mouth. The person does not desire repentance or a remedy for slander. He thinks that it is not a sin. There are also some <i>diseases</i> that are called <i>dangerous</i>, even though they are not dangerous, since the remedy exists. However, the remedy is very ugly and bitter for the person. He would die before he would take the remedy. So too it is with slander. The remedy is that he must go to the one whom he slandered and must say: I have <i>slandered</i> you. A person would rather die before he would do this. Sometimes a disease is not <i>dangerous</i> and the remedy is not ugly, but it is <i>dangerous</i>, because the remedy is far from him and before he can obtain it, he might die before he gets the remedy. So too it is with slander. When a person wants to repent for it, it is far to go to the one he spoke about in order to ask forgiveness of him. He might die before he would come to him. He also does not know the people about whom he spoke ill. Sometimes, the remedy is close and is not ugly, but the disease has been in the body for a long time and has taken it over, so that the remedy cannot help him. So too it is with slander. The speech is always in the person and he has become accustomed to much slander all the time, day and night. The slander is very strong in him and no remedy can help him. The person must continue to sin. He comes to slander because he speaks much. Therefore, the person should not accustom himself to speak much and he will not come to slander.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Zeror ha-Mor, Leviticus, 14:2.</i>
“<i>Shave off all his hair</i>” [14:8]. They shaved off the hair of the leprous person’s body, since the hair is the adornment of the body. The beard is the primary adornment of a man and when it is cut off, this is very ugly, expecting that he should be shamed and not be impudent and engage in slander. Therefore, the section ends, “<i>the priest shall make expiation for him. Then he shall be clean</i>” [14:20]. That is to say, the essence of purification depends on his leaving his sins, through which he is healed of leprosy and he becomes clean.
“<i>I inflict an eruption plague</i>” [14:34]. Rashi writes. It was good for the Israelites when their houses had leprosy. The gentiles who had lived in them knew well that the Israelites, after forty years of wandering in the desert, would conquer their land and would take away their <i>treasures</i>, goods, and money. Therefore, these <i>gentiles</i> hid their goods and money in the stone walls of their houses, expecting that the Israelites would not find their <i>treasures.</i> Therefore, the Holy One sent leprosy onto their houses. Where there was a treasure, leprosy came upon the house. Thus, the Israelites had to tear down the houses because of the leprosy and they found the treasures of the gentiles.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Leviticus, 14:34.</i>
<i>Zeror ha-Mor</i> writes that some nations, when they build a house, lay a stone in the name of the foreign god or in the name of the <i>demons.</i> Therefore, the Holy One sent the leprosy on the houses, expecting that they should build a new building in the name of the Holy One and to extirpate the magic and worship of foreign gods. The <i>spirit of impurity</i> rests on the houses of those nations. It happened that a Jew was taking his son who could not walk and his mouth was twisted, on a donkey. He led him into a cave where all the blind and lame came to be healed. Two sages encountered him and asked him if the same thing had happened to others in that house? The father responded that he had heard that it happened to other people in that house. The sages said: there is a <i>demon and an impure spirit</i> in that house who does everything. Therefore, go again to the house and rely on the Holy One. He can help you. He did not want to return and continued on in the cave. He saw a demon in the middle of the night with a jug of oil who was smearing the <i>sick people</i> and they were healed. When the demon came to that Jew, he did not want to smear the oil on him. The father asked: why did you not smear the Jew? He answered: you are not within my power, but the Holy One has power, he heals you. I do everything to destroy and mislead the gentiles so that they should err and serve the foreign gods. I do not heal, but I know well that when the sick people come that each person’s <i>illness</i> should end and should be healed. Thus, I smear them and they think that I am healing them. The Jew went with his son and the son died. The sages encountered that Jew. The Jew told them everything that happened to him and the sages were happy.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Zeror ha-Mor, Leviticus, 14:35. The source of this story is <i>Zohar</i>, III: 51a.</i>
Bahya writes. The Torah wrote “<i>a man who lies with an unclean woman</i>” [15:33], near the death of Aaron’s children. This shows what kind of sin the children of Aaron committed that led to their deaths. Some sages say that they brought strange fire into the Tabernacle. Some sages say that they drank wine and wanted to do the <i>service</i> in the Tabernacle. Some sages say that they issued <i>halakhic rulings</i> before their <i>teacher, Moses.</i> Some sages say that they did not want to take wives because they held themselves haughty. They said that there is nobody <i>worthy</i> to be their wife. Many important maidens were waiting for them and became old maids, as the verse says, “<i>fire consumed their young men, and their maidens remained unwed</i>” [Psalms, 78:63]. That is, the two <i>young men, Nadav and Avihu</i> were burned by a fire, because they did not <i>marry</i> the <i>young maidens.</i> The word “<i>hulalu</i>” means marriage. Some say that <i>Nadav and Avihu</i> at Mount Sinai gazed intently at the Shekhinah, and this is a great sin. The Holy One did not kill them at that time, as he did not want to mar the celebration of the Torah at that time. Some say that they were impure and went into the Tabernacle. That is to say, they did not wash their hands and their feet. Similarly, one who does not wash and goes into the Tabernacle to do the service is guilty. These are six opinions why Nadav and Avihu died. The Midrash writes. “<i>Concerning her who is in menstrual infirmity</i>” [15:33]. The Torah compares the impurity of Israel in the exile to a menstruating woman. She will soon again become pure with her immersion. So too are Israel in exile, when they are impure. The Holy One will again purify them and will have relations with them. Therefore, the verse does not compare their impurity to the impurity of a <i>dead person.</i> This is an eternal impurity and when there is a dead person in the house a priest cannot enter that house. However, a woman who is menstruating, the priest can certainly be with her in the same house, and may even sit on the same bench where she is sitting. So too is the Holy One with us in the exile, even when we are also impure in the exile, and also our <i>impurities</i> among the gentiles. The Holy One said: now in the exile you are impure. However, in the end I will purify you eternally, as the verse says, “<i>I will sprinkle clean water upon you, and you shall be clean: I will cleanse you from all your uncleanness and from all your fetishes</i>” [Ezekiel, 36:25].<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Leviticus, 15:33.</i>

Achrei Mot

<i>King Solomon</i> said: “<i>when you sit down to dine with a ruler, consider well who is before you</i>” [Proverbs, 23:1]. The verse teaches us that the person should not pursue <i>noblemen and aristocrats</i>, and should not have to engage with them too much and do business with them. The authorities are compared to a fire. Just like a fire is good to warm oneself near it and at the same time is very bad when one is too close to it. He will burn himself. So too are the authorities of the gentiles. Whoever gets too close to them, he will be harmed by them. They bring a person close when they have benefit from him. Therefore, King Solomon said, when you want to eat bread with a nobleman, see and ask how it went with other people who ate bread with those authorities. The verse also teaches us that the person should not think much or have many thoughts about what is in heaven, how the Holy One is and what He is. Therefore, the verse says, “<i>consider well who is before you</i>” [Proverbs, 23:1]. That is to say, if you want to know what the Holy One is, then see what is before you, the heaven and the earth that the Holy One does wonders and miracles all the time. With that you will recognize the Holy One. Therefore, the children of <i>Aaron</i>, <i>Nadav and Avihu</i>, at Mount Sinai looked intently at the Shekhinah and thought very deeply about it. Therefore, the Holy One killed them, as the verse says here.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Ahrei Mot, Introduction.</i>
“<i>After the death of the two sons of Aaron who died when they drew too close to the presence of the Lord</i>” [16:1]. That is to say, they died because they came too close to the Holy One, and saw too much of the <i>Shekhinah</i> at Mount Sinai. <i>Rabbi Ephraim</i> writes in his <i>book</i>, <i>Keli Yakar.</i> “<i>When they drew too close</i>” [16:1] means, because they were close and important to God. Therefore, they were killed as the verse says, “<i>through those near to Me I show Myself holy</i>” [Leviticus, 10:3]. I will be sanctified by those closest to me, since the Holy One punishes the righteous for small sins.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Keli Yakar, Leviticus, 16:1.</i>
“<i>When they drew too close</i>” [16:1] also means, because they came close to bring sacrifices and brought a strange fire into the Tabernacle. They died on the first day of the month of <i>Nisan.</i> Therefore, the verse here warns Aaron that he should say to the priests that they should not always come into the Tabernacle, but only on <i>Yom Kippur</i>, with <i>the incense.</i> The Midrash writes that the four children of Aaron were guilty of death because of the sin of the Golden Calf, but Moses prayed and only two died, as the verse says, “<i>for the same fate is in store for all: for the righteous and for the wicked; for the good and pure</i>” [Ecclesiastes, 9:2]. This means, something happens to the righteous and to the evil, for good or for evil. King Solomon saw prophetically how the generations would behave and saw that the evildoer would have the same fate as the righteous. Abraham was righteous. He convinced people to worship the Holy One. Nimrod was very evil. He dissuaded all the nations from worshiping the Holy One and both of them had to die. King David was called pure and Nebuchadnezzar was called impure. King David built the Temple<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Though historically inaccurate, it follows the statement in the original source, which is <i>Tanhuma</i>, <i>Ahrei Mot</i>, 1.</i> and was king for forty years. Nebuchadnezzar destroyed the Temple and also was king for forty years. We see here that the same thing happened to each of them. Moses who was very pious was called <i>good</i> and the spies were called <i>sinners</i>, because they committed sins. Moses had to die in the desert, just like the spies who all died in the desert and did not come into the <i>land of Israel.</i> Another explanation. The children of Aaron were called <i>good</i> and <i>Korah</i> was called a sinner. The children were burned, just like the people of Korah, two hundred and fifty men, were burned. “<i>Of revelry I said, it</i>’<i>s mad</i>” [Ecclesiastes, 2:2]. Rejoicing and revelry are only foolishness. <i>King Solomon</i> was very rich and accumulated much gold and silver, which God had forbidden him. However, he did not listen to it and he took seven hundred wives and three hundred concubines. The Holy One also forbade him to have many horses. He had forty thousand stalls, since there were that many horses. The Holy One sent an angel who looked just like Solomon and the angel seated himself on his throne and threw King Solomon away. King Solomon shouted that he is Solomon in all the synagogues and <i>study houses.</i> The people beat him with sticks and they fed him beans and cabbage. At that hour Solomon said: this is all my work that I increased my <i>kingdom and wealth</i>, to eat beans and cabbage. Similarly, Elisheva, the wife of Aaron, had distinguished lineage and great honor. Her husband was the high priest and her brother-in-law Moses was a king over Israel. Her two sons, Nadav and Avihu, were the most important priests after Aaron and her brother was the most important chieftain in Israel. When her two children went into the Tabernacle, they were burned. Her joy soon ended. Therefore, no person should rejoice excessively when he has great wealth or distinguished lineage.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Leviticus, 16:1.</i>
“<i>Tell your brother Aaron that he is not to come at will</i>” [16:2]. It is a parable. A physician goes to a sick person and says, do not eat cold food and do not lie in the cold. Another physician comes and says to him, do not eat cold food and do not lie in the cold and you won’t die like the other person died. Is the second physician much better than the first one? He instills fear and makes him alert, that he should not eat cold things and not lie in the cold, expecting that he should not die, like the other one who died. So too, the Torah wrote here, do not come all the time into the Tabernacle, so that you should also not die like the children of Aaron died. The Torah instills a fear about dying. The priest should not go into the Tabernacle, except for Yom Kippur. The cloud removed itself from the outside of the Tabernacle and moved to the cover. This was the cover of the Holy Ark. The priest was not supposed to go in, but he had to make the incense smoke from spices and carried the incense in front of him, expecting that the smoke should be before his eyes, so that he should not be able to see much of the Shekhinah, which was over the cover.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Leviticus, 16:2.</i>
“<i>With this shall Aaron come</i>” [16:3]. The word “<i>with this</i>” teaches us much. “<i>With this</i>” has the same numerical value as the number of years that the Temple stood, four hundred and ten years. “<i>With this</i>” also teaches us that Aaron went into the Tabernacle with many merits and many commandments. The word “<i>with this</i>” points to the merits of the Torah, which is called, “<i>And this is the Torah</i>” [Deuteronomy, 4:44], and points to the <i>merit of circumcision</i>, which is called, “<i>this is My Covenant</i>” [Genesis 17:10]. It points to the commandment of the Sabbath, which is called “<i>this</i>,” as the verse says, “<i>happy is the man who does this</i>” [Isaiah, 56:2]. Similarly, many other commandments are called “<i>this.</i>” Aaron went into the Tabernacle with these merits, and was protected so that he came out of the Tabernacle in peace.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Leviticus, 16:3.</i>
“<i>Linen tunic</i>” [16:4]. The verse writes that the high priest wore four garments on Yom Kippur of pure linen. There were eight garments that the high priest used to wear except for one time in the year, on <i>Yom Kippur.</i> When the <i>high priest</i> went into the inner part of the Tabernacle, the priest was not supposed to appear in clothes with gold, since the other garments were with gold. Gold was at the Golden Calf, with which Israel sinned in the desert. Therefore, the priest should not cause the sin to be remembered through the gold of the garments, in the holy place where the <i>Ark and cover</i> were. However, during the year, the priest did the service outside and therefore, the gold of the garments was not central. The four garments were compared to the four camps of angels that surrounded the <i>Throne of Glory.</i> Therefore, the garments were made of linen, expecting that the priest should hold himself humble, since linen grows out of the earth. The priest should remember that he came from the earth and will again come to the earth. However, also that the sheep came from an animal that has life. This was also shown by the garments that the priest donned on <i>Yom Kippur</i> were compared to three <i>worlds</i>, since the person is compared to three <i>worlds.</i> First he donned <i>breeches.</i> This was for the first part of the body, which relates to the world that is lowly. Everything in it is what becomes destroyed and desolate. So comes everything from the person’s rear end, everything that was eaten and drunk. There were the <i>breeches</i> on the limbs. Afterwards, he put a belt on his loins. This was related to the heart of the person. This was related to the middle world where the <i>spheres</i> are. They do not rest, but run forever. So too is the heart; it must beat forever. Afterwards, he had a cap on his head. This was related to the <i>world of the angels</i>, which are pure intellect. There too wisdom and intellect are in the head.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Leviticus, 16:4.</i>
“<i>One for Azazel</i>” [16:8]. Two goats were brought as sacrifices on <i>Yom Kippur</i>, one for the Holy One; the second one was sent into the <i>wilderness</i> alive. The Midrash says. They sent one of them alive to the <i>evil Samael</i> as a bribe. He is an evil angel who speaks evil against Israel. Therefore, he was given a bribe on <i>Yom Kippur</i>, a sacrifice, so that he should not speak evil about us. When the <i>angel Samael</i> sees that Israel, on <i>Yom Kippur</i>, have <i>regret</i> for their sins and repent. He comes to the Holy One and says, what a good nation you have on the earth. They are like the angels. How are the angels? They go barefoot, without shoes, just like <i>Israel</i> who go barefoot <i>on Yom Kippur.</i> How are the angels? They do not eat and drink. So too are Israel on <i>Yom Kippur.</i> How are the angels? They have no knees and they always stand. So too are Israel, on <i>Yom Kippur</i> they also stand on their feet all day. How are the angels? There is peace among them. So too are Israel on <i>Yom Kippur.</i> How are the angels? They have no sins. So too are Israel on <i>Yom Kippur.</i> When the Holy One hears from the <i>evil Samael</i> that he speaks only good about Israel, then the Holy One forgives the sins of Israel. Therefore, the <i>angel is called Samael</i>; he is the <i>poison of death</i> for the people. Samael’s nature is that his eyes can be blinded by bribes. The verse says, “<i>bribes blind</i>” [Deuteronomy, 16:18]. This means, the bribe blinds him. Aaron took two goats, putting one at his right hand and one at his left hand. He wrote two notes; on one was written, <i>for God</i>, and on the other was written, <i>for Azazel.</i> He put the two notes in a vessel, mixed them, and took out one and put it on a goat. Then he took out the other note and placed it on the other goat. Then the notes were read. The one that was written <i>for God</i> remained as a sacrifice for the Holy One and the one that was written <i>for Azazel</i> remained for <i>Azazel.</i> Even though we send the sacrifice to Azazel, but in any event our intention is for the Hoy One. It is like a parable. Once someone was asked to give a <i>minister a present</i>, expecting that he would intercede with the king. The present is like it comes from the Holy One Himself. He had commanded that the goat be given to <i>Azazel.</i> Even when the lot fell on the right side for <i>Azazel</i>, one was not supposed to change it, though one wanted to take the goat from the right side for the Holy One. This shows that the Holy One foregoes the honor due him and He commanded to give a sacrifice to Azazel.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Leviticus, 16:7.</i>
“<i>Nobody else shall be in the Tent of meeting</i>” [16:17]. Our sages say in the <i>Talmud</i>, in <i>tractate Yoma</i>, that even the angels that were on the cover of the Tabernacle, moved out from the Tabernacle so that the high priest should have room.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">J. <i>Yoma</i>, 1.5.</i> That is to say, the angels moved out of the Tabernacle for the sake of his honor. There was a high priest who did not observe what the sages said, that the incense should be prepared inside the holy part of the Tabernacle. However, he wanted to prepare it outside and bring in the incense into the holy part. He was not supposed to do this, since the essence of the incense was when one began to prepare it. Then its smell was very good and strong. However, if he prepared the incense outside, the smell would have evaporated before he entered the holy place. One priest did not want to go inside and prepared the incense outside. An angel came and killed him in the <i>courtyard</i> before he came into the holy place. The priests came and saw the mark of a calf’s foot between his shoulders, since the angels have feet like a calf.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Leviticus, 16:17.</i>
“<i>For the life of the flesh is in the blood</i>” [17:11]. Ramban writes that the prohibition is because it was supposed to be sprinkled on the altar, just like the fat, which is forbidden because it was brought on the altar. Another explanation why blood is forbidden is because it is the soul of the person and the animal. The Holy One did not tell us to eat any soul, but only the body of the animal. We must have a clear mind to study Torah and if we would eat the blood of an animal we might have a base body like the animal, and also an uncompassionate body like the animals that engage in attacking and killing. Blood is not like other food that becomes digested in the body. It always remains blood, even when the person ingests it in his body. Rambam writes that blood is forbidden to eat because it was the custom of the Egyptians to be completely magical, and follow demons. They dug a pit and poured blood into it and the demons would gather around the pit. Later, whichever person drank from the pit, he would know what would happen in the future. Therefore, the Holy One forbade the eating of blood, expecting that they should not do magic.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Leviticus, 17:11. Bahya quotes both Ramban and Rambam.</i>
“<i>Shall live by them</i>” [18:5]. <i>Bahya</i> writes. The Torah teaches us that the person should remain alive through the Torah and commandments. That is to say, he may occasionally transgress a commandment and not observe it, if he will be killed, expecting that he will transgress the commandment. Our sages say about three commandments; the person should allow himself to be killed before he would transgress them. One is worship of foreign gods; the second is illicit sexual relations, when someone wants to force him to engage in illicit sexual relations. The third is murder. He is told to kill a person or they will kill him. He should let himself be killed before he kills another person. It is known that there are four types of life for the body and soul through keeping the commandments. The first is that his intention is keep the commandments so that things should go well for him with wealth and health; he should live long. This is not completely right. The second is that some fulfill the commandments because they want to have a good reward in the next world. They are always worthy to have the <i>world to come.</i> The third is the one whose intention is to fulfill the commandments out of love of the Holy One. He merits this world and the next world. Therefore, he keeps the commandments and engages in business. He feeds himself with honor and honors other people. The fourth is the one who keeps the commandments and the Torah and does nothing else day and night, but serves God, Blessed be He. He comes to the Garden of Eden with body and soul, like Enoch and <i>Elijah.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Leviticus, 18:5.</i>
“<i>None of you shall come near anyone of his own flesh</i>” [18:6]. The verse teaches us that it is forbidden to marry relatives, since healthy children do not come from this. They do not remain alive. Bahya writes that sleeping with a wife is divided into five parts. The first is that he is obligated to sleep with her, expecting that he will have children. The second is to observe the commandment of the Torah not to transgress during the time of menstruation and sleep with her. The third is that it is a remedy to sleep with her. The person purifies his body. The fourth is that he will chase away his evil inclination and evil thoughts. The fifth is that he will sleep with her for pleasure, and it is forbidden to do it like the animals.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Leviticus, 18:6.</i>
Bahya writes further that <i>King Solomon, of blessed memory</i>, said. “<i>Can a man rake embers into his bosom without burning his clothes?</i>” [Proverbs, 6:27]. This means, whoever sweeps the fire into his lap and his clothes will not be burned?
So too it is with one who only touches a strange woman with his hand. His body will be punished and tortured, since the body is compared to clothes. It is the clothes to the soul. King Solomon then says, “<i>Can a man walk on live coals without scorching his feet? It is the same with one who sleeps with his fellow</i>’<i>s wife</i>” [Proverbs, 6:28–29]. That is to say, if someone were to walk on coals, and his feet are not burned? It is similar with one who sleeps with a <i>married woman.</i> His soul will be burned in Gehenna. From here we should learn that people should be warned not to dance with strange women who have husbands. The people are not warned about dancing with them, especially young unmarried men with young married women. The sin is very great and the thought is very evil.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Leviticus, 18:20.</i>
“<i>Do not allow any of your offspring to be offered up to Molech</i>” [18:21]. The nations had an idol. They built a fire on two sides and the father allowed the son to be pulled through the fire until he was burned. He thought that he was a sacrifice and all of his other children would remain alive because he had burned one son to his god, and he would have <i>good fortune</i> in all of his endeavors. The Torah wrote about idol worship near illicit sexual relations. This teaches us that that when Israel serve foreign gods, it is like one engaged in illicit sexual relations with women married to others.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Leviticus, 18:21.</i>
“<i>Such people shall be cut off</i>” [18:29]. The <i>cutting off</i> that the body is cut off is divided into three parts. One cutting off is that the body is cut off. The second is that sometimes only the soul alone is cut off. Sometimes the body and the soul are cut off together. The first is that the body is cut off alone. When someone is very pious and commits a sin for which one is guilty to be cut off. A scholar was in one bed with his wife when she was sitting the seven clean days after her menstruation, before she immersed herself. He was in his clothes and she was in her clothes in one bed. That scholar died in middle age. This is called cutting off his years. Another cutting off of years is when an old man who commits a sin, his years should be cut off. Since he is old, can one cut off his years? He lived out his years. The Holy One cuts off his days. That is, he should have lived seventy years; so it was signed for him. However, now he will not live out his days. Therefore, the Talmud says in [tractate] <i>Moed Katan. Rabbi Joseph</i> became seventy years old and he made a <i>festival.</i> He said, I have lived long because I was not guilty of being cut off, because I have become so old. Rabah said to him. Yes, you have survived being cut off this year, but regarding having your days cut off, you do not know if you have not been guilty. That is, perhaps you committed a sin so that you will not live out the days that were signed for you. He responded: in any event, I have lived more than half and because we cannot know if the cutting off of the days was for guilt or not. However, we can know the cutting off of days when the person does not live for thirty five years, then it was because he was guilty of being cut off. However, cutting off of the days cannot be known. Therefore, our sages said: the Holy One shows the people when somebody is guilty of being cut off for his days. If he was an old man and died in three days from his illness, then he was guilty of having his days cut off. The <i>Jerusalem Talmud</i> writes. An old man who eats forbidden fat or <i>desecrates the Sabbath</i>, how does one become aware that he was guilty of having his days cut off? The explanation is that when he dies in one day, this is a death from the anger of the Holy One. If he dies in two days, this is a frightful death, a quick death. However, when he dies in three days, this is a death of being cut off. This is called cutting off of the body alone. Concerning it, the verse says, “<i>that man shall be cut off from among his people</i>” [Leviticus, 17:4]. That is to say, his body is cut off from among the people in the world. However, his soul immediately comes to the <i>Garden of Eden</i> in the <i>World to Come</i>, and will arise at the <i>resurrection of the dead.</i> The second cutting off is of the soul. This is when someone eats <i>leavened products on Passover</i> or he eats on <i>Yom Kippur</i>, he <i>works on Yom Kippur</i>, or commits <i>adultery.</i> His soul will not come into the <i>Garden of Eden</i> where the other souls are in the <i>World to Come.</i> Concerning this, the verse says, “<i>that person shall be cut off from before Me</i>” [Leviticus, 22:3]. However, his body is not cut off from the world. Sometimes, he lives quite long and it goes well for him with wealth and peace, but his soul will lose the <i>World to Come.</i> The third cutting off is for the body and the soul. When someone worships foreign gods, he reviles the Holy One, heaven forbid. Here it is written, “<i>that person shall be cut off</i>” [Numbers, 15:31], twice. That is, his body and soul will both be destroyed, the body from this world and the soul from the next world. Not that his soul will be destroyed in the next world, but it must spend a long time in Gehenna, in order to torment his soul. Afterwards, it will also have rest and will derive pleasure from the <i>treasures of charity</i> that are in the Garden of Eden. He cannot come to the proper place forever, where other souls come. Bahya writes that the soul has a very clear light, even in the womb, which shines on his head, as the Talmud says in [tractate <i>Nidah</i>], <i>chapter three.</i> The child has a light on its head in the womb and the child sees from one end of the world to the other end of the world. When the time comes for it to come out into the world, an angel comes and hits the child on its mouth. It immediately forgets all the Torah that it knew in the womb. The next day the angel leads it to the Garden of Eden and shows it the righteous, sitting with their crowns. The angel says to the child. Here sit those who were created in the world; you will also go there. They kept the Torah and the commandments of the Holy One. Therefore, they were worthy of this honor. Therefore, when you will be born, you should also study Torah and keep the commandments. Then you will be worthy of the honor. However, if you will not keep the Torah and commandments, you will sit somewhere else. When evening comes, the same angel leads the child and shows him Gehenna. The child sees how the evildoers are beaten and burned, and they shout, woe, woe. The angel says, these know that they did not keep the Torah and commandments. Therefore, they must suffer in Gehenna. Therefore, see and learn Torah so that you should not come to this disgrace. When the time comes that the child should be born, the angel comes and hits the child on its mouth and it forgets everything. Therefore, the child cries as soon as it is born, because it has been hit on its mouth. So writes the Midrash. Bahya writes that this teaches us that the person in the womb is still prepared to receive wisdom and intellect, but the angel makes it forget.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Leviticus, 18:29.</i>

Kedoshim

<i>King Solomon, of blessed memory</i>, said: “<i>Desire realized is sweet to the soul; to turn away from evil is abhorrent to the stupid</i>” [Proverbs, 13:19]. The verse teaches us that the person should not follow the desires of the heart. Each person who removes himself from the desires of his heart is compared to an angel. The one who does follow his desires, he is like an animal. We find that the Holy One created the world, before the sixth day when man was created; the creation of the fifth day had two parts. Some creatures were only intellect and wisdom; these are the angels in heaven. The other creatures on that day were only earth, without intellect, like the trees and vegetation, domestic and wild animals, birds, and fish. None of them have intellect. These two types of creation do not do their deeds of their own free will. They are obligated by their nature to do their deeds, for which they were created. The angel must do with intellect what he was created for, not from free will. The animals, trees, vegetation also do their deeds, not from their will, but their nature impels them to do what they must do; the deeds for which they were created. Nobody does anything to them to do their deeds. Therefore, the Holy One made a third creature that would have intellect like the angels and should also have a body like the animals. The person has the will to do anything, like the angels, who only have wisdom. He also has the power to do like the animals. Therefore, also when the person strengthens himself and does not go after his body, but follows his intellect, then he is like the angel. However, if he follows the desires of his body, then he is like the animal. So too, Adam, before he sinned was supposed to be like the angels who live forever. However, when he sinned, death was thrown over him and over the whole world like the animals. Therefore, each person should be warned that he should not go after his desires. Concerning this, King Solomon said in the verse with which we began, “<i>Desire realized.</i>” That is to say, the broken desires are very sweet for the body. However, the wise person should separate himself from “<i>turn away from evil is abhorrent to the stupid</i>” [Proverbs, 13:19]. That is to say, it is very despicable and difficult for the evildoers to remove themselves from the evil. They only have desires and it is known that the one who only follows his desires is like one who denies the whole Torah. The one who follows his desires is divided into four parts. The first is with his thoughts. He thinks day and night only about his desires and evil thoughts. The sin is just as bad as if he had committed the sin with his deeds. He makes his thoughts and intellect impure. The second one is that he has desires to speak <i>slander and obscenity.</i> The evil inclination had overtaken his desires at times, since there are four kinds of evil inclination. The first evil inclination is when he only sees a woman and he desires her. He has enough with this, but it incites the person to see her often. The second evil inclination is that he only speaks with that woman and he has desires for her. First, ordinary words and then he begins to speak obscenity with her. This makes him think that he has slept with her. The third evil inclination does not let the person rest; he must do the deed with that woman. Therefore, that person should be warned not to look at strange women and even more so not to speak to her. Scholars in particular should be warned that the evil inclination incites scholars when they speak with women. The Talmud says that the more important and pious the person, the more the evil inclination incites him. The evildoers have followed him for a long time and he does not need to exert himself to have them. The third desire is with eating and drinking. The person should abstain even from what is completely permitted. He should accustom himself to abstain. The fourth desire is with his body; he engages in illicit sex, following his desires. The Torah ordered that even with his wife he should not engage in to much sex, and even more so with strange women. Therefore, the Torah in this portion commands us.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Kedoshim, Introduction.</i>
“<i>You shall be holy</i>” [19:2]. You should separate yourselves and not follow the <i>desires of the body.</i> The one who separates from these desires, he is <i>holy</i>, a holy person before God. So we find explicitly in the Torah concerning the nazirite who separates himself from drinking wine. The <i>Torah</i> calls him <i>holy</i>, as the verse says concerning the nazirite, “<i>he will be holy</i>” [Numbers, 6:5].<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban, Leviticus, 19:2.</i>
“<i>You shall each revere his mother and father</i>” [19:3]. This means that the person should fear his mother and father. Here one asks a question. Why is mother written first here? Concerning <i>honoring father and mother</i>, that one should honor father and mother; father is written before the mother? The explanation is that one fears the father more than the mother. Therefore, the Torah wrote about fearing the mother first. That is to say, you should fear your mother as much as you fear your father. Concerning <i>honoring</i> his father and mother, it is known that the mother was honored more than the father. The mother gave the child many good things, with food and everything for the child in the house. Therefore, the child honors the mother more. Therefore, the Torah mentioned the father first. That is to say, you should honor your father as much as your mother.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Leviticus, 19:3.</i>
“<i>And keep my Sabbaths</i>” [19:3]. If your father and mother will tell you to do a forbidden act on the Sabbath, you should not do it, even if you will be guilty of not honoring your father and fearing your father. Yet, keep the Sabbath as I have commanded you.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Leviticus, 19:3.</i>
Bahya writes. “<i>You shall be holy</i>” [19:2]. It is written near it, “<i>the whole Israelite community</i>” [19:2]. This teaches us that the women are also obligated to keep themselves holy, just as the men are commanded. As a result, the verse says that men and women should keep themselves holy when they have sexual relations. Therefore, it says, “<i>you shall be holy, for I, the Lord</i>” [19:2]. That is to say, the Holy One is at the sexual union. When it is done in <i>holiness</i>, the Holy One gives the soul into the child. Father and mother add the body to it, since there are three who have a share in the child, the Holy One, mother and father. Therefore, the verse wrote here, “<i>you shall be holy, for I, the Lord</i>” [19:2]. You should keep yourselves holy because I am holy. I am at the sexual union of husband and wife, and you should also fear your mother and father. They are also those who brought you into the world. Therefore, he mentions the mother first before he mentions the father, since the primary holiness depends on the mother and her good thoughts. Near it is written, “<i>and keep my Sabbaths</i>” [19:3]. That is to say, there were some <i>scholars</i> who had sexual relations with their wives on the Sabbath. Therefore, the Torah wrote, “<i>do not turn to idols</i>” [19:4]. That is, you should not look at a strange woman, since when you look at her it is like you would turn to worshiping foreign gods. It is also written, “<i>or make molten gods for yourselves</i>” [19:4]. That is to say, you should not have any thoughts about another woman when you are having sexual relations with your wife.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Leviticus, 19:2.</i>
“<i>I, the Lord your God</i>” [19:4]. The Torah wrote this with regard to many commandments, since all the commandments are for God and the will of God is that one should fulfill the commandments, as the Talmud says. Whoever only studies Torah and does not fulfill the commandments, that person is one who has no God. Whoever does not fulfill the commandments, it soon happens that the <i>scholar</i> denies the Holy One because he does no <i>good deeds</i>, which are primary. Our sages said: study is not primary, but good deeds are primary.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Leviticus, 19:4.</i>
“<i>When you reap the harvest</i>” [19:9]. When you will harvest grain, wheat or barley you should allow the corners of the field stand with grain, expecting that the poor person will come and take it. Similarly, with vineyards you should not forget the poor person and leave wine for him. When the owner lets two ears fall in the field, he should not take them. He must leave them for the poor person. However, when three ears fall on the ground, then the poor person should not take it; it belongs to the landowner.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Leviticus, 19:9–10.</i>
“<i>You shall not steal</i>” [19:11]. The Talmud says in [tractate] <i>Baba Mezia.</i> One should not steal something from his friend in order to cause him anguish. That is to say, his thought is that he will return it, but he will cause him anguish for a while. This is a great sin, as the Talmud says, “<i>in order to irritate him.</i>” That is to say, his thought is to cause him anguish. Whoever steals, eventually lies and swears falsely and <i>desecrates the name of God</i>, <i>heaven forbid</i>, since one sin leads to another sin.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Leviticus, 19:11.</i>
“<i>You shall not swear by My name</i>” [19:12]. You should not swear by My name. Whichever name it is, it is from God.
“<i>You shall not defraud your fellow</i>” [19:13]. When your fellow works for you, pay him immediately and do not make him run after his pay the next day. You must pay him the same day that he earned it.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Leviticus, 19:13.</i>
“<i>Do not place a stumbling block before the blind</i>” [19:14]. When you see a blind person, you should not cause anything to fall in his path. Similarly when a friend comes to you and asks you for advice about whether he should buy some merchandise, you should give him proper advice. If you see that the merchandise is very cheap, you should not persuade him that it is very expensive, expecting that he will walk away and you will buy the same merchandise. Therefore it is written, “<i>you shall fear your Lord</i>” [19:14]. That is to say, you will remember who will be aware of this. Therefore, it is written, you should fear God, since He will punish you for this. He knows all the secrets of the person’s heart.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Leviticus, 19:14.</i>
“<i>You shall not let your cattle mate with a different kind</i>” [19:19]. You should not cause that an ox should mate with a donkey or the opposite. Similarly with all domestic or wild animals, you should not mate that which is not the same <i>species.</i> Bahya writes here. The reason is because the mixture is forbidden because the Holy One created each <i>species</i> separately, even the vegetation, each one separately. Each one has a separate constellation in heaven that pushes and causes them to grow. When the person makes an ox and donkey mate together, a new creature comes from them that is half ox and half donkey. He changes the creation of the Holy One and makes himself like the Holy One, who did not create such a <i>species</i>, as he made. That is to say, he wants to show more wisdom in creation. Similarly, all the vegetation and plants were each created the way they should be. The person who makes mixtures by sowing wheat or grain in one garden, he mixes the creation that the Holy One created. He also mixes up the world of the constellations in heaven. Each constellation has one species of animal and one of vegetation. Each <i>species</i> also has one constellation. When the person mixes the creatures on the earth, he also mixes up the constellations in heaven and causes war among the constellations.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Leviticus, 19:19.</i>
“<i>Do not favor the poor</i>” [19:15]. When a poor person comes before you with a communal leader for judgment, you will help the poor person. You will think that the communal leader is responsible to feed the poor person. You will then judge the poor person innocent and the communal leader guilty, expecting that the communal leader should support the poor person. You should not do this.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Leviticus, 19:15.</i>
“<i>Do not show deference to the rich</i>” [19:15]. You should not show deference to any communal leader. You will say, no communal leader should be embarrassed.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Leviticus, 19:15.</i>
“<i>Do not gossip</i>” [19:15]. Do not be a gossipmonger.
“<i>You shall not take vengeance or bear a grudge</i>” [19:18]. When a neighbor comes to you to borrow an ax or other item, you should lend it to him. You should not take revenge and remember that he did not want to lend you a cleaver, so you do not want to lend him a shovel. You should not do this. You should not say: I will lend you a shovel even though you did not want to lend me a cleaver. Therefore, it is written here, “<i>you shall not bear a grudge.</i>” You should not reproach him about how he did not want to lend to you.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Leviticus, 19:18.</i>
“<i>Love your fellow as yourself</i>” [19:18]. You should love your friend as yourself.
“<i>Three years it shall be forbidden to you</i>” [19:23]. When you plant a tree, you should not eat its fruit for three years and on the fourth year you should sanctify the fruit to the Holy One in the <i>Temple.</i> It is just that one should first give honor to the Holy One by bringing the first fruits to the Holy One. The majority of trees do not grow in three years. So too it is with people. Our sages said: a girl who is not three years and one day old, when someone removes her virginity, it can restore itself. However, after, three years, she is called a woman, like the tree that grows properly after three years. Also, the fruit that grows the first three years are not ready to be eaten by the person, because the sun has not properly heated up the tree. Therefore, the fruit is coarse and lacks moistness from the earth. The Midrash says: “<i>Three years it shall be forbidden to you.</i>” This teaches us about a child that cannot speak in three years and in the fourth year it is <i>sanctified</i>, it begins to speak. Mother and father give their blessings and praise to God. In the fifth year, he begins to learn.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Leviticus, 19:23.</i>
<i>Toldot Yizhak</i> writes. The <i>Torah portion of Kedoshim</i> teaches us all sorts of <i>holiness</i> that the person should observe. Purity with eating and drinking; not to eat and drink excessively. There are some people who must eat and drink little, because when they eat too much they become sick. There are old people who eat little and young people who eat much. There are also some young people who eat little and old people who eat much and are healthy. The Torah could not write about each person separately, how much they should eat or drink, since people are not similar in their body and digestive system. Who can write about what each person should eat? Who knows the <i>nature</i> of each person? Therefore, the Torah wrote, “<i>you shall be holy</i>” [19:2]. You should keep yourself holy with eating and drinking. If you want to know who can tell each person how much he should eat, therefore it is written nearby, “<i>you each shall revere his mother and his father</i>” [19:3]. That is to say, the mother and father can tell each child how much they should eat. The mother can see what it needs, a measure of beer or a measure of wine, and if it is healthy for them. The Torah wrote nearby in the portion, “<i>keep my Sabbaths</i>” [19:3]. That is to say, even on the Sabbath, one should not become accustomed to eat excessively, but in any event to honor and rejoice in the Sabbath, one may eat more than during the week. It is written here, “<i>do not turn to idols</i>” [19:4]. This teaches us that even though the astrologers and sorcerers say that one should not eat meat on the Sabbath and drink no wine, the <i>constellation of Saturn</i> [<i>Shabbtai</i>] comes and gives him <i>good fortune and success.</i> Therefore, the Torah commands that one should eat meat, drink wine, and wear beautiful clothes on the Sabbath. Do not turn to the idols and sorcerers, but keep the Sabbath the way I commanded you and you will have success. Therefore, also in the <i>Ten Statements</i> it is first written, to keep the Sabbath and nearby, “<i>honor your father and your mother</i>” [Exodus, 20:12]. That is to say, it is just to honor your father, how he inspires you regarding food, drink and Torah study, but in any event honor the Sabbath. Even if your father and mother inspired you to eat and drink little, but on the Sabbath you should eat and drink a little more than your father inspired you, expecting to honor and keep the Sabbath. That is to say, just as you were commanded to honor your father and mother, but honor the Sabbath more than your father. Your father and your mother are obligated to honor the Sabbath. Therefore, it is written nearby, “<i>honor your father and your mother</i>” [Exodus, 20:12], “<i>that you may long endure</i>” [Exodus, 20:12]. That is, when you will keep the commandment and honor your father and your mother and keep them provided with food and drink, you will live long. Many diseases come from excessive eating. He must die from that, and therefore the Torah commanded after <i>honor</i>, “<i>You shall not murder. You shall not commit adultery</i>” [Exodus, 20:13]. That is to say, when you will honor your father the way he taught you will not come to murder, like Absalom, who caused many Israelites to die and engaged in illicit sex with his father’s wives. This happened because his father agreed to everything that he desired. He also wanted to kill his father. “<i>You shall not steal</i>” [Exodus, 20:13]. Since he was used to eating and drinking like a glutton, he must steal when he cannot get something to eat. Therefore, the Torah wrote here, <i>his mother</i>, to fear his mother more than his father. The mother is the <i>primary one.</i> She can influence the child for good more than the father, as the mother of <i>King Solomon</i> did. She tied her son to a pillar and hit him and punished him. The Torah wrote, “<i>when you sacrifice an offering</i>” [19:5]. When you will bring sacrifices. Near it is written that we should leave grain at the edge of the field. That is to say, this teaches us that charity is compared to sacrifices. Therefore, it is written here, “<i>the wages of a laborer shall not remain with you until morning</i>” [19:13]. You should pay the one who works for you his wage before the next morning comes. When one does not do it, it is as if he stole it. Since it is customary among some people that when one asks them for money owed, they curse. Therefore, the Torah wrote here, “<i>do not curse</i>” [19:14]. Do not curse any person. It can happen that if the worker is not paid, that the worker might attack the householder. Therefore, it is written, “<i>do not place a stumbling block before the blind</i>” [19:14]. You should not cause that the worker would attack you. Therefore, pay him on time. You should do proper justice. Concerning this, it is written that you should not be a <i>gossipmonger.</i> That is, when the <i>judge rules</i> on something, the other <i>judge</i> says about the <i>judge</i> that he ruled badly concerning that householder. Gossip caused that the person is attacked because of gossip. Therefore, it is written, “<i>do not profit by the blood</i>” [19:16]. Do not cause blood to be shed. <sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Leviticus, 19:1–18.</i>
Our sages learn from here that one should not eat and that one must pray for his soul every morning. Therefore, it is written, “<i>you shall not eat anything with its blood</i>” [19:26]. That is to say, do not eat before you pray for your blood. That is to say, for your body.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Leviticus, 19:26.</i>
“<i>You shall not round off the side-growth on your head, or destroy the sidegrowth of your beard</i>” [19:27]. You shall not cut off the corners or the front with a cutting implement, since the Holy One gave a beard so that he should be different from a woman. That is to say, one should know what is a woman or what is a man. When a person cuts off his beard, he wants to change the creation of the Holy One who identified a man with a beard.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Leviticus, 19:27.</i>
“<i>You shall rise before the aged</i>” [19:32]. When you see an old person, you should stand up, even if he is an <i>ignoramus.</i> When a <i>scholar</i> goes before you, even if he is young and not old, you should stand up and honor him.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Leviticus, 19:32.</i>
Therefore, it is written here, “<i>you should fear the Holy One</i>” [19:32]. You should fear the Holy One. That is to say, if you will close your eyes and make yourself as if you do not see him coming, expecting that you will not have to stand for him. Therefore, it is written, fear the Holy One, who knows well what you thought, and He will not forgive you.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Leviticus, 19:32.</i>
“<i>Length, weight or capacity</i>” [19:35]. You should measure with a proper measure and weigh with proper weights and when you measure wine, mead, or beer, you should not make any foam, expecting that they should think that the measure is full, and afterwards it will recede. <i>Rabbi Levi</i> said: a false measure is more severe than <i>adultery.</i> When he had given his friend a false measure he cannot return it, and thus cannot repent for it. However, adultery, as long as no child was born from it, he can easily repent. However, a false measure, he cannot know what he measured falsely, thus he cannot return it and no repentance helps until he returns the theft.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Leviticus, 19:35.</i>
“<i>If a man commits adultery with a married woman, committing adultery with another man</i>’<i>s wife</i>” [20:10]. <i>Toldot Yizhak</i> asks a question. Why does the verse say twice, <i>a married woman</i> or <i>another man</i>’<i>s wife</i>, since it is all one? The explanation is that with a gentile woman, he is not <i>guilty of the death penalty</i>, if he engaged in adultery with a gentile woman who has a husband. Therefore, the verse must say specifically, with your friend’s wife you are guilty of the death penalty. Toldot Yizhak gives another explanation. It teaches us that Reuben slept with Simeon’s wife, and Simeon comes and sleeps with Reuben’s wife. I might say that Simeon is not culpable, because Reuben first slept with his wife. Therefore, Simeon may also sleep with Reuben’s wife. Therefore, the Torah wrote twice; that is to say, Simeon is also guilty of the death penalty.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Leviticus, 20:10. The names Reuben and Simeon have nothing to do with the biblical figures. Rather, these names are used in rabbinic literature when one wishes to speak generically about people. It is the equivalent of saying, person A and person B.</i>
“<i>You shall kill the beast</i>” [20:15]. When a person sleeps with an animal, the animal should also be killed, because some evil from the animal came over the person, it must also be put to death. People should not say that the animal committed a sin with a person. From here, we learn that though the animal has no intellect, yet because it brought evil upon the person and he has intellect. How much more so, when a person brings an evil upon his fellow, who does have an intellect, the Holy One will punish him.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Leviticus, 20:15.</i>
“<i>It is a disgrace</i>” [20:17]. When a person takes his sister as a wife, it is a great sin and he should be put to death. If you want to ask, did not <i>Cain</i> marry his sister? The answer was grace from the Holy One, expecting that the world could be built and people would come from them.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Leviticus, 20:17.</i>
“<i>It is indecency</i> [<i>nidah</i>]” [20:21]. The Torah wrote that when a person sleeps with his brother’s wife, it is as if he slept with a menstruating woman. Bahya writes. It says this because just like a menstruating woman, since how it is like a menstruating woman? When she become clean from her menstruation, then it is permitted to sleep with her. So too, there comes a time when one may marry his brother’s wife. He dies without children, then his brother must take her as a wife.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Leviticus, 20:21.</i>
“<i>I have set you apart from other peoples to be Mine</i>” [20:26]. The Holy One said: when you will separate from the nations, then you are My people. However, if you will not separate, you will be taken away into the hands of the nations. <i>Rabbi Eliezer the son of Azariah</i> said that a person should not say: it is disgusting to me to eat pork, but he should say, I would gladly eat pork, but the Holy One commanded me not to eat it and I want to keep His commandment. Therefore, the verse says here, “<i>to be Mine.</i>” You should separate yourself from the sins, for the sake of My name. That is, because I commanded it.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Leviticus, 20:26.</i>

Emor

<i>King Solomon</i> said: “<i>giving a straightforward reply is like giving a kiss</i>” [Proverbs, 24:26]. The wise person speaks good sweet words, which the people appreciate. They would gladly kiss him, and they smack their lips that he is speaking well. The verse also teaches us about a righteous person who is worthy to die with a kiss from the Holy One, like <i>Moses and Aaron</i> died. Concerning them, it is written, “<i>at the command of the Lord</i>” [Numbers, 33:38; Deuteronomy, 34:5].<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The verse literally means, “by the mouth of the Lord.” Numbers is Aaron, Deuteronomy is Moses.</i> That is to say, they died through the kiss of the Holy One; their soul left them. <i>Miriam</i> also died in the same way, but the Torah does not explicitly want to write explicitly, “<i>at the command of the Lord</i>” concerning the death of Miriam because she was a woman and it is not proper to write that she died through a kiss from the Holy One. <i>Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob</i> also died in the same way. <i>Rabbi Judah the Prince</i>, a rabbi in the Talmud also died in this way. That is to say, they all died without the <i>Angel of Death.</i> Rabbi Judah the Prince was very righteous; he had no pleasure from this world. The Jerusalem Talmud writes. When <i>Rabbi Judah the Prince died</i>, <i>Rabbi Yannai</i> announced, today the <i>priesthood</i> does not exist. That is to say, the <i>priests</i> may touch <i>Rabbi Judah</i>, since he is not impure like other corpses, because he died through the Holy One himself. The priests buried him. However, the priests should not touch other corpses. Therefore the verse says here:<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Emor, Introduction.</i> 
“<i>Speak to the priests</i>” [21:1]. Tell the priests that they should not touch any corpse. The children of the priests should not touch a corpse, even when they are small. One can ask a question. <i>Rabbi Yannai</i> told the priests that they could touch <i>Rabbi Judah the Prince</i>, even though he had died. There is a midrash in the <i>Zohar</i> that disagrees.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Most probably, Zohar, III:88b.</i> It says, as soon as the person dies, the <i>spirits of impurity</i> see that the soul of the person has gone to heaven and the Garden of Eden. The <i>spirits of impurity</i> unite with the body. They think that they will also come to heaven when they cleave to the dead body. Therefore a corpse is impure because of the impure spirits. This midrash also answers a question. Why, when a gentile or an animal die and are lying in a house, a priest may go into that house. When a Jew dies and lies in a house, then no priest can come into that house because there is a corpse in the house. The explanation is that the spirits of impurity only desire to cleave to the corpse of a Jew whose soul went to heaven. However, they do not cleave to the body of a gentile or animal. So, one may ask, since the spirits of impurity unite with a body whose soul has gone to heaven. The soul of <i>Rabbi Judah the Prince</i> certainly went to heaven. Why does the <i>Jerusalem Talmud</i> say that <i>Rabbi Yannai</i> announced that the priests may touch <i>Rabbi Judah the Prince</i> and to bury him? The spirits of impurity would certainly cleave to the body of <i>Rabbi Judah the Prince</i> and make him impure. The explanation is that <i>Rabbi Judah the Prince</i> was called “Rabbi” in the Talmud because he taught Torah to all of Israel. Thus, he was called “Rabbi” and when he died, he had taught the whole world Torah and they always recited Torah that they had learned from him. Through this, the lips of <i>Rabbi Judah the Prince</i> speak in the grave, as the verse says, “<i>O that I might dwell in Your tent forever</i>” [Psalms, 61:5]. Here the Talmud asks a question. How is it possible that <i>King David</i> said that he would live in two worlds at one time? The explanation is that <i>King David</i> said, let people say <i>words of Torah</i> for my sake after my death and it will be as if I would live in two worlds because the lips of my mouth speak in the grave when people will say words of Torah for my sake after my death, as the verse says, “<i>gliding over the lips of sleepers</i>” [Song of Songs, 7:10]. This means, the lips of the <i>scholars</i> speak in the grave.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Yevamot</i>, 96b-97a.</i> Thus, this explains the question about how could Rabbi Yannai announce that <i>Rabbi Judah the Prince</i> is not impure, since the spirits see that the lips of <i>Rabbi Judah the Prince</i> speak in the grave. They think that because Rabbi Judah is speaking with his lips, the soul must still be in him, since the soul speaks by every person. Therefore, the spirits of impurity do not cleave to Rabbi Judah the Prince. They think that he is still teaching.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">This is most likely an original interpretation.</i>
Therefore, the verse says two times, “<i>speak and say</i>” [21:1]. When there is no person to bury a corpse, then the priest should go and bury him, but a male priest should not touch him. However, a daughter of a priest may touch it because the women brought death into the world. Thus, it is just that every woman should help bury the dead, even daughters of priests. The section of the priests is written near the section about magic, “<i>a ghost or familiar spirit</i>” [20:27], that is previously in <i>Kedoshim.</i> This teaches us that you Israelites do not need to ask what will happen through magic. You have priests who will tell you what you need.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Leviticus, 21:1.</i>
“<i>Except for the relatives</i>” [21:2]. However, a priest may become impure for his wife. He can bury her and similarly, a priest may become impure for his mother and father, his son and daughter, his brother and sister who have not married. The priest may become impure for his relatives, but he should not go to the <i>cemetery</i> among other graves after he has buried his father and wants to visit the graves. However, when he carries the corpse to the grave he is allowed to go among other graves. However, he can be in a house where his dead relatives are in the house. Bahya and <i>Toldot Yizhak</i> ask. “<i>To his mother and father he should become impure</i>” [21:2]. He should become impure to his mother and father. Why does the verse say mother first, before the father? <i>Rabbi Abraham</i> said because more women die quickly than the men. He first mentions the mother regarding death, since the mother dies first. However, one can ask a question. Why did the Torah write the father first before the mother in connection with the high priest, that he should not become impure for them? The high priest was not supposed to become impure even for his mother and father. The explanation is that it says the mother first regarding an ordinary priest. That is to say, to his mother he can certainly become impure, because she is certainly his mother, with good testimony that his mother had given birth to him. However, his father is not certain to us if he is his true father, yet he may become impure to his father. Therefore, it says the mother first; he may certainly become impure to her. Concerning the high priest, the Torah first mentions the father. That is, it is obvious that he should not become impure to his father since he does not know with certainty if he is his father. However, to the mother the high priest should be able to become impure to her, since we know with certainty who is his mother. Therefore, the Torah says that even to your mother you should not become impure.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Leviticus, 21:2; Toldot Yizhak, Leviticus, 21:2–3.</i>
“<i>They shall not smooth</i>” [21:5]. The priest should not tear out his hair because a child or father and mother died. If he wanted to tear his flesh, he should not do this. Toldot Yizhak writes. The priest and other Israelites are compared to a high and important minister for the king. It is not right that such a lover should have scratches or torn hair. Similarly, if another person had torn out his hair or scratched him, this is a disgrace for the king that they did not fear him, and tore out the hair of his lover. The other explanation is that one should not scratch oneself or tear out his hair, since the one tears out his hair or tears out his flesh, people will say that the Holy One did not do justly that he had killed his children. This is a <i>desecration of God</i>’<i>s name.</i> Therefore, our sages said, the person who cries excessively over a corpse, the Holy One will punish him. He will have another corpse to cry over. The third is that the person who cries greatly over a corpse, this is like he will lose hope in the next world. Therefore, he cries greatly, and this is a desecration of God’s name. The fourth is that the high priest always stands in the Tabernacle and before the table of the Holy One. It is not just that a servant of the king should have torn out his hair and scratched his face.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Leviticus, 21:5–6.</i>
“<i>The priest who is exalted above his fellows</i>” [21:10]. The high priest must keep himself much holier than the <i>ordinary priest.</i> He should not become impure to any corpse, not even father and mother. He should not marry a widow or <i>divorcee</i>, but only a virgin. The reason that he should not marry a <i>widow or divorcee</i> is that he will accustom the virgin to sleeping with him as is appropriate for a high priest. He must maintain his holiness with his wife and the way he accustoms the virgin; she will accept it. However, when he marries a widow or divorcee who are used to sleeping with their first husband all the time, and she will touch the high priest to sleep with her all the time, which will lead the high priest to commit a sin. “<i>The priest who is exalted above his fellows</i>” [21:10]. He should be more important than the other priests in five ways. He must be a handsome man. He must also be strong, wealthy, wise, and have honor. When he is not wealthy, his brothers make him wealthy.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Leviticus, 21:10.</i>
“<i>A man who has a defect</i>” [21:18]. When a priest has a defect, he is blind, limps, or has another defect; he should not do the service in the Tabernacle. That priest may eat the <i>terumah</i> and the meat of the offerings, but he cannot do the service. It is the same if he was born with the defect or the defect happened after birth, he should not do the service. Similarly, if he has become impure, he should also not do the service.
“<i>No lay person shall eat of the sacred donations</i>” [22:10]. Someone who is not a priest should not eat the <i>terumah</i>, but the slave of a priest, even a Canaanite one, may eat the <i>terumah.</i> When a priest’s daughter marries an ordinary Israelite, she should no longer eat the <i>terumah.</i> If the Israelite husband dies and she has no children, she may return to her father and may eat the <i>terumah.</i> If an Israelite or a Levite ate <i>terumah</i>, he has to pay the priest the same amount of grain and must add a fifth to the amount of <i>terumah.</i>
“<i>You shall not offer any that has a defect</i>” [22:20]. When an animal has a defect, then one should not bring it as a sacrifice.
“<i>When an ox or a sheep or a goat is born</i>” [22:27]. The Midrash says that they took an ox as a sacrifice, expecting that it should <i>atone</i> for the Golden Calf, which was an ox. Therefore, gold was brought to the Tabernacle first, among the things that were brought, as the verse says, “<i>gold, silver and copper</i>” [Exodus, 25:3]. Gold is mentioned first, expecting it to atone for the gold that they made the Golden Calf with. <i>Rabbi Levi</i> gave a parable. A <i>bad rumor</i> was spread about the wife of the king that she was engaging in illicit sexual relations. The king asked and investigated if it was true. He found that it was false. The king made a banquet and seated the wife who had been suspected at the front at the banquet to show that the <i>rumors were false.</i> So too, the Holy One became aware that the Israelites did not make the Golden Calf, but the <i>mixed multitude</i>, who had <i>converted</i> in Egypt. Therefore, the Holy One placed the ox first as a sacrifice in the portion. Why did the Torah take an ox, a sheep and a goat as a sacrifice? Our sages say, an ox is for Abraham, as the verse says, “<i>Abraham ran to the herd, took a calf</i>” [Genesis, 18:7]. He took an ox for the three angels. He thought that they were people, and honored them with the ox. A sheep is for Isaac. A sheep was brought as a sacrifice in his place, when he was supposed to have been slaughtered on the altar. A goat is for Jacob. His mother said to him; so that Isaac should bless him, bring me two goats. I will prepare them for Isaac to eat. Another explanation for an ox, a sheep and a goat is that the wild animals chase them all. That is to say, they run from the wild animals because they are not strong. They are lowly. Therefore, the Holy One took them as sacrifices, since the Holy One loves those who hold themselves lowly.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Leviticus, 22:27.</i>
“<i>These are the set times of the Lord, which you shall celebrate each at its appointed time</i>” [23:4]. The <i>holidays</i> that are given over into the hands of Israel, that they should establish when the holidays should be observed. The <i>prophet Ezekiel</i> wanted to establish when the <i>holidays</i> should be observed <i>outside the land of Israel.</i> The Holy One said: you should not do it outside the land; it is only in the <i>land of Israel.</i> From here our sages learned that even very righteous people and very wise people <i>outside the land of Israel</i> could not establish when the <i>holidays</i> should be observed. Ordinary people in the <i>land of Israel</i> were allowed to establish when the holidays were observed, according to their understanding. This is how they establish the holidays. A Torah scroll was brought and the rabbis gathered around it. Each one sat according to his <i>importance.</i> That is to say, the most important one sat in front. They looked down, stood up and raised their hands to heaven. The <i>head of the academy</i> mentioned the <i>Divine Name</i> with his mouth and a <i>voice</i> came down from heaven. When the generation was sinful, no <i>voice</i> was heard. Happy is the <i>generation</i> that heard the voice, as the verse says, “<i>Happy is the people who know the joyful shout; O Lord, they walk in the light of Your presence</i>” [Psalms, 89:16]. The elders gathered in the Temple and shouted, <i>it is sanctified</i> – <i>it is sanctified.</i> That is, the days have become holy. Then the Holy One also assembled an <i>angelic Sanhedrin</i> in heaven. They also sanctified the same days that Israel had established. The Holy One sat on His throne and had His <i>books</i> and His <i>Sanhedrin</i> brought before Him, and said: We will judge the world, as the verse says, “<i>for it is a law for Israel</i>” [Psalms, 81:5]. That is to say, Israel has commanded to make the <i>New Year</i> on that day. “<i>A ruling of the God of Jacob</i>” [Psalms, 81:5]. Therefore, it is a ruling of the God of Jacob.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Leviticus, 23:4.</i>
“<i>But the tenth day of the month</i>” [23:27]. However, the tenth day of the <i>month</i> of <i>Tishrei</i> will be the <i>conclusion</i> of the <i>Day of Judgment.</i> The Midrash says that the word “<i>But</i>” [<i>ach</i>] shows us that <i>Yom Kippur</i> forgives the sins of those who repent. However, those who do not repent will not have expiation on <i>Yom Kippur.</i> That is to say, one should not rely on, because it is written, “<i>expiation is made on your behalf</i>” [23:28], that <i>Yom Kippur</i> will atone, even for those who will not repent.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Leviticus, 23:27.</i>
“<i>On the first day you shall take</i>” [23:40]. You should take an <i>etrog</i> and <i>lulav</i> [palm branches], <i>myrtle</i>, and <i>willows</i> on the fifteenth day of <i>Tishrei</i>, because these four species grow near the water. We pray for rain during these days. One should take an <i>etrog</i>, a <i>lulav</i>, three <i>myrtle branches</i>, and two <i>willow</i> branches. “<i>Palm branches</i>” [23:40]. Bahya asks why is it written, <i>palm branches</i>, and it is not written <i>palm branch.</i> This also means a palm tree. The explanation is that the trees are <i>male and female.</i> This is how they are planted and when one does not have both <i>male and female</i>, they cannot grow. Therefore, the verse says, “<i>palm branches</i>” concerning the <i>lulav</i> to show that both <i>male and female</i> trees are appropriate. The Midrash says, “<i>the product of the hadar tree</i>” [23:40], refers to Abraham who showed that there is one God in the world, just like the <i>etrog</i> was one. Therefore, it is written, <i>tree.</i> Just like wood or a tree that is without water withers and does not grow, but when it is given water it grows again. So too was Abraham. At first he could not have children, but at the age of one hundred, he again had the strength and had children, his son Isaac. “<i>Hadar</i>” [23:40]. That is to say, the Holy One beautified and adorned Abraham with old age. Before Abraham, one did not know who was the father and who was the son. Then Abraham came and prayed that the Holy One should make white and gray hair for an old person, expecting that one should be able to know who is the son and who is the father. Abraham was the first person to have white and gray hair in his beard and this is the beauty of the old. “<i>Branches of palm trees</i>” [23:40]. This refers to Isaac who was bound to be slaughtered. Branches [<i>kapot</i>] means to bind and palm trees means a smoke. That is to say, just like smoke and steam rose from the altar where Isaac lay bound. “<i>Boughs of leafy trees</i>” [23:40]. This is the <i>myrtle</i>, which refers to Jacob. Just as a <i>myrtle</i> has many leaves growing around it, so too Jacob was surrounded with children, like a <i>myrtle.</i> “<i>Willows of the brook</i>” [23:40]. The <i>willows</i> refer to Joseph. Just as a willow grow as quickly as a tree when they have water, so too was Joseph. He was shriveled because of many troubles that he was thrown into a pit and was sold. He was a <i>king in Egypt</i> with great honor. However, when his father died, he also became as if he was withered. He and his brothers also died. This is like the <i>willow</i> that withers quickly. That is, the Midrash teaches us that we should pray and remember the merits of our ancestors. Thus, our prayers will be accepted. The Midrash compares the etrog to the heart of the person. It is known that many commandments and sins depend on the good thoughts or evil thoughts of the heart. If he committed a sin with his heart, he has expiation with his taking the etrog, which is like the heart, and will continue to <i>repent.</i> The <i>lulav</i> is like the <i>spine</i> to which the person’s ribs are attached, since the leaves are attached to the <i>lulav</i> like the person’s ribs. It has the essence of the person’s life. Why is this? In the person’s <i>spine</i> there is a bone that is like a tube and liquid flows from the <i>brain</i> through this tube and the intellect and wisdom to fulfill commandments or commit sins depends on the brain. The <i>myrtle</i> is like the eyes of the person. The primary commandments and sins depend on the eyes. The <i>willow</i> is like the lips of the mouth and many commandments and sins depend on the speech of the mouth. Therefore, the person should take the four species to atone for the person’s four organs. Each sin has an expiation that relates to it. So we find with <i>King Herod</i> who was killing tens of thousands of Israelites. Afterwards, he had regret and said to <i>Rabbi Simeon ben Shetach</i>, with what can I atone for this sin? The responded to him, if you will build the Temple, you will again illumine the world through this building. Thus, you will have expiation, since you have extinguished the light with the killing of Israelites who illumined through Torah and commandments. Therefore, build the <i>Temple</i> and again illumine the world. The Midrash also writes, “<i>products of the hadar tree</i>” [23:40]. The <i>etrog</i> has two qualities, it has a good aroma and it is good to eat. “<i>Branches of palm trees</i>” [23:40]. The <i>lulav</i> is from a date palm that is good to eat, but has no aroma. “<i>Boughs of leafy trees</i>” [23:40]. The myrtle has an aroma and is not edible. “<i>Willows of the brook</i>” [23:40]. The willow has no aroma and is also inedible. Therefore, the <i>etrog</i> refers to the righteous who have two qualities, Torah and <i>good deeds.</i> The <i>lulav</i> refers to those who have Torah, but do not have <i>good deeds</i>, like the <i>lulav</i> that has only one quality. One only eats its dates, but it does not have an aroma. The myrtle refers to those Israelites who have <i>good deeds</i>, but no Torah. <i>Willows,</i> refers to those who have no <i>Torah</i> and no <i>good deeds.</i> Thus, the Holy One said: you should take the four species together that I should forgive your sins. The same is with the incense. There are only good aromas among the good incenses and He also ordered them to take devil’s dung, which has an evil smell, to allude to the evildoers who have done evil deeds. Thus, the Holy One commanded that the evildoers should also be included in our prayers and <i>repentance.</i> Thus, the Holy One will quickly forgive our sins. The Midrash also says that the <i>etrog</i> refers to the <i>Babylonian exile.</i> This is because it is written about the <i>kingdom of Babylon</i>, “<i>You are the head of gold</i>” [Daniel, 2:38]. This means, a golden head was by the image. The <i>etrog</i> shines like the gold. The lulav is long and refers to the <i>exile of Ahasuerus</i>, that <i>Haman</i> was hanged on a tall gallows. The myrtle refers to the <i>exile of Greece.</i> How is it a myrtle? It is intertwined and so too is <i>Greece</i> and its kingdom. The willows are red and refer to <i>Edom</i>, who was born red. That is to say, the Holy One said: because of the merit of these four species you will be protected from these four exiles. Bahya writes. The <i>etrog</i> alludes to the reward in this world, since there are many commandments that one eats its reward from one year to the next year, like the <i>etrog</i> that remains whole on its tree from year to year. The <i>lulav</i> alludes to the <i>reward in the world to come</i>, since the <i>lulav</i> has leaves where one leaf is higher than the other leaf. So it is in the <i>world to come</i>, lower and higher levels, one is higher and more important than the other one. In this way he is given a good seat in the <i>world to come.</i> Similarly, the <i>fruit</i> of a <i>date palm</i> only grows after seventy years. So too, the <i>world to come</i> is only after seventy years. That is to say, the person lives for seventy years and when he dies he comes to the <i>world to come.</i> The <i>myrtle</i> is bitter. This teaches us that he cannot come to the <i>reward</i> of the <i>world to come</i> any other way. He must make his body bitter with <i>fasts</i> and other pain and allow himself to be whipped, <i>the thirty-nine lashes.</i> The <i>willow</i> shows that repentance is what will let him come to the <i>world to come.</i> He must hold himself humble like the willow which only grows in valleys and do not grow on mountains. Similarly, the person should hold himself humble and lowly. This also why we take the <i>etrog</i> in the left hand, which points to the reward of this world. The <i>lulav</i>, <i>myrtle</i>, and <i>willow</i> are taken in the right hand. They show him that with <i>repentance</i> one comes to the <i>world to come.</i> Thus, it is appropriate to take it in the right hand, as the verse says, “<i>In her right hand is length of days, in her left, riches and honor</i>” [Proverbs, 3:16]. That is to say, the one who learns for the <i>sake of heaven</i>, he will come to the <i>world to come</i>, and he will have long life. However, the one who studies Torah so that he should have wealth, the Holy One gives him the <i>wealth</i>, but no long life. This is the meaning of the verse, in the left hand. That is. He does not properly study for the sake of heaven; he will only have <i>wealth</i> and <i>honor.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Leviticus, 23:40.</i>
“<i>I made the Israelite people live in booths</i>” [23:43]. Some sages say that the Israelites also made <i>booths</i> in the wilderness in the way that we make them, out of wood and covered with tree branches. Therefore, we make them in the way that they made them to show the sign that the Holy One had shown to Israel in the wilderness. If you will ask, where did the Israelites get trees in the desert where they do not grow? The explanation is that merchants from foreign lands brought the Israelites everything they needed. Some sages say that the booths were clouds over Israel, and a cloud for each of the four sides.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Leviticus, 23:43.</i>
“<i>There came out among the Israelites one whose mother was Israelite</i>” [24:10]. A man went out, who was the son of an <i>Israelite woman</i>, from his house and went among the Israelites and he argued. Our sages say that he went out from the previous Torah portion. He was mocking the above passage that they prepared the bread on the table in the Tabernacle, from one Sabbath to the next Sabbath. He said: how is it that a king should eat bread that is many days old, and he mocked. This was the son of the Egyptian that Moses had killed in Egypt. Another Israelite man told him that Moses had killed his father, and told him how Moses had killed him. That is to say, Moses had killed him with the <i>Name</i> of the Holy One. Therefore, the Egyptians son cursed the <i>Name</i> of the Holy One, because his father had been killed through that Name. He did not want to come in the Tabernacle for judgment, so he was brought. Bahya asks a question here. Why does the Torah have to tell us that he cursed? The Torah should have written briefly what the law is when a person curses, and that each person should be warned about this. The explanation is that the Torah teaches us two things. The first thing the Torah wants to show us that nobody dares to curse, but only a person who came from an evil father and mother. Therefore, he was evil and cursed the Holy One. The second is that the man first spelled out the <i>Name</i> with its four <i>letters.</i> Afterwards, he cursed, as the verse says, “<i>the son of the Israelite woman pronounced</i>” [24:11]. This means that he deliberately spelled out the Name and afterwards he cursed. From here we should learn that in our prayers when a person mentions the <i>Divine Name</i> he should have in his thoughts the four letters of the Name. Thus, the Holy One will pay him a good reward and his prayers will be heard when he places the Name on his heart and in his thoughts. Afterwards, he says the <i>Name</i> with his mouth.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Leviticus, 24:10.</i>
“<i>His mother</i>’<i>s name</i>” [24:11]. His mother’s name was <i>Shelomit.</i> Bahya writes that whoever is <i>insolent</i> to people, one should look at his mother. The verse does not mention his mother’s name, but before the sin it mentions the son’s name. That is to say, his mother caused that her son committed the sin. The child’s deeds come more from the mother than the father. The child comes from the mother’s blood and grows in her belly. When it is born, it nurses with the mother’s milk. Therefore, the child takes after the mother and her deeds. Similarly, when the child does good deeds, they also come from the mother. Therefore, it is written, “<i>Amram took to wife his father</i>’<i>s sister</i>” [Exodus, 6:20]. Amram married Yocheved. Therefore, he had Moses, Aaron and Miriam with her, good children. The verse tells us that no woman was licentious except for this one, and she was insolent. She said hello to and spoke with every man. That is why her name was Shelomit. That is, she said <i>hello</i> [<i>shalom aleichem</i>] to everyone, and spoke with every man. That is to say, she said <i>shalom aleichem</i> to everyone. “<i>Of the tribe of Dan</i>” [24:11]. The evildoer brought shame on his family, and on his father and mother. Therefore, the verse says from which tribe he came. Similarly, a righteous person brings positive praise on his family and on his father and mother.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Leviticus, 24:11.</i>
“<i>If he has pronounced the Name, he shall be put to death</i>” [24:16]. It is written near it, “<i>if anyone kills any human being</i>” [24:17]. That is, when someone kills his fellow it is like he, <i>heaven forbid</i>, killed the <i>Holy One.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Leviticus, 24:16.</i>
“<i>Let all who were within hearing lay their hands</i>” [24:14]. The witnesses should place their hands on the one who curses. The witnesses must publicly say how he cursed the Name and how he cursed with it, they commit a sin. Therefore, they placed their hands on his head. That is, the sin should be on your head that we have to explicitly mention the <i>Name.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Leviticus, 24:14.</i>

Behar

<i>King Solomon, of blessed memory</i>, said. “<i>The heart of the righteous man rehearses his answer, but the mouth of the wicked blurts out evil things</i>” [Proverbs, 15:28]. The righteous one only speaks humble and soft words. The evildoer only speaks arrogant and haughty words. The speech of the person shows the thoughts of his heart for good or for evil. It is known that humility is the best attribute among all attributes. The Shekhinah only rests on someone who holds himself humble, as the verse says, “<i>I dwell on high in holiness; yet with the contrite and the lowly in spirit</i>” [Isaiah, 57:15]. The Torah does not remain with someone who holds himself haughty, as the verse says, “<i>ho, all who are thirsty, come for water</i>” [Isaiah, 55:1]. Just like water runs to the lowest place on the earth in a valley, so we also find that the Holy One rests on a humble lowly mountain. This is <i>Mount Sinai</i>, which is a low mountain, and He left all the high mountains and gave the Torah on Mount <i>Sinai.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Behar, Introduction.</i>
Therefore, it is written, “<i>the land shall observe a Sabbath of the Lord</i>” [25:1–2]. The land shall rest, so that one should not work it on the seventh year, which is the <i>sabbatical year.</i> One should not plow and one should not sow. One should not cut that which grows by itself. Similarly, he should not dig and cut his vineyard during the <i>sabbatical year.</i> He should let himself think that he is not the master over anything; everything should be free. With this is shown that the person should not hold himself haughty with regard to his field or his garden. He should think that it all belongs to the Holy One. All the <i>wealth</i> belongs to the Holy One alone.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Leviticus, 25:2.</i>
“<i>Seven weeks of years</i>” [25:8]. You should count seven <i>sabbatical years</i>, one after another, every seven years. This is forty-nine years, since seven times seven is forty-nine. Make the fiftieth year holy and blow the ram’s horn and free all your male and female slaves. They should no longer serve you from the jubilee onward. When someone bought a field long ago and when the jubilee comes, he must return the field to the one he bought it from. On Yom Kippur they would blow the ram’s horn so that they should know that it is the jubilee.
“<i>When you sell your property to your neighbor</i>” [25:14]. When you have merchandise for sale, sell it to an Israelite rather than to a gentile. Similarly, when you want to buy something, buy it from an Israelite and not from a gentile.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Leviticus, 25:14.</i>
“<i>You shall not wrong</i>” [25:14]. You should not lie to or deceive your friend when you sell him a field. Know how many years it is until the jubilee. When many years remain, then you may sell it for more money. Calculate with him how much grain he will eat from that field. Bahya writes. Why is this section written near the <i>section on the sabbatical year?</i> It teaches us to be warned to keep the sabbatical years and the jubilee. However, if he will not keep it, God will send him poverty. He will have to sell his utensils and his clothes. However, if he will repent, then God forgives him and gives him everything back. If he continues to be evil then God causes that he must sell his field. If he is not pious, he must go begging for bread in all the doors, as a beggar. If he continues to be evil, God causes that he has to sell himself. If he continues to be impious, then he must sell himself to a gentile who worships foreign gods. So the Midrash says and so it happened. Israel did not keep the sabbatical year properly and they were sold to the gentiles.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Leviticus, 25:14.</i>
“<i>Do not wrong one another</i>” [25:17]. One should not fool or anger his friend with words, to make him cry. One should not give him bad advice. Since the destruction of the Temple, the gates of prayer were closed. However, the gate of tears that one sheds, this gate is open in heaven, and the Holy One accepts his prayers. When one fools someone and provokes him, his heart is very sick and mournful and prays with tears and worry, his prayer is accepted before God. Therefore, the Holy One will punish because of his prayer that he asks that God take vengeance on you because of his tears and his being fooled.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Leviticus, 25:17.</i>
“<i>Should you ask, what are we to eat</i>” [25:20]? If you will say, where will we eat in the eighth year because we have not sown in the seventh year? Therefore, the Holy One says, I will give my blessing in the sixth year that you should have enough to eat. You will eat from it for three years, the sixth year, the seventh year and the eighth year. You will sow again in the eighth year and you will eat from the old grain until the ninth year.
“<i>If your kinsman is in straits</i>” [25:25]. When your friend is poor and he sells a field. From here our sages learn that no person should quickly sell a field, unless he has great need and poverty. Then he should sell the field. “<i>From his holdings</i>” [25:25]. This teaches <i>proper behavior.</i> You should not sell it all, but leave a piece of the field for yourself. “<i>His nearest redeemer shall come</i>” [25:25]. When you have sold a field, the Torah ordered, out of mercy, that it should again be given to be redeemed when he has money. However, he must leave it for two years with the purchaser. If he does not have money to redeem it himself, then one of his relatives may redeem the field. If he has no relative to redeem the field for him, then he must wait until the jubilee. Then it will return to its original owner without money.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Leviticus, 25:25.</i>

“<i>Fear your God</i>” [25:36]. The Torah wrote that you should fear the Holy One. That is to say, there are many who say that the money is the gentile’s money and he is allowed to charge interest.

Bahya writes that this portion shows us about four exiles and the redemption, and the redemption depends on repentance. When we do not repent, he comes in any event when it is time for him to come. The portion teaches us that we will have no servitude in those days, but we will serve the Holy One. It is shown in the portion that the Holy One will bring all the nations to account that they have tormented Israel in the exile. Therefore, the portion alludes to four exiles. The last exile is called “<i>offshoot</i>” [25:47], because the Holy One will uproot them. Near it is written, “<i>he shall have the right of redemption, even after he had given himself over</i>” [25:48]. This alludes to our exile, which is long and far. Therefore, the verse says, “<i>one of his kinsmen shall redeem him</i>” [25:48]. This is the <i>Messiah of David</i>, who comes from the <i>tribe of Judah</i>, the most distinguished tribe of Israel. “<i>One of his kinsmen</i>” teaches us that the Messiah will be our brother. That is to say, born from human beings, from a father and a mother, like Moses, who was the redeemer from the exile of Egypt, the verse informs us, in contrast to the nations who say that the Messiah will not be a human being. They also say that he came a long time ago. “<i>If he prospers, he may redeem himself</i>” [25:49]. This teaches us that with repentance the Messiah comes soon. Therefore, he says that he redeemed with silver. That is to say, just like silver is white, so is repentance. It purifies and makes the body white and makes the sins white. “<i>He shall compute with his purchaser</i>” [25:50]. The Holy One will make an accounting with all the nations that have caused great troubles to Israel. “<i>From the year he gave himself over</i>” [25:50]. From the time that the nations began the exile until the jubilee, this is the redemption when Israel will be free of the exile. Therefore, the redemption is also called jubilee. This means that all the nations will bring presents to the Messiah, since jubilee [<i>yovel</i>] means to carry. It also shows that the nations will lead Israel on the best roads and decorated roads to Jerusalem. With this, they will be as if they had brought a present, when they lead Israel with honor to Jerusalem to the Messiah. “<i>If he has not been redeemed in any of those ways</i>” [25:54]. When the redemption will not come through repentance. “<i>Shall go free in the jubilee year</i>” [25:54]. They will, in any event, the redemption will come without repentance. That is to say, it will not tarry longer than the time that was established, as the verse says, “<i>I the Lord will speed it in due time</i>” [Isaiah 60:22]. That is to say, if they will repent then I will speed the Messiah. However, if they will not repent then the Messiah will come, in any event, in the appropriate time that the Holy One established. “<i>He and his children with him</i>” [25:54]. The Holy One will gather all of Israel who are dispersed in all the lands. “<i>For it is to Me that the Israelites are servants</i>” [25:55]. Israel will be the servants of the Holy One. “<i>Whom I freed from the land of Egypt</i>” [25:55]. He compares the final redemption to the <i>redemption from Egypt</i>, with miracles and wonders, as He did in Egypt and in the wilderness.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Leviticus, 25:47.</i>
“<i>He shall compute with his purchaser</i>” [25:50]. When an Israelite was sold to a gentile and wants to free himself, he should give the gentile a proper accounting of how many years he had been sold. You should not do any falsehood, similarly with a gentile who is in Israelite hands in the land of Israel. One should also not steal from a gentile, as this is a <i>desecration of God</i>’<i>s name.</i> If he errs and makes a mistake by himself, this is permitted. However, if he makes a mistake and wants to commit a falsehood, this is a desecration of God’s name. When someone returned what the gentile had mistaken, this is a proper sanctification of God’s name, who will repay him double in return. Therefore, Jacob ordered his children to return the silver that they found in their grain, even though the Egyptians were worshipers of foreign gods. Furthermore, Jacob ordered them to return it, for the sanctification of God’s name. The Talmud says that it is a greater sin to do a falsehood to a gentile than to his friend, an Israelite. The gentile would, heaven forbid, speak evil about the Holy One. He will say that just as they are false, so to their religion is also false, heaven forbid. Therefore, <i>King Solomon</i> also prayed when the he built the <i>Temple.</i> He said, <i>Lord of the Universe</i>, when a gentile will pray in the <i>Temple</i>, accept his prayer so that he will not speak evil about your <i>faith.</i> When the gentiles do not receive what they want, they speak evil and blaspheme. However, an Israelite takes everything for good and waits. When the kinsmen redeem him, they must free him so that they should not say that he must serve us.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Leviticus, 25:50.</i>
“<i>You shall not make idols for yourselves</i>” [26:1]. You shall not make idols and images of angels to worship them. If you will make an <i>image</i> or a decorated stone to bow to it, therefore the verse here warns about idols. He wants to teach us that when an Israelite was sold to a gentile, the Israelite might say, since my master serves foreign gods, I will also do like my master. Or, since my master <i>desecrates the Sabbath</i> I will also <i>desecrate the Sabbath.</i> Therefore, the Torah wrote near the sale of an Israelite that he should not do as his master does concerning worshiping foreign gods and observing the Sabbath.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Leviticus, 26:1.</i>
“<i>I am the Lord</i>” [26:2]. I am God, who can reward you well if you keep My commandments and punish those who do not keep my commandments.

Bechukotai

<i>King Solomon, of blessed memory</i>, said, “<i>the ornament of the wise is their wealth; the stupidity of dullards is stupidity</i>” [Proverbs, 14:24]. The verse teaches us that the sages who are worthy of wealth, it is a crown to them. For the evildoers, wealth is an evil thing. It makes them stumble in all things. When a wise man is wealthy, then the people hear his words and they listen to him. When he is in poverty, his words are not heard, even when he says very wise things, they are considered as nothing, as the verse says, “<i>a poor man</i>’<i>s wisdom is scorned</i>” [Ecclesiastes, 9:16]. The wisdom of a poor man is shamed and ignored. He can also apply the wealth to the fulfillment of commandments. However, for the evildoer the wealth is foolishness and a stumbling block. He gives no charity and is very arrogant. He does not speak with the people and as a result they hate him. They separate from him and always consider him insignificant, since he does not want to do any good, to lend money to a person even for a pledge and this gives him a bad <i>name.</i> If he is poor then his words are as nothing. When he is an evildoer and has done evil deeds, they ignore him. However, through the money that he has, the poor person speaks of him and tells of his deeds. They even add many evil deeds that he had not done. They curse his business and his merchandise, and they rejoice at his downfall. Therefore, the Torah also always writes that one should fulfill the commandments. It tells us near this that He wants to give grain, plentiful rain, and health for the body, as a reward. Even though the Torah and commandments were not given for people to eat and drink for enjoyment, but the Torah says that it will give food and drink, expecting that one should be able to study Torah and fulfill commandments, so that on should come to the world to come through this.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Behukotai, Introduction.</i>
Therefore, the portion began with, “<i>If you follow My laws</i>” [26:3]. When you will be pious and keep My commandments, I will give rain in its time, to eat enough bread.
“<i>I will grant peace in the land</i>” [26:6]. Our sages say, that if the person will say, what good is the bread if there is no peace, therefore the verse says, I will give peace.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Leviticus, 26:6.</i>
“<i>Five of you shall give chase to a hundred and a hundred of shall give chase to ten thousand</i>” [26:8]. Five Israelites will pursue a hundred gentiles and a hundred will pursue ten thousand. Here one asks a question, why will one hundred pursue ten thousand, when five will only pursue one hundred gentiles. The calculation is that one hundred Israelites should pursue two thousand gentiles. The explanation is that it is not the same when many Israelites are together. Their merit is much greater than when a few are together. That is to say, the Holy One hears the prayers of many people more quickly than that of a few people. Even if the five are more pious than a hundred men, yet it is better when many Israelites are together. Therefore, each one of the hundred kills more than the number that are killed by the five men.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Leviticus, 26:8.</i>
“<i>I will look with favor upon you</i>” [26:9]. The Holy One promises that He will cleave to Israel. He means with this, the <i>world to come.</i> Therefore, He also says, “<i>I will be ever present in your midst</i>” [26:12]. That is to say, in the <i>world to come</i> the Holy One will visit and stroll with the righteous in the <i>Garden of Eden.</i> The portion showed that first He will give us food in this world so that we will be able to study in order to be able to come through that to the <i>world to come.</i> The whole portion shows that the Holy One will cleave to us in the day of the Messiah.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Leviticus, 26:9.</i>
“<i>I made you walk erect</i>” [26:13]. When the Messiah will come, the Holy One will rebuild the <i>Temple</i> twice the height of <i>Adam</i> and the people will also be so tall. The portion begins with the letter <i>Aleph</i> and ends with a <i>Tav.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The first and last letters of the Hebrew alphabet.</i> That is to say, when Israel will keep the Torah from the <i>Aleph</i> to the <i>Tav</i>, the blessings will come upon Israel. The Torah talks about the curses nearby. They will happen if Israel transgresses the commandments. They begin with a <i>Vav</i> and end with a <i>Heh.</i> These are two letters of the name of the <i>Holy One.</i> This teaches us that the Holy One is in exile with us and will redeem us from the curses. The Midrash says that one should not say that the blessings are few <i>verses</i> and the curses are many <i>verses.</i> Therefore, he began the blessing with the <i>Aleph</i> and ended with the <i>Tav.</i> That is, the blessings will be long lasting, as far as from the <i>Aleph</i> to the <i>Tav.</i> However, he began the curses with the <i>Vav</i> and ended with the <i>Heh.</i> That is, the two letters are close to each other. So too, the curses will not last long.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Leviticus, 26:13.</i>
<i>Toldot Yizhak</i> writes. “<i>If you will follow My statutes</i>” [26:3]. That is, you should keep the commandments, even those that have no reason. Why should we keep them? Only because the Holy One commanded them. Afterwards, it says, “<i>keep My commandments</i>” [26:3]. You should also keep the commandments that do have <i>reasons.</i> Another explanation why he said, “<i>keep My commandments</i>,” is that you should wait to fulfill the commandment, and do not allow the commandment to wait for you, and be fresh with each commandment. Therefore, the verse says, “<i>keep My commandments.</i>” That is to say, first you should wait for the commandment. Afterwards, it says, “<i>fulfill them</i>” [26:3]. That is to say, wait and when the time comes, you should fulfill the commandment. This explains why it says, “<i>keep</i>” and also says, “<i>observe.</i>” It could have just said, “<i>keep</i>” alone and deleted “<i>observe them.</i>” <i>Toldot Yizhak</i> gives an explanation. The Torah says that five will pursue a hundred and a hundred will pursue ten thousand. The calculation is not correct; a hundred should only pursue two thousand. The explanation is that when Israel wage war, it is just that there should be as many Israelites as gentiles. Then the Holy One comes with His <i>miracles and wonders</i> and causes that five Israelites will pursue one hundred gentiles. When they have won the war, the hearts of the gentiles have fallen, then one hundred will pursue ten thousand. Therefore, the verse says, “<i>Make you fertile</i>” [26:9]. I will increase you greatly. The portion teaches us that there are four groups among Israel. Some who work and plow the earth to grow grain. Concerning them, the verse says, “<i>I will grant your rains</i>” [26:4]. I will give rain and the blessing to these. There are some people who desire much money. They do not plow and desire that there should be no wars. They desire peace. Concerning them, the verse says, “<i>I will grant peace</i>” [26:6]. They will have peace from wars. On the other hand, there are people who desire war. Concerning them, the verse says, “<i>five of you shall give chase to a hundred</i>” [26:8]. Five will pursue a hundred. On the other hand, there are some Israelites who do not desire war or plowing and not wealth. Rather, they desire to study Torah and fulfill the commandments. Concerning this, the Torah says, “<i>I will establish My abode in your midst</i>” [29:11]. “<i>I will be ever present in your midst</i>” [29:12]. That is to say, the Shekhinah is among Israel because of Torah and commandments, to those who desire to cleave to Me.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Leviticus, 26:3–12.</i>
Toldot Yizhak asks a question. Why does the verse concerning the curses have to be so long? “<i>If you will not listen to Me and will not observe</i>” [26:14]. We know well that if he will not listen to God’s commandments, then he will certainly not observe them. The explanation is that when a people in a land do not want to keep the laws of the king, this has four causes. The first is that the king will not oversee them because the king has too many problems of his own. The second is that the people sometimes think that the king’s laws are foolish. Good sense does not indicate that they should be kept. The third is that the king makes too many laws with heavy taxes and wars. Therefore, they do not follow his laws. The fourth is that the people sometimes want to rebel against the king. Therefore, the verse began, “<i>if you will not listen to Me</i>” [26:14]. That is to say, you will not listen to Me for My sake. You think that I have no oversight over you. Therefore, you do not keep My laws. Against this He says, “<i>if you reject My laws</i>” [26:15]. These are the commandments that we do not know why the Holy One commanded them. Our intellect cannot understand them. That is to say, just like the people do not want to keep the laws of the king. They think the king is a fool since he makes such laws. With regard to the third, the people do not want to keep the laws of the king because he makes too many of them. About this the verse says, “<i>spurn My rule so that you will not observe them</i>” [26:15]. That is to say, you do not want to fulfill My commandments because they are so many. It is disgusting to you because of that. Concerning the fourth, it says here, “<i>you break My covenant</i>” [26:15]. You want to abrogate My commandments and want to rebel against Me. Therefore it is written in the portion, <i>measure for measure</i> about your sin. Concerning the first, that you say that I have no <i>oversight</i> over everything, the verse says, “<i>I will wreak misery upon you</i>” [26:16]. I will have My oversight over you, and will bring a fear over you. I will show that I have oversight over everything. You say that I have too much to send, with wars, as is with the kings. Therefore, I am sometimes in a hurry and frightened. Therefore, I do not have supervision over everything. Therefore, the verse says, I will bring <i>misery</i> quickly and hurriedly upon you. Concerning the second, that the people hate the laws, because they are without sense or wisdom. Therefore, it is disgusting to you. This comes from arrogance, that the person holds himself important. He does not want to hear what he is commanded, since he is too important. Therefore, the verse says, “<i>I will break your proud glory</i>” [26:19]. I will make you lowly and your sky will darken like iron. That is to say, no rain will fall, even if the sky will be full of clouds. The clouds will not return to you and will give no rain. They will ignore you because you said that He has no supervision over everything. The third, that the commandments are to numerous, and therefore it is disgusting to you. Concerning this, the verse says, “<i>I will loose wild beasts against you</i>” [26:22]. The wild animals will make you fewer because you said that there are too many commandments. You did not want to keep them. Therefore, you will become fewer in number, since you did not desire many of My commandments. So too, I do not desire many of you. Concerning the fourth, that you will rebel and remove the commandments from yourselves. Thus, I want to force you and capture you, so that you will have to be in My hands. You will not be able to run away. Concerning this, the verse says here, “<i>I will bring a sword against you</i>” [26:25]. I will send nations against you who will kill you with the sword. If you will want to run to the fortified cities to hide from the nations, and to be protected from the sword. However, I will send the <i>plague</i> into the cities. This is air from which people die. You will want to flee the city, as is the custom. You will not be able to flee because of the sword and you will be captured in My hands. “<i>When I break your staff of bread</i>” [26:26]. I will break your bread from the oven. That is to say, the bread will crumble into pieces, just like you broke the covenant that you swore to uphold.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Leviticus, 26:14–15.</i>
“<i>If you remain hostile toward Me</i>” [26:21]. When the Holy One gives a person wealth, he should think that the Holy One did this, and should not say that this happened accidentally. He should say that this is a grace from the Holy One, and should not say that it is because of his <i>merit and good deeds.</i> Similarly, when a person has troubles, he should recognize his sins. If he will attribute it to happenstance and accident, then the Holy One will send him more troubles like these upon him.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Leviticus, 26:21.</i>
“<i>Ten women shall bake</i>” [26:26]. Ten women will bake in one oven and the bread will not be baked. He says ten women because when the verse wants to speak about many women it talks about ten. Similarly, the Torah says seven all the time when it wants to talk about many, as the verse says, “<i>seven times the righteous man falls and gets up</i>” [Proverbs, 24:16]. The righteous one falls seven times, yet God helps him to stand up again. It is also written, “<i>he bowed low to the ground seven times</i>” [Genesis, 33:3].<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Leviticus, 26:26.</i>
“<i>So that your enemies shall be appalled by it</i>” [26:32]. The verse teaches us that the nations cannot remain in the <i>land of Israel.</i> Israel will console themselves in the exile when they see that no king or <i>nobleman</i> builds a castle or a fortified city in all of the land of Israel. If they sometimes desire to build, they cannot accomplish this, and the land is not desirable to them.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Leviticus, 26:32.</i>
“<i>They shall stumble over one another</i>” [26:37]. Our sages say that each Israelite is responsible for his friend. That is, if his friend commits a sin, his friends must suffer for him and sometimes all of Israel are punished for the sin of one Israelite. Therefore, Israel is compared to a pile of nuts. When someone wants to take a nut, then all of them roll away. So too are Israel, when someone commits a sin, the <i>Holy O</i>ne punishes the other Israelites because of that sin.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Leviticus, 26:37.</i>
“<i>Then I will remember My covenant with Jacob; I will also remember My covenant with Isaac</i>” [26:42]. The verse places Jacob first, even though he was the youngest of the Patriarchs. The explanation is that the merit of Jacob, the youngest one, was enough to rescue Israel. If You, Holy One, do not have enough with Jacob, then the added merit of Isaac should be enough. If you want to say that it is not enough, then add Abraham. The Torah wrote, “<i>Then I will remember</i>” concerning Jacob, concerning Abraham it did not write, “<i>Then I will remember</i>,” and also concerning Isaac that he allowed himself to be bound upon the altar in order to be slaughtered. This is itself a reminder before the Holy One. Jacob is written here with a <i>vav.</i> We find that Jacob is written five times with a <i>vav.</i> On the other hand, we find that <i>Elijah</i> is written five times without a <i>vav.</i> This teaches us that Elijah gave his <i>vav</i> to Jacob as a pledge to Jacob. He should come to tell us the good news when the Messiah will come to redeem Israel. The <i>vav</i> is written like a finger and this teaches us that it is specifically five times that the <i>vav</i> went to Jacob. That is to say, the hand has five fingers. This showed that he gave him a <i>handshake</i> with his whole hand that he will come and promise that the Messiah would come, since Elijah the prophet must come one day before the Messiah.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Leviticus, 26:42.</i>
“<i>Yet, even this</i>” [26:44]. The verse teaches us that even though Israel will be in exile, yet they will hold on to the Torah, which is called “<i>this.</i>” That is to say, the Holy One will do lovingkindness with Israel that they will be able to study Torah. The nations will spoil everything for them. The Midrash says, what is left for Israel? They lost everything, but the Torah is the little among them to protect them in the exile.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Leviticus, 26:44.</i>
“<i>The equivalent for a human being</i>” [27:2]. When a person says that he will give as much as he is worth to the <i>Temple</i>, then they should estimate how old his is. A man from twenty to sixty years old should give fifty weight of silver. When a woman says that she will give what she is worth, according to her age. She should give thirty weight of silver, since she is cheaper than a man. From sixty years on a man should give fifteen weight of silver, and a woman who becomes older than sixty years and older should give ten weight of silver, since when a woman gets older and is sixty years old, she is almost as valuable as a man. Therefore, she does not give much less than a man. The proverb says, an old man in the house is a war in the house. A good old woman in the house is good fortune in the house, and is a good sign in the house. Toldot Yizhak writes. How does the portion attach the curses when Israel will be evil to when a person says that he wants to give want he is worth? The explanation is that when one sees troubles and is protected from them, he should make a promise to give charity and make a vow that the Holy One rescued him. It is known that four sorts of evil come from the curses that were mentioned above. The first is when he says, I will disperse you among the nations so Israel would think that the Holy One will exchange them and will take another nation for himself, to be His beloved people. Therefore, the first portion said, “<i>one may not exchange or substitute</i>” [27:10]. That is, the Holy One will not exchange Israel for any other nation, even if they will be better than Israel. The second evil that is written above in the portion of the <i>curses</i>, that Israel will serve foreign gods in the exile. Concerning this, the Torah here said the portion of giving tithes. This points to the Holy One, who is holy. Therefore, it says in the portion about tithes, “<i>he must not look out for good as against bad</i>” [27:33]. That is to say, the person should always praise God, whether He gives him good or, heaven forbid, gives him much bad. The third evil of the curses is Israel will remember the land. Israel will always remain, heaven forbid, in the hands of the <i>Ishmaelites.</i> Concerning this, the portion said, “<i>in the jubilee year the land will revert to him</i>” [27:24]. That is to say, when the redemption will come, the land will again be in the hands of Israel. The fourth evil is that Israel will say, because we are exiled in the hands and lands of the gentiles. They are much more important than Israel. Therefore, the portion of “<i>and he spoke</i>” near the counting of Israel. When one counts something, it must be important. Our sages said that Israel are compared to a barn with wheat. When the owner comes in, he counts how many measures of wheat he will have. He does not count the straw, because it is not important. So too, the Holy One counts Israel, and He does not count the nations. Israel are compared to stars that are counted every day. So we should be worthy to also shine like the stars in heaven, <i>amen.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Leviticus, 27:1–2, 9–10, 16, 32–33.</i>

Bamidbar

<i>King Solomon, of blessed memory</i>, said, “<i>honest scales and balances are the Lord</i>’<i>s; all the weights in the bag are His work</i>” [Proverbs, 16:11]. That is to say, the Holy One has all sorts of weights for his judgments, from large to small. That is to say, the Holy One judges each person properly, just like someone properly weighs his merchandise. So too, the Holy One properly weighs each person’s sins. If it is large, then he is given a big punishment. If it is small, then he gets a small punishment, according to its weight. The deeds of the Holy One are hidden and no person understands them, as the verse says, “<i>Your justice is like the great deep</i>” [Psalms, 36:7]. Your justice is hidden, just like the person does not know what is in the abyss. We find that Jerusalem was destroyed on the ninth day of the month. The Holy One had shown the <i>prophet Ezekiel</i> that it would be destroyed on the tenth day, since the Holy One did not want to reveal when it would be destroyed. However, the Holy One had wanted to have His Shekhinah rest over Israel, he said, in which city, and on which day? He said, in the wilderness, in one day in the month, in the month of Iyyar, in the second year since the exodus from Egypt. Therefore it says here.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Bamidbar, Introduction.</i>
“<i>In the wilderness of Sinai, in the Tent of Meeting, in the second month, in the second year following the exodus from Egypt</i>” [1:1]. The Midrash writes that the Torah was given with three things. With fire, that is to say, there was fire and lightning when the Torah was given. The second is with water, since there was great rain when the Torah was given. The third is that the Torah was given in the wilderness. Therefore, the Torah was given with these three things. This shows us that water, fire, and wilderness were given in the world for free. So too, the Torah was given for free. Each one may take it. Just as the wilderness is free, so too the person must make himself free, that is to say, lowly. “<i>In the Tent of Meeting.</i>” The Shekhinah rested on Mount Sinai at first. Afterwards, the Holy One caused the Shekhinah to rest in the <i>Tent of Meeting.</i> Just as the Holy One said about Mount Sinai that they should not touch it with their hands, so too with the Tabernacle the Holy One placed the Levites around the Tabernacle to guard that so no Israelite should touch the Tabernacle. Just as twenty-two thousand angels came with the Holy One to Mount Sinai, so there were twenty-two thousand Levites around the Tabernacle. Previously, the Holy One appeared openly in a field on a thorn bush, in Egypt, in Midian, and publicly on Mount Sinai. The Holy One said, it stands well, without modesty. Therefore, let the Holy One make the Tabernacle and He will appear privately. <i>Rabbi Joshua ben Levi said:</i> If the nations of the world would know how good the Temple is for them, the nations of the world would surround the Temple and would guard it. The Temple was better for the nations of the world than for Israel. When King Solomon built the Temple, he prayed to God and said: <i>Lord of the Universe</i>, when a gentile will come to the Temple and will desire something, give him what he desires, expecting that whatever the person prays for, he is given in the Temple whatever he prays for. Since if a gentile would pray and he would not be answered, he will say that the Temple is nothing. Therefore, respond to each gentile, even if he is not worthy of response. Not only is the Temple good for the nations, even Israel are good for the nations of the world. If Israel would not exist, then there would be no rain and the sun and moon would not shine, as the verse says, “<i>As surely as I have established My covenant with day and night, I will not reject</i>” [Jeremiah, 33:25]. If not for the Torah and commandments that Israel has, heaven and earth would disappear. So writes <i>Bahya.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Numbers, 1:1.</i>
<i>Bahya</i> further writes and also <i>Toldot Yizhak.</i> Why is the <i>portion of Bamidbar</i>, which talks about the number of Israelites, written near the <i>portion of Behukotai</i>, which talks about not exchanging a good animal for a bad animal for the sacrifices? This teaches us that He is the only one in all the <i>worlds</i>, and is never exchanged, as the verse says, “<i>there is no holy one like the Lord, truly, there is none better besides You</i>” [I Samuel, 2:2]. Similarly, the Holy One will not exchange Israel for any other nation. The Midrash writes. The Holy One said: to no nation have I given a number of how many of them there are. However, to you Israel, I have given a number of how many there are. It is a parable. A king has a barn full of straw. He does not count how much straw he has. Then he has another barn with wheat. He says to his chief assistant, count how much wheat is in the barn. This parable shows the king as the Holy One and the barn is His Israel, as the verse says, “<i>My threshing, the product of my threshing floor</i>” [Isaiah, 21:10]. That is, Israel is compared to a barn, and is compared to a holy grain, as the verse says, “<i>Israel was holy to the Lord, the first fruits of His harvest</i>” [Jeremiah, 2:3]. The Holy One said to <i>Moses Our Teacher</i>, who is the overseer of the Holy One’s house, as the verse says, “<i>he is trusted throughout My household</i>” [Numbers, 12:7]. Moses counts how many Israelites there are. The <i>nations of the world</i> are compared to straw, as the verse says, “<i>let them become like straw in the wind</i>” [Job, 21:18]. They will be like straw in the wind.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Numbers, 1:1; Toldot Yizhak, Numbers, 1:1–4.</i>
Rashi writes. Because He loves Israel very much, He counts them all the time. First, He counted them when they went out of Egypt. When they sinned at the Golden Calf, many Israelites were killed, and the Holy One had them counted again, to let them know how many of them remained. When the Holy One caused the Shekhinah to rest on them, He counted them again.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 1:1.</i>
<i>Toldot Yizhak</i> writes. What did the counting show? It is know that there are three types of love. The first is that a son loves his father and a man loves his wife. This is <i>natural</i> for the person, that he loves his father, his wife and children. The second is, a king loves his people very much and gives them proper justice, and protects them from war. The third is, the people love the king, honor him, and serve him faithfully. The counting of Israel was according to these three ways. The first was when Israel went out of Egypt, they were counted. They were called, “<i>Israel is My first-born son</i>” [Exodus, 4:22]. That is, the Holy One loves Israel like a father loves his son. The second love is when someone loves someone else because he is pious and good. Therefore, they were killed at the Golden Calf and they repented. There was only the <i>tribe of Levi</i> with <i>Moses Our Teacher</i> killing all those who worshiped the Golden Calf and the children of those people did not fight. There were another six hundred thousand men and children and they did not lift a hand against Moses or against the tribe of Levi. Therefore, the Torah wrote the story of the Golden Calf. It wanted to tell us that Israel repented for the sin. One should not say that the Holy One considered this evil, but the Holy One loves the repentance. Therefore, He had them counted at the Golden Calf. The third love is of the king to his people. Therefore, the Holy One had them counted when He wanted to have His Shekhinah rest in the Tabernacle. He counted them out of love.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Numbers, 1:1–4.</i>
<i>Toldot Yizhak</i> writes further. What is the connection of love to counting? The explanation is because each Israelite would be counted by the mouths of the <i>prophets Moses and Aaron.</i> Through this, they would be remembered for good before the Holy One. They did not count the men in groups. Each man walked before Moses and Aaron. If they would have counted each one of them by hand, ether and plague come, heaven forbid, when they counted the people in this way. If you want to say that each one gave a silver coin that is called the <i>half shekel</i>, and they counted the silver coins, then Israel would not be counted by the mouth of the <i>prophets Moses and Aaron.</i> Therefore, the explanation is that each Israelite wrote his name and Moses, Aaron and the leaders of Israel counted the written names. Thus, they were counted by the mouths of the prophets, and no ether and plague harmed them. They counted themselves; each man wrote down his own name. The second reason the Holy One had them counted, so that they should be prepared to go to war in the land of Israel. The third was that the Holy One had them counted because the nations said that the Israelites were all bastards. The Egyptians slept with the wives of the Israelites. Therefore, they gave their pedigree by family.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Numbers, 1:5–19.</i>
<i>Ramban</i> and <i>Bahya</i> write. “<i>Take a census</i>” [1:2]. Count each clan, and the verse says, “<i>count.</i>” This has two meanings; the first is for good. That is to say, “<i>count</i>” means to elevate and make Israel important when they will be pious. The other “<i>count</i>” means to take off the head, when Israel will, heaven forbid, be evil.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban, Numbers, 1:3; Bahya, Numbers, 1:2.</i>
“<i>From the age of twenty years</i>” [1:3]. Nobody should be counted if they are not twenty years old. The one who is twenty years old, he is strong to go to war. “<i>Who go to the army</i>” [1:3]. They should count each one who is <i>appropriate</i> to go and they should not count the <i>proselytes</i> and the same is with the <i>mixed multitude</i>; those who came from Egypt and followed Israel out of Egypt. Similarly, the one who was old also do not count, or the one who is sick, also do not count. “<i>Record them</i>” [1:3]. Bahya asks a question here. Why does the verse say, “<i>record</i>” and does not say, “<i>count</i>”? The explanation is, they did not count them by their clan, since the ether and plague come, heaven forbid, when they count the people. However, they counted each man who gave a silver coin that was called the <i>half shekel,</i> and through the coin they learned how many men there were in Israel. “Record” also means to count. That is to say, they were counted through the coin.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Numbers, 1:3.</i>
<i>Baal ha-Turim</i> asks a question. Aaron helped here by the counting, and above in the <i>portion of Ki Tisa</i> Aaron is not mentioned. The explanation is, above in the <i>portion of Ki Tisa</i>, the count was after the Golden Calf. Therefore, because Aaron made the Golden Calf, therefore Aaron did not count with Moses at the Golden Calf.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Baal ha-Turim, Numbers, 1:3.</i>
“<i>From the sons of Joseph, from Ephraim</i>” [1:10]. Bahya writes. Why did the verse not count the <i>tribal leaders</i> with Moses, in their <i>order?</i> Joseph was very young compared to the other tribes. The verse writes Joseph before other tribes in the counting. The explanation is that the verse first writes the children of Leah, who was Jacob’s proper wife. Then it writes about the children of Rachel, who were born afterwards. The verse counts Ephraim before Menashe, even though Menashe was the oldest. The verse does this because Jacob made Ephraim more important than Menashe. Therefore, the verse also places him first. Everything the verse does is for the <i>honor of Rachel.</i> Afterwards the verse lists <i>Dan, Asher, Gad, and Naphtali.</i> They were all older than Joseph. The verse does this to show that Joseph was from Rachel who was Jacob’s beloved wife. Therefore, the verse counts him first. However, <i>Dan and Gad</i> came from the <i>maids, Bilhah and Zilpah.</i> The one whose pedigree is greater goes first.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Numbers, 1:10.</i>
Ramban asks a question. <i>King David</i> counted the people of Israel and many died because of that counting. Did not David see the verse that one should not count, as the verse says, “<i>that no plague may come upon them through their being enrolled</i>” [Exodus, 30:12]? That is to say, the Holy One had commanded to take a silver coin, to count Israel with the silver coin, expecting that they should not die because of the counting. The explanation is, <i>King David</i> also counted with silver coins, but they died because David counted them. He wanted to know how many Israelites were under him, and not for the purpose of war. Rather, he wanted to rejoice in his <i>leadership</i> of a multitude. Another explanation by Ramban. They died because David commanded that they count all those over thirteen years old, but the Torah writes that those over twenty years old should be counted and not younger. David was mistaken in this, since it is not explicitly forbidden in the Torah that one must only count from twenty years old and not younger.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban, Numbers, 1:3.</i>
“<i>On the first day of the second month they convoked the whole community</i>” [1:18]. The verse shows us that Moses was very quick to fulfill the Holy One’s commands, and he gathered all of Israel in the same day that God had told him to count them. However, there were many Israelites and they could not all be counted in one day. Therefore, the verse says, “<i>he recorded them in the wilderness of Sinai</i>” [1:19]. That is to say, they were not counted in one day, but the counting finished on the next day in the <i>wilderness of Sinai.</i> So write <i>Ramban</i> and <i>Bahya.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban, Numbers, 1:18; Bahya, Numbers, 1:18.</i>
“<i>Who were registered by the clans of their ancestral houses</i>” [1:18]. That is to say, they brought their letters of <i>pedigree</i> and showed in which tribe they were born. So writes Rashi.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 1:18.</i>
<i>Ramban</i> asks a question about <i>Rashi.</i> How is it that each person had to bring his letter of pedigree from which tribe he was? Therefore, Ramban says, the meaning is that each one brought a silver coin, <i>a half shekel</i>, and gave it to Moses and said from which family and tribe he was. Moses counted the coins of each tribe separately. This is how they knew how many men each tribe had.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban, Numbers, 1:18.</i>
Bahya and Ramban write. “<i>Who were registered</i>” means, they showed when each one was born, expecting that they should know when he is twenty years old.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban, Numbers, 1:18; Bahya, Numbers, 1:18.</i>
“<i>Do not on any account enroll the tribe of Levi</i>” [1:49]. They were told not to count the tribe of <i>Levi</i> because they were important. Thus, they should be counted separately. They were the servants of the Holy One. Another explanation is that they were not counted with the Israelites, since all those who died in the wilderness were those who were counted and were twenty years old. The Levites did not err at the Golden Calf. Therefore, they remained alive in the wilderness. The Levites were counted when they were a month old, since the Levites were holy as soon as they were born. Therefore, they were counted when they were a month old.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 1:49.</i>
Ibn Shuaib writes. The Talmud says that the <i>tribe of Levi</i> was accustomed to be counted when they were born, since <i>Yocheved</i>, the mother of <i>Moses Our Teacher</i>, was born between the gates. When Jacob and his children came to the streets of Egypt, Yocheved was born. The verse counts her among the children of Jacob. That is, with Yocheved there were seventy souls. She was counted as an adult when she was still a child. Therefore, the <i>tribe of Levi</i> is counted from one month old. Moses said to the Holy One. Should I go into each house and see how many children the Levites have in their beds? The Holy One responded to Moses. You do yours and I will do mine. Moses placed himself at the door of the Tabernacle and the Holy One said to Moses. There are so many children and souls with this man, and Moses wrote it down. Therefore, the verse says, “<i>so Moses recorded them at the command of the Lord</i>” [3:16]. That is, Moses counted them through the word of the Holy One. So writes <i>Ibn Shuaib.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Ibn Shuaib, <i>Derashot</i>, II: 315.</i>
The Levites carried the Tabernacle when they traveled in the wilderness. When they stopped to rest, the Levites erected the Tabernacle and they rested near the Tabernacle.
“<i>Each with his standard, under the banners</i>” [2:2]. Rashi writes. Each tribe had a banner with a silk cloth. The color of the silk was the color of its precious stone that each tribe had on the breastplate. The same was on the garment that the high priest wore when he did the service in the Tabernacle. That garment had precious stones for each tribe. Each precious stone had its own color, and the banner was that color. Thus, each person could tell from a distance, his tribe with his banner. Another explanation of “<i>banner</i>” means that the tribes rested around the Tabernacle the same way that Jacob had commanded them to carry him out of Egypt to be buried. Jacob had said how they should go. <i>Judah, Issachar, and Zebulon</i> should carry in the east. <i>Reuben, Simeon, and Gad</i> to the west. In this way he arranged all of the children, each in his place. So too, the Holy One told them to carry the Tabernacle, and the Ark with the Tablets.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 2:2.</i>
Hizkuni and Zeror ha-Mor write that on the banner was written the names of <i>Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.</i> The first banner, that of <i>Reuben</i> had three <i>letters</i>, an <i>aleph</i> that alluded to Abraham, a <i>yud</i> that alluded to Isaac, and a <i>yud</i> that alluded to Jacob. On the second banner was written three other letters that alluded to the second three letters of <i>Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob</i>, a <i>bet</i>, a <i>zadi</i>, and an <i>ayin.</i> On the third banner there were three other letters. They alluded to the third letter of <i>Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob</i>, a <i>resh</i>, a <i>het</i>, and a <i>kuf.</i> The fourth banner alluded to the fourth letters of <i>Abraham, Isaac and Jacob</i>, a <i>mem</i>, a <i>kuf</i>, and a <i>bet.</i> A <i>heh</i> was deleted, since Abraham has five letters. The cloud over Israel was shaped like the letter <i>heh</i> and it was the <i>heh</i> of Abraham. So writes Hizkuni.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Zeror ha-Mor, Numbers, 2:2; Hizkuni, Numbers, 2:2.</i>
Bahya writes. Moses Our Teacher was afraid of how the tribes would march, that each one would want to go first. The Holy One said, let them go the way that Jacob told them to carry his coffin. Thus, there will be no arguments between them.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Numbers, 2:2.</i>
Further, Bahya, Ramban, Toldot Yizhak, and Ibn Shuaib write. On the banner of Reuben there was the image of a man. This alluded to Reuben who brought the mandrakes from the field, which are in the image of a person. On the banner of Judah was the image of a lion, since Judah was compared to a strong lion. On the banner of Ephraim was the image of an ox, since Joseph was called “<i>a firstling bull</i>” [Deuteronomy, 33:17]. On the banner of Dan there was an eagle. Judah, Zebulon, and Issachar were on the east, because Judah is compared to a lion. Therefore, he goes first to the east. Issachar was learned, full of Torah and good deeds. Therefore, they were together. Zebulon dealt with merchandise and supported Issachar, and Issachar would share the reward of Torah in the world to come. Ibn Shuaib writes a story here. There were two friends who made an agreement. One of them would deal with merchandise and the other one would study Torah. They would split the profit from the Torah and the business. The time came that the scholar died. His friend went and said to the one who died, who remembers how we decided to divide the profit from his Torah. The scholar shook his head. That is to say, he wanted to divide the reward from his Torah study in the next world. The first banner was related to the angels <i>Gabriel, Uriel and Shemaiel.</i> They were around the Throne of Glory. The second banner of the tribe of Reuben was in the south, since Reuben was a penitent who had repented for his sins. He was the first one who began who began to rescue the people. He rescued Joseph from death when the brothers wanted to kill him. Dew, good rain, and good winds, which people desire and enjoy, come from the <i>south. Simeon</i> was with <i>Reuben</i> and also <i>Gad</i>, who was a strong man. This shows that one who wants to repent must strengthen himself against the evil inclination, as our sages said, “<i>who is mighty? He who subdues his [evil] inclination.</i>”<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">M. <i>Avot</i>, 4.1.</i> <i>Simeon</i> was separated from <i>Levi</i>, even though they were always friends. However, Jacob separated them, as the verse says, “<i>I will divide them in Jacob</i>” [Genesis, 49:7]. The banner related to <i>Michael, Kochaviel, and Puriel.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Numbers, 2:2; Ramban, Numbers, 2:2; Toldot Yizhak, Numbers, 2:2, and Ibn Shuaib, <i>Derashot</i>, II: 314–316.</i>
Afterwards, the gate of the <i>Levites</i> followed, and the <i>Levites</i> were only twenty-two thousand. They were not numerous because the <i>Ark</i> made them few. Because they carried the Ark and the holy Tablets, and they sometimes saw where one was not supposed to see or touch, therefore, they were few. Some died because of this. So says the Midrash.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanhuma</i>, Bamidbar, 17.</i>
<i>Ramban</i> gives another explanation. They were few in number because Pharaoh did not let them work in Egypt, since the Israelites increased because they had the heavy work in Egypt, as the verse says, “<i>the more they were oppressed, the more they increased and spread out</i>” [Exodus, 1:12]. The more they were oppressed, the more they increased. Pharaoh did not give the <i>tribe of Levi</i> work because they did not carry Jacob’s coffin when he died in Egypt. Jacob had forbidden Levi from carrying his coffin, because Levi would carry the Ark with the holy Tablets in the wilderness. Ramban asks a question about the midrash that the Ark made them few in number. How could this be? They had not yet carried the Ark with the Tablets when they were counted. However, after the counting they began to carry the Ark. The explanation is what he writes about those who were oppressed in Egypt, were those who increased. However, the <i>tribe of Levi</i> was not oppressed and therefore they were few. Could not the Holy One have made it that they should be equally numerous, even if they were not oppressed? Therefore, <i>Ramban retracts</i> his explanation and says that the Levites were not numerous because Jacob was angry with Levi. When he blessed the other children, Jacob said in the portion of <i>Vayehi</i>, “<i>let not my being be counted in their assembly</i>” [Genesis, 49:6]. He was angry with Levi and therefore they were few in number. The <i>tribe of Simeon</i> was also few in number because Jacob was angry with <i>Simeon</i> at the same time. Thus, we find that the tribe of Simeon was only twenty-two thousand. So writes <i>Ramban.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban, Numbers, 3:14.</i>
<i>Zeror ha-Mor</i> asks a question about the <i>Ramban.</i> How could it be that because of <i>Jacob</i>’<i>s</i> anger the children of Levi and <i>Simeon</i> were so few? Were the children of the <i>tribe of Simeon</i> many at first, but after they committed sins with illicit sex in the city of <i>Shittim</i> and many from Simeon died. In any event, they were not few because of Jacob’s anger. Therefore, Zeror ha-Mor gives another explanation. The children of Levi were few because they studied Torah day and night. So too, Moses said about the children of Levi, “<i>they shall teach Your laws to Jacob</i>” [Deuteronomy, 33:10]. Therefore, because they studied Torah day and night, and the Torah makes the person weak. All the Levites had a greater desire for Torah study than for their wives. Therefore, they had few children and the Levites already studied Torah with Jacob in Egypt. Therefore, they were weak all their days from the Torah and did not have the energy to sleep much with their wives to have children.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Zeror ha-Mor, Numbers, 3:15.</i>
As the Israelites surrounded the Levites on all four sides, the Levites surrounded the Tabernacle and the Ark on all four sides. <i>Moses and Aaron</i> were on the <i>east</i> and <i>Gershon</i> on the <i>west.</i> The <i>children of Kehat</i> to the <i>south</i> and the <i>children of Merari</i> in the <i>north</i>, and the Tabernacle was in the middle. The third banner was <i>Ephraim</i> to the <i>west.</i> Because <i>Jeroboam</i> was descended from Ephraim, and he was full of sins, therefore, he had to rest near Torah and repentance. The same was with <i>Reuben and Issachar.</i> They repented and studied Torah, expecting that Ephraim should Torah and repentance from them. This banner referred to <i>Raphael, Zichriel, and Ahaziel.</i> They surrounded the <i>Throne of Glory.</i> The fourth banner was that of <i>Dan</i> to the <i>north.</i> Dan caused much worship of foreign gods in the world and therefore he rested in the north, the side where no sun comes. Therefore, this side is called zafon [hidden], because the sun is hidden from that side. Dan darkened the world with sins. They worshiped an image and <i>Jeroboam son of Nebat</i> made two golden calves. One calf was placed in the city of <i>Dan</i>, and he placed the second one in <i>Beth-El.</i> The <i>tribe of Dan</i> worshiped these calves. Gold comes from the north. Therefore, Dan rested in the north where it is dark. Near him rested <i>Asher</i> and <i>Naphtali</i>, to illumine for Dan, since the blessings of Asher and Naphtali was much oil and good food. They illumine the eyes of people, expecting to make light for Dan, since his eyes were darkened.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Numbers, 2:2.</i>
“<i>You shall put the Levites in charge</i>” [1:50]. Ramban writes. The Holy One ordered Moses to count the Levites himself, and he should not take Aaron or other chieftains to help count them. However, Moses was not arrogant and took Aaron to help, and did not want to make himself important. Therefore, the verse says at the end of the portion, “<i>all the Levites whom Moses and Aaron recorded</i>” [4:46]. Here the word Aaron was dotted. There was a dot over each letter. This shows us that Aaron was not commanded by the Holy One explicitly to count the Levites, but Moses himself took Aaron to help count. He did not want to make himself important, since Moses assigned each Levite to his service. He also added the chieftains, expecting that he would also honor them that they should also participate. He should not rule alone, even if he was the most important person, as Moses was. Afterwards, the Holy One agreed that Moses had done rightly in taking Aaron to help count, as the verse says, “<i>whom Moses and Aaron recorded at the command of the Lord</i>” [4:37]. That is to say, Moses counted them with Aaron as God had commanded.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban, Numbers, 1:47.</i>
<i>Baal ha-Turim</i> writes. It is written here, “<i>you shall put the Levites in charge</i>” [1:50]. Elsewhere, the verse says, “<i>appoint a wicked man over him</i>” [Psalms, 109:6]. This shows, as the Talmud writes, when a person is appointed a ruler on the earth, then he is placed as an evildoer, above in heaven. That is to say, when one is made a ruler in the community or the land, many people are envious of him. There are many opposed to him and argue against him. He must also argue with them and he must battle. The arguments tear at him. He wants to show his rulership against them and through this he comes to sins and great arguments. He becomes an evildoer through this.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Baal ha-Turim, Numbers, 1:50.</i>
“<i>The Levites shall camp around the Tabernacle</i>” [1:53]. Ramban writes here. The Levites rested around the Tabernacle to guard it just like one guards a king on all sides. The Israelites surrounded the Levites on all four sides. The Levites guarded the Tabernacle the whole night. The priests guarded inside the Tabernacle, like one guards a king.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban, Numbers, 1:53.</i>
“<i>Around the Tent of Meeting at a distance</i>” [2:2]. All of Israel rested two thousand cubits from the Tabernacle, expecting that all of Israel should be able to come on the Sabbath and festivals to Moses, to study Torah.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 2:2.</i>
“<i>His troop, as enrolled</i> … <i>the total enrolled in the division of Judah</i>” [2:4–9]. Ramban and also Bahya ask a question. Why does the verse have to say, “<i>his troop, as enrolled</i>” many times, and again, “<i>the total enrolled.</i>” The explanation is that the Torah shows us that the Holy One did a great miracle with Israel, and protected them from all evil. Even though there were many hundreds of thousand souls among them, they were not counted. They only counted the men who were twenty years old and those below were not counted. No women and children were counted. Those who were counted were six hundred thousand, and their wives were also six hundred thousand. Some had two wives and each one had how many children. It took twenty days to count them, since they could not count them all in five or six days. They had to be counted for twenty consecutive days. During those twenty days nobody among the Israelites died. This was an innovation of the Holy One who was protecting them. Therefore, the verse says several times, “<i>his troop as enrolled</i>” [2:4]. That is to say, they were all together with their army and their people. Nobody left his group.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban, Numbers, 2:4; Bahya, Numbers, 2:3.</i>
Ramban asks further. The prince of Gad is called here <i>Eliyasaf the son of Reuel</i>, with a <i>resh.</i> Another time he is called <i>Deuel</i>, with a <i>dalet.</i> The explanation is that <i>Reuel</i> was an important person. He was called <i>Deuel</i> because his thoughts were always about the Holy One, to know Him and recognize Him. He was not called Reuel again. He was a friend to God. That is to say, when someone wanted to know what God is and serves Him, he becomes a friend to God. <i>Reuel</i> also means that he thinks about God to serve Him. Thus, <i>Reuel</i> and <i>Deuel</i> both mean the same thing. Whoever the Holy One loves, He gives him another name for good.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban, Numbers, 2:4.</i>
Bahya and Rashi write that <i>Judah, Issachar and Zebulon</i> were together under one banner and were not far from Moses and Aaron, because they were also all scholars.

There were seven clouds with Israel in the wilderness. Four clouds were on the four sides. One cloud went before Israel, three days journey, and killed all the big burning snakes that were as large as a pillar. The clouds also removed mountains wherever there were mountains. Where there was a valley, the clouds smoothed them out, so that Israel had a flat path and not let them tire going up hills. There was also a cloud that covered Israel so that they should not suffer from heat or cold. One cloud illumined them from the Shekhinah. So says the Midrash in Bahya.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Numbers, 2:2.</i>
“<i>These shall march first</i>” [2:9]. Rashi writes. Israel did not march until they saw the cloud going before them. As soon as the cloud moved, the priests blew trumpets and they began to move. Judah was in front, and then Reuben went with his people. Then the Tabernacle and the Levites. Then Ephraim went to the west and then Dan to the north. When they rested, so too, each one went to their side.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 2:9.</i>
“<i>This is the line of Aaron and Moses</i>” [3:1]. Ramban, Rashi and Bahya write here that he only counted the children of Aaron and not the children of Moses and it says, the line of Aaron and Moses. The explanation is that they are called the children of Moses, even though they were not his children. Because he taught them Torah, they were like his children. Therefore, the verse says that they were the children of Aaron because he gave birth to them. They were the children of Moses because he taught them Torah.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban, Numbers, 3:1; Rashi, Numbers, 3:1; Bahya, Numbers, 3:1.</i>
The verse then says again, “<i>These are the names of Aaron</i>’<i>s sons,</i> … <i>the anointed priests,</i> … <i>but Nadav and Avihu died</i>” [3:2–4]. This shows us that the Holy One was very exacting with the righteous when they commit a sin. He does not forgive them and does not flatter them. When Nadav and Avihu were anointed as high priests, they had to die because of a small sin.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Numbers, 3:1.</i>
“<i>I hereby take</i>” [3:12]. The Holy One said: the Levites should serve Me instead of the firstborn, who used to serve, to bring sacrifices. However, because all of Israel worshiped the Golden Calf, the Holy One did not want that they should serve in the Tabernacle. He placed the Levites to serve because the Levites did not worship the Golden Calf.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 3:12.</i>
“<i>And take the Levites for Me, the Lord, in place of every firstborn among the Israelite people</i>” [3:41]. The Holy One said: count the firstborn who are one month old of each Israelite. Moses counted the firstborn of the Israelites. The firstborn of the Israelites were twenty-two thousand and two hundred and seventy three. The Levites were only twenty two thousand. The Holy One said that each Levite should be in place of an Israelite firstborn. The remaining firstborn, who were two hundred and seventy three, should each redeem themselves. Each one should give five <i>shekels</i> weight of silver to Aaron. Moses said: what should I do with the Levites and the firstborn? Each Israelite firstborn will not want to give five <i>shekels</i> each one will say; there is a Levite for me. There were two hundred and seventy three fewer Levites than firstborn. Since there were more firstborn, two hundred and seventy three of them had to give five shekels. None of the firstborn wanted to give. Each one said, there is a Levite who reflects me. Moses did not know which firstborn should give five <i>shekels.</i> Therefore, Moses went and threw <i>lots.</i> He wrote twenty two thousand small notes and on each one he wrote one word, Levite. Then he wrote two hundred and seventy three notes and on each one of them was written, five <i>shekels.</i> He mixed together the twenty two thousand and the other two hundred and seventy three. <i>Moses Our Teacher</i> called each firstborn and he took out a note. If the firstborn pulled out a note on which was written Levite, then he was exempt from the five <i>shekels.</i> If he pulled out a note on which was written, five shekels, then he had to give five shekels. All the firstborn pulled out notes in this way.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanhuma</i>, Bamidbar, 21.</i>
<i>Devek Tov</i> asks. Why did Moses have to write so much? On twenty-two thousand notes it was written Levi, and on two hundred and seventy-three it was written five shekels. He only had to write five shekels on the two hundred and seventy-three and leave the twenty-two thousand notes blank. Whoever received a blank note would be exempt, and Moses would have been spared all that writing. The explanation is that the firstborn who took a note on which was written Levite, he could show after a number of years that he had been redeemed by Moses. Another explanation is that he did not leave any note blank, then the firstborn could have made blank notes by themselves. Each firstborn could have brought a blank note and could have said that he had taken this note out of the <i>lottery.</i> Therefore, they wrote on all the notes and Moses wrote in his own hand. Everyone knew Moses’ signature and handwriting. <i>Devek Tov</i> asks another question. Why did Moses not leave the two hundred and seventythree notes blank and just write Levi on the twenty-two thousand notes? The firstborn could not bring a blank note. If he had taken out a blank note, he would have had to give five shekels. Levi was written on twenty-two thousand notes, as we find what Moses did in the portion of <i>Behalotekha.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">A reference to Rashi, Numbers, 11:26.</i> <i>Devek Tov</i> gives no answer.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">Devek Tov, Numbers, 3:32, note 2.</i>
“<i>Take a census of the Kohathites</i>” [4:2]. Count the Levites to carry the <i>holy vessels.</i> They did not count those who were under thirty years old. They also did not count those over fifty years old, since the who is over fifty years old does not have the strength to carry. Similarly, the one under thirty years old is not yet ready for his work. From here our sages learn that one has his greatest strength at the age of thirty years.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 4:2.</i> The Levites took down the Tabernacle when they were ready to move. They covered the Ark with the curtain and then covered it with an animal skin. They did this with all the vessels in the Tabernacle, putting them in their cases and nicely covered for the journey. They also carried the altar. The fire that came down from heaven the first time on the altar was always there and was never extinguished. The fire was covered with an iron lid and a cover of purple wool was put on the lid. It was not burned.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 4:13.</i> When it all had been covered, the children of <i>Kehat</i> came and carried all the vessels.
“<i>Responsibility shall rest with Eleazar</i>” [4:16]. <i>Eleazar</i> was the master over the children of Kehat. He was also the one who prepared the oil and the incense, and the oil for the meal offerings when they rested. Bahya and Ramban write that the verse says, “<i>Responsibility shall rest with Eleazar.</i>” This shows us that <i>Eleazar</i> did not carry any load, but he was the overseer of the Levites. However, it is written in the <i>Jerusalem Talmud</i> that <i>Eleazar</i> did carry things. The <i>spices for the incense</i> had a weight of three hundred and sixty-five, and the oil for a whole year, one hundred and eighty three measures. Eleazar carried all this alone, since he had great strength. The Holy One caused a miracle that he was able to carry all this.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Numbers, 4:16; Ramban, Numbers, 4:16.</i>
“<i>Do not let the group of Kohathite clans be cut off</i>” [4:18]. The Holy One commanded Aaron and his children should guard the children of Kehat that they should not die, but that they should carry properly. If they did not carry properly, they would be killed. “<i>The group of Kohathite clans.</i>” Bahya writes. The Torah wrote an extra <i>heh</i> in the front of Kehat and an extra <i>yud</i> at the end. This is the name of God that is called <i>Yah.</i> The Torah knew that <i>Korah</i> and his group would argue against Aaron and Moses. Therefore, the Holy One said to Kehat, do not get destroyed in that argument. Therefore, the Holy One added His name to Kehat to protect him.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Numbers, 4:18.</i>
“<i>The dismantling of the sanctuary</i>” [4:20]. The Holy One ordered them to cover all the sacred vessels expecting that people should not see and should not die because of it. Therefore, the Holy One warned that they should not look at them because they are holy.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Numbers, 4:20.</i>

Nasso

“<i>Take a census</i>” [4:22]. <i>King Solomon</i> said. “<i>Justice done is a joy to the righteous, to evildoers, ruination</i>” [Proverbs, 21:15]. The verse teaches us that it is woeful to the evildoer to do justice and right. However, for the righteous it is a great joy to do justice and fulfill commandments, and that no robbery and theft should occur in his city. However, the evildoer fears justice, that he should not be punished for his evil. King Solomon lets me know that the person is obligated to rejoice and be joyful at fulfilling every commandment. He should rejoice wholeheartedly when he fulfills a commandment. The Holy One gives him a reward for the <i>joy</i> that he has in connection to the commandment, just like He was at the event Himself, as the verse says, “<i>worship the Lord in gladness</i>” [Psalms, 100:2]. Worship God with joy and therefore, those who sang in the Temple had to have a good voice. In the wilderness, they also had to sing with good voices and beautiful instruments in the Tabernacle, at the sacrifices, expecting that the joy should be on the people who were present at the sacrifices. Therefore, the verse says about the sacrifices, “<i>subject to duties of service</i>” [4:47]. Our sages write. What kind of work is the work that serves others in their work? The explanation is that the Levites had to serve to bring joy that they should do the other work with joy. That is, offering the sacrifices with joy.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Naso, Introduction.</i>
<i>Hizkuni</i> also writes. The children of Kehat were counted first because they carried the holy vessels and the Ark, the table, the <i>candelabrum</i>, and the <i>altar.</i> Afterwards, they counted the children of Gershon. Even though they did not carry, but they guarded wagons with oxen and led the oxen. Yet, they were counted after Kehat because Gershon was the oldest. Thus, it was just to count them after Kehat.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Numbers, 4:22.</i>
Zeror ha-Mor writes. Since Gershon was the firstborn of the children of Levi, it is written there, “<i>take a census of the head of the Gershonites also</i>” [4:22]. That is to say, Gershon is also a leader like Kehat. However, concerning the children of Merari, it is written, “<i>count the Merarites</i>” [4:29]. It is not written, <i>head.</i> That is to say, esteemed and important. Though the children of Merari were important and valuable, the children of Merari were not as important as the children of Gershon. Therefore, the word <i>head</i> is not written. The children of Kehat became important because they always went barefoot near the Ark, since wherever the Ark was, this was holy ground. Wherever is holy ground, one is supposed to go barefoot. The children of Kehat also walked differently, always having their face toward the Ark and their back to the path.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Zeror ha-Mor, Numbers, 4:22.</i>
Therefore it is written, “<i>Moses, Aaron, and the chieftains of the community recorded the Kohathites</i>” [4:34]. Because the Kehatites were important and honored the Torah, therefore Moses, Aaron counted them and the chieftains also helped to count the Kehatites. However, Gershon was only counted by Moses and Aaron.
The chieftains, the leaders of the tribes did not help count because they were not as important as Kehat.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Zeror ha-Mor, Numbers, 4:41.</i>
“<i>You shall list by name</i>” [4:32]. Ramban writes. They counted each Levite and what he should carry, how many boards, thresholds, or pillars. Not that one should have told the children of Merari to carry ordinary things or that one should take boards or thresholds according to their desire. There would have been many arguments. Each one would have hid himself and thought, let my colleague take first. The work of the children of Merari was difficult, only heavy boards, pillars, and thresholds. Perhaps each one will want to make it easy and not carry heavy things. Therefore, they wrote down for each one, how much he should carry, so that there should not be any conflict, since God had commanded this. They followed this, and the same thing regarding the children of Kehat and Gershon. Each one’s name was inscribed and what he should carry and how much.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban, Numbers, 4:32.</i>
“<i>Each one was given responsibility for his service and porterage</i>” [4:49]. Ramban writes that the verse shows us that each Levite did not need to help the other Levite with any other work.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban, Numbers, 4:49.</i>
“<i>Remove from camp anyone with an eruption or a discharge and anyone defiled</i>” [5:2]. Rashi writes. The one with an eruption was sent out of the camp of the Israelites. There were three camps. First, innermost, inside the curtain of the Tabernacle was where the Shekhinah rested. This was the first camp. The second camp was where the Levites rested, around the Tabernacle. This was called the <i>camp of the Levites.</i> The third camp was where the resting place of the Levites ended. Here began the resting place of the Israelites on the four sides around the Levites and was called the <i>camp of the Israelites.</i> The <i>one with a discharge</i> had to go out of all three camps, to the field alone so that he should not make the people impure. The <i>one with a discharge</i>, means someone from whom blood flows. He must leave the <i>camp of the Levites</i> and the <i>camp of the Shekhinah.</i> He was allowed to remain in the camp of the Israelites. One who touched a corpse had to leave the camp of the Shekhinah, but was allowed to remain in the camp of the Levites and the camp of the Israelites.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 5:2.</i>
Ramban, Hizkuni, and Zeror ha-Mor write. How is the portion about impurity related to the portion about Israel being counted, each one in his place? The explanation is, because Israel was counted on the place where they should rest around the Tabernacle, and how the Tabernacle should be carried, therefore, it immediately talks about the portion on impurity, that Israel should keep themselves pure and should not make the Tabernacle impure. They should also be warned not to steal, as is written in the following portion. They should also be warned not to engage in illicit sex, as is mentioned afterwards in the portion about the Sotah. This means a woman who engages in illicit sex.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban, Numbers, 5:2, Hizkuni, Numbers, 5:2–3; Zeror ha-Mor, Numbers, 5:2.</i>
“<i>Breaking faith</i>” [5:6]. The portion teaches us that one should not steal and not to swear falsely and not to lie to his friend about something. He must return what he had stolen. He must add a fifth to what he had stolen. If he stole five gulden, he had to give <i>the principal</i>, five gulden and must add a gulden as a <i>penalty.</i> He must also bring a sacrifice. If he stole something from his friend and he died, he should return the theft to the priests.
<i>Baal ha-Turim</i> writes. The Torah wrote, “<i>any wrong toward a fellow man</i>” [5:6], and wrote near it that the <i>impure</i> should be sent out of the camp of Israel. It teaches us that all the <i>impurity</i> came from <i>Adam</i>, because he had eaten from the apple. The snake incited the woman and <i>spoke ill</i> of <i>Adam.</i> Therefore, the snakes were afflicted with leprosy and blood flows from the woman, and Adam had to die. In this way, the Torah wrote in order, first when someone is leprous and he is sent out of the camp. This was related to the affliction of the snake and that was leprosy. The second portion talks about when blood flows from a man or a woman, this relates to the affliction of Eve, who was afflicted with menstrual blood. The third portion which talks about when someone touches a corpse. This relates to Adam who was afflicted that he had to die. Death began with him and then came into the world.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Baal ha-Turim, Numbers, 5:6.</i>
“<i>Each shall retain his sacred donations</i>” [5:10]. Rashi writes. A person who does not want to give the correct tithe, then the tithe will be his. That is to say, if a field used to grow one hundred measures, then he would be obligated to give ten measures. However, because he did not give the proper tithe, his field would not grow any more than ten measures, as much as he should have given as a tithe.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 5:10.</i>
“<i>Each priest shall keep what is given to him</i>” [5:10]. However, whoever gives charity and tithes, he will have much good from God.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban, Numbers, 5:10.</i>
“<i>If any man</i>’<i>s wife has gone astray</i>” [5:12]. Rashi writes. When a person does not give proper tithes and charity to the priest, then the Holy One sends to that person that his wife has illicit sex. He must come to the priest with his wife. Therefore, these two portions are next to each other. The Torah writes two times, <i>a man</i>, <i>a man.</i> This teaches us that the woman who engages in illicit sex acts against the Holy One, who is called <i>man</i>, and acts against her husband, who is also called <i>man.</i> “<i>His wife has gone astray</i>” [5:12]. Our sages say that a woman or a man who engages in illicit sex, a foolish spirit must first come into them. Therefore, they engage in illicit sex. Concerning this, the verse says, “<i>has gone astray.</i>” This means that the woman becomes foolish and allows herself to be persuaded.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 5:12.</i>
“<i>A man has had carnal relations with her</i>” [5:13]. When a woman sleeps with a strange man, that woman will die from drinking the water of the Temple. However, her sister does not die from the water. So writes Rashi. That is to say, there was a story of two sisters who looked alike. One of them had illicit sex. They were supposed to give her the water to drink in the Temple. She said to her sister, go in my place, as the water will not harm you. The sister went to the Temple. The people thought that this was the woman that her husband suspected of having illicit sex. They made her drink the water and the water did not harm her at all. When she came home, her sister came and embraced and kissed her that she had saved her from death. The taste of the water went from one sister into the mouth of the other sister. The sister who had the illicit sex swelled up because of the taste of the water. “<i>Unbeknown to her husband</i>” [5:13]. When the man sees that she had illicit sexual relations and remains silent, then she is not given the water to drink. “<i>There is no witness against her</i>” [5:13]. When there is no witness that she had illicit sex, she is given the water to drink. However, when there is one <i>witness</i>, then she is not given the water to drink. When there is one witness that she had illicit sex of her own will, she does not drink the water. However, she is forbidden to her husband. However, when there are two witnesses that she had illicit sex, then she is put to death by strangulation. She was not given water to drink. It happens that her husband forbade her to hide herself with that man. Two witnesses saw that she hid herself with a strange man. However, they did not see that he slept with her. She is given the water to drink. “<i>And she was not forced</i>” [5:13]. If she freely hid with a strange man, then she is given the water to drink. However, when she was forcibly taken, then she is not given any water to drink, because she was not responsible for it.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 5:13.</i>
“<i>Barley flour</i>” [5:15]. She must bring a sacrifice of barley flour, but not wheat, since she behaved like an animal, which mates with whichever animal it is. Therefore, she should bring a sacrifice of barley, which is what animals eat. One should not pour oil on the flour, as they used to pour on other meal offerings, because she did her deed in the dark with a strange man. Therefore, one should not pour oil, which was used to illumine. It should be dark for the woman. They should also not put any frankincense on the sacrifice, because <i>Sarah, Rebecca, Rachel and Leah</i> were compared to frankincense. The woman had separated herself from <i>Sarah, Rebecca, Rachel and Leah,</i> with her evil deeds.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 5:15.</i>
The priest should take water from the basin. This basin was made from the mirrors that the women gave to the Tabernacle. The woman had separated herself from these good women. Therefore, she is given the water from the basin of those women.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 5:17.</i>
Bahya writes. Why did the Torah say that one should put earth in the water that is given to the woman to drink? If the woman would be just, a righteous person like Abraham would come from her. It is written about him, “<i>I who am but dust and ashes</i>” [Genesis, 18:27]. I am earth and ashes. However, if the woman was not just, them she must die from the drinking and her body becomes ashes and earth. <i>Rabbi Meir</i> said: the Holy One repays, <i>measure for measure. Rabbi Hiyya</i> said: from the time that the Sanhedrin was abrogated and they could not legally put a person to death, the Holy One himself punishes the person who is <i>guilty of the death penalty.</i> However, people do not understand this. When someone committed a sin and he is guilty to be stoned, the Holy One causes that he falls down from the roof or a wild animal tears him apart. If one is guilty to be burned, the Holy One causes that he should fall into a fire and is burned, or a snake bites him with poison, which burns like fire. When someone is guilty to be beheaded with a sword, the Holy One causes that he falls into the hands of robbers and they behead him, or he is arrested by the <i>government</i> and is killed, or he is guilty to be hanged. The Holy One causes that a liquid or a swelling in his throat occurs in his throat and he chokes. So too it is with the faithless wife. Everything was done, <i>measure for measure.</i> She used to drink out of beautiful vessels. Therefore, she is given water to drink out of an earthen vessel. She used to give him good wine to drink. Therefore, she is given bitter water. She stood at her door to see how her lover is coming. Therefore, the priest places her near a door in the <i>Temple</i> so that all the people should see her. She adorned herself beautifully and covered her hair so that her lover should like her. Therefore, the priest should uncover her hair and everyone should see her unadorned hair. She braided her hair. Therefore, the priest disheveled her hair and tore her clothes until her heart is bared and publicly exposed before the people. She beautified her face for her lover. Therefore, her face is green and yellow from drinking the water. She colored her eyes. Now her eyes bulged out from the water. She made good food for her lover. Therefore, her sacrifice was barley that animals used to eat.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Numbers, 5:17.</i>
“<i>He made her stand</i>” [5:18]. Rashi writes here. The priest led the woman from one corner to the other corner, expecting that he would make her tired and crazy, so that she should reflect and recognize that the name of the Holy One should not be erased because of her. The hair of her head was uncovered to shame her. From here we learn that women should cover the hair of their head, so that no hairs should be seen. She is given the meal offering into her hand, expecting that they want to make her crazy, so that she should remember and recognize. The priest put the water in her hand that she should drink. The priest makes her swear that she did not sleep with a strange man, because she had a husband. Not only that, she should swear about the man who was suspect, even about all the men in the world, that she did not sleep with any of them. She should swear on that. If she did sleep with a strange man, then God should curse her with the water, and all the people should curse her and say in their curse, it should happen to you what happened to the woman. “<i>Your thigh to sag</i>” [5:21]. Your thighs should fall off and your belly should swell. Since she began to commit her sin with her thighs and her belly, therefore, the thighs and the belly must suffer. Then the whole body must collapse, a piece at a time, because of the water. The thighs and belly of the man with whom she had illicit sex would also collapse, a piece at a time, when the woman would drink the water.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 5:18–22.</i>
“<i>Elevate the meal offering</i>” [5:25]. The priest lifted up the meal offering with the hand of the woman. That is to say, the woman had the meal offering in her hand. The priest put his hand under the hand of the woman, and they lifted it up together.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 5:25.</i>
<i>Imre Noam</i> asks a question here. How appropriate is it that the priest should place his hands and touch the hands of a woman? Perhaps he might have an evil thought about the woman.

Even for a young priest, the evil inclination might not come for a short time.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Imre Noam, Numbers, 5:25.</i>
Rashi writes. “<i>The woman shall say, amen, amen</i>” [5:22]. The woman should say amen about the curses.

When the woman sees that they have erased the name of the Holy One in the water, and she does not want to drink, then she is made to drink it by force.

“<i>She shall be unharmed and able to retain seed</i>” [5:28]. When the woman was justified and had not engaged in illicit sex and had to drink the water in the Temple, the Holy One gives her that if she had not been able to have children, now she would be able to have children with her husband, because of the disgrace she had endured. If she had children with great pain, she would now have children easily. If she only had daughters previously, she would now have only sons with her husband. When she previously had dark and swarthy children, she would now have light haired and beautiful children, and she would have children who would be righteous.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 5:28.</i>
“<i>The man shall be clear of guilt</i>” [5:31]. Rashi and Imre Noam write. The husband should not say: I am guilty that she was given the bitter water to drink and she died. Therefore, the Torah says that the husband is free of any punishment. The verse also teaches us that when the woman drank the water and did not become impure, then she is as she was before for her husband.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 5:31.</i>
<i>Imre Noam</i> writes. It is written three times in the Torah “<i>clear</i>” [<i>nikah</i>]. This means, clear of sin, since there are three times where one’s sins are forgiven. There are three whose sins are <i>forgiven.</i> The first is when a person comes to <i>greatness.</i> Here, the Holy One forgives his sins. Someone who was sick and became well again, the Holy One forgives his sins. The Holy One also forgives a groom at his wedding his sins.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Imre Noam, Numbers, 5:31.</i>
Ramban and Bahya write. “<i>The man shall be clear of guilt</i>” [5:31], means, when the man never engaged in illicit sex and he also did not sleep with his wife from the time that she was suspected of secluding herself. Also, when somebody slept with his fiancיe, when she was still his fiancיe before the wedding, she is not given the water to drink. Even when his children engaged in illicit sex and he did not forbid it, his wife is not given the water to drink in the Temple.

“<i>If a man or woman explicitly utters a nazirite vow, to set himself apart</i>” [6:2]. Rashi and Bahya write. The Torah wrote the portion about when someone wants to become a nazirite; he should separate himself from drinking wine and other pleasures. The Torah wrote this near the portion of the <i>unfaithful wife.</i> This teaches us that the person should separate himself from wine. He should take an example from what happened to the <i>unfaithful wife</i> and that she was punished.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 6:2; Bahya, Numbers, 6:2.</i>
“<i>No razor shall touch his head</i>” [6:5]. The one who wants to separate himself from drinking wine and wants to be a <i>nazirite</i> to God. That is to say, by not drinking, he will be able to serve God properly, with a clear mind. That <i>nazirite</i> should not cut the hair of his head, because he is a <i>nazirite. Bahya</i> and <i>Ibn Shuaib</i> write this. Therefore, he should let the hair of his head grow. When the hair of his head is long, it makes him worried and sad, and he is not happy. Thus, he will fear the Holy One and will worship God properly.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Numbers, 6:3; Ibn, Shuaib, <i>Derashot</i>, II: 333.</i>
<i>Toldot Yizhak</i> and <i>Ibn Shuaib</i> write. The portion about the <i>unfaithful wife</i> was written near the portion of the nazirite. This teaches us that the unfaithful wife, when she engaged in illicit sex, transgressed the Ten Statements that Moses Our Teacher brought down on Mount Sinai. The nazirite very properly kept the Ten Statements, and did even more. <i>Rav Huna</i> said in the name of <i>Rabbi Abba.</i> The woman who had illicit sex transgressed ten commandments. The first is “<i>I the Lord am your God</i>” [Exodus, 20:2]. When someone engages in illicit sex and sleeps with his friend’s wife and denies it, this is like he had denied the Holy One. The second is “<i>you shall have no other gods</i>” [Exodus, 20:3]. When a woman engages in illicit sex with a strange man, it is like when she takes another god. The third is “<i>you shall not swear falsely</i>” [Exodus, 20:7]. You should not swear falsely. The man and woman engage in illicit sex and swear that they had done no evil. The fourth is “<i>remember the Sabbath day</i>” [Exodus, 20:8]. They sometimes engage in illicit sex and she has a husband who is a priest and she has a son. People think that it’s the proper son that she had with the priest. The son performs the <i>service</i> in the <i>Temple</i> on the Sabbath, and he offers sacrifices. The priest may do this, but the son came from an Israelite with whom his mother had <i>illicit sex.</i> Thus, he should not do the service in the Temple. Thus, the woman causes that the son <i>desecrates the Sabbath.</i> The fifth is “<i>honor your father</i>” [Exodus, 20:12]. The woman causes that her son kills his own father. The son thinks that her legal husband is his father and he might sometimes kill his real father, who is the <i>adulterer</i> who slept with her. The sixth is “<i>you shall not murder</i>” [Exodus, 20:13]. Sometimes the husband kills the <i>adulterer.</i> The seventh is “<i>you shall not commit adultery</i>” [Exodus, 20:13]. One should not commit adultery and the woman committed adultery. The eighth is “<i>you shall not steal</i>” [Exodus, 20:13]. One should not steal. The <i>adulterer</i> was like a thief. He stole his friend’s wife. The ninth is “<i>you shall not bear false witness</i>” [Exodus, 20:13]. One should not testify falsely. The wife gives false testimony. She says to her husband that she became pregnant from him. The tenth is “<i>you shall not covet</i>” [Exodus, 20:14]. One should not lust after your friend’s things. The adulterer lusted after his friend’s wife.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Numbers, 6:2; Ibn, Shuaib, <i>Derashot</i>, II: 335–337.</i>
“<i>Throughout his term as nazirite he is consecrated</i>” [6:8]. The nazirite must remain <i>holy.</i> He should not touch any corpse, even if his father, mother, brother or sister died, he should not touch them. <sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 6:8.</i>
“<i>Make expiation on his behalf for the guilt that he incurred through the corpse</i>” [6:11]. Rashi writes here. They should make expiation for the nazirite that he was not warned to guard himself not to become impure. <i>Rabbi Eliezer</i> said: because he separated himself not to drink wine and tormented his body, therefore he brings a sacrifice.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 6:11.</i>
<i>Toldot Yizhak</i> asks a question. Why is the nazirite guilty that he unexpectedly came into a house and did not know that a person died in the house unexpectedly? Why is the nazirite guilty and why should he bring a sacrifice? The explanation is that the person who becomes a nazirite and becomes very pious, comes unexpectedly into the house of another <i>householder</i>, the nazirite might mention the sins of the householder. The <i>angels</i> tell the Holy One how great and pious the nazirite is and the householder is an evildoer in comparison. Thus, God kills him because of the nazirite. Therefore, he must bring a sacrifice.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Numbers, 6:11.</i>
Ramban, Bahya, and Ibn Shuaib write. The nazirite brings a sacrifice because he began to be pious and became a nazirite. This lasts thirty-one days and then he is again as he was. He drinks wine and again becomes impure to the dead. He has to bring a sacrifice for this, that he did not remain a nazirite and pious forever, like <i>the prophet Samuel</i> who remained a nazirite forever, and also other <i>nazirites.</i> The verse had compared the nazirite to a prophet and how is it appropriate that after thirty days he should separate from this? For this reason, he brings a sacrifice.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban, Number, 6:11; Bahya, Numbers, 6:13; Ibn, Shuaib, <i>Derashot</i>, II: 333.</i>
<i>Baal ha-Turim</i> writes. “<i>He shall not go in where there is a dead person</i>” [6:6], because he is a nazirite and the Shekhinah rests on him. Therefore, he should not become impure to any dead person. They should not say that he does magic with the dead, since the Shekhinah rests on him. There are many who can learn things from the dead, just like he was prophesying.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Baal ha-Turim, Numbers, 6:6.</i>
“<i>Such is the obligation of the nazirite</i>” [6:21]. When the thirty days end for the nazirite, he brings a sacrifice. He must cut the hair of his head, and burns it under the pot where they boiled the <i>peace offering.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Numbers, 6:18.</i>
“<i>The Lord bless you and protect you</i>” [6:24]. The Holy One gave into the hands of the priests that they should bless Israel. This is how they blessed Israel. They said: God should bless you with much goods and money. “<i>Protect you.</i>” He should protect you. When a king gives someone something and robbers come and take it away, what kind of pleasure does he have from this present? However, the Holy One protects the person to whom He gives something.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 6:24.</i>
“<i>The Lord deal kindly and graciously with you</i>” [6:25]. God should show Israel a happy clear face, and God should give Israel <i>grace</i> so that whoever looks at Israel should find <i>grace</i> in Israel.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 6:24.</i>
“<i>The Lord bestow His favor upon you and grant you peace</i>” [6:26]. God should remove His wrath from Israel and should give Israel peace.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 6:26.</i>
Another explanation. There are three words in the first verse, relating to the three men who are called to the Torah on Sabbath evenings, Monday and Thursday. The second verse has five words relating to the five that are called to the Torah on the festivals. The third verse has seven words relating to the seven who are called to the Torah on Sabbath morning.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Numbers, 6:24–26.</i>
“<i>Grant you peace</i>” [6:26]. With this, the Torah makes peace between the tribe of Levi and the other Israelites. As many from the tribe of Levi are called to the Torah every week as one calls up <i>Israelites.</i> On the Sabbath morning two from the tribe of Levi are called up, a priest and a Levite. On Sabbath evening, again a priest and a Levite. On Monday and Thursday, a priest and a Levite each day. That is, eight from the tribe of Levi every week. Similarly, eight Israelites are called up to the Torah On Sabbath morning, five Israelites. On Sabbath evening, one Israelite. On Monday and Thursday morning, also one Israelite each day. There are all together eight, just like the tribe of Levi. There is no conflict between the tribes. The Torah wrote the blessing near the nazirite who separated himself from wine and other pleasures. This teaches us that the blessings come to the person who separates himself from pleasures. So writes the <i>Toldot Yizhak.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Numbers, 6:24–26.</i>
“<i>Moses finished setting up the Tabernacle</i>” [7:1]. He completed setting up the Tabernacle. Rashi asks a question. Why does the verse not say on which day the Tabernacle was set up? The explanation is that Moses erected the Tabernacle for seven whole days, and every day of the seven days he took down the Tabernacle, but it happened on <i>the first day of Nisan</i> that the seven days ended and he erected the Tabernacle and allowed it to stand and did not take it down.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 7:1.</i>
Bahya writes. “<i>The one who presented</i> … <i>one silver bowl</i> … <i>one ladle</i>” [7:12–14]. Each chieftain brought a silver bowl and a ladle, a kid and two oxen, no more. It is a parable. A king is traveling on the road. The nobles honor him with few honors. The king says: I am a king over you and you do not honor me the way a king used to be honored. The nobles responded to the king. We are now on the road. When we will come home to the proper land, then we will honor you accordingly. So too, Israel were in the wilderness, and in no land, so they brought little as sacrifices. However, when they will come into the land, they will bring much, as the verse says, “<i>May it please You to make Zion prosper</i> … <i>then bulls will be offered on Your altar</i>” [Psalms, 51:20–21]. When Zion will be built, then we will bring many oxen as sacrifices, as we find concerning King Solomon when he finished building the Temple. He brought twenty-two thousand oxen as sacrifices at one time, and also one hundred and twenty thousand sheep.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Numbers, 7:1.</i>
“<i>The chieftains of the tribes drew near</i>” [7:2]. The chieftains brought sacrifices. They were the watchmen that Pharaoh had set over Israel to supervise that Israel should work properly. When Israel did not work quickly, Pharaoh had these watchmen beaten. They were from the tribes of Israel.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 7:2.</i>
<i>Rabbi Isserl</i> writes. The verse says, “<i>chieftains of Israel</i>” [7:2]. Why does it have to say, “<i>chieftains of the tribes</i>” [7:2]? Rashi gives the explanation. “<i>Chieftains of the tribes</i>” [7:2] teaches us that they were worthy to become chieftains over Israel because they were beaten for the sake of their brothers in Egypt. Therefore, the Holy One made them chieftains over Israel and therefore it says, “<i>the tribes.</i>” This means stick. That is to say, they were chieftains because they were beaten with sticks in Egypt. From here we learn that when someone is placed over Israel, as a <i>communal leader</i> or <i>member of the communal council</i>, and he allows himself to be beaten at times for the sake of Israel, then he is worthy to be a chieftain over Israel, and the Holy One honors him greatly.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">Be’ure Maharai, Numbers, 7:2.</i>
“<i>Six draught carts</i>” [7:3]. The chieftains brought six loaded wagons and twelve oxen, two oxen for each wagon. Moses did not want to take them until the Holy One told him to take them. <i>Rabbi Nathan</i> said: why did the <i>chieftains</i> bring sacrifices first and when the Tabernacle was built they brought things last to the Tabernacle. The explanation is that the chieftains said about the Tabernacle. Let all of Israel bring silver, gold, and silk, and we will donate whatever will be missing. However, Israel brought extra gold, silver and silk and there was nothing missing. Thus, the chieftains could not bring anything to the Tabernacle. They could only bring precious stones for the breastplate and the <i>ephod.</i> Therefore, the chieftains feared here if they delayed, and they brought sacrifices first. One should not save when doing good and each one should be first.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 7:3.</i>
Moses gave two wagons with four oxen to the children of Gershon the Levites. Bahya and Hizkuni write here. The children of Gershon carried the curtains and coverings that were pure silk and very light. Therefore, two wagons were enough. Moses gave four wagons and eight oxen to the children of Merari, since the children of Merari carried heavy things, the boards, rings, posts and thresholds. However, the children of Kehat were not given wagons because they carried the Table and the Ark, only holy things. Therefore, they had to carry them on their shoulders and not on wagons.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Numbers, 7:3; Hizkuni, Numbers, 7:5–8.</i>
Bahya writes. They brought six wagons relating to the six heavens. He did not want to count where the Holy One rests. Moses said before the Holy One: <i>Lord of the Universe</i>, if one of the oxen will die or a wheel will break, will the sacrifices of the chieftains be nullified? Therefore, the Holy One said: “<i>accept from them</i>” [7:5]. That is to say, take the oxen from them and they will live forever. The word “<i>vehayu</i>” means that they will live eternally. Some <i>rabbis</i> say that the oxen lived until King Solomon built the Temple and King Solomon offered them as sacrifices. <i>Rabbi Meir</i> said: they live forever and even in the present day. From here we can learn that if the oxen live forever, it is because they were joined to serve in the Tabernacle. How much more so, Israel who join themselves to the study of Torah and worship of the Holy One, they will certainly live forever.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Numbers, 7:3.</i>
“<i>The Lord said to Moses: one chieftain</i>” [7:11]. Moses did not want to accept the sacrifices until the Holy One said to Moses. Each chieftain should bring their sacrifice and in the order in which they traveled. The one who went first should bring his sacrifice first.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 7:11.</i>
“<i>Nahshon son of Amminadab of the tribe of Judah</i>” [7:12]. On the first day, Nahshon the chieftain brought a sacrifice and he brought the sacrifice from his own money and not from the money of the tribe of Judah.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 7:12.</i>
Bahya, Zeror ha-Mor, and Hizkuni write. Concerning Nahshon, it is written, “<i>and his sacrifice</i>” [7:12] with the <i>vav</i> [and] in the Torah, even though Nahshon was the first chieftain who brought a sacrifice. It should have said, “<i>his sacrifice</i>,” without the <i>vav.</i> All the other chieftains are written without a <i>vav.</i> The explanation is that Nahshon did not want to make himself important because he brought his sacrifice first. Therefore, it is written, “<i>and his sacrifice</i>” with the <i>vav</i>, just like he was not the first one. The <i>vav</i> also shows that just like someone else had brought his sacrifice and Nahshon was after him. Therefore, <i>chieftain</i> is also not written about Nahshon. <i>Chieftain</i> is written with regard to all the other <i>chieftains.</i> Concerning <i>Nahshon</i> it is only written, “<i>the one who presented his offering on the first day was Nahshon son of Amminadab of the tribe of Judah</i>” [7:12]. This teaches us that Nahshon was very <i>humble</i> and lowly. He did not consider himself a <i>chieftain.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Numbers, 7:12; Zeror ha-Mor, Numbers, 7:12–13, and Hizkuni Numbers, 7:12–13.</i>

“<i>On the second day, Nethanel son of Zuar, chieftain of Issachar made his offering</i>” [7:18]. Rashi writes here. It is written here concerning <i>Issachar</i>, the word, <i>brought near</i> [<i>hikriv</i>], a superfluous word not found regarding the other <i>chieftains.</i> The explanation is that <i>Reuben</i> saw that <i>Judah</i> brought a sacrifice first, before he brought one. Reuben said: is it not enough that Judah brought it before me, and I am the firstborn. I will not allow anyone to bring an offering before me. Moses said to Reuben. Let Issachar bring it after Judah. The Holy One ordered this so. Therefore, it is written, <i>brought near.</i> This means, let Issachar bring his sacrifice first. Therefore, it is written, <i>brought near, brought near</i> twice, for <i>Issachar</i> was <i>worthy</i> in two ways to bring his offering first. First is because he studied Torah. Therefore, it was just that he should bring the offering first. The second is because the <i>chieftain</i> of <i>Issachar</i> gave the advice that the chieftains should bring offerings and which offerings they should bring.<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 7:19.</i>
<i>Ibn Shuaib</i> writes. The portion teaches us that there is no better attribute among all attributes than to make oneself lowly, as we find concerning Abraham, who said, “<i>I who am but dust and ashes</i>” [Genesis, 18:27]. Moses and Aaron said, “<i>for who are we</i>” [Exodus, 16:7]. What are we? Concerning Moses it is also written, “<i>Moses was a very humble man</i>” [Numbers, 12:3]. He held himself very lowly. <i>King Saul</i> hid himself when they wanted to make him a king. He did not want to accept kingship over Israel. He was very righteous and modest. The Israelites had issued a ban on any daughter <i>marrying</i> anyone from the <i>tribe of Benjamin</i>, because the Benjaminites caused many to die in the <i>concubine in Gibeah</i> incident. Therefore, the Israelites issued a ban that nobody in Israel should marry Benjaminites. Afterwards, the Israelites reconsidered and allowed a dance to be held every year where the children of Benjamin could run off with Israelite maidens and marry them, and the Israelites allowed this to happen. This is how the Benjaminites married Israelites. <i>King Saul</i> was from the tribe of Benjamin and was very <i>bashful.</i> He was ashamed to run after a maiden until an important maiden came and asked him to dance. That is to say, she wanted him as a husband. <i>King Saul</i> allowed it to happen and he married that maiden. Therefore, she had a son with <i>King Saul</i> who was called <i>Jonathan.</i> He was a <i>good friend of David. Saul</i> wanted to kill David and <i>Jonathan</i> spoke strongly on behalf of David against his father, Saul. Saul became angry with Jonathan and called him, “<i>son of a perverse, rebellious woman</i>” [I Samuel, 20:30]. That is to say, you are <i>insolent.</i> You take after your mother, who was insolent with me and took me to dance. We also find that the <i>sages</i> said: hearing something that shames someone and hearing what <i>embarrasses</i> him and he remains silent, their reward is great. The Holy One gives them great honor, as we find. A pious person heard what bad things someone said about him. The pious person sent a present to that person and said to him. You have given me from your <i>merits</i> and therefore I am sending you a present. He said: the wise person is judged in the next world, all of his <i>merits</i> are brought and he says, I do not have so many <i>meritorious acts</i> in my lifetime. They respond: you were silent when others spoke ill of you. Therefore, one should try to be humble with his wealth and other things, as we find in the portion that the <i>chieftains</i> did not rely on their own merits, but on the merits of their ancestors.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">Ibn, Shuaib, <i>Derashot</i>, II: 328–332.</i>
Rashi writes. <i>Nahshon</i> remembered Adam with his sacrifice, since <i>Nahshon</i> brought a “<i>silver bowl</i>” [7:19], a silver bowl, and [the words] <i>silver bowl</i> has the numerical value of nine hundred and thirty, relating to the number of years that <i>Adam</i> lived, which was nine hundred and thirty. The bowl weighed one hundred and thirty weights. <i>Adam</i> was one hundred and thirty when he began to have children. “<i>A silver basin</i>” [7:19], a silver basin, and a “<i>silver basin</i>” has the numerical value of five hundred and twenty. This relates to <i>Noah</i>, who was five hundred years old when he had children and twenty years was the decree of the Flood, before his children were born. The basin weighed seventy weights and this related to the seventy nations who were descended from Noah’s children. “<i>A ladle</i>” [7:20], for the Torah that was given by the Holy One, with the <i>Ten Statements.</i> “<i>One bull</i>” [7:21]. An ox for <i>Abraham</i>, who fed the <i>angels</i> an ox. “<i>A ram</i>” [7:21]. A ram for <i>Isaac</i>; a ram was slaughtered as a sacrifice instead of Isaac, when his father wanted to bring a sacrifice at the <i>Akedah.</i> “<i>One sheep</i>” [7:21]. A sheep for <i>Jacob</i> who separated the sheep at Laban’s when he was guarding Laban’s sheep. “<i>One goat</i>” [7:22]. A goat that should be expiation for the children of Jacob who sold Joseph and who slaughtered a goat and dipped his shirt in its blood.<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 7:19–22.</i>
<i>Bahya</i> and <i>Ramban</i> ask a question. Why does the Torah have to write at such length about each chieftain separately? The offerings that each chieftain brought, a bowl and a ladle and the sacrifices were also the same for each one. The Torah should have written briefly about what offerings the first chieftain brought and regarding the other chieftains, the Torah should have written that they also brought the same things as the first one. The explanation is that the Torah writes about the offerings of each chieftain separately, to give them honor. If the Torah had written about the first one, that is Nahshon, and described his offerings at length and explicitly and had written about the others that they brought the same as the first one, then they would not have received any honor. Also, each chieftain had a different reason for bringing his offering, therefore the Torah writes about each chieftain separately.<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Numbers, 7:84; Ramban, Numbers, 7:13.</i>
“<i>On the seventh day, it was the chieftain of the Ephraimites</i>” [7:48]. Some sages say that the children of Joseph brought their sacrifice on the seventh day, which was the Sabbath. Even though one should not bring the sacrifice of an individual on the Sabbath, but what concerned all of Israel, that sacrifice was brought on the Sabbath. The explanation is that the Holy One said to Joseph, because you kept My commandment, “<i>do not commit adultery</i>,” not to engage in illicit sex in Egypt, before the Torah was given, therefore your children should also bring their offering on the Sabbath, even if they were <i>individuals.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Numbers, 7:48.</i>
<i>Zeror ha-Mor</i> writes. Because Joseph kept the Sabbath in Egypt, therefore, the Holy One said, you may bring your sacrifice on the Sabbath. Furthermore, the <i>Zeror ha-Mor</i> writes. Why did the Torah not mention the name of Joseph by the <i>chieftains of Ephraim and Menashe</i>, as we find by the counting. When they counted the Israelites, the name of Joseph was mentioned by <i>Ephraim and Menashe.</i> How much more so would it have been just to mention the name of Joseph at the offerings? The explanation is, our sages say that Joseph died more quickly than his brothers. “<i>Your servant, our father</i>” [Genesis, 43:28]. This means, the brothers said to Joseph before he identified himself, your servant our father said thusly, and this was a sin that he should have allowed to be said about his father, Jacob, about how he was a servant to Joseph. Because of this, the verse did not want to mention him by name at the sacrifices. Nonetheless, Joseph had enough honor that his two sons brought sacrifices.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">Zeror ha-Mor, Numbers, 7:54.</i>
“<i>Total silver of vessels</i>” [7:85]. <i>Rashi</i> asks a question here. Why does the Torah have to write again separately what the vessels weighed all together? The explanation is that it wants to show that even though each <i>chieftain</i> separately weighed and watched his bow, basin and ladle. When they weighed the bowls, basins, and ladles again together, they all weighed the same and not even a little weight was missing, but was equal. This was a novelty. When one first weighs many pounds, each pound separately, and afterwards when one weighs the same weight together, it weighs less. However, with the vessels of the chieftains, there was no loss when they were all weighed together.<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 7:85.</i>

“<i>He would hear the voice</i>” [7:89]. Bahya writes. The verse teaches us that the <i>voice</i> came from heaven, between the two birds that were in the Tabernacle. From the birds the <i>voice</i> came into the Tabernacle and whoever was outside did not hear it. Bahya writes. “<i>He spoke to him</i>” [7:89], teaches us that Moses answered God and was not frightened like the other prophets, who were frightened. Even when an angel spoke to a prophet, his soul left him out of fright. How much more so, when the Shekhinah itself spoke with a prophet, his soul left him. However, Moses Our Teacher responded to the Shekhinah immediately and was not frightened. Therefore, it is written, “<i>between the cherubim, thus He spoke to him</i>” [7:89].

Beha'alotcha

<i>King Solomon</i> writes, “<i>the light of the righteous is radiant; the lamp of the wicked is extinguished</i>” [Proverbs, 13:9]. He compares the soul of the righteous to a lamp, since the soul is like one lights a lamp from another lamp. So too, the soul was taken from the light of the <i>Throne of Glory</i>, and the light shines from itself; it does not come from anything else. However, the soul of the evildoer is like a lamp that burns with oil, wax or tallow. As soon as the oil or wax is used up, the light goes out. The evildoer’s soul depends on the body, which exists in the world through eating and drinking. As soon as he dies, the soul darkens because it only followed dark deeds. The souls are all taken from the Throne of Glory where there is only light, since only light rests near the Holy One. Even though is much light with the Holy One, thus the Holy One commanded Israel to light lights in the Tabernacle, to honor the Holy One. Therefore, the Torah says here.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Behalotekha, Introduction.</i>
“<i>When you mount the lamps</i>” [8:2]; to light them in the Tabernacle. The Midrash writes. The Holy One said: not that I need your light, but light for Me as I lighted in the wilderness with a pillar of fire, expecting that I will praise you before the nations, that you have honored Me. “<i>Speak to Aaron and say to him</i>” [8:2]. God said to Moses: You should tell Aaron that he should light lights in the Tabernacle that was in the wilderness. If he wants to think that one should light lights because there no windows in the Tabernacle, but in the Temple there were windows, so one does not need to light lights. Therefore the verse says, “<i>say to him.</i>” You should say to Aaron that he should also light lights in the Temple, even if it will have windows.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Numbers, 8:2.</i>
Toldot Yizhak and Bahya write. The Midrash gives a parable. A king loves one of his ministers very much and the king has the minister informed that he wants to be at his banquet. The minister prepared himself with everything for when the king comes. Many servants came with the king, with beautiful lights on all sides, with lovely golden candelabra. When the minister saw that the king had great honor with him, the nobleman was ashamed to show his servants and his candelabra, and picked up everything that he had prepared. The king said to the minister. Why did you not prepare for me? The minister responded. I saw the great glory and I was ashamed with what I had prepared, and I hid everything. The king then commanded that all of his golden candelabra and beautiful vessels and also the servants should be removed, and wanted to have the candelabra and servants of the minister serve him and illumine. So too was the Holy One. He is purely great light and came in to the Tabernacle and he ordered them to make a golden candelabrum to illumine for him. He wanted to have honor from Israel whom He loves.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Numbers, 8:2; Bahya, Numbers, 8:2.</i>
Hizkuni and Zeror ha-Mor write. Why was the portion of “<i>When you mount the lamps</i>” [8:2] written near the portion of the chieftains bringing their sacrifices? The explanation is that the Levites saw that the chieftains brought their sacrifices and the tribe of Levi did not bring something. The Levites became saddened and said, why are we worse than all of Israel and have not brought a sacrifice? The Holy One said to Levi, Aaron and his children: make a separate candelabrum to light the lights.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Numbers, 8:2; Zeror ha-Mor, Numbers, 8:2.</i>
“<i>This is how the lampstand was made</i>” [8:4]. The making of the candelabrum was very difficult for Moses. He could not make it, but the Holy One showed Moses a fiery candelabrum that Moses should copy. However, Moses could not make it. The Holy One had commanded Moses that he should throw ten weights of gold into the fire, and a finished candelabrum would emerge from the fire, as the verse says, “<i>the lampstand shall be made</i>” [Exodus, 25:31]. This means, the candelabrum should be made by itself. Our sages said; four things were difficult for Moses and the Holy One had to show him with His finger so that Moses should understand. The first thing that was difficult for Moses to understand was making the candelabrum. The second thing that was difficult for Moses to understand was bringing sacrifices. The third were the shekels that each one should give a silver coin at the counting of the Israelites. It was also difficult to make. He did not know what kind of coin each one should give. The fourth was that Moses did not know how they should <i>bless the new moon.</i> That is to say, when the moon first appears at the beginning of each month, Moses did not know when it was time to bless it. The word “<i>Mikshah</i>” [Exodus, 25:31] alludes to the four things that were difficult for Moses to understand, <i>Menorah, Korban, Shekalim, Ha-hodesh.</i> The <i>mem</i> of the word <i>mikshah</i> alludes to the <i>menorah</i> [candelabrum], the <i>kuf</i> alludes to <i>korbanot</i> [sacrifices], the <i>shin</i> alludes to <i>shekalim</i> [shekels], and the <i>heh</i> alludes to <i>ha-hodesh</i> [the month]. Even though the Holy One also had to show which wild or domestic animals one should eat or should not eat, and similarly, with the <i>creeping things</i>, the Holy One also showed with His hand. Yet, our sages only counted four that were difficult for Moses. So writes Bahya.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Numbers, 8:2.</i>
However, <i>Hizkuni</i> writes. There were only three things that were difficult for Moses to understand. However, the coin was not difficult to understand, but it was a question for Moses. How is it that such a small coin should be expiation for Israel in their counting?<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Numbers, 8:4.</i>
<i>Bahya</i> writes. The candelabrum was very holy. Therefore, when the Temple was destroyed, the candelabrum was hidden so that the enemy should not be able to capture it, because it was holy.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Numbers, 8:2.</i>
“<i>Take the Levites from among the Israelites</i>” [8:6]. Bahya and Hizkuni write. The Torah ordered that the Levites who had gotten mixed in with the Israelites after Mount Sinai, be taken and now should be selected. The portion was written after the portion of the lighting the lights. This shows us that the priests should light the lights and the Levites should do their service in the Tabernacle. Thus, the portions will be properly placed one after the other. First, the priests should light the lights. The Levites should do their service and afterwards that Israel should also worship God. They should celebrate the Passover in its proper time when they are pure and they should offer the Paschal sacrifice.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Numbers, 8:2; Bahya, Numbers, 8:2.</i>
“<i>This is what you shall do to them to cleanse them</i>” [8:7]. You should cleanse the Levites because they killed whoever had worshiped the Golden Calf at the incident of the Golden Calf. Moses ordered that the Levites be assembled and they killed all those who worshiped the Golden Calf. The Levites became impure from that time, from the people they killed. Therefore, they now had to be cleansed. They had to be sprinkled with pure water. All the hair of their bodies had to be shaved off with a razor, but the sidelocks of their head were not cut off.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Numbers, 8:7.</i>
Rashi and Bahya write that they were shorn because the Levites were expiation for the firstborn who used to do the service for God. Because the firstborn worshiped the Golden Calf, the firstborn were disqualified from doing the service in the Tabernacle. Because they worshiped the Golden Calf, which is called a foreign god, they were called dead. A leper is also called dead. Just as the leper is completely shorn when he is cleansed, so too the Levites were shorn because they were expiation for the first born who worshiped foreign gods.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 8:7; Bahya, Numbers, 8:7.</i>
Hizkuni writes here. Today also, when someone was an apostate and returns to Judaism, he must also immerse himself and must allow himself to be shorn.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Numbers, 8:7.</i>
“<i>Let Aaron designate the Levites</i>” [8:11]. Aaron raised up all the Levites from the ground, each of the twenty-two thousand individually. Korah mocked this and said that Moses made us all to be fools. He lifted us all up like fools and had us shorn like fools. However, this mocking came from a grudge.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Numbers, 8:20. The first part is found in Bahya. I was not able to find the source of the statement about Korah.</i>
“<i>For they are formally assigned to Me</i>” [8:16]. The Levites have been given to Me. It says, “<i>assigned</i>” two times. This shows us that the Levites were assigned to carry the Tabernacle and were also assigned to sing in the Tabernacle with good songs.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 8:16.</i>
“<i>I formally assign the Levites</i>” [8:19]. Rashi writes here. Israel is mentioned five times in this verse. This teaches us that the Holy One loves Israel. Therefore, they are mentioned five times, like the <i>five books of the Torah.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 8:19.</i>
Bahya writes. It is a parable. A child goes to the <i>teacher.</i> The father comes and asks about his child. He says: has my son eaten? Did my son drink? Has my son slept? Did my son go to the teacher? Did my son come home from the teacher? He mentions him at every question and says my son, out of love. So too is the Holy One. He mentions Israel five times in one verse, for the <i>five books of the Torah</i>, on which the world stands.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Numbers, 8:19.</i>
Bahya writes that one can see the great strength that Aaron had. He lifted up twenty-two thousand Levites from the ground in one day.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Numbers, 8:20.</i>
“<i>From twenty-five years of age up</i>” [8:24]. Bahya asks a question here. In the portion of Naso the verse says that the Levites should be counted from the age of thirty years. The explanation is that at the age of twenty-five the Levites were accepted so that they should learn the <i>service</i> in the Tabernacle. At thirty years he began to do the service in the Tabernacle. Our sages learn from here that a student who does not learn Torah from his teacher in five years. That is to say, he has not improved in five years; it is not a good sign for that student.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Numbers, 8:24.</i>
“<i>Shall serve no more</i>” [8:25]. When the Levite was fifty years old, he should no longer work in the Tabernacle. That is to say, he should not carry the Tabernacle on his shoulders. However, at that age he guarded the gate and sang in the Tabernacle. He helped load the wagons where the vessels of the Tabernacle were carried and guarded the perimeter of the Tabernacle. So writes Rashi.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 8:25.</i>
“<i>There should not be</i>” [8:19]. Hizkuni writes. If the firstborn had done the service in the Temple, many would have died. They would not be able to do the service properly. Sometimes, a firstborn of his father and his father and grandfather were not firstborn, and they did not know anything about the service. The son would follow them and would never have seen how the service was done. However, now that all the Levites had been taken to do the <i>service in the Temple</i>, the children would see from childhood how their fathers and grandfathers performed the service. They would also become expert in doing the service of the Tabernacle, particularly that their hands and fingers should know from their youth how to play the harps and organs in the Temple.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Numbers, 8:19.</i>
“<i>There were some people who were unclean by reason of a corpse</i>” [9:6]. There were men who were impure and could not make the <i>Paschal sacrifice.</i> These people came and asked Moses and Aaron in the study house and said: we are impure. Why should we be worse than others that we should also not bring the <i>Paschal sacrifice</i> with other Israelites? Moses responded: wait until I hear from the Holy One, what He will say about this. Rashi writes. Happy is <i>Moses Our Teacher</i> that he was so important that could always talk with the Holy One when he wanted to, and the Holy answered him.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 9:6–7.</i>
Zeror ha-Mor asks a question. What did the men ask when they were impure? How could they bring the Paschal sacrifice when they were impure? It is more questionable that Moses said that he would ask what the Holy One would say. Did not Moses know that when someone is impure, he is not supposed to bring the Paschal sacrifice? Another question is why do the men have to say, “<i>unclean though we are by reason of a corpse</i>” [9:7]. <i>Zeror ha-Mor</i> gives an explanation. The men said that Nadav and Avihu died in the Tabernacle. This is not because of their sins, since they were very righteous, and they cleaved to the service of God, as the verse says, “<i>through those near to Me I show Myself holy</i>” [Leviticus, 10:3]. This means, the Holy One said about Nadav and Avihu, the children of Aaron, because they were very important, more than other righteous people. Therefore, they had to die, expecting that all the people would fear God. They should say, when the Holy One allows such important people to die, how much more so, the Holy One would kill other ordinary people. Therefore, the men said, because Nadav and Avihu did not die because of their sins, when we carried the corpses of Nadav and Avihu out of the Tabernacle, we did not become impure from them. Therefore, we did not become impure from them. Therefore, the verse says, “<i>the soul of Adam</i>” [<i>le-nefe</i>sh Adam]. That is, Nadav and Avihu died because of the sin that Adam committed, that all people must die. Nonetheless, they did not have any sins. Therefore, Moses responded: I don not know this. I will ask the Holy One. The Holy One answered, “<i>a person who is defiled by a corpse</i>” [9:10], and does not say <i>Adam.</i> That is to say, regardless of the type of impurity it is, he should not celebrate the Passover when he is impure.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Zeror ha-Mor, Numbers, 9:6–7.</i>
Bahya asks a question. Why was it not counted that the Holy One had punished Moses Our Teacher that he did not know how to answer the rule to respond that one who is impure should not bring the Paschal sacrifice, just as Moses did not know the law regarding the daughters of <i>Zelophehad.</i> The sages say that Moses had sinned in not knowing the law concerning the daughters of <i>Zelophehad.</i> Because Moses held himself important and said, a difficult thing and judgment come to me and ask, and I will tell you. Moses did not speak properly in saying that he would deal with all the difficult judgments himself. Therefore, the Holy One punished him that the daughters of Zelophehad asked Moses a law that he did not know how to respond. However, here what sin did Moses commit that he was punished that he did not know the law about impure people and the Paschal sacrifice? The explanation is that it was no punishment from the Holy One that Moses did not know the law about impure people and the Paschal sacrifice, since the law was something new that they should delay Passover from Nisan to Iyyar. Therefore, Moses had to ask the Holy One. However, the law regarding the daughters of Zelophehad, that their father had no son but only daughters. The daughters asked Moses if the daughters should inherit from their father, because there is no son. Every ordinary person knows that the daughters should inherit when there is no son.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Numbers, 9:8.</i>
“<i>In the second month</i>” [9:11]. The Holy One ordered that whoever was impure should celebrate Passover in the month of Iyyar. On that Passover he has unleavened and leavened in his house, and does not celebrate the <i>festival</i> except that he ate the <i>unleavened bread</i> and <i>bitter herbs</i> along with the Paschal sacrifice.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 9:10.</i>
“<i>On the day that the Tabernacle was set up, the cloud covered</i>” [9:15]. When the Tabernacle was erected, a cloud came and covered the Tabernacle. At night the cloud turned into a pillar of fire that illumined until daybreak.
“<i>At a command of the Lord the Israelites broke camp</i>” [9:18]. Israel moved at the word of the Holy One. When the cloud arose, all of Israel arose with the cloud. Israel followed the cloud, and when the cloud stopped, all of Israel stopped with the cloud. When the cloud removed itself from the Tabernacle, the cloud wrapped itself around the children of Judah and stood over the children of Judah. That is to say, it was time to go and Judah went in front. They blew trumpets, but they did not move until Moses first said, “<i>advance O Lord, may Your enemies be scattered</i>” [10:35]. When Israel was supposed to rest, the cloud again came over the children of Judah and covered the children of Judah like a sukkah. The cloud did not move from Judah until Moses said, “<i>when it halted, he would say: return, O Lord, You who are Israel</i>’<i>s myriads of thousands</i>” [10:36].<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 9:18.</i>
“<i>As soon as the cloud lifted</i>” [9:21]. Hizkuni and Bahya write that all the Israelite’s journeys were in the morning and not midday and later.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Numbers, 9:21; Bahya, Numbers, 9:19.</i>
“<i>Have two silver trumpets made</i>” [10:2]. The Holy One ordered that two trumpets be made to assemble the people or the chieftains when Moses would need them. They should also be blown when they wanted to travel. How did they know what was needed when the trumpets were blown? The explanation is that they needed to assemble all of Israel before Moses, two trumpets were blown and when they needed to assemble the chieftains, then they blew one trumpet. Thus, they would understand that the chieftains were needed. When they were ready to travel on the way, then they blew two trumpets, but they blew <i>teruah</i> and <i>tekiah.</i> However, to assemble the people or the chieftains they only blew a <i>tekiah</i> alone without the <i>teruah.</i> Priests blew the trumpets, and the trumpets were made of silver and not gold, so that they should not be reminded of the Golden Calf that was made of gold. They also blew them when there was war and also when the sacrifices were brought. They blew so that Israel should hear that sacrifices are being brought and they should think and remember that God should accept the sacrifices to forgive their sins.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Numbers, 10:2.</i>
Rabbi Isserl asks a question. Why did they only blow [the trumpets] when the first two banners went, but they did not blow the trumpets when the last two banners went? The explanation is that Moses was like a king who walked in the middle of his people. When the king is ready to proceed, many noblemen stand in front of the king that they should go before him. Many noblemen also stand behind the king, so that they should follow him. The king’s carriage is in the middle of the people and nobody is supposed to move until the king says that they should go and the front should proceed.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Be’ure Maharai, Numbers, 10:6.</i>
So too, Moses was like a king in the middle of the people with the Tabernacle on the way. When the cloud removed itself from the Tabernacle, it was time for all of Israel to prepare to go. They arranged themselves in order. However, nobody was supposed to move until Moses ordered the trumpets to be blown. The first two banners began to move and did not need to blow anymore, since Moses followed the two banners and the last two banners followed Moses.
“<i>The flag of the camp of Judah</i>” [10:14], and <i>Issachar</i> and <i>Zebulon</i> went first. As soon as Judah started moving, Aaron and his children lowered the curtain and covered the Ark. Afterwards, the children of <i>Gershon</i> and <i>Merari</i> came and took down the Tabernacle, and placed the Tabernacle on the wagons. The children of Kehat prepared the Ark and the <i>holy vessels</i> and the poles to carry them. When the children of Reuben went, the Levites began to move. When the cloud stopped, the children of Gershon and Merari erected the Tabernacle. The children of Kehat were still moving with the Ark and came to the Tabernacle when it was ready, just like one prepared an inn for the king before he arrives.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 10:17, 21.</i>
“<i>The standard of the camp of Dan at the rear of all the camps</i>” [10:25]. Because the tribe of Dan was very large, therefore they were at the end. If something was lost by one of the Israelites, the children of Dan returned it and they moved like a box.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 10:25.</i>
Hizkuni writes. That is to say, they went on all four sides. Dan went to the north, but because his people were so numerous, they went on the west side. Therefore, they found everything. Hizkuni asks: the children of Judah were more numerous. The explanation is that the children of Dan were more numerous than all the other tribes and they went behind the Tabernacle. When an Israelite was not able to travel with his tribe, he went with Dan, who was in the back.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Numbers, 10:25.</i>
“<i>Come with us and we will be generous with you</i>” [10:29]. Moses said to his father-in-law, come with us to the land of Israel. We will do good for you. Jethro answered: I will not, I will go to my land.
“<i>We are setting out</i>” [10:29]. We will come into the land of Israel in three days. So said Moses to Jethro, but Israel committed a sin and Israel had to remain for forty years in the wilderness. Rashi asks a question. Why did Moses say, we will go into the land of Israel in three days. The explanation is that Moses was ashamed before Jethro that he should say before him that he would not come into the land of Israel. That is to say, he was also counting himself in the community.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 10:29.</i>
“<i>Please do not leave us</i>” [10:31]. Moses asked Jethro. He said: I ask you very much that you should go with us, so that the nations should not say that you converted, expecting that you wanted a share in the land of Israel. Now that you do not have a share in the land of Israel, you have separated yourself from us and from our God. Therefore, go with us because you have seen the signs and wonders that God did in the wilderness.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 10:31.</i>
“<i>Can be our eyes</i>” [10:31]. You Jethro will be a guide for us. Bahya asks a question. Israel had the cloud going before Israel. Why did they need Jethro to show them the way? The explanation is that Moses was consoling the ordinary people who did not properly believe in God and were worried that they would not come to any land. Therefore, Moses said to Jethro. Go with us, you know the way. Thus, Israel will certainly know that they are going properly. Another explanation is that Moses said: you will go with us, expecting that you will be a guide for us. That is to say, to show the nations that we properly serve God, who has done many signs for us in the wilderness. Your testimony will help more with the nations, because you were a gentile and converted, because you saw the miracles and wonders of God. Therefore, Moses said to Jethro: go with us to testify before the nations, expecting that the nations should also convert.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Numbers, 10:31.</i>
“<i>A distance of three days</i>” [10:33]. When the Israelites were supposed to take three days, they went in one day, expecting that the Holy One would quickly bring them into the land of Israel.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 10:33.</i>
“<i>The Ark of the Covenant</i>” [10:33]. The <i>Holy Ark</i> traveled three days journey before Israel, to show the way. In the Ark were the tablets that Moses had broken when Israel made the Golden Calf. There was a second Ark in the middle of the community of Israel in which were the important tablets. The clouds were around the four sides of the Israelites. One cloud was over them, one cloud behind them, and one cloud was before them. It lowered the mountains before them and smoothed the ground under them. Where there was a valley, the cloud filled in the valley so that Israel did not need to go into any valleys. The same cloud burned the large snakes, as big as pillars that were in the desert.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 10:33–34.</i>
“<i>They marched from the mountain of the Lord</i>” [10:33]. They quickly ran away from Mount Sinai. They feared that the Holy One would give them more commandments, and they did not want to have any more commandments. The Torah did not write about this sin explicitly, because they only had it in their thoughts. However, the Holy One knew their thoughts well and showed it to us.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban, Numbers, 10:35.</i>
Another explanation is that they said, “<i>be our eyes</i>” [10:31]. That is to say, Moses said to Jethro: Israel will learn from you how to be pious. They will say, Jethro was a gentile and is pious. How much more so, we are the children of <i>Abraham, Isaac and Jacob</i>, how can we not be pious?<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Numbers, 10:31.</i>
Bahya writes. The Torah wrote the portion of “<i>when the Ark was about to set out</i>” [10:35], among the portions where Israel spoke ill of God, because the Ark performed wonders. This shows that God has power over everything. It is known that the world is divided into three parts. One third of the world is <i>sea</i>, one third is wilderness, and the third part is where people live, which is the <i>dry land.</i> When they were supposed to go to the land of Israel, the Holy One led them through the three parts; first through the sea. The Holy One showed His wonders that He changed the sea to dry land, so that they should not say that the world was created by itself, and that God could not create the world. Therefore, the Holy One showed that He changed the third part from <i>sea to dry land</i> and again from <i>dry land to sea.</i> Afterwards, the Holy One led Israel in the wilderness, where no person ever went, because of large snakes. He showed Israel that God has power over all things. When Israel came from the wilderness into the land of Israel, this is a third part of the world and the Holy One again showed wonders to Israel and knocked down the strong walls of <i>Jericho.</i> This was against nature, but this was a wonder of God. Therefore, Moses said by the Ark, “<i>may Your enemies be scattered, and may Your foes flee before You</i>” [10:35]. That is to say, the Holy One’s <i>Shekhinah</i> rests on the Ark. He makes the enemies flee from Israel and shows wonders. When it halted, Moses said, “<i>return, O Lord</i>” [10:36]. That is to say, <i>Lord of the Universe</i>, cause the ten thousand to rest on their places, that nobody should have misfortune.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Numbers, 10:35.</i>
“<i>Bitterly before the Lord</i>” [11:1]. Rashi writes. Israel spoke ill of God. Their intention was that God should listen to them. They wanted to anger God and said: we have not rested in three days. The Holy One did this for good. He wanted to bring them quickly to the land of Israel.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 11:1.</i>
“<i>The outskirts of the camp</i>” [11:1]. The Holy One burned the <i>mixed multitude</i> among Israel. Some say that He burned the princes of Israel. That is to say, the most important among them. Moses prayed to God and the fire sank into the ground.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 11:1.</i>
<i>Toldot Yizhak</i> and <i>Devek Tov</i> ask a question here. Why was the fire not extinguished or why did the fire not go up as is natural for fire? Why did the fire sink into the ground? The explanation is that the Holy One did not extinguish the fire or let it rise, expecting that Israel should fear the fire that is in the ground. They would remember the evil that they did. Perhaps the fire might come out of the earth again and burn them.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Numbers, 11:2; Devek Tov, p. 148, n. 4.</i>
“<i>The riffraff in their midst</i>” [11:4]. It was the <i>mixed multitude</i> that consisted of many Egyptians who left with Israel when they went out of Egypt and converted.
They desired to eat meat and they caused Israel to sin. They said together, who will give us meat to eat? Even though many cattle and sheep went with Israel out of Egypt, and if you want to say that they ate them and now they have no meat to eat, this cannot be. The verse says, “<i>the Reubenites owned cattle in very great numbers</i>” [Numbers, 32:1]. This means that Israel went out of the wilderness into the <i>land of Israel</i> after forty years; the children of Reuben had many flocks. However, Israel thought up many <i>accusations.</i> Even though they had meat, yet they wanted to have more.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 11:4.</i>
Ramban writes. The rich Israelites had enough meat, as is customary in a war when many people are together, meat is expensive. However, those who are not rich, they do not have any meat. Therefore, they were shouting that they wanted to have meat.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban, Numbers, 11:4.</i>
“<i>We remember the fish that we used to eat free</i>” [11:5]. They said: we remember that we ate fish in Egypt for free. Rashi asks a question here. They did not give Israel straw for free, so how is it that they should have given them fish for free? The explanation is that they said: we ate fish in Egypt free of the commandments.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 11:5.</i>
<i>Devek Tov</i> writes here. That is to say, we ate fish, not for the sake of our commandments. We had no commandments in Egypt, but now when we transgress the commandments of God, God will not give us food to eat. It is that we must fulfill the commandments. God will give us everything good to eat as a reward. However, in Egypt we ate even when we did not fulfill any commandments and we were not afraid.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Devek Tov, p. 148, n. 5.</i>
Ramban, Ibn Shuaib, and Hizkuni write. Bahya also cites Ramban that the Egyptians gave fish for free, so that the Israelites helped pull the nets with fish from the water. It was very tiring to help the fishermen. The Egyptians gave the small fish to the Israelites, so that they had to work with the fishermen. The custom is that the fishermen are given small fish. <i>Bahya</i> writes further that the Talmud says that the Holy One gave Israel fish when the women went with their jugs to the water. The Holy One caused the fish to enter their jugs.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban, Numbers, 11:5; Ibn Shuaib, II: 343; Hizkuni, Numbers, 11:5; Bahya, Numbers, 11:5.</i>
<i>Toldot Yizhak</i> and <i>Bahya</i> write. “<i>The fish</i> [<i>dagah</i>]” [11:5] means stinking fish. When the <i>Egyptians</i> had the <i>idea</i> that they wanted to kill the <i>Israelites</i> with dead fish that were very old, four or five days, and were very unhealthy to eat. However, the fish that were caught that day were not given to the <i>Israelites.</i> Therefore, it is written here, “<i>we remember the fish</i> [<i>dagah</i>]” [11:5], and it is not written <i>the fish</i> [<i>ha-dag</i>]. Where it is written fish [<i>dagah</i>], it means a dead fish, as we find with regard to <i>Jonah</i> and the fish that swallowed him. <i>Jonah prayed</i>, as the verse says, “<i>Jonah prayed to the Lord from the belly of the fish</i>” [Jonah, 2:2]. It is written here that <i>Jonah prayed</i> from the belly of <i>the fish</i> [<i>dagah</i>]. This means, from the belly of a dead fish. The fish died as soon as it swallowed <i>Jonah.</i> Since it was dead, the Holy One sent a living fish to swallow <i>Jonah</i>, since it is not <i>respectful</i> for a <i>righteous person</i> to be in a dead fish. Therefore, it is written, “<i>the Lord commanded the fish, and it spewed out Jonah</i>” [Jonah, 2:11]. This was a living fish, since a dead fish could not spew out what is in it. Therefore, here too, the <i>Egyptians</i> gave the dead fish to the Israelites, expecting that the fish would harm them.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Numbers, 11:5; Bahya, Numbers, 11:5.</i>
<i>Rashi</i> and <i>Bahya</i> write. “<i>The cucumbers</i>” [11:5]. The <i>Israelites</i> said: we remember the pumpkins, cucumbers and the onions and garlic that we ate in Egypt. Rashi writes here. The <i>manna</i> had the taste of all the foods in the world, but the <i>manna</i> did not have the <i>taste</i> of cucumbers, pumpkins, onions or garlic. Therefore, the <i>Israelites</i> said: we have everything, but these foods we do not have. The Holy One did this for good, since all the foods they thought about, like pumpkins, cucumbers, onions or garlic, are not good for a woman who is nursing a child. She loses her milk because of them. Also, it is difficult for a woman who is pregnant to eat.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 11:5; Bahya, Numbers, 11:5.</i>
<i>Zeror ha-Mor</i> writes. The <i>manna</i> caused that the person should fulfill <i>commandments</i>, study <i>Torah</i> and to think to do good. They spoke ill and they wanted such food that would make them lively to do pleasurable things for the body. Concerning this, our sages said: <i>free, without commandments.</i> That is to say, the Israelites said. We ate pumpkins and cucumbers in Egypt that did not bring us to fulfill commandments. We were free of the commandments, but the <i>manna</i> causes the person to fulfill commandments and study Torah.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">Zeror ha-Mor, Numbers, 11:5.</i>
“<i>Now our gullets are shriveled. There is nothing at all. Nothing but this manna to look to</i>” [11:6]. The Israelites said: day and night we eat nothing but <i>manna.</i> That is to say, we are disgusted with eating the <i>manna</i> as our food all the time. However, the Holy One praised the <i>manna</i> and said how very good the <i>manna</i> was. It looked like coriander seed and was the color of crystal.
<i>Zeror ha-Mor</i> writes. The Holy One praised the <i>manna.</i> It is known that for a food to be good, it must have four qualities. The first is that it must be healthy for the head and body. The second is that the food must look nice before one eats it. This makes the person desire it. The third is that it must be sweet in the mouth. The fourth is that it must be clean. Concerning the first, the Holy One said, “<i>like coriander seed</i>” [11:7]. That is to say, the <i>manna</i> is healthy like coriander, which is healthy for the head and the eyes. The second is, “<i>in color it was like crystal</i>” [11:7]. It is a crystal that is a delight to look at. The third is “<i>like rich cream</i>” [11:8], sweet like honey and oil. The fourth is “<i>when the dew fell</i> … <i>the manna would fall upon it</i>” [11:9]. That is to say, it was clean below and above, the dew from heaven.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">Zeror ha-Mor, Numbers, 11:7–9.</i>
<i>Toldot Yizhak</i> writes. The Israelites said that the <i>manna</i> was very white; it blinded their eyes. The Holy One said: “<i>in color it was like crystal</i>” [11:7]. It was like a crystal out of which one makes eyeglasses that the old people place on their nose and see with them. That is to say, it does not take away the sight. It is good for the sight.<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Numbers, 11:6–8.</i>
<i>Hizkuni</i> writes. “<i>Our gullets are shriveled</i>” [11:6]. This means, the Israelites said, we are eating the <i>manna</i> and we have no excretion from our bodies, as we have with other foods, since the <i>manna</i> remains in our bodies. The Israelites said: we will die; our bellies are swollen. Hizkuni asks a question. The Holy One had ordered that each Israelite should make an iron nail to have when they would attend to their bodily needs in the wilderness, he should cover the excrement with earth using the nail, so that his friend should not see his excrement. Thus, it is heard that the Israelites did have bodily excretions in the wilderness, even though they ate <i>manna.</i> The explanation is they ate food that the Israelites bought from other nations who brought food into the wilderness and sold the food to the Israelites. It was from that food that the Israelites had excretions in the wilderness. That is why the Holy One told them to make an iron nail for that purpose.<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Numbers, 11:6.</i>
Rashi writes. “<i>Gather it, grind it between millstones or pound it in a mortar</i>” [11:8], means that the <i>manna</i> had all the tastes. It smelled like it had just been ground in the mill. It had the taste as if it had been pounded in the mortar, and had a taste as if it had been cooked in a pot.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 11:8.</i>
Hizkuni writes. The Talmud writes that the righteous ate the <i>manna</i> as it fell from heaven. The intermediate people pounded the <i>manna</i> in the mortar and ate it. The evildoers boiled it in a pot and ate it.<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Numbers, 11:8.</i>
“<i>Weeping, every clan apart</i>” [11:10]. Rashi writes. They gathered in family groups and cried. They wanted to show their evil hearts that they had spoken evil about God. However, our sages say in the Talmud that they cried about the families, that they had been forbidden that nobody should sleep with <i>someone else</i>’<i>s w</i>ife, or sister, or mother-in-law. Therefore, they were crying.<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 11:10.</i>
<i>Imre Noam</i> asks a question. Why did they cry now, when they were forbidden to engage in illicit sex? They should have cried at Mount Sinai, when illicit sex was forbidden. <i>Imre Noam</i> gives an explanation. Israel did not want to mar the joy at Mount Sinai. Therefore, they did not want to cry, but now they cried.<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">Imre Noam, Numbers, 11:10.</i>
One can give another explanation. The <i>manna</i> told who was engaging in illicit sex, as the Talmud says in [tractate] <i>Yoma.</i> When a woman’s husband died, she took another husband three months after her husband’s death, and had a child with the second man. They could not know if the child came from the first husband, and it was nine months from the first husband. Or, was the child from the second husband, and was born in the seventh month after she married the second husband. They could not find the truth, but only through the <i>manna.</i> The <i>manna</i> fell from heaven on each one’s tent, one measure for each person. If there were ten people in one tent, ten measures of <i>manna</i> fell. If the child was from the first husband who had died, then the measure of <i>manna</i> from heaven for the child fell before the tent of the first husband. That is to say, the <i>manna</i> showed that the child was from the first husband. If it was the second husband’s child, then the portion fell in front of the tent of the second husband. Therefore, the woman was very fearful to engage in illicit sex since she thought that the <i>manna</i> would inform on her that she engaged in illicit sex.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Yoma,</i> 75a.</i>
“<i>Did I conceive all the people</i>” [11:12]? Moses said to the Holy One. Why have you placed the burden of Israel upon me? Did I carry them in my belly? Did I give birth to them like a mother gives birth to a child that you should say to me, carry them like a nursemaid carries the children that she nurses?
“<i>Kill me rather</i>” [11:15]. Moses said: if You want to do this to me, that I should have the burden alone, kill me instead. Bahya asks a question here. Why does he have to say, “<i>Kill me rather</i>” [11:15], twice? The explanation is that Moses said: <i>Lord of the Universe</i>, I will be killed in any event. If I will say anything to Israel, they will kill me. If I will not fulfill Your mission, then I am guilty of the death penalty, because I have not fulfilled Your mission. Therefore, he says, “<i>Kill me rather</i>” [11:15].<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Numbers, 11:15.</i>
There are three types who bring evil, heaven forbid, upon themselves. The first is, the one who throws crumbs of bread on the ground; he has poverty. The second is, the one who curses himself. An evil angel comes before the Holy One in heaven and says: this person desires evil upon himself. Even though Moses said, “<i>erase me from the record</i>” [Exodus, 32:32]. He said to the Holy One: erase me from the <i>Book of Life</i>, that is to say, he should die. At that time, Israel had made the Golden Calf. Nonetheless, Moses did not die because he did not say this in anger. However, here Moses was speaking only out of anger. Therefore, Moses died because of that statement. The third is one who lights a light at the <i>close of the Sabbath</i> before [the prayers] <i>Vayehi Noam</i> and <i>Ata Kadosh</i> are recited. So writes the <i>Zeror ha-Mor.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">Zeror ha-Mor, Numbers, 11:15.</i>
“<i>Gather for me seventy men</i>” [11:16]. The Holy One ordered that Moses should gather seventy elders from the Israelites to help Moses in all things. That is to say, the Holy One answered Moses. You will not be alone to have the burden of Israel. Rashi and Bahya ask. There was a demand for seventy elders still in Egypt. The explanation is that those elders were burned in <i>Tabherah</i> [11:3]. The Israelites had spoken ill of the Holy One. The elders did not speak any ill words at <i>Tabherah</i> against God, Blessed be He, but they did because of guilt at <i>the giving of the Torah</i>, when they did not keep themselves honest. God was on Mount Sinai and gave the Torah. They looked too much at the cloud where God was, but the Holy One did not want to mar the joy of the Torah. Therefore, the Holy One killed those elders; since they were mourning about this, let them mourn properly. The Holy One said: choose the elders who allowed themselves to be beaten in <i>Egypt</i> because of the Israelites. They were placed over Israel by Pharaoh. These <i>elders</i> made the work easier in Egypt and allowed themselves to be beaten because of it. Therefore, they were worthy to be masters over Israel. You should say to the elders that it is good that they are worthy to be masters over the children of God. Place them near you so that Israel should see and should <i>fear</i> them.<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 11:16; Bahya, Numbers, 11:16.</i>
“<i>I will draw upon the spirit that is on you</i>” [11:17]. The Holy One said: I will separate some of your prophecy and place it on them. Bahya writes. Moses was worthy because he had transcended his body to kill himself for the sake of Israel. Therefore, the Torah compared this, that like the Holy One gives the <i>spirit of prophecy</i> on the person, similarly the Holy One said: you should give from your prophecy upon Israel, so that the elders received their prophecy from Moses. When the Holy One spoke with Moses, at the same time the prophecy came from Moses upon the elders and the elders also heard Him speaking with Moses.<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Numbers, 11:17.</i>
Bahya and Hizkuni write. Could not the Holy One give from His spirit on the elders and not spirit from Moses? The explanation is a parable. A person hired a watchman to guard his garden. Afterwards, the watchman came to the master and said: I cannot guard the garden alone; give me more watchmen. Finally, he said: if I will pay you, then you must pay the other watchmen. So too, the Holy One said to Moses: I gave you to guard Israel alone. Therefore, Moses, you must also give from your prophecy to the elders, because you had enough <i>strength</i> to lead Israel. Therefore, you must share some of your prophecy with the elders. However, in any event it did not harm Moses that he should have less prophecy, because he gave some of his prophecy. This is just like a light from which everyone lights and that light is not diminished. So too was Moses, he continually gave his prophecy and his prophecy remained whole. We find that after the <i>Israelites</i> had been in the wilderness for forty years, it is written, “<i>single out Joshua</i> … <i>and lay your hand upon him</i>” [Numbers, 27:18]. The Holy One said to Moses: take Joshua and give him from your prophecy to Joshua. It is written afterwards, “<i>Joshua son of Nun was filled with the spirit of wisdom</i>” [Deuteronomy, 34:9]. This means, from the spirit that Moses gave to Joshua, Joshua was filled with prophecy. It must be heard from here that Moses kept his prophecy, close to his death, even when Joshua had enough prophecy from Moses.<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Numbers, 11:17; Hizkuni, Numbers, 11:17.</i>
However, Imre Noam said. The Holy One said that you should give part of your spirit. That is, just as you have a spirit that is not haughty, but lowly and can suffer <i>abusiveness</i> from the people, so too, it should be that the elders should have such a humble spirit. However, in any event the spirit and the prophecy came from the Holy One.<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">Imre Noam, Numbers, 11:17.</i>
“<i>But a whole month</i>” [11:20]. The Holy One said: You will eat meat for a month, thirty days. Rashi writes. Some sages say that the <i>worthy Israelites</i> ate meat and suffered for thirty days and died after a month. The evildoers still had not digested the meat and had it between their teeth and they died immediately. Some sages say the <i>opposite.</i> The evildoers suffered for thirty days, but the worthy ones died immediately and suffered little.<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 11:20.</i>
“<i>Become loathsome to you</i>” [11:20]. The Holy One said: you will eat meat for a month and it will become loathsome to you and you will die because of it.<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Numbers, 11:20.</i>
“<i>Moses said, six hundred thousand men</i>” [11:21]. Moses said to the Holy One. Six hundred thousand men went out of Egypt and now you want to kill them. You say that they will eat meat for a month and afterwards you want to kill them?<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 11:22.</i>
“<i>Could enough flocks and herds be slaughtered to suffice them?</i>” [11:22]. That is to say, is it just that one should slaughter sheep and cattle for them so that in the end it should be forever. It is just like one says to a donkey. We will give you a measure of oats to eat and then we will chop off your head. The Holy One answered, if I had not given them any meat, then they would say, I do not have any strength, that I was able to give them meat in the wilderness. They would desecrate My holy name. Therefore, I will give them meat. Afterwards, they must all be destroyed. I see that Israel are only looking for <i>accusations.</i> If I would give them ox meat, they would say that I should have given them mutton. If I would give them mutton, they would say that I should have given them ox meat. If I would have given them fish from the water, Israel would always say, I do not have <i>strength</i> to do Your will. <i>Moses</i> answered: <i>Lord of the Universe</i>, I will go to Israel and I will convince them that they should not speak evil.<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 11:22–23.</i>
The Holy One said. “<i>You shall soon see whether what I have said happens to you or not</i>” [11:23]. That is to say, You will see that I am right; they will not follow you. Moses came and said to Israel. Does not God have the power to do everything that he wants? He has given us enough water to drink from a rock and <i>manna</i> from heaven. Israel answered: this incident shows that He has no power to do our will.<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 11:23.</i>
Toldot Yizhak, Ibn Shuaib, and Bahya write. Israel had enough cattle to eat, but they said that the Holy One did not tell them to eat meat. Does one have to sprinkle the blood on the altar and burn the fat? Therefore, the verse says, “<i>if only we had meat to eat</i>” [11:18]. That is to say, who will cause us to eat enough meat? There are only three priests, Aaron and his two sons. Will they be able to sprinkle enough blood and [burn] fat to feed meat to all of Israel? However, to gather fish, they had enough to eat. Therefore it is not written, “<i>if only we had meat to eat</i>” [11:18]. That is to say, where are there priests who could give us enough meat to eat? The Holy One said: I will show you that you will be able to eat meat. Though you have few priests, I will give you the birds called quail. They do not need to have their blood sprinkled or their fat burned on the altar.<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Numbers, 11:21–22; Ibn Shuaib; II: 344–345; Bahya Numbers, 11:21.</i>
<i>Toldot Yizhak</i> writes further. Why did the Holy One say that they would eat meat for a whole month and afterwards the Holy One killed them before they had digested the meat between their teeth? The Holy One should have waited for a month. The explanation is because the Holy One said: they would eat meat and die. Afterwards, Moses said to the Holy One, because You said to Israel that they would eat so much meat that they will die because of it, since the food will harm them. Israel will guard themselves from eating too much, so that they should not die from it, since You told them the secret that they will die from eating too much meat, even if much cattle and sheep would be slaughtered and the fish of the sea would be collected for them. They will guard themselves from eating too much, expecting that they should not die. Therefore, Moses said to the Holy One, perhaps Your decree will not be fulfilled and they will not die. The Holy One answered: “<i>is there a limit to the Lord</i>’<i>s power</i>” [11:23]. That is to say, does the Holy One not have the power to kill them, even if they would only eat a little meat? “<i>The meat was still between their teeth</i>” [11:33]. The meat was still between their teeth when they died. That is to say, the Holy One killed them even if they had only eaten a little. The Holy One had seen that they had eaten little, expecting that they would not die. Therefore, the Holy One showed them that He could kill them, even if they had eaten a little bit.<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Numbers, 11:21–22.</i>
“<i>Two men had remained in the camp</i>” [11:26]. Bahya, Ibn Shuaib, and Rashi write. The Holy One ordered that seventy elders be selected in Israel. Moses said that there are twelve tribes, and if I would take six from each tribe, there would be two left over. If I would take five elders from two tribes, then the tribes would argue? They would say,why do you want to diminish a tribe and want to take five elders from one tribe and from the other tribes want to take six elders to be prophets? Moses took seventy-two notes and wrote, elder, on seventy of them and he wrote nothing on two of them, but left them blank and placed them among the seventy-two notes. He selected six elders from each tribe, so that there were seventy-two elders, which is six times twelve, for a total of seventytwo. He mixed up the notes and each elder took out a note. If he had in his hand a note on which was written, elder, then he became an elder and a prophet. If he received an empty note, on which nothing was written, then the Holy One did not want to accept him as an elder and he had to separate from the elders. In any event, they cast lots as to who would pick the notes first. The first one had a better possibility to receive a note that would make him an elder, since in the beginning there were many notes on which was written, elder. Therefore, they threw lots as to who would begin. <i>Eldad</i> and <i>Medad</i> were two elders that Moses had chosen to participate in the lottery. They were very pious and held themselves very lowly. They said: should we go to the lottery? Perhaps the lot will fall upon us to be elders and two other elders will be embarrassed and have to leave the lottery, because the Holy One does not want them to be <i>elders.</i> Some sages say that <i>Eldad</i> and <i>Medad</i> did not go into the Tabernacle to the lottery. They said: let the other seventy remain elders. It is a quorum without us. This was very humble of them. The lot may have fallen upon them and they might have been elders and members of the <i>Sanhedrin.</i> Some sages say that <i>Eldad and Medad</i> did go into the Tabernacle, because they had been commanded and they did not want to transgress Moses’ command. When they came to the lottery, sixty-eight elders had taken out notes and were elders. Two elders had empty notes in their hands that they should not be in the community. Two notes remained on which was written that they should be elders. They should have been for <i>Eldad and Medad.</i> They did not want to take them and said: let the two remaining notes be for those who have the empty notes. They are more <i>worthy</i> than us, even though the Holy One did not want to have them and the Holy One wanted to have us. We will go out and not become <i>elders.</i> Nonetheless, even though they made themselves humble, they were <i>worthy</i> to have much more honor than all the <i>elders.</i> First, the elders could only <i>prophesy</i> about what would happen in their own times. However, these two prophets prophesied about what would happen in the days of the <i>Messiah</i> with <i>Gog and Magog.</i> Furthermore, the names of the elders were not written down. However, the two prophets had their names written down. Furthermore, the other elders prophesied from the spirit of Moses. However, these two <i>elders</i> prophesied form the spirit of the Holy One. All the elders died in the wildernes, but <i>Eldad and Medad</i> came into the land of Israel.<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Numbers, 11:25; Ibn Shuaib, II: 345–346; Rashi, Numbers, 11:26.</i>
“<i>He said, my lord Moses, restrain them</i>” [11:28]. Gershon the son of Moses ran and said to his father, Moses that the two prophets were prophesying in the gate of the Israelites. <i>Joshua</i> answered before Moses and said to Moses: let them be put into prison. Here one asks a question. Because they studied Torah and prophesied, they should be put in prison for this? The explanation is that <i>Eldad</i> and <i>Medad</i> were prophesying that Moses would die and Joshua would lead Israel into the land of Israel. It hurt <i>Joshua</i> very much that they were shaming their <i>teacher, Moses.</i> When they also praised <i>Joshua</i> that he would lead Israel into the land of Israel. Further, it impugned his honor and he desired that they should be put in prison.<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 11:27–28; Zeror ha-Mor, Numbers, 11:27.</i>
“<i>Moses then reentered the camp together with the Elders of Israel</i>” [11:30]. Moses and the elders assembled. Zeror ha-Mor writes. This shows us that Moses was a humble person in his opinions, that he was not upset when he saw that the seventy elders had authority like him, and not like other people who want to have sole authority and no other person should have more authority.<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">Zeror ha-Mor, Numbers, 11:29.</i>
Toldot Yizhak, Zeror ha-Mor, and Ibn Shuaib write that the two <i>prophets, Eldad and Medad</i>, were the half brothers of Moses on his father’s side. <i>Amram</i> had heard Moses, his son, saying that it was forbidden to marry one’s aunt, and Amram had married his aunt Yocheved. Now that he heard from Moses that the Torah would forbid one’s aunt, <i>Amram</i> divorced <i>Yocheved</i>, the mother of Moses. Amram took another wife and had <i>Eldad and Medad.</i> That is why one was called <i>Eldad.</i> This means, not my father. That is to say, they were not born from the aunt. <i>Medad</i> means, where is the father, or who is the father. That is to say, he was also not born from an aunt.<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Numbers, 11:25–26; Zeror ha-Mor, Numbers, 11:26; Ibn Shuaib, II: 346.</i>
The Israelites in the wilderness had three attributes that were evil. One attribute was jealousy. Joshua had this so that Moses responded, “<i>are you jealous on my account</i>” [11:29]. Are you jealous for my sake? Even though Joshua did this <i>for the sake of heaven</i>, that the <i>prophets Eldad and Medad</i> had issued a ruling before Moses their master without permission. Because Moses rebuked Joshua, therefore, Joshua died ten years before his time, because he spoke ten words in the verse, “<i>Joshua son of Nun spoke up</i>” [11:28].<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">Ibn Shuaib, II: 341.</i>
It is also written in the portion that Aaron and Miriam spoke ill about Moses that Moses had separated from his wife because the Shekhinah was always speaking with Moses. Therefore, he did not want to sleep with his wife. Aaron and Miriam said that it was just that Moses should have sexual relations with his wife, since he had ordinary children. Perhaps he will now have better children in his old age. Aaron and Miriam thought that he had separated because he had a wife who was black, like a moor. Aaron and Miriam were punished for this, as we will write below in the portion.<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">Ibn Shuaib, II: 346.</i>
We also find it is written in the portion that Israel desired to eat extra meat. The Holy One punished them immediately and killed them. The third thing we find is that <i>Eldad and Medad</i> did not want <i>honor or power</i> and left their honor and power behind.<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote">Ibn Shuaib, II: 345.</i>
“<i>Moses reentered the community</i>” [11:30]. Moses and the elders each went into his own tent. The cloud did not appear until each of the elders was in his tent. The plague of the quail did not begin until the elders were in their tents. Then the Holy One made a wind bring them and caused the quail to fly from the sea. There were many of them. There were quail on all four side of Israel, a distance of one day’s journey on all four sides. They flew right at the person’s heart, so that the person should not have to bend down for them and should not have to reach up for them.<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 11:30 –31.</i>
<i>Hizkuni</i> writes. They flew thickly from the ground to a height of two cubits, one on top of the other. They collected them for a whole day and night, and again the next morning. The least of the Israelites, who was lazy and sluggish or lame and could not quickly come to collect them, collected ten piles. Hizkuni writes that each one collected three hundred <i>seah.</i> This is a measure that each Israelite had enough to eat every day for a month from ten <i>seah</i>, and they had many piles around them.<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Numbers, 11:31–32.</i>
“<i>The meat was still between their teeth</i>” [11:33]. <i>Hizkuni</i> writes that the Holy One gave them so much meat to eat, so that after He killed them that they should not say that the Holy One had killed them because He was not able to give them enough meat to eat. The Holy One killed them because of the sin.<sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Numbers, 11:33.</i>
Bahya asks a question. Why did Moses not pray to God that He should not kill so many, as he had done earlier in the portion when they spoke ill of God? The fire had burned many Israelites. Moses prayed and the fire sank into the ground. The explanation is that Moses was ashamed that Israel had done so much evil. They had seen that the Holy One had burned them and now they were again doing evil, and did not believe in the Holy One. Moses was also afraid. He had also spoken angrily against the Holy One. He said: who can give enough meat to Israel. This was not right, since the Holy One has the power to do everything. He also said, “<i>why have You dealt ill with Your servant</i>” [11:11]? This means, why have you done ill to Your servant, that he should lead Israel alone? This was also not proper before God.<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Numbers, 11:33.</i>
“<i>Because the people who had the craving were buried there</i>” [11:34]. The place where they were buried was called “<i>Kibroth hattavah</i>” [11:34]. That is to say, <i>graves</i> where they buried those who desired much meat. Even in the grave where they lay, they shouted <i>hunger, hunger.</i> That is to say, hunger; they still desired to eat. So they were shouting in the grave.<sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote">I could not find the source of this idea.</i>
“<i>Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses</i>” [12:1]. <i>Miriam and Aaron</i> spoke ill about Moses. “<i>The Cushite woman he had married</i>” [12:1]. They spoke ill that Moses had a beautiful wife. She was beautiful in her appearance and she was beautiful with her <i>good deeds</i>, and Moses had separated from her. Therefore, she was called <i>Cushite</i>, a moor who is black. That is to say, they used to call a lovely child, gypsy. They did not want to say it, so that the evil eye should not dominate him. So also says the verse about <i>Zipporah.</i> She was beautiful and she was called black moor, so that the <i>evil eye</i> should not dominate her.<sup class="footnote-marker">83</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Numbers, 11:33.</i>
<i>Bahya</i> and <i>Hizkuni</i> write that <i>Zipporah</i> was like a gypsy and a black Moorish woman. Therefore, <i>Miriam and Aaron</i> said, Moses had separated from Zipporah because she was not beautiful and that is why he had now separated from her. He had been married a long time and did not let her leave. That is why the verse says, “<i>Moses was a very humble man</i>” [12:3]. That is to say, the verse testifies that Moses did not look at his wife. He was very bashful and very righteous. He did not think about whether she was beautiful or not, just like <i>Abraham</i> who never looked at his wife, Sarah.<sup class="footnote-marker">84</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Numbers, 12:1; Hizkuni, Numbers, 12:1.</i>
<i>Ibn Shuaib</i> and Hizkuni write. In <i>Sefer Divrei ha-Yamim</i> it is written that Moses was a king in the land of the <i>Cushites.</i> He had run away from Pharaoh and Moses took the <i>queen of Cush</i> as a wife. However, he did not sleep with her. Therefore, Miriam and Aaron spoke ill of Moses. They said that even though God spoke with him and that is why he was haughty and important, and did not take a wife from the daughters of Israel, and took a queen from the nations, who was supposedly important. And yet, God spoke with us.<sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote">Ibn Shuaib, II: 346–347; Hizkuni, Numbers, 12:1.</i>
Rashi writes here. How did Miriam know that Moses had separated from his wife Zipporah? The explanation is that Miriam was standing near Zipporah when it was told to Moses that <i>Eldad and Medad were prophets.</i> Zipporah said to the wives of the prophets that since their husbands had become prophets, they would separate from their wives like Moses had separated himself. Miriam went and told the story to Aaron. Even though, Miriam and Aaron did not intend to shame Moses, yet the Holy One punished them.<sup class="footnote-marker">86</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 12:1.</i>
Hizkuni writes. Miriam asked Zipporah, why did she not adorn herself for her husband? It is a positive commandment for the wives to adorn themselves for their husbands, so that their husbands should not have any thoughts about strange women. Zipporah responded: Moses does not think about these things. That is to say, he rarely comes to me. In the verse, Miriam is mentioned before Aaron. This is because Miriam began to speak ill first.<sup class="footnote-marker">87</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Numbers, 12:1.</i>
Toldot Yizhak writes that Miriam and Aaron spoke ill of Moses. They said that if Moses had wanted to have a beautiful wife, he could have had one. However, Moses showed that he did not desire a beautiful wife, but he wanted to fulfill the commandment of <i>procreation</i>, to have children. Now he had separated himself from his wife because she was despicable. Therefore, the verse says, “<i>Moses was a very humble man</i>” [12:3]. That is to say, it did not bother him that he had a despicable wife. Toldot Yizhak asks another question. Why did they speak ill now? The explanation is that they said that Moses had been separated from his wife for a long time and it was proper, because he alone was a prophet for all of Israel. However, now there were seventy elders and prophets with him. Why should he separate himself more than the other elders?<sup class="footnote-marker">88</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Numbers, 12:1–3.</i>
“<i>Suddenly</i>” [12:4]. The Holy One appeared suddenly and unexpectedly, and they were not pure. They called for water, wanting to purify themselves, because the Shekhinah had suddenly appeared. The Holy One did this because He wanted to show that Moses had also acted properly, in separating himself from his wife. Since the Shekhinah appeared unexpectedly, there was no fixed time for when the Shekhinah appeared.<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 12:4.</i>
Bahya writes. He appeared to them quickly, because they had spoken and what they said was a <i>desecration of God</i>’<i>s name.</i> When one speaks against <i>prophets</i> or against <i>scholars</i>, it is like he would speak against God. Therefore, the Holy One appeared to them immediately, expecting that they should not repent for their sin. They should also have no regret, since where there is <i>desecration of God</i>’<i>s name</i>, God causes that there should not be any repentance because he does not want his repentance. One does not borrow to pay for <i>desecration of God</i>’<i>s name</i>, but he is immediately paid for his sin.<sup class="footnote-marker">90</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Numbers, 12:4.</i>
<i>Zeror ha-Mor</i> writes. The Holy One appeared unexpectedly in the midst of their speaking, so that one should not say that Moses had complained to the Holy One that Miriam had <i>denigrated</i> him. That is to say, people should not say that Moses considered himself important; he did not want to suffer that someone should say anything to him. Therefore, the Holy One immediately appeared, while they were still standing together, so that nobody could say that Moses was alone and complained about Miriam and Aaron, but the Holy One came unexpectedly. He wanted to take Miriam and Aaron to account. That is to say, even though Moses did not complain and therefore it is written, “<i>the Lord heard it</i>” [12:2]. That is, God had heard on His own, aside from from Moses’ prayer. He was not arrogant.<sup class="footnote-marker">91</sup><i class="footnote">Zeror ha-Mor, Numbers, 12:4.</i>
“<i>He called out, Aaron and Miriam</i>” [12:5]. The Holy One called Aaron and Miriam alone, and not Moses. He wanted to show that Moses was not angry with Aaron and Miriam.<sup class="footnote-marker">92</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Numbers, 12:5.</i>
<i>Ibn Shuaib</i> writes. He called them Himself. He wanted to how them that Moses was righteous, and did not want to talk about his <i>righteousness</i> to his face. Another explanation is He separated Moses, so that Moses should not hear the <i>disgrace of Aaron</i>, that the Holy One would <i>denigrate</i> him.<sup class="footnote-marker">93</sup><i class="footnote">Ibn Shuaib, II: 347.</i>
“<i>I speak with him in a dream</i>” [12:6]. The Holy One said. How can you compare yourself to Moses? When I speak to other <i>prophets</i>, I appear in a dream. However, with Moses I speak openly, <i>face to face</i>, and I have explicitly spoken to Moses, that he should separate himself from his wife.<sup class="footnote-marker">94</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 12:8.</i>
<i>Imre Noam</i> asks a question. The Talmud says that Moses had separated on his own. Why does Rashi write here that the Holy One had told him? The explanation is that Moses had first separated on his own and afterwards the Holy One told him explicitly. You have done properly in that you have separated. You should always do so.<sup class="footnote-marker">95</sup><i class="footnote">Imre Noam, Numbers, 12:8.</i>
“<i>Still incensed with them, the Lord departed</i>” [12:9]. The Holy One told Aaron and Miriam about their evil words, and then he punished them and beat them. From here we should learn that when someone wants to get angry at his friend, he should first tell him his <i>fault</i> and then be angry at what he had done.<sup class="footnote-marker">96</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 12:9.</i>
The cloud removed itself from Miriam and she became leprous. Aaron also became leprous. Some sages say that Aaron was not leprous, but that he was immediately healed.<sup class="footnote-marker">97</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Numbers, 12:9.</i>
Aaron asked Moses and said to him, let not our sister be like a dead person. A leper is like a dead person.<sup class="footnote-marker">98</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 12:12.</i>
“<i>Who emerges from his mother</i>’<i>s womb</i>” [12:12]. Miriam came from the same womb as we did, and we can help her with prayer. If we won’t help her, it would be like we are eating our own flesh, and destroying our own flesh, since our sister is like our own flesh. Aaron said to Moses: if you will not pray for Miriam, who will heal her? That is to say, a leper used to be locked up until he was healed and clean. However, now that Miriam is a leper, who will lock her up, since I am the only priest in the world, and I am her brother. A cohen is not supposed to lock up a relative when they are a leper. The Holy One said: I will heal her and make her clean.<sup class="footnote-marker">99</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 12:12.</i>
“<i>Who emerges from his mother</i>’<i>s womb</i>” 12:12]. Bahya writes. Aaron said to Moses: pray, since if you will not pray, Miriam will be like a child who is born a leper; it is impure forever. Our sister will be impure forever, since there is no priest who can lock her up and clean her.<sup class="footnote-marker">100</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Numbers, 12:12.</i>
“<i>O God, pray heal her</i>” [12:13]. Moses prayed and asked God that he should heal Miriam of her leprosy. Ones asks a question here. Why did Moses pray such a short prayer? The explanation is that the people should not say that he is praying so long for the sake of his sister.<sup class="footnote-marker">101</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 12:13.</i>
“<i>If her father spat in her face</i>” [12:14]. When a father shames his daughter, then she must be ashamed for seven days. How much more so, when she does this against the Holy One? Therefore, I do not desire that Miriam should be ashamed more than seven days. That is to say, she should be a leper for seven days.<sup class="footnote-marker">102</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 12:14.</i>
“<i>The people did not march</i>” [12:15]. <i>All of Israel</i> did not move until Miriam was cleansed of her leprosy. She was worthy of this because she waited for Moses when he was thrown into the water. Pharaoh’s daughter took Moses from the water and said to Miriam that she should call a Jewish wet-nurse to nurse the child. <i>Miriam</i> called the mother to nurse Moses. From here we learn that the Holy One pays each one his reward, <i>measure for measure.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">103</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 12:15.</i>

Sh'lach

<i>King Solomon, of blessed memory</i>, said: “<i>The horse is readied for the day of battle, but victory comes from the Lord</i>” [Proverbs, 21:31]. The verse teaches us that the person should do everything to work on himself to nourish himself as far as he can, and he should rely on God that He should help him. Just like someone goes to war, he must prepare himself for it. However, if he does not want to prepare himself and only wants to rely on God alone, he will lose the war. Therefore, the Torah also told Israel to prepare, that they should make swords and spears to go to war against the nations. Even though Israel did not win the war like the nations, but through the <i>miracles and wonders</i> of the Holy One. Concerning this, <i>King Solomon</i> said above in the verse that the horse is prepared for the war, but the help is from God. Therefore, the portion says here.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Shelah Lekha, Introduction.</i>
“<i>Send men to scout</i>” [13:2]. The Holy One said, send <i>representatives</i> to spy out the land, to see how they will be able to conquer them, expecting that the Torah would show us that we should do what is just.
<i>Ibn Shuaib</i> asks a question. What kind of sin did the spies commit when they went? The explanation is that the <i>spies</i> desired to spy out the <i>land of Israel.</i> They should have followed the cloud, because they had seen wonders, <i>miracles, and signs.</i> Moses accepted their words because of their desire, since Moses was afraid to speak against them. He first asked the Holy One. The Holy One responded, “<i>Send men</i>” [13:2]. That is to say, send the spies according to your opinion.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Ibn Shuaib, <i>Derashot</i>, II: 351.</i>
“<i>Send men</i>” [13:2]. Rashi asks a question. Why is the portion of the spies written near the portion about <i>Miriam</i>, who had spoken slander? The explanation is that Israel were supposed to learn from Miriam that if they spoke slander they would become leprous. Therefore, the Israelites should also not have spoken evil about the land of Israel.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 13:2.</i>
Bahya writes. “<i>Send men</i>” [13:2]. Send spies for your benefit, since Israel will soon come into the land of Israel. You, Moses must soon die, since he was not supposed to come into the land of Israel. However, now that the spies have sinned with their words, Israel will wander for forty years in the desert, and only afterwards will they come into the land of Israel. Thus, Moses lived for another forty years, because the spies sinned. Moses sent twelve spies, one man from each tribe, expecting that if they would be pious, then <i>all of Israel would have merit from this mission.</i> If they will be evil, then the Holy One will punish them all together. The Midrash says, “<i>Joshua sent two spies secretly</i>” [Joshua, 2:1]. This means that Joshua sent only two spies, not like Moses who sent twelve spies. Joshua’s spies made themselves appear to be deaf. When they wanted to ask something they made themselves deaf and dumb. The word “<i>heresh</i>” [Joshua, 2:1] means pots. They made pots and called out, who wants to buy pots? That is to say, they should not be noticed. They should not be considered spies and that is why they made pots. This is merchandise that the women buy and no men have an interest. Therefore, the men would not notice who they were. Perhaps if the men would talk with them, the men might notice something about their speech, or about their appearance. Furthermore, women do not think ahead and women gladly speak much. One can soon learn secrets from them. The two spies asked the women if they were afraid of the Israelites. They would tell us everything. Therefore, the Midrash says that the spies of Moses were evildoers and fools. The two spies of Joshua were <i>righteous, Phinehas and Caleb.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Numbers, 13:2.</i>
“<i>All the men</i>” [13:3]. The spies that Moses selected were all righteous, but they became evildoers on the way.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Numbers, 13:3.</i>
“<i>Caleb ben Jephunneh</i>” [13:6]. He was called Jephunneh because he turned away from the evil spies.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Numbers, 13:6.</i>
“<i>From the tribe of Joseph, namely the tribe of Manasseh</i>” [13:11]. Hizkuni, Bahya, and Toldot Yizhak ask. Why did the Torah here write Joseph next to Manasseh? In other places in the Torah that count Joseph, it is next to Ephraim. The explanation is that here the Torah speaks about the spies and the chieftain of Manasseh spoke evil against the land of Israel, and Joseph had also spoken evil against his brothers. Therefore, Joseph was mentioned with Manasseh. Therefore, the verse also says here, “<i>from the tribe of Ephraim, Hosea son of Nun</i>” [13:8], and does not mention Joseph in connection with this, because Joshua, from Ephraim, did not speak evil about the land of Israel. This also explains why the Torah did not write Ephraim and Manasseh near each other. He wanted to separate them because the chieftain of Ephraim was pious, and the chieftain of Manasseh was evil.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Numbers, 13:11; Bahya, Numbers, 13:11; Toldot Yizhak Numbers, 13:11.</i>
“<i>These were the names of the men</i>” [13:16]. There was no chieftain from the tribe of Levi who went to be a <i>spy</i>, because they would have no share in the land of Israel. They were given <i>tithes</i> and <i>terumot</i> and the priests, the children of Levi, were given the meat of the sacrifices.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Numbers, 13:16.</i>
“<i>Moses called Hosea ben Nun, Joshua</i>” [13:16]. Moses blessed Hosea and said, your name should be Joshua. That is, God should help you that you should not be instigated by the spies. Moses had seen <i>prophetically</i> that the <i>spies</i> would speak evil.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 13:16.</i>
Bahya writes. They added a <i>yud</i> to Joshua because he took the reward from ten spies. Bahya asks a question here. He was called Joshua with the <i>yud</i>, above in the whole Pentateuch. Why does it say that here he was called Hosea, without a <i>yud?</i> The explanation is that his name was Hosea first, but the Torah knew that Moses would give him the name Joshua. Therefore, the Torah calls him Joshua in the portion, and here, Hosea. It wants to show us that his correct name was Hosea, and Moses first gave him the name Joshua here.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Numbers, 13:16.</i>
“<i>Go up into the Negev</i>” [13:17]. Moses gave his staff to the spies, expecting that they would be protected from all evils and would go in peace.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Numbers, 13:17.</i>
Moses told the spies to first go to the <i>south</i> of the land of Israel, since that is the worst part of the land of Israel. Just like a shopkeeper who sells his wares, first he shows his worst merchandise, and afterwards, the best merchandise. So too, Moses first told them to see the worst land and afterwards, the best.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 13:17.</i>
“<i>Strong or weak</i>” [13:18]. Moses said to the spies. You should see if there are strongly fortified cities in the land of Israel. This is a sign that the people are weak, and they make themselves strong cities. You should also see if there are good wells and springs in the land of Israel, and that the people are fresh and healthy.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 13:18.</i>
“<i>Is it wooded</i>” [13:20]. You should see if there are any righteous ones in the land of Israel. There are some nations that are pious and will protect their people.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 13:20.</i> He also told the spies to take a bunch of <i>fruits from the land of Israel.</i>
“<i>Came to Hebron</i>” [13:22].<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Came in this verse is in the singular.</i> Rashi asks a question here. It should say, <i>they came.</i> There were twelve spies. The explanation is that <i>Caleb</i> went alone to <i>Hebron</i>, and prayed at the <i>graves of the Patriarchs</i> that the Holy One should give him from the evil advice of the spies. However, Joshua did not go to the <i>graves of the Patriarchs</i>, since Moses had blessed him with the <i>yud</i> and said: God will help you. The Midrash says that the Holy One came to Hebron and let the Patriarchs know that the Holy One will give the land of Israel to their children.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 13:22; Bahya, Numbers, 13:22.</i>
“<i>It had to be borne on a carrying frame by two of them</i>” [13:23]. The spies cut down a bunch of grapes. It was so big that they had to carry the bunch on two poles, and eight men carried the two poles. Afterwards, two other spies, one took a large fig and one took a <i>pomegranate.</i> However, <i>Joshua</i> and <i>Caleb</i> did not want to take anything. The evil <i>spies</i> wanted to say that just as the <i>fruits</i> are <i>different</i> from other <i>fruits</i> from our land. So too, the people in the <i>land of Israel are different.</i> The spies went through the whole length and breadth of the land of Israel in forty days, even though it would take eighty days. However, the Holy One made them go quickly, expecting that they should only go for forty days, since each day was equated to one year. Thus, they were in the wilderness for forty years. If they had gone through the land of Israel longer, then they would have had to stay in the wilderness longer. Bahya writes that Joshua and Caleb carried the bunch of grapes. The other ten spies could not carry the bunch of grapes because it was so heavy. The two righteous men, Joshua and Caleb, inherited the land and ate the fruits of the land.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 13:25; Bahya, Numbers, 13:23.</i>
“<i>They made their report to them</i>” [13:26]. When the spies came home they did not go to their tents, but they went to Moses and to all of Israel and wanted to speak evil about the land of Israel.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Numbers, 13:26.</i> They showed the fruits and said that the land is full of honey and milk. That is to say, when one tells many lies, one must also tell some truth, expecting that the falsehoods will be believed.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 13:27.</i> However, the people are strong and the cities are also strong. We also saw giants there, and they made Israel fearful. Amalek dwells near the sea and you know Amalek well, who has done much evil to Israel. The Hittites and the Amorites dwell in the mountains and the Canaanites dwell near the sea. Thus, it will be difficult to enter the land of Israel.
“<i>Caleb hushed</i>” [13:30]. Caleb very much wanted to silence the spies, and began to shout loudly, has the son of Amram, that is to say, Moses, done all this alone? The spies immediately thought that Caleb also wanted to speak evil about the land of Israel. They all became quiet. Caleb began: He has done so much for us. He split the sea and gave us the <i>manna</i> and gave us the quails. He said, “<i>let us by all means go up</i>” [13:30]. That is to say, even if the land of Israel would be in heaven. If the Holy One would tell us to make ladders to ascend to heaven, to come to the land of Israel, we would have good fortune and would soon come to the land of Israel. Then we will certainly come to it, since God has promised it to us.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 13:30.</i>
The spies immediately answered, “<i>we cannot attack that people</i>” [13:31]. That is to say, even if the nations of the land of Israel would go out of their cities into the fields, yet we could do nothing to them. They are very strong; even more so when they will be in their strong cities. Then, we will certainly not succeed against them. They said, all the people in the land of Israel die. The Holy One did this for their benefit. There was a great ether and many gentiles dropped dead at that time in the land of Israel, expecting that the nations should be preoccupied with the corpses and not notice the spies. They spoke ill about the miracle and their words were similar. They said that there are a strong people in the land of Israel, and now they said, “<i>a land that devours its inhabitants</i>” [13:32], a land that destroys those who live there.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 13:32.</i>
“<i>Children of Anak</i>” [13:28]. That is to say, the children of the giants. Afterwards, they said before all of Israel, “<i>the Nephilim, the children of Anak</i>” [13:33]. That is, the fallen giants. They fell down from heaven during the <i>six days of creation</i> and that is why they are called <i>Nephilim.</i> Whoever sees them, their heart falls from great fright. We were like flies in their eyes. They said about us, who are these flies that are going there?<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 13:33.</i>
They said: “<i>it is stronger than we</i>” [13:31]. That is to say, the people are stronger than God.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 13:31.</i>
They said: “<i>if only we had died</i>” [14:2]. If only we had died in Egypt or in the wilderness, so that our wives and children should not fall to the sword of the enemy. Therefore, let us choose a leader over us and we will return to Egypt. As soon as Moses and Aaron heard this, they fell on their faces. Joshua and Caleb rent their garments. They said: the land is good. The Holy One should only want to give it to us, but let us not rebel against God. Israel wept that night. The Holy One said: you cry for no reason and for nothing. You will have to weep this night all your days. This was on the ninth of <i>Ab.</i> Therefore, Israel must weep on the <i>ninth of Ab</i> because of this.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban, Numbers, 14:1.</i>
Joshua and Caleb said to Israel. “<i>For they are our bread, their protection has departed from them</i>” [14:9]. That is to say, we will eat the nations like bread. Their shade left them. That is to say, a righteous person has one, just like Job had one. It protected them, like a shade protects a person from the sun, and now Job died.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 14:9.</i>
<i>Bahya</i> writes. “<i>Their protection</i>” [14:9] means that each nation has an angel in heaven who protects his nation, like a shade protects from the sun. Therefore, Joshua and Caleb said: you are afraid of the angels that the nations have in heaven. Know that all these angels are with us along with the Holy One. This is the meaning of the verse, “<i>and the Lord is with us</i>” [14:9]. That is to say, when it is written, “<i>and the Lord</i>,” this means that the Holy One’s law court is with us. These are the angels of the seventy nations. They are the Holy One’s law court. Therefore, Joshua and Caleb said: do not fear the angels of the nations. They are with the Holy One on the earth and in the cloud. Therefore, the angels have no power. Bahya writes in the name of Ramban. “<i>Their protection</i>” [14:9] means that on <i>Hoshanah Rabbah</i> the one who does not see his shadow will die in that year. Therefore, Joshua and Caleb said: they have no shadow. That is to say, they have been <i>sealed</i> to die this year. Another explanation of what Joshua and Caleb said. We have two commandments. One commandment is that we eat <i>unleavened bread</i> on Passover and because of that merit, we will destroy the <i>nations</i> like bread. Another commandment we have is that we make a shade in the <i>sukkah.</i> Because of that merit, the shade will be removed from the nations. Concerning this, the verse says, “<i>Their protection</i>” [14:9] in relation to the commandment of the sukkah, and then says, “<i>For they are our bread</i>” [14:9], in relation to the unleavened bread of Passover.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Numbers, 14:9.</i>
“<i>Despite all the signs that I have performed in their midst</i>” [14:11]. The Holy One said to Moses. How long will Israel continue to anger Me and will not believe the signs that I have done among them. Bahya asks a question here. Why is it written here “<i>bekirbo</i>”? This means among him, just like one is speaking to one person. It should have written <i>bekirbam.</i> This means that there were many Israelites who did not believe in God. The explanation is that the Holy One said. I have done signs for Israel and they had one heart to serve God. The Midrash also writes that <i>bekirbo</i> shows us, I gave them <i>manna</i> to eat and they did not have an evacuation, but the <i>manna</i> lay in their stomach and in their limbs. This is <i>bekirbo</i>, that is to say, in their stomach. The Talmud says in [tractate] <i>Yoma.</i> Yet, the Holy One had told each Israelite to take an iron spike in order to cover their excrement in the wilderness. This raises a question. When they did not have excretions, why did they take a spike? The Talmud gives an explanation. The food that the Israelites bought from the nations and ate, from this they had excretions. The Talmud asks, even if Israel had eaten other food from the nations, the <i>manna</i> should have caused the other food to be digested, so that there should not have been any excretion, even from other food. The explanation is that they had to have spikes, since the Israelites committed sins against God. Thus, they also had excretions from the <i>manna.</i> The Holy One said to Israel. I considered you like angels who have no excretions. That is why I gave you the <i>manna</i> to eat, so that you should have no excretions. However, now because you have committed sins, you must be like other people and you will have to trouble yourselves to go three miles to do your excretions. Israel was a large people and they occupied an area of three miles. When one wanted to attend to his bodily functions, he had to go a distance of three miles behind the people.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Numbers, 14:11.</i>
“<i>I will strike them with pestilence</i>” [14:12]. The Holy One said: I will destroy Israel with the ether. They will all die in the wilderness. Hizkuni writes here. The Holy One said: I will kill them with the ether so that they will not fall into the hands of the enemy, so that the nations should not say that the Holy One did not have the power to lead the Israelites to the land of Israel. This would be a desecration of God’s name.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Numbers, 14:12.</i>
The Holy One said to Moses. If you will ask, if I kill all of Israel, what will happen to the oath that I swore to <i>Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob</i>, to give the land to their children?<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 14:12.</i> Therefore, the Holy One said: I will make you a great nation, and they will take the land of Israel. Moses responded: when the Egyptians will see that You had taken Israel out of Egypt with great wonders, the Egyptians will not say that Israel sinned against God, but that God had no power to bring them to the land of Israel.
“<i>The Lord, slow to anger</i>” [14:18]. Rashi writes. Moses came up to heaven before the Holy One. He found that the Holy One has written, “<i>The Lord, slow to anger.</i>” This means, the Lord is slow to anger. Moses said to the Holy One. This means that God is slow to anger with the righteous. The Holy One responded: He is slow to anger even with evildoers. Moses said: let the evildoers be lost with their sins. The Holy One said a time would come that you will need this, when Israel will have sinned with the Golden Calf and the spies. Then Moses prayed: “<i>The Lord, slow to anger.</i>” The Holy One responded to Moses. You did say yes to the righteous and that the evildoers should be lost. Moses responded: <i>Lord of the Universe</i>, You also said about the evildoers, “<i>slow to anger</i>,” God is slow to anger.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 14:18.</i>
“<i>Yet not remitting all punishment</i>” [14:18]. The Holy One remits those who repent, and does not remit those who do not <i>repent. Moses</i> was pleading; forgive their <i>sin</i> with your great grace, as you have endured until now. The Holy One responded: the sin will be forgiven, as you desired. However, the Holy One swore by His life, that all the men must die in the wilderness, because they have seen My glory and great signs, and tested Me ten times. Therefore, they must not see the land of Israel. However, in any event the Holy One did not forgive the sin, since the sin of Israel is before the Holy One forever that the parents all died in the wilderness. However, their children and wives all came into the land of Israel. Israel must always cry on the <i>ninth of Ab</i>, because of this sin.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 14:18–21.</i>
Hizkuni and Bahya write. “<i>I pardon, as you have asked</i>” [14:20]. This means, I have forgiven the sin of the Golden Calf, as you desired. However, I did not forgive the sin of the spies, but the men all have to die in the wilderness. However, they will die a few at a time, not all at once, so that the nations should not say that the Holy One did not have the power to bring them to the <i>land of Israel.</i> Therefore, He killed them. Therefore, the Holy One brought the children into the land of Israel. Thus, the Holy One showed that He did have the power over thirty-one kings.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Numbers, 14:17; Hizkuni, Numbers, 14:20.</i>
“<i>He was imbued with a different spirit</i>” [14:24]. The Holy One said: all those who are twenty years old must die. However, <i>Caleb</i> was of two opinions. With his mouth he said before his colleagues, the spies that he <i>agreed</i> with them. That is, he might also speak evil. However, his heart was not in it, but his heart was very much for God. Therefore, he could come into the land of Israel.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 14:24.</i>
However, Hizkuni asks a question. Why does it not say that Joshua would also come into the land of Israel? The explanation is that it does not need to mention Joshua, because he would lead all of Israel into the land of Israel. Another explanation is that it does not mention Joshua because Joshua did not have children. Therefore, the verse cannot say that his children will inherit the land.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Numbers, 14:24.</i>
Toldot Yizhak asks. Why did the Torah not mention that Joshua would have a reward as the Torah had mentioned that Caleb had a reward? The explanation is that Joshua had Moses who had blessed him that he should be protected from the spies. However, Caleb did not have someone who would bless him on his journey. Therefore, the Holy One gave Caleb a separate reward. Another explanation is because Caleb risked his neck and shouted against the spies with his mouth. We will be able to conquer the land and the land is good. Therefore, God gave him a separate reward. Toldot Yizhak asks another question. Why did Joshua also not say good things like Caleb said against the spies? The explanation is that Joshua was very wise and therefore he was silent and allowed Caleb to speak. Joshua thought: if I would speak with Caleb against the spies that the land is good, the spies would say, you are not right the land is evil. You are only two and we are ten. Therefore, Joshua was silent and allowed Caleb to speak alone. He thought, when the spies would speak against Caleb, perhaps they will think that because I am silent that I agree with the spies to speak evil with them. He also thought that perhaps they would ask me who spoke the truth, Caleb or the spies. Joshua thought, with this I will <i>sanctify the name of God</i> and will tell the truth. They will all recant because they will all rely on me. The spies were silent and did not ask Joshua. Thus, Joshua first rent his garments over the evil reports.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Numbers, 14:15.</i>
“<i>In this very wilderness shall your carcasses drop</i>” [14:29]. Therefore, it says <i>your carcasses.</i> That is to say, your bodies. This is the body that will disappear, but your soul will have a <i>share in the world to come.</i> The <i>tribe of Levi</i> was not part of these deaths. They were counted from the age of one month. However, the Israelites were counted from twenty years. They all died in the wilderness. Rashi writes. Israel was in the wilderness for forty years, for each day that the spies went in the land of Israel and spoke evil about the land of Israel. This was forty days. Therefore, they had to spend forty years in the wilderness, expecting that they should get old. Those who were twenty years old at the time would become sixty years old, since nobody died under the age of sixty years.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 14:29–33.</i>
“<i>Not one of you shall enter the land</i>” [14:30]. Bahya writes. Moses and Aaron were shown that they would not come into the land of Israel. This was all shown for the honor of Israel, that Moses and Aaron also died in the wilderness. That is to say, when the Messiah will come, Moses and Aaron will arise and take those who died in the wilderness with them.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Numbers, 14:30.</i>
“<i>Died of plague</i>” [14:37]. <i>Rashi</i> writes. Their death was <i>measure for measure.</i> They spoke evil with their tongues. Therefore, their tongues became enlarged and went out of their throats and reached their navel. Worms grew on their tongues and went into their navels, and from the navel worms also went out onto their tongues.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 14:37.</i>
“<i>Overcome by grief</i>” [14:39]. Israel regretted their sins, and they said, we will go to the land of Israel. Moses said: do not go, because the Holy One is not with you and you will not succeed. You will be killed by your enemies. The Amalekites and the Canaanites are before you at the border. Israel went ahead on the mountains to go to the land of Israel. Moses and the Ark did not move out of the gate. The Amalekites and the Canaanites who dwelled in those mountains came and killed many Israelites.
Ibn Shuaib writes. Our sages said that even though Miriam did not intend to speak slander, yet the Holy One punished her that she became leprous. How much more so, when someone speaks slander and his intention is to cause anguish to people. Concerning this, King Solomon said, “<i>death and life are in the power of the tongue</i>” [Proverbs, 18:21]. Death and life depend on the tongue. The Midrash tells a story about a king’s son who was very sick. The doctors said that he could only become healthy by drinking the milk of a lion. A person came before the king and said: I will bring the milk. The king responded, I will make you a marshal. That man immediately asked for ten goats, and he went to the lion’s den. On the first day, he gave the lion one goat to eat. On the second day, he again gave it a goat to eat, and showed himself a little to the lioness from a distance expecting that the lion should see that he was the one who was feeding it the goats. He did the same on the third day, and stood a little closer and played with the lioness a little bit. On the tenth day he milked it and took the milk and left there. At night he came to an inn and he had a dream about the great celebration that the king would make for him. In the dream, his feet said: we did this since we went to the lion’s den. The hands said: we did this since we milked it. The eyes said: if we had not been there, you would not have seen where the lion’s den was, and you could not have helped. The ears said: if you had not heard from the doctors that milk should be brought from a lioness. Then the heart said: if it was not my intellect and had not given you the advice to take goats and to play with the lioness, to take her milk. The tongue said: I made everything with my speech before the king to give goats. If I had been mute, then none of you would have helped. All the other organs immediately shouted at the tongue. You are the lowliest organ in the person, and you want to make yourself important. The tongue responded: you will see how everything depends on me. The person awoke from his sleep. He was very frightened by the dream. He came to the king with the milk and said, I have brought <i>milk of a female dog.</i> This means, milk from a female dog. The king and the nobles became very angry with him. They said to him: we have enough milk from dogs, and the king immediately ordered him thrown into prison. The person fell asleep at night. The tongue began to speak and said. I told you that I am better than all the other organs, since with my speech you will all be killed. All the organs began to speak. We recognize that you are better than all the organs. Therefore, we will make you a master over all of us, but protect us from death. In the morning, the king commanded that the man with the milk should be hanged. They led him out to be hanged and the man pleaded that they should listen to him one more time. He wanted to heal the king’s son with the milk. He was immediately brought to the king with great joy. The man said to the king. In Israel, lionesses are called <i>female dogs</i>, and I spoke as we speak in Israel in my language. The king checked if the milk was from a lioness. They found that it was true and the king made the man a marshal. Concerning this, the verse says, “<i>death and life are in the power of the tongue</i>” [Proverbs, 18:21].<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Ibn Shuaib, II: 357–358.</i>
“<i>When you enter the land that I am giving you to settle in</i>” [15:2]. Bahya, Hizkuni, Ramban, and Ibn Shuaib write. The portion about sacrifices was written near the portion about the spies. The Torah wanted to console Israel, when the spies committed a sin. Nonetheless, the Holy One would still accept the sacrifices of their children. The Midrash writes that this is just like a father who does five things for his son. The first is that he has his son circumcised. The second is that he redeems him from the priest. The third is that he teaches him Torah. The fourth is that he teaches him a trade or how to engage in business. The fifth is that he gives him a wife. So too is the Holy One. He had Israel circumcised through Joshua. He also redeemed them from Egypt, from the house of Pharaoh. The Holy One taught the Torah, and gave them commandments, which is better than any merchandise. He commanded them, “<i>be fruitful and multiply</i>” [Genesis, 1:28], to take a wife and have children.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Numbers, 15:2–3; Hizkuni, Numbers, 15:2; Ramban, Numbers, 15:2; Ibn Shuaib, II: 361.</i>
“<i>That person shall be cut off</i> – <i>he bears his guilt</i>” [15:31]. Rashi writes here. The person who has spurned the word of God, he is <i>guilty of being cut off.</i> His years will be cut off if he does not repent. However, if he repents, his sin will be forgiven.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 15:31.</i>
Ramban writes. “<i>He bears his guilt</i>” [15:31], means, the person who is guilty of being cut off, the sin is eternal for that soul. He must eternally suffer in Gehenna.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban, Numbers, 15:31.</i>
“<i>When the Israelites were in the wilderness, they came upon a man gathering wood</i>” [15:32]. Rashi writes here. The verse teaches us that the Israelites were very evil and only properly observed one Sabbath in the wilderness. On the second Sabbath, <i>the gatherer</i> came and collected wood on the Sabbath and <i>profaned the Sabbath.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 15:32.</i>
Bahya writes. Therefore, the Torah writes, <i>in the wilderness.</i> This teaches us that they saw many signs from God in the wilderness. The <i>manna</i> fell from heaven every day, so that they had enough to eat, and other wonders. They considered all of this as nothing and desecrated the Sabbath. Another explanation, the Torah teaches us that Israel were angry in the wilderness that God had commanded that they must all die in the wilderness because of the sin of the spies. Further, they now committed the sin of desecrating the Sabbath. One sin led to another sin because they committed the sin with the spies. That is why they were in the wilderness for a long time and this led to their <i>desecrating the Sabbath</i> in the wilderness. Israelites found him collecting wood and they warned him that he should not collect or he would be put to death. He did not turn back to them. They captured him and brought him to Moses. Moses ordered him put in prison. He wanted to ask what form of death should be used.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Numbers, 15:32.</i>
Hizkuni asks a question. It is written concerning the Sabbath that the one desecrating the Sabbath <i>shall surely die.</i> Where it is written, <i>surely die</i> [<i>mot yumat</i>] means to put to death by strangulation. Why did Moses want to ask what form of death should be used? The explanation is that Moses wanted to say because it is written desecration concerning the Sabbath, and it is also written desecration concerning worshiping foreign gods. Just as with worshiping foreign gods his head is chopped off with a sword, one should also chop off the head of the <i>Sabbath desecrater.</i> Therefore, Moses had to ask what kind of death should be imposed. Hizkuni asks another question. Each person had to be warned about his sin and what type of death would be imposed. If they did not know what kind of death should be imposed on the Sabbath desecrater, how did they warn the one who gathered wood on the Sabbath? The explanation is that he was warned not to collect wood on the Sabbath, since there are four types of death that are imposed on a person who transgresses God’s commandments. The one who gathered wood heard about all four types of death, and yet continued to collect wood.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Numbers, 15:34.</i>
Ibn Shuaib writes. The one who gathered wood on the Sabbath did not wear <i>zizit</i> and did not think that it was the Sabbath. Therefore, each person should put on another garment on the Sabbath that he does not wear during the week. Through this, he will remember that it is the Sabbath and will properly observe the Sabbath.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">Ibn Shuaib, II: 361.</i>
Rashi writes that zizit has the numerical value of six hundred and eight strings and five knots on the <i>zizit.</i> All together this is six hundred and thirteen and relates to the commandments in the Torah, which are six hundred and thirteen. That is to say, zizit relates to the six hundred and thirteen commandments.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 15:39.</i>
<i>Bahya</i>, <i>Ibn Shuaib</i>, and <i>Hizkuni</i> write. Is not <i>zizit</i> written in the Torah with a <i>yud</i> and thus has the numerical value of six hundred?<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">In this verse, the word <i>zizit</i> is written with only one <i>yud</i> rather than two as is more common.</i> The explanation is that there is an extra <i>lamed</i> written in <i>le-zizit.</i> The <i>lamed</i> equals thirty, for the three times that <i>zizit</i> is written in the Torah without a [second] <i>yud.</i> In this way the calculation will be correctly six hundred.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Numbers, 15:38; Ibn Shuaib, II: 361; Hizkuni, Numbers, 15:39.</i>
Baal ha-Turim and Ibn Shuaib write. There are eight strings in the zizit relating to the eight organs that the person uses to commit sins. They are, the ears, the eyes, the mouth, the nose, the hands, the feet, the sexual organs, and the heart. These are the eight organs with which one commits sins.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">Baal ha-Turim, Numbers, 15:39; Ibn Shuaib, II: 361.</i>
“<i>Do not follow your heart and eyes</i>” [15:39]. The eyes and the heart are the two organs of the person that are the brokers that bring the person to commit sins. The eyes first see everything and then the heart desires to commit that sin.<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 15:39.</i>
Bahya and Hizkuni write. Midrash <i>Tanhuma</i> writes that the Holy One gave a commandment for every task that a person does in the world. If a person wants to plow, it is written that one should not plow with an ox and a donkey at the same time. If he wants to sow a garden it is written, do not sow <i>mixed varieties.</i> If he wants to cut the grain, he must leave some in the field for the poor. If he wants to take grain to eat, he must give <i>terumah and tithes.</i> When he wants to knead the dough, he must separate the <i>hallah.</i> If he wants to eat, he must recite a blessing. If he wants to shear the sheep, he must give wool to the priest. Also, if his animal has a firstborn, he must give it to the priest. If he wants to slaughter an animal, he must give the shoulder, the stomach, and the cheeks to the priest. If he comes across a bird’s nest, he must send the mother away. If he slaughters a bird, he must cover the blood. Should he put on a garment, he must check that it does not contain a mixture of wool and linen. If a son is born to him, he must have his foreskin circumcised. If he wants to have sexual relations with his wife, he must be careful about menstruation. If he plants a tree, he must wait three years. If he buries a relative, then he must not scar his body from anguish and he must not cut his hair, then he must not cut off his sidelocks. If he builds a house, he must build a parapet. If he makes a door, he must make a <i>mezuzah.</i> If he makes a garment, he must put <i>zizit</i> on it. A parable. A person falls from a ship into the water. The captain of the ship throws a long rope to that person and says to him: hold on to the rope and you will be protected from death. So too, the Holy One gave many commandments to the person for all of his works. He said to the person: hold on strongly to the commandments and you will have life in this world and in the next world. Concerning this, the verse says, “<i>the Lord desires His [servant</i>’<i>s] vindication</i>” [Isaiah, 42:21]. That is to say, the Holy One desires his vindication to greet the Torah with many commandments, expecting the person should have many commandments, where he goes and does. He can have many commandments to do and fulfill.<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Numbers, 15:38; Hizkuni, Numbers, 15:38.</i>
Rashi writes. The portion about <i>the gatherer</i>, who gathered on the Sabbath, was written near the portion about worshiping foreign gods. This teaches us that the Sabbath is weighed against all the commandments. The one who desecrated the Sabbath is like one who worships foreign gods. Therefore, <i>zizit</i> was also written here. This teaches us that <i>zizit</i> is also related to all the commandments of the Torah. Therefore, one makes it on the four corners relating to the four terms that the Holy One said at the <i>Exodus from Egypt</i>, “<i>I will free you, I will deliver you, and I will redeem you</i>” [Exodus, 6:6], and “<i>I will take you</i>” [Exodus 6:7]. In ancient times they took a <i>string of tekhelet</i>, a string of blue for the <i>zizit.</i> This is like the blue color of the sky. There are eight strings on the zizit, for Israel waiting eight days from the Exodus until they sang songs at the sea.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 15:41.</i>

Korach

“<i>Korah took</i>” [16:1]. <i>King Solomon, of blessed memory</i>, said. “<i>He who earnestly speaks what is good pursues what is pleasing; he who is bent on evil, upon him it shall come</i>” [Proverbs, 11:27]. That is to say, the person should think to do good to his friend as far as he can. This is the meaning of the verse “<i>He who earnestly speaks what is good pursues what is pleasing</i>” [Proverbs, 11:27]. The one who prays for his friend, he does the will of the Holy One. Concerning this, our sages said: when someone prays for his friend and he also needs the same thing that he prayed for his friend, the Holy One gives him the same thing for this request, and rewards him with what he needs. Similarly, when someone is a leader of the generation, he is obligated to pray for the people of his generation. Our sages say that the person who accidentally kills his friend must dwell in the cities of refuge until the high priest dies, because the high priest did not pray that a murder should not happen in his generation. The murderer keeps praying that the high priest should die soon. King David also prayed for Israel, as the verse says, “<i>when they were ill, my dress was sackcloth</i>” [Psalms, 35:13]. When Israel were sick, I prayed and donned sackcloth that they should become healthy. “<i>May what I prayed for happen to me</i>” [Psalms, 35:13]. That is to say, when I pray, the prayer comes back to me. That is to say, the Holy One first rewards me with what I asked for and need because I prayed for Israel. Similarly, when someone seeks evil against his friend, the evil comes to him also. Concerning this, King Solomon said after the above-cited verse, “<i>he who trusts in his wealth shall fall</i>” [Proverbs, 11:28]. That is to say, the person who has much wealth and relies on his wealth. Therefore, he falls with his wealth and evil comes upon that wealth, as it says, “<i>riches hoarded by their owner to his misfortune</i>” [Ecclesiastes, 5:12]. Sometimes, the wealth is to the person’s misfortune, to destroy him in this world and in the other world. We find that there were two <i>wealthy people in the world</i>, one among the <i>Jews</i> and one among the <i>gentiles</i>, may they be separated; Korah among the Jews and Haman among the gentiles. Both were destroyed in this world and in the other world. All of this happened because they listened to their wives. <i>Haman</i> listened to the suggestion of his wife, <i>Zeresh</i>, to make a gallows on which to hang <i>Mordecai.</i> This resulted in Haman being hanged on it. <i>Korah</i> also followed his wife and therefore he was destroyed. <i>Korah</i> came out of the <i>study house</i> where Moses taught Torah to Israel. Korah’s wife asked him what kind of commandment did Moses teach today? Korah said: he taught us the portion about the <i>zizit</i>, to take a string of <i>tekhelet</i>, blue wool, and seven strings of other wool to attach to the garments. His wife said: I will make a <i>garment</i> [<i>talit</i>] only of <i>tekhelet.</i> Moses mocks and makes fun of you. One string should be enough and a whole garment of <i>tekhelet</i> should not be good? She made it only out of <i>tekhelet.</i> Korah took the <i>garment</i> and gathered an assembly of two hundred and fifty good men from Reuben. He had garments made from <i>tekhelet</i> and had them all dressed in them. Korah took a <i>garment</i> of <i>tekhelet</i> for himself and they all came before Moses.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Korah, Introduction.</i>
They asked Moses. The <i>garments</i> we are wearing are only made of <i>tekhelet.</i> Does one have to attach a string of <i>tekhelet</i> to these <i>garments?</i> Moses responded: yes, one needs to attach a separate string to the garment. Korah and his company laughed and mocked. They said: how is it that a whole <i>garment</i> of <i>tekhelet</i> still needs a string of tekhelet? Korah asked further. A house full of <i>Pentateuchs</i> and other <i>sacred books</i>, does one have to have a separate <i>mezuzah</i> on that house? Moses responded that one must have a separate <i>mezuzah.</i> Korah laughed and said. How appropriate is it that when a house is full of <i>Pentateuchs</i> and <i>sacred books</i> that it should need a separate <i>mezuzah?</i> Korah said: you, Moses, you thought up these commandments, and God did not command them. Bahya writes here. Korah’s intention was with two commandments to which he responded. That is to say, a <i>garment</i> that is completely made of <i>tekhelet</i>, or a house that is full of sacred books. This is holy by itself, why does one need more holiness? So too <i>all of Israel</i> is holy, and heard the words of God on Mount Sinai, just like Moses. How does Moses want to be a master over us? Therefore, it is written, “<i>Korah took</i>” [16:1]. That is to say, Korah took a garment made of tekhelet and brought it before Moses.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Numbers, 16:1.</i>
Rashi writes, “<i>Korah took</i>” [16:1] means, Korah made a special appointment with Moses to argue with him, and he took along two hundred and fifty men who also came to argue.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 16:1.</i>
“<i>Son of Izhar son of Kohath son of Levi</i>” [16:1]. Rashi asks a question here. Why does it also not mention <i>son of Jacob</i>, since <i>Levi</i> was the son of Jacob? The explanation is that the Torah did not mention Jacob, because this was only conflict. Therefore, the name of Jacob should not be mentioned here. Since Reuben was near Korah’s tent in the desert, therefore, Korah incited the children of <i>Reuben</i> to fight with Moses. Therefore, our <i>sages</i> said:<i>Woe to the evildoer, woe to his neighbor.</i> One should be careful of an <i>evil neighbor.</i> When God punishes the evildoer, his neighbor is also punished, even if he is good.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 16:1.</i>
<i>Ibn Shuaib</i> writes. The Midrash writes. Korah engaged in many mockeries. He said to the children of Reuben. A <i>widow</i> had a sheep and the sheep gave birth to a firstborn. Aaron came and took away the firstborn. She sheared the sheep and Aaron took away the wool. Afterwards, she slaughtered the sheep, and Aaron took the shoulder, the stomach and the cheeks. Then she said in anger that it should all become sanctified. Aaron said to her, since you <i>sanctified</i> this, it all belongs to the priest. She gathered it all up and gave it to <i>Aaron the priest.</i> Korah related such mockeries to the children of Reuben and incited them against God.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Ibn Shuaib, <i>Derashot,</i> II: 365.</i>
Rashi writes. Why did Korah argue? The explanation is that he said: why did <i>Elizaphon</i> become a <i>chieftain</i> over our tribe? <i>Elizaphon</i> is the son of <i>Uziel</i>, the youngest son of <i>Kehat</i>, since <i>Kehat</i> had four sons, <i>Amram, Izhar, Hebron and Uziel.</i> Moses and Aaron were the children of Amram. It is just that Moses and Aaron should have the rulership, since Amram was the oldest son of Kehat. However, how is it that <i>Elizaphon</i> should be a chieftain over us? He is the son of <i>Uziel</i>, the youngest son of Kehat. It would have been just that I, Korah, should have been a chieftain, because I am the son of <i>Izhar</i>, the second son of Kehat. Therefore, Korah argued about everything. The children of Reuben were arguing because they said that Moses had taken away the birthright from Reuben and given it to Joseph, because Joshua was Moses’ servant, and Joshua was from Ephraim, the son of Joseph. The children of Reuben said: Moses does whatever he wants. He wants to make his servant Joshua important. Therefore, he first took away the birthright from Reuben, expecting that Joshua, his servant, should be among the firstborn, since the firstborn used to do the <i>service</i> in the <i>Temple.</i> Korah was also a firstborn, and the two hundred and fifty men were also all firstborn. Therefore, they all said to Moses together. You have changed things so that the firstborn should not do the service. Moses, you do what you like with the service. You had long thought that the <i>tribe of Levi</i> should do the service. That is to say, who then is just among the tribe of Levi, but Aaron, whom you like?<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 16:1.</i>
Rashi, Bahya, and Ibn Shuaib write. Korah saw in a dream that among his descendants would be a great and important family. This is <i>Samuel the prophet</i>, and twenty-four prophets would be among his descendants. Korah thought to himself. Such important descendants will come from me, how should I be silent against Moses? Therefore, Korah argued. He thought that the merit of his descendants would help him. Even though he heard that they would all be destroyed, except for one who would remain, yet Korah thought that he would remain. However, <i>Moses Our Teacher</i> saw that his children repented and they remained alive, and from them came the <i>prophet Samuel.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 16:7; Bahya, Numbers, 16:1; Ibn Shuaib, <i>Derashot,</i> II: 365.</i>
Ramban writes and <i>Ibn Shuaib</i> quotes Ramban that Korah began to argue now, after the spies, because Israel had everything from Moses, even at the Golden Calf. They committed a great sin, and Moses prayed for Israel forty days and forty nights. They loved Moses very much. If someone had spoken against Moses, all of Israel would have stoned him. Therefore, Korah was silent and allowed Aaron to assume his rulership. The first born also remained silent when the service was taken away from them and given to the Levites. However, now when many Israelites died because they had desired meat. Many Israelites were also burned because they spoke evil against God. The spies were the chieftains who died. All of Israel was supposed to die in the wilderness. Therefore, they said, “<i>to have us die in the wilderness</i>” [16:13]. That is to say, Moses is leading us into the wilderness to kill us. He did not bring us into the good land.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban, Numbers, 16:1; Ibn Shuaib, <i>Derashot,</i> II: 364.</i>
Ramban writes. All those who gathered to argue were firstborn. They said: he took away the service and gave it to his tribe of Levi. Therefore, Moses said: let each one take a fire pan to bring incense in the Tabernacle. Thus, we will see if the firstborn are worthy to do the service or the priests.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban, Numbers, 16:5.</i>
“<i>He fell on his face</i>” [16:4]. Moses fell on his face. He thought that prayer was not good or appropriate. This was the fourth sin. For the first, the Golden Calf, he prayed and by the <i>complainers,</i> who spoke evil against God, he prayed. By the spies, he also prayed. However, with Korah he was very frightened. He thought to himself. How long should I exert myself to forgive their sins?<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 16:4.</i>
Ramban and Bahya ask, why did Moses fall alone and not Aaron? The explanation is that Aaron did not want to get involved in the conflict. He thought to himself, it concerns me that I am a priest, and they want to be priests.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban, Numbers, 16:4; Bahya, Numbers, 16:4.</i>
“<i>Come morning, the Lord will make known</i>” [16:5]. God will let us know in the morning. Moses wanted to put the matter off until morning. He thought that they might regret it over night.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 16:5.</i>
“<i>Do this, take fire pans</i>” [16:6]. Moses said: you said that I exchanged the firstborn for the Levites, expecting to give the authority to Aaron the priest. Therefore, take a fire pan and bring incense on it. The one who brings incense and is not a priest, he must die. Then we will see if the firstborn are lawful priests, or the Levites are the lawful priests. The sages write that he put <i>poison</i> into the incense. That is to say, not that one put <i>poison</i> into it so that they should die. The evildoers might say that they were not killed by God, but by the <i>poison.</i> However, the explanation is that the incense was a <i>poison</i> for them. That is, since they were not priests, therefore, they died from the incense.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Numbers, 16:6.</i>
“<i>Is it not enough for you</i>” [16:9]? Moses said: is it not enough for you that you serve in the Tabernacle to sing during the sacrifices, and you still desire to be priests? There are how many hundreds of thousands of Israelites who are not in the Tabernacle, but you want even more?
“<i>Who is Aaron</i>” [16:11]. That is to say, Aaron is not guilty, that you should argue against Aaron.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 16:11.</i>
“<i>Moses sent for Dathan and Abiram</i>” [16:12]. Moses sent for Dathan and Abiram to come to him, since they had gone away. However, Korah was near Moses, where the Levites were. Therefore, he spoke with Korah first. However, <i>Dathan and Abiram</i> were far from Moses, and therefore he had to call for them. Ramban asks a question. Why did Moses not call <i>On ben Pelet</i>, who was their friend? The explanation is that <i>On</i> had gone home. His wife dissuaded him from arguing and he remained at home and did not want to argue. Thus, he remained alive with his household. This was done by a good wife with her good advice. <i>On</i> also did not come to the fire pans.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban, Numbers, 16:12.</i>
Dathan and Abiram responded to Moses: we will not ascend to Moses. Rashi writes. Their mouths were opened to evil that they said that they would not go up. That is to say, they would go down to the earth, to death.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 16:12.</i>
“<i>Should you gouge out those men</i>’<i>s eyes</i>” [16:14]? Even if Moses would gouge out their eyes, yet they would not go. Bahya writes. “<i>Should you gouge out those men</i>’<i>s eyes</i>” [16:14]? That is to say, if you want to blind the men, that we see that you have brought us into the wilderness to kill us.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Numbers, 16:14.</i>
“<i>Pay no regard to their oblation</i>” [16:15]. Moses prayed to God and said: do not accept the incense that the two hundred and fifty men are bringing. Moses further said: the two hundred and fifty men also have a share in the sacrifices that are brought for all of Israel every day. Therefore, Moses said before God: do not accept the share that they have in the sacrifices.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 16:15.</i>
“<i>I have not taken the ass of any of them</i>” [16:15]. Moses said: I showed no rulership over Israel, even when I needed a donkey to ride, for the sake of Israel. I rode on my own donkey.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 16:15.</i>
“<i>Korah gathered the whole community</i>” [16:19]. Korah engaged in mockery and laughter the whole night and went to all the tribes. He said to them. Do not think that I am only for myself. I am speaking for all of Israel that Moses and Aaron took the authority for themselves, until he convinced all of Israel.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 16:19.</i>
Bahya writes. He first convinced the firstborn whose service had been taken away from them and given to the Levites. He convinced the other tribes and said, see what Moses did to Reuben. He is a firstborn and it would have been just to be the chieftain who first brought a sacrifice at the <i>dedication of the altar.</i> Moses went and allowed Nahshon to bring a sacrifice. Nahshon was from the tribe of Judah, who was younger than Reuben.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Numbers, 16:19.</i>
“<i>Stand back from this community</i>” [16:21]. The Holy One said to Moses and Aaron: separate yourselves from this community. I will destroy the whole community. Moses and Aaron immediately fell on their faces and said. <i>Lord of the Universe</i>, an earthly king, when people rebel against him, he does not know who is rebelling against him. Therefore, when he gets angry he destroys all of them. However, You, Holy One, know well who committed the sin; kill that one. Therefore, Moses and Aaron said: “<i>O God, God of the breath of all flesh</i>” [16:22]. That is to say, You know all the opinions and thoughts of people and who does evil. The Holy One said to Moses. Speak to all of Israel that they should separate themselves from the tribe of Korah, and <i>Dathan and Abiram.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 16:22.</i>
Bahya asks a question here. Why did the Holy One tell them to separate themselves from Korah’s tent? He could have saved them even if they were standing next to him. The explanation is that the ether in which Korah and his household died harms people that are nearby, as we find with the wife of Lot. She turned to look back to Sodom, and the fire that was over Sodom. She died from the same ether and evil spirits. Another explanation is that when the <i>Angel of Death</i> goes and he has been given permission to kill, he kills anyone he encounters. The Holy One did this for the honor of the righteous, that they should not be at the blow.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Numbers, 16:21.</i>
Moses said to Israel, separate yourselves from Korah and his group and do not take any of their goods. Whoever will take something; he will also come to the same pit. Even if someone had long ago borrowed a sewing needle from Korah’s household, that needle rolled by itself into the pit where Korah had fallen. As soon as all of Israel had removed themselves from the tents of <i>Korah, Dathan, and Abiram</i>, Moses said: If these people would die in their beds as other people used to die, the people would not know whether they were right or not. Therefore, Moses said that the Holy One must show new signs to Korah, so that people should know that they were not right. Therefore, Moses said: if a mouth was created for the earth in the <i>six days of creation</i> to swallow Korah, then it is good. However, if it had not been created, then the Holy One should make a mouth in the earth to swallow Korah along with his community. Immediately, the earth split under Korah and swallowed Korah and his community along with their goods. The earth then covered them.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Numbers, 16:31–32.</i>
Rashi and Bahya write. How evil an argument was this. An earthly <i>court</i> does not declare a person guilty for their sins before they are twelve years old for a woman and thirteen years old for a man. The heavenly <i>court</i> does not consider a person guilty for their sins until they are twenty years old. However, here with the argument with Korah, the Holy One punished and killed even the small children in the cradle and children nursing at their mother’s breast.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 16:27; Bahya, Numbers, 16:29.</i>
Bahya writes in the name of Ramban. Why does the Torah first have to say, “<i>the ground burst asunder</i>” [16:31], that the earth split? Afterwards, the Torah again says, “<i>the earth opened its mouth</i>” [16:32]. The explanation is that this shows us that the splitting of the earth for Korah was different from the splitting of the earth in other places. It sometimes happens that the earth splits when a great storm wind comes and the earth opens a large hole is created in the earth and the hole remains open. However, with Korah there was a great miracle. The earth split and swallowed many people, many tents, and many goods, and then the earth was covered again, just like it was before. One did not see where there had been a great hole. Bahya writes that the children of Korah were not killed. They also fell into the hole, but the Holy One created a high mountain in the hole, and the children of Korah stood on it and did not fall down into Gehenna. Concerning this, the verse says elsewhere, “<i>the sons of Korah, however, did not die</i>” [Numbers, 26:11]. The children of Korah did not die. Bahya also writes that Korah and the two hundred and fifty men who took fire pans to make incense before God were burned with the fire. A fire came and burned all two hundred and fifty men, including Korah.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Numbers, 16:31–32.</i>
The Holy One imposed two deaths upon him. First, he was burned and then he fell into Gehenna. He fell into the deepest part of Gehenna, which is called <i>Sheol.</i> This place is half fire and half hail and <i>snow.</i> The evildoers jump from the fire to the hail and from the hail into the fire. They are very exhausted and eternally have no rest. The portion teaches us that the one who argues against the Torah, has no <i>share in the world to come.</i> Therefore, the verse says, “<i>they vanished from the midst of the congregation</i>” [16:33]. That is to say, they were separated from <i>the community of Israel</i>, so that they would have no <i>share in the world to come.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Numbers, 16:33.</i>
“<i>Fled at their shrieks</i>” [16:34]. Bahya writes that Korah and his group and their people were shrieking when they were falling and all of Israel were running away. They were afraid because of their screaming. They were shouting that Moses is true and his Torah is true, as the Talmud says. <i>Rabbah the son of Hana</i> said. I was going in the wilderness. A <i>merchant</i> said to me. I will show you the place where Korah sank into the earth. I saw that the earth was split and smoke rose from it. He took a spear and put some wool on it and the smoke singed the wool. The merchant said: listen to what they are saying. I heard them shouting, Moses is true and his Torah is true, and we are false liars. All the evildoers in Gehenna were shouting this, when they were being burned.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Numbers, 16:34.</i>
God is just and He repays everything <i>measure for measure.</i> Because Korah wanted to hold himself high, the Holy One made him very lowly, and he sank into the earth. The two hundred and fifty men who brought fire pans to make the incense, even though they were not worthy of it. From here, each person should be warned not to tease people.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Numbers, 16:35.</i>
“<i>Plating for the altar</i>” [17:3]. The Holy One commanded that a plating for the altar should be made from the fire pans of the men who had been burned, so that they should remember that they wanted to argue with God and therefore they were burned.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 17:3.</i>
“<i>As the Lord had ordered him through Moses</i>” [17:5]. One should not be like Korah and his community. God also said concerning Moses that he had spoken evil about Israel and his hand became leprous. So should it conclude for everyone.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 17:5.</i>
“<i>You have brought death upon the Lord</i>’<i>s people</i>” [17:6]. Israel spoke evil again and said to Moses and Aaron: you have caused the whole people to be killed. Ramban and Bahya ask a question. Did Israel see that they were burned and sank into the ground? What else did they speak evil? The explanation is that Israel saw that Aaron was worthy to be a priest, because the Holy One had accepted his sacrifices. However, they desired that the firstborn should also serve in the Tabernacle, to guard and to sing, just like the Levites sang and guarded the Tabernacle. They said: why did Moses exchange the firstborn and put the Levites in their place. It would have been better if all of Israel had a share in the service of God. That is to say, there were firstborn in every tribe who would serve in the Tabernacle. This was an honor for all of Israel and not just for the tribe of Levi alone.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban, Numbers, 17:6; Bahya, Numbers, 17:6.</i>
“<i>Wrath has gone forth from the Lord</i>” [17:11]. The plague began immediately and many Israelites died. Bahya writes here. An angel called <i>Wrath.</i> When Moses came down from heaven, when the Israelites made the Golden Calf, he encountered five evil angels, <i>Anger, Rage, Wrath, Ruin, and Indignation.</i> Moses prayed and mentioned <i>Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.</i> Three of the evil angels ran away. <i>Anger</i> and <i>Rage</i> remained. Moses said to the Holy One: You stand by <i>Anger</i>, as the verse says, “<i>Rise, O Lord, in Your anger</i>” [Psalms, 7:7]. Moses also said: I will stand by one of them. Here, by the plague, the evil angel called <i>Wrath</i> came and killed many.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Numbers, 17:11.</i>
“<i>He stood between the dead and the living</i>” [17:13]. The word <i>between</i> was superfluous. The explanation is that the verse teaches us that there were dead people and living people before Aaron. Behind Aaron there were dead people and living people. Aaron stood in the middle, and the plague ended when Aaron brought the incense. Before, the <i>Angel of Death</i> killed Israelites and placed all the dead together in one pile and the living stood together separately. However, when Aaron came, the dead remained among the living. The Angel of Death was not able to move. The sages say that Aaron found the Angel of Death who had killed the people. Aaron stopped him and said: Moses sent me to you. The Angel of Death responded: I was sent by God and you were sent by a person. Aaron responded: let us go into the Tabernacle where the Holy One and Moses are found and we will ask them. The Angel of Death did not want to do this. So Aaron held him by the hand and led the Angel of Death before the Holy One and before Moses.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 17:13; Bahya, Numbers, 17:11, 15.</i>
Rashi writes further. Therefore, they stopped the plague with the incense. Because the people said that incense can only kill people. There is poison in it and it killed Nadav and Avihu, and it killed two hundred and fifty men. Therefore, they now took the incense and showed that when there is a plague, the incense can also stop the plague. That is, the incense makes the dead live.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 17:13.</i>
“<i>One staff of each ancestral house</i>” [17:17]. Israel spoke even more evil here. Though they saw three punishments, they were burned, the earth swallowed them, and there was the plague, yet they spoke evil. Therefore, the Holy One had to show a sign, that they should take a staff from each tribe and place it in the Tabernacle. Whichever staff would blossom and grow overnight would be a sign from the Holy One that this tribe was chosen by God to serve in the Tabernacle. Korah had sunk into the ground. With this, the Holy One had shown that the <i>firstborn were ineligible</i> to serve in the Tabernacle, since Korah was also a firstborn. The two hundred and fifty men who were burned with the incense were also firstborn. Thus, it was shown that Aaron was appropriate to be a priest to bring sacrifices, since Aaron had stood with his fire pan among the two hundred and fifty men, and was the only one to remain alive. Israel did not want to have that the firstborn should be exchanged for the Levites. Therefore, a plague came upon them and fourteen thousand-seven hundred died, along with those who died with Korah. After all this, they still spoke evil. Thus, the Holy One made a sign with the staff. The Holy One ordered that each staff be inscribed with the name of its tribe. The tribe of Levi was considered to be one tribe, even though there were two families in it, priest and Levites. The Holy One commanded that they should place the staff of Aaron among all the staffs, so that they should not say that because Aaron’s lay close to the holy place, near the Shekhinah, therefore, his staff blossomed.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Numbers, 17:20, 21.</i>
Ramban writes. Some say that they wrote the names of <i>Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah</i>, all of them one after another. Some also write that they only wrote the names of the <i>chieftains</i> and not those of <i>Reuben, Simeon.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban, Numbers, 17:17.</i>
The next morning they found that Aaron’s staff had flowered. An almond bud had grown on it overnight. Why did an almond bud grow? It grows more quickly than all the other fruits. That is to say, the Holy One also quickly repays the one who argues against the priests.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Numbers, 17:23.</i>
“<i>Each identified and recovered his staff</i>” [17:24]. Each one identified his staff, because each one had written his name on his staff. The Holy One commanded that Aaron’s staff should be placed in the <i>Tent of Meeting</i>, as a sign against the people who wanted to argue against the <i>priesthood.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 17:25.</i>
Israel said: we perished with the fire from the pans, and we were destroyed with the splitting of the earth, and we were destroyed with the plague in which fourteen thousand-seven hundred men were killed. More of us will die. That is, whoever will come close to the Tabernacle must also die. How can we protect ourselves? We must come to the Tabernacle to pray and offer sacrifices. The Holy One responded. Aaron and his children will watch that Israel should not come close to the Tabernacle, and should not touch the Ark, the Table, and the other holy vessels. Aaron should teach the tribe of Levi that they should not touch the holy vessels, and the Levites should further teach Israel that they should not come to their work of guarding the Tabernacle.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Numbers, 17:27; Rashi, Numbers, 18:1.</i>
“<i>They are assigned to you</i>” [18:6]. The Holy One said: I have given the Levites to the priests for them to serve God. That is to say, I have given the Levites to the priests as a present, expecting that no Israelite should come to serve in the Tabernacle. How is it that the <i>prophet Samuel</i> was a Levite and brought a sacrifice himself? The explanation is that it was a one-time necessity.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Numbers, 18:7.</i>
“<i>A service of dedication</i>” [18:7]. I have given the Levites to a service of honor, and not to work as workers whose work is hard and disgusting.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Numbers, 18:7.</i>
“<i>I hereby give you charge of My gifts</i>” [18:8]. Bahya writes. The Torah wrote after this that Israel argued with Aaron about giving <i>terumot</i> and <i>tithes.</i> It is a parable. A king gave a field to his faithful servant and had not yet signed that the field should belong to the faithful servant. Thus, people argued about I and said that the field was not his. The king went and wrote a letter and signed it and said, whoever wishes to argue should cease arguing. So too, the Israelites argued about the <i>priesthood.</i> The Holy One said: I will make it very strong that the priesthood should be for Aaron. I command that they should give terumot and twentyfour presents to the priests in the Temple. It is shown in the portion how arguing is an evil thing, that the people were punished from heaven and earth. First, the fire came down from heaven and burned them. Afterwards, the earth came and swallowed them. Therefore, the people should be warned not to argue with anyone.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Numbers, 18:8.</i>
Toldot Yizhak writes. Many signs appeared on Aaron’s staff. The first was that two flowers grew on the staff. As soon as a flower fell off, the almond grew on it, and one flower always remained on the staff. They picked up the staff with its flower in the Tabernacle and in the Temple. Another miracle on the staff was that two almonds grew. On the right side an almond grew that was sweet. Opposite it on the left side an almond grew that was bitter. When Israel committed sins, the almond on the right side was withered, pale, and it lost its color. The almond on the left side was beautiful and moist. It had its color. When Israel was pious, the almond on the right side was very beautiful and moist and had a beautiful color. The almond on the left side was withered and lost its color. Thus, one could recognize from the staff when Israel was being pious or evil.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Numbers, 17:23.</i>

Chukat

The Holy One wrote <i>hukat</i>, because it is a law and a command from God to keep. Some sages say that the <i>red heifer</i> was commanded by God so that it should be expiation for the Golden Calf that they made in the wilderness. It is a parable. The son of a maid made himself unclean in the palace of the king. The king has the mother called that she should clean up the child that has made himself unclean. In this way the cow should come and should be <i>expiation</i> for its child. This is the Golden Calf. Since they made the Golden Calf, and all of Israel gave their earrings and nosebands, out of silver and gold, to make the Golden Calf, therefore, all of Israel has to give money to make a <i>red heifer.</i> The <i>red heifer</i> was red because Israel committed a sin with the Golden Calf and sins are red. It was completely red, because Israel was this, completely whole and without blemish. When they made the Golden Calf, they became blemished in their souls, and with the <i>red heifer</i> they again became whole. Therefore, <i>Eleazar the priest</i> dealt with the <i>red heifer</i>, since all of Israel had gathered around Aaron the priest to make the Golden Calf. Since Aaron had made the Golden Calf, he did not prepare the <i>red heifer</i>, but his son <i>Eleazar.</i> The <i>red heifer</i> was burned, just like the Golden Calf had been burned. They took a stick of acacia wood, a red silk thread and an herb called <i>hyssop.</i> These three were for the three thousand men who died in the sin of the Golden Calf. The acacia tree is the tallest tree of all trees. The person who commits the sins comes to hold himself high and is <i>arrogant.</i> Therefore, he has to hold himself humble and lowly. The ashes were kept forever, just as the sin of the Golden Calf is eternal, because it was a foreign god. The Holy One pays Israel for this sin in all <i>generations.</i> Just as the Golden Calf made Israel impure, so too the one who prepared the <i>red heifer</i> had to become impure. Just as the Golden Calf was burned and the ashes were spread on the water, the same was done with the <i>red heifer. King Solomon</i> said about the <i>red heifer.</i> I thought that I was very wise, but I cannot understand the wisdom of the <i>red heifer.</i> Even though Scripture wrote about King Solomon that he was wiser than the <i>ancients</i> whose wisdom was from the constellations in heaven, and did clever things with the birds that fly in the heaven. He was wiser than the Egyptians and their wisdom. <i>King Solomon</i> wanted to build the <i>Temple.</i> King Solomon sent to the <i>king of Egypt</i> that he should send him workmen who knew how to build walls. What did the king of Egypt do? He gathered all of his astrologers and they saw which people were supposed to die in that year, and he sent them to King Solomon. As soon as King Solomon saw them coming, he said that these were all dead people. He saw this prophetically and had shrouds made for them, and sent them back to the king of Egypt. He sent a message; did you not have enough shrouds to bury them? He was smarter than <i>Adam.</i> When the Holy One wanted to create humanity, he first consulted the angels. The angels said: what good is this sinful person? The Holy One answered: he is smarter than you are. The Holy One assembled all the domestic and wild animals, and the birds. The Holy One asked the angels: what should we call the creatures? They did not know how to respond. Then he created the person and asked him what they should be called. He gave each one a name and this pleased the Holy One very much. The Holy One asked him, what should you be called? He responded: my name should be Adam, because I was created from the earth. The Holy One responded: what should My name be? He responded: <i>Adonai</i>, since You are the Lord of the whole universe and all the <i>worlds. King Solomon</i> was smarter than <i>Abraham Our Father</i>, <i>Moses Our Teacher</i>, and more than the <i>righteous Joseph.</i> When Joseph was supposed to become a king, they had seventy letters written in <i>seventy languages</i>, and he could read and understand them all, including <i>Hebrew</i>, which the Egyptians could not understand, and Joseph understood them all. The Egyptians had seen that he was not the king, but the Holy One had sent <i>Gabriel</i> and he had taught <i>Joseph the seventy languages.</i> King Solomon was smarter than all of them and yet he could not understand the reason for the <i>red heifer.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Numbers, 19:2.</i>
“<i>He who touches the corpse of any human being</i> – <i>he shall cleanse himself</i>” [19:11–12]. From here we learn that if someone walked behind a corpse, they must wash their hands. It is also an allusion that when the dead will rise at the <i>resurrection of the dead</i>, the Holy One will sprinkle clean water on Israel to purify them. Therefore, we also tear up grass at the <i>cemetery</i> just like the grass withers in the evening and in the morning it sprouts up again from the earth.

<i>Rabbi Yannai</i> spoke: why is the portion of the <i>death of Miriam</i> written close to the <i>red heifer?</i> It shows us that when the pious women die, they are expiation for all of Israel, just like other righteous people, just as the <i>red heifer</i> was expiation.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Numbers, 20:1–2.</i>

The woman is compared to a well. The more one takes water from it, the more water comes into it. So too is the woman. When she does acts of <i>lovingkindness</i> with poor people then her money and goods also increase, as the water in the well. So too, we find that our ancestors found their wives at the well. Isaac sent Eliezer and Rebecca came to the well and gave him and his camels to drink. Jacob encountered Rachel at the well, and Moses Our Teacher encountered Zipporah at the well. Women have few positive commandments, but to give charity. As soon as the well ceased, Israel gathered around Moses and Aaron, who were mourning Miriam. The Holy One said to them: since you are mourners, should Israel die of thirst? Stand up, take the staff and give Israel water.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">I did not find a source for this passage.</i>

This staff was in the hands of Moses Our Teacher and performed all the signs and wonders in Egypt with this staff. This same staff was in the hands of Aaron and this staff became a snake before Pharaoh. The same staff was in the hands of <i>King David</i> to kill <i>Goliath the Philistine.</i> The same staff was in the hands of all the kings until the destruction of the <i>Temple.</i> When the Messiah will come, he will have this staff, and will beat all the nations of the world with this staff.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Hukat, <i>Remez</i>, 763.</i>

“<i>In front of the rock</i>” [20:10]. It was a miracle that all of Israel were in front of the rock, since the <i>rock</i> was not very large and all of Israel saw it at one time.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanhuma</i>, <i>Hukat</i>, 9.</i>
Israel said to Moses: You said, God who is in the whole world, in every place. Since you were a shepherd and had animals in the wilderness for forty years, you know well that the rocks have water, and you rushed to hit the rock. The evildoers thought that this was not a miracle, but they thought that it was under the rock. This angered God. A great deal of water flowed from the rock and drowned the evildoers, just like the Flood. They gathered around Moses and found a stone. The Holy One had promised to give us water from a rock. Moses responded: follow me to the rock. They said: will you not give us from the rock? Moses swore that he would only give them water from the rock that he knows and desires.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Hukat, <i>Remez</i>, 763.</i>

As soon as the well stopped because of Miriam, it went among other rocks and they did not know where it was. Israel were shouting, from which rock will you give us water? Moses became angry and shouted at them: you are rebellious. Shall I draw water from rocks that I have not been commanded to draw water?<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 20:10.</i>
“<i>Struck the rock twice</i>” [20:11]. He hit it twice, since from the first strike no more than a few drops of water came out. Since he did not find the correct rock and did not speak to the correct rock that it should give water, thus it gave no water. Moses thought that he had to hit it and began to hit it. The rock did not want to give water by being hit, but one should speak with it. The Holy One soon sent him the correct rock. Then Moses drew water from the middle of the rock, so that Israel should not say that there was a well under the rock. The water ran like a river, long and wide. It was not possible to give water to all of Israel from the rock alone, particularly their flocks and children. God had told Moses that he should give water to all of Israel with his own hands, expecting to show the great miracle, but the people were very thirsty and quickly wanted to drink themselves.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 20:11; Bahya, Numbers, 20:8.</i>
“<i>Because you did not trust Me enough to affirm My sanctity</i>” [20:12]. Since you did not want to sanctify Me before all of Israel, therefore, you Moses and Aaron will not be worthy to lead Israel into the land of Israel. Even though Moses had spoken before God that Israel had desired meat to eat. If all the sheep and cattle had been slaughtered, they would have enough. This was a great sin that God should not give enough sheep or cattle, the Holy One has many wonders to do. The same sin was magnified by the sin at the rocks. Why did God say to Moses at that time, you must die? The sin at the rocks was before all of Israel and this was a desecration of God’s name, and the Holy One does not forgive this. God forgives all sins without desecration of His name. This was the desecration of God’s name; he was supposed to have spoken to the rock to give water. All of Israel would have said to themselves: a stone does not speak and does not hear and does the will of the Holy One. How much more so, we hear and speak and need food from God, it is just to follow His words.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 20:12.</i>
Some rabbis say. The sin of Moses was that he got angry at Israel, since the attribute of anger is worst of all attributes. The Israelites said that Moses was angry about giving water, just like the <i>Holy One</i> would also have been angry, <i>heaven forbid</i>, and refused to give water. Israel thought that it was, heaven forbid, difficult for the Holy One to give water, because Moses was angry. When one desires something from someone and he gets angry, then one thinks that he does not have it. Therefore, the Holy One was angry with Moses, and swore that he would not come into the land. Even though Moses wanted to pray great prayers, the prayers did not help him, since the Holy One had sworn.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Ibn Shuaib, <i>Derashot</i>, II: 371–372.</i>
Some rabbis say that the sin was that they said, “<i>shall we get water for you</i>” [20:10]. This means, we will get you water. Israel meant that Moses and Aaron wanted to make water from the rocks with their wisdom, as if it was not a miracle from the Holy One. Therefore, the Holy One was angry with them that they made themselves haughty and hung the glory on themselves. Moses said to the Holy One: write what kind of sin I committed, so that people should not say that I committed a great <i>sin</i>, like other Israelites. Therefore, it is written, because you did not believe in Me to sanctify Me. Because of this, you should not come into the land. The Holy One said to Moses: you took six hundred thousand Israelite men out of Egypt and they all died in the wilderness, and only their children will come into the land of Israel. However, those that were buried in the wilderness have no <i>share in the world to come.</i> Therefore, you must also lie with them in the wilderness, expecting that you will bring them into the land of Israel in the days of the Messiah. So spoke <i>Rabbi Hama son of Haninah.</i> You will not bring the people now into the land of Israel, but you will bring all of Israel.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Numbers Rabah</i>, 19.13.</i>
“<i>These are the waters of Meribah</i>” [20:13]. The astrologers said to Pharaoh: we know well that Moses will be killed with water. Therefore, Pharaoh commanded that all the children should be thrown in the water, so that Moses, the helper of Israel, should also die in the water. According to that constellation, Moses had not yet been born. However, they did not know that the water referred to the sin of the rock from which Moses drew water.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 20:13.</i>
“<i>Through which He affirmed His sanctity</i>” [20:13].

“<i>Moses sent messengers</i>” [20:14]. Moses sent a request to the <i>king of Edom.</i> Even though Moses had been punished because of Israel, he would not have served them justly not to send messengers before Israel. Therefore, he sent messengers to the <i>king of Edom.</i> Moses said thusly to the king of Edom. You are also our brothers, <i>children of Abraham.</i> We were both supposed to have gone down together to the exile of Egypt. Since the Holy One said about both of us, you should be <i>strangers</i> in foreign lands. Therefore, your father separated from Jacob our father. He did not want to pay the debt of exile. We were oppressed with many troubles in Egypt.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Numbers Rabah</i>, 19.15.</i>
“<i>He heard our plea</i>” [20:16]. With the blessing that our father Jacob blessed us.

We will travel through your land. Do not deny us this, since you did not help us suffer exile. Help us a little. We will not go through any fields or vineyards.
“<i>We will not drink water from wells</i>” [20:17]. Moses said: we have our own food to eat and water to drink, yet we will buy water and bread for money, expecting that you will make money from us. From here we learn that when a guest is in the inn, even if he has his own food and drink, he should buy from the innkeeper for money, expecting that the innkeeper should make money from him. We will bind the mouths of our animals, so that they should not eat the grass of your fields. We will not turn to the right or to the left. Even though we have permission to kill all the nations, we will do nothing to your nation.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 20:17.</i>

“<i>For you broke faith with me</i>” [Deuteronomy, 32:51]. The righteous are punished by the Holy One for a small sin. When a righteous person dies, he immediately sees the <i>Shekhinah</i> and also <i>Adam.</i> They argue with Adam and say to him, you caused that we die. You brought death into the world with your sin. <i>Adam</i> responds: I only committed one sin, and you committed many sins.

“<i>Mount Hor</i>” [20:23]. There were two high mountains opposite each other. Even though the <i>cloud</i> that went before Israel in the wilderness masked wherever there was a mountain, expecting that Israel would not go over the mountains, but on the straight path. Nonetheless, three mountains remained visible. One was <i>Mount Sinai</i>, on which to give the Torah. The second was called <i>Mount Nebo</i>, to be a grave for Moses. The third was <i>Mount Hor</i>, where <i>Aaron the priest</i> was buried.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 20:22.</i>

<i>Rabbi Huna</i> said: what did Moses do? He woke up early and called Aaron. Aaron said: why have you come so early? Moses responded: I was studying at night and I have many questions in the <i>Book of Genesis.</i> They opened the <i>Book of Genesis</i> and read it together until they came to the story of <i>Adam.</i> Moses said: see what happened to Adam. He had to die. Aaron responded: see how they were worthy of thirteen <i>canopies</i> made of precious stones in the <i>Garden of Eden.</i> Afterwards, it is written, you are only earth and earth you will be. Moses responded: I ruled over angels in heaven and you, Aaron, ruled over angels and over the Angel of Death. You stopped him, so that he could not touch Israel to kill them. Yet, we must all die, and we do not have long to live. Aaron understood immediately and said: Moses, did you begin this for my sake? Moses responded: yes. Aaron said: my heart is dejected. Moses said: do you want to die? Aaron responded: yes. Moses said: then we will go up the mountain. Moses, Aaron, and Eleazar went before all of Israel. However, if Israel had known that Aaron was going so that he would die, they would not have allowed him to go. They would have offered great prayers for him, and they thought that he had something to discuss with the Shekhinah. As soon as they came to the mountain, the cave opened and there was a bed in it. Moses said to Aaron. Miriam died here. Here, you and I buried her and honored her. Now, you will die and Eleazar and I will deal with you. However, when I will die, who will deal with me? The Holy One responded: I will deal with you. When they went out, the cave closed, since God had told them to leave. All of Israel saw that only Moses and Eleazar came alone from the mountain and Aaron was not with them. Some Israelites said that Moses had killed him; he also wants to have his <i>priesthood.</i> Some said that Eleazar had killed him. He wants to be the high priest. Some said that he died, as the entire world will die. All of Israel immediately gathered and said: where have you put Aaron? Moses said: he died. They said: how can it be, the Angel of Death cannot do anything to him? He subdued the Angel of Death at the plague. Therefore, if you will not bring him, we will stone you and Eleazar. Moses immediately prayed and soon the angels took Aaron’s casket in which he lay. They showed the casket and how Aaron died under heaven, and the angels praised and sang near the casket. Then all of Israel saw that he had died. Some sages say that the Holy One opened the cave and all of Israel went in and saw that he had died.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Hukat, <i>Remez</i>, 764.</i>
“<i>All the house of Israel bewailed Aaron thirty days</i>” [20:29]. The whole house of Israel bewailed Aaron, but for <i>Moses</i> only the men cried.

When <i>Aaron</i> came into the cave, he saw a beautiful bed that had been prepared and a beautiful lamp that was lit. <i>Moses said to Aaron.</i> Lie down on the bed and he lay down on the bed.

“<i>The Canaanite heard</i>” [21:1]. The Canaanite heard. This was Amalek, the son of Esau, who heard that Aaron had died. He had disguised himself with other clothes and spoke a different language, so that he should not be recognized, expecting that when Israel would pray to God about this people that they should not know their name. When Israel would ask God to give them the Canaanites, Amalek would not be included among those to be destroyed. However, the Israelites were smart and they asked in general, give this people into our hands. They did not mention the name of a particular people. The verse calls Amalek, Canaanite, because God had forbidden that there should be wars with Edom. However, because Amalek was also the son of Edom, and he had started many wars with Israel himself, therefore, the Holy One had said to Israel that they should no longer be called Amalek, but Canaanites, expecting that they could be killed, like the Canaanites. Since Amalek disguised himself with a different language and different clothes, therefore, we also disguise ourselves on Purim, since Haman was descended from Amalek. We show that the disguise did not help.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">The reference to Amalek and disguise and its relation to the practice of Purim disguises is not found in the <i>Yalkut Shimoni.</i> It is an addition by the author.</i> Esau had left a testament to Amalek that he should take revenge on Israel. So when Israel would commit sins, then you will be able to kill them. Previously, the clouds had surrounded Israel and no people could reach them. The clouds were like a wall. Therefore, as soon as he had heard that Aaron had died and the clouds had removed themselves from Israel, Amalek thought that Israel must be sinful, because Aaron had died and the clouds had left them.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Hukat, <i>Remez</i>, 764.</i>
“<i>There is no bread and no water</i>” [21:5]. Even though they had <i>manna</i> and the <i>well</i>, yet they said, we are unlike other nations. They have bread for a number of days and we do not for more than one day. The next day the Holy One gives us <i>manna</i> again from heaven, and we do not see enough bread before us. We even worry that we should have enough water. <i>Rabbi Akiva</i> said: when a merchant brought good fruits from the land of Israel to sell to the Israelites, they died from the fruits. God had said that no Israelite should taste the goodness of the land of Israel, because they spoke evil about the land of Israel. However, their children were worthy to come into the land of Israel. Rabbi [Judah the Prince] said: The Holy One was angry at Israel and said: I gave them easy bread, that they did not have to have bowel movements, since the <i>manna</i> they ate was digested in the stomach and went into their organs, not like other bread. They did not need a <i>toilet.</i> Israel spoke evil about the <i>manna.</i> They were afraid that it would harm their stomachs. They said: how is it possible that a person should eat and have no excrement? However, the Holy One showed them that they were like the angels who have no excrement, and the Holy One can easily heal them that they will have no need of excrement. Why did He not give them enough bread at one time, expecting that Israel would get used to trust in God? Every day they looked to heaven to give bread. Thus, they were used to trust in God. God desires that we should rely on God. He sustains each person with grace, and money does not help.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Numbers, 21:5.</i>
“<i>The Lord sent serpents against the people</i>” [21:6]. The Holy One sent serpents against Israel to kill them, because they had spoken evil about the <i>manna.</i> Why did he send serpents, because the serpent had also spoken evil about God? Therefore, the serpent should come and pay Israel their due for speaking evil. Another explanation is that the serpent was cursed, so that what they ate, even the best food, tasted of earth. However, Israel ate <i>manna</i>, which had every taste that the person thought about, when he ate it. Yet they spoke evil. Therefore, the serpent should pay Israel their due. Another explanation is that there were many large serpents. They were as large as a thick pillar. They were all in the wilderness. It was a great danger to pass by them, but the Holy One had sent a cloud of fire in front of Israel and burned all of the snakes that were in the wilderness. Now that Israel had committed sins and spoke evil about the <i>manna</i>, God made the great serpents come back to life and they burned many Israelites with their poison. Therefore, it is written, “<i>seraph serpents</i>” [21:6]. This means, the burning serpents, and also means that they were burned.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Numbers, 21:5.</i>
“<i>Anyone who is bitten</i>” [21:8]. Everything that it bites, even a wild animal or a mad dog is a great danger for the person. Israel immediately came to Moses and said: we have sinned against the Holy One and against you. Pray for us that God should remove the snakes. Moses immediately prayed to God. From here we should learn that one should not be haughty. Similarly, when someone speaks ill of him, he should quickly forgive when he is asked for forgiveness and should not hold himself hard. When he does not forgive quickly, he is called a sinful person and God does not forgive his sins, as we find concerning Moses. They spoke much evil against him, yet he immediately prayed to God. The person should not think that when he has committed sins, that God will not forgive him. God is full of grace and forgives the one who only asks.
“<i>Make a seraph</i>” [21:8]. God said to Moses: make a serpent, put it on a tall pole and let Israel look at it, so they will be healed. God said to Moses: I forgive what Israel said about Me, but what Israel said against you, that I do not forgive. God said: it is a great sin before Me that one speaks against sages or prophets.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Numbers, 21:8.</i>
This was a great miracle. It is normal that when a mad dog bites a person and poisons him with the bite, then the person always thinks that the dog is before him. It is in his thoughts. If that person would put some of his urine in a glass, he would see many dogs in the urine. However, if one were to strain the urine through a cloth, then one would not see it. This happens because the person was bitten. He still has mad dogs in his thoughts. However, with regard to the serpents that bit the Israelites, the Holy One made a miracle. Even though they looked at the serpent, yet they were healed.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Numbers, 21:9.</i>
Some say that this is why they put the serpent high, so that each Israelite should raise their eyes to heaven, to God. Then he will be healed. The serpent does not heal, but God is the one who heals.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 21:8.</i>
Our sages said the following in the Talmud. The one who is bitten by a mad dog should not drink from a glass for a whole year, since he will see young dogs in the glass and must die from this. One should not mention dogs near him, since it is a great danger for him to hear about dogs. Therefore, the Holy One wants to show that the snake does not kill, but the sins kill the person. When the Holy One wants, he can make the poison a remedy.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Numbers, 21:9.</i>
“<i>Therefore the Book of the Wars of the Lord speaks of</i>” [21:14]. The Holy One said: when you will study the Book of the Commandments and Torah, then I will wage war for you, and you will win all the wars. Great miracles happened at the Red Sea. There were two large mountains and there was a road between them that Israel should go to the land of Israel. All the nations of the world gathered in the valley and hid in the caves of this valley, since on one side there were caves and great pits. The other side was jagged and pointed. The nations said: when Israel will go through the valley, we will kill them. When Israel came to the mountains, the Holy One commanded that the two mountains should come together and squeezed the nations that were hidden there, and one could not recognize that there were two mountains. The way was now flat and one could not see any valley anymore. The well of Israel went down into the valley and killed the strong nations. Israel went on its way and did not know about the miracles. The Holy One said: I will let My children know about all the nations that were destroyed in that valley. He sent the well into the valley and he caused many feet, hands, heads, and much blood to flow and swim from it. Israel saw many wonders and saw the <i>well</i> standing in the middle of the valley and shining like the moon. It poured out human limbs, and red blood shot out.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanhuma</i>, <i>Hukat</i>, 20.</i>
Israel sang a <i>song</i> and Moses Our Teacher was not mentioned in the <i>song.</i> Why, because Moses had committed a sin by the well, and he was punished because of the <i>well.</i> Because Moses is not mentioned by the well, God also ordered that his name should not be written in the song. It is a parable. A great minister invited a king to a banquet. The king asked, is my good friend here? Then I will come. If he is not here, then I will also not be at the banquet. Therefore, the Holy One did not allow His holy name to be written in the song.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Numbers, 21:18.</i>
“<i>The well which the chieftains dug</i>” [21:18]. A well that was dug by the chieftains. Each chieftain of his tribe stood by the <i>well</i> and pointed with his staff and led the water from the well to his tribe and its banner, expecting that each tribe would have its own separate brook. He had to travel in a boat, since the waters surrounded each tribe separately. Nice vegetation and beautiful trees grew near the water, as the verse says, “<i>He makes me lie down in green pastures; He leads me to water in places of repose</i>” [Psalms, 23:2]. He makes me rest in a dwelling of grass. He leads me near still waters. Why did Israel recite songs at the <i>well</i> and not at the <i>manna?</i> Concerning the <i>manna</i> they had spoken much evil. Therefore, God said: I do not desire your songs and praises, bcause you have spoken evil about the <i>manna.</i> However, concerning the water they always spoke positively. The <i>well</i> came with them to the sea of <i>Tiberias</i>, and stood in the middle of the sea.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Hukat, <i>Remez</i>, 764.</i>

“<i>Nahaliel</i>” [21:19]. The one who studies Torah is the heir of God, since God is his <i>inheritance.</i> The Torah says thusly to the Holy One. It is written that the one who studies Torah will have wealth and honor, and my children study Torah and they are very poor. The Holy One responded: they are poor in this world, expecting that they should study Torah and should have nothing from it, but the study of Torah. However, in the next world they have great honor.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Hukat, <i>Remez</i>, 764.</i>
“<i>From Bamot to the valley</i>” [21:19]. The one who holds himself high, makes God lowly.

“<i>Israel sent messengers to Sihon</i>” [21:21]. See how great a positive commandment relates to peace. Regarding all the other positive commandments, the person is not obligated to search for them, but when a positive commandment comes to hand he must fulfill it. However, with regard to the commandment of peace, the Holy One wrote, you should search to make peace, as the verse says, “<i>seek peace</i>” [Psalms, 34:15]. This means, seek peace. Israel was doing this now also. Even though the Holy One had ordered Israel to kill all the nations, yet Israel sent to the nations in case they wanted to make peace. Sihon was a strong king, his city was also very strong and his people were very numerous. The Holy One said: Israel will have to exert themselves greatly to kill them. The Holy One implanted the idea in Sihon that he should gather his whole people in one group and they should out of their strong city toward Israel in the open field. The Holy One immediately took the angels who were appointed over all the nations in heaven, and the Holy One tied them all up, and threw them down before Moses. He said: see Moses, you have them all in your hands. Do not be afraid, since when the angels were with the nations, they had power. He was called the king of Sihon because the whole world spoke of his strength. He had a son who was also very strong. Sihon did not want to allow Israel to pass through his land, since all the kings of the nations gave <i>Sihon tribute</i> that he should not allow Israel pass through his land. Therefore, Sihon said to Israel: how can I let you pass through my land? I must guard that you Israel should not pass through. Therefore, all the nations from all the cities gathered and went out together in one group. They were all killed together. Afterwards, Israel went into their cities without any trouble.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Hukat, <i>Remez</i>, 764.</i>
“<i>Do not fear him</i>” [21:34]. God said to Moses, do not be afraid, since the attribute of the righteous is that they are fearful. Even though God promised them that He would protect them, and Moses was fearful. He thought: perhaps Israel committed a sin. The Holy One said: do not be afraid, even though Og was very strong. I will give him into your hands. Og had lived in the days of Abraham. When his nephew Lot was captured, it was Og who came to Abraham and told him how his nephew, <i>Lot</i>, was captured. Og’s intention was that Abraham should be killed in the war. Nonetheless, he saved Lot and his household. Therefore, <i>Og</i> merited living for so long. In the end, Og fell into the hands of Abraham’s descendants, since <i>God, may He be exalted</i>, pays each one his good reward. Therefore, Moses said: I am afraid of <i>Og</i> since I am one hundred and twenty years old and he lived five hundred years before Abraham. If <i>Og did not have special merit</i> he would not have lived for so long. The Holy One responded to Moses: do not be afraid.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Numbers, 21:34.</i>
“<i>They defeated him and his sons</i>” [21:35]. They killed Og and his son who was as strong as his father, and was even stronger. The Holy One said to Israel: in this world you destroy the evildoers one at a time, but in the days of the Messiah, you will destroy groups of evildoers at one time. <i>Rabbi Yohanan</i> said: Moses was more afraid of Og than of Sihon, even though Og and Sihon were brothers, since Moses thought that the <i>merit of Abraham</i> would not be enough support. Og said: how great is the gate of Israel? I will tear out a mountain that is three miles large and I will throw it at Israel to kill them. He tore out a mountain and raised it over his head. The Holy One brought mice and worms and they made a large hole in the mountain. The mountain fell on Og’s neck and he could not remove it from his neck. The Holy One then caused Og’s teeth to grow into the mountain. Moses was ten cubits tall and he took a large ax that was also ten cubits tall. Moses jumped ten cubits and Moses only reached his shins and killed him. <i>Abba Shaul</i> said: I was a <i>gravedigger</i> who buried the dead. Once I was running after a stag and it came into a mighty bone of a dead person. I ran three miles after the stag and I could not catch the stag, and the bone did not end. I went back and I was told that this was a bone of <i>Og, king of Bashan.</i> Some sages say that Og was Eliezer, the servant of Abraham, and his footstep was forty miles. Once, Abraham shouted at Og and he became very frightened and a tooth fell from Og’s mouth. Abraham took that tooth and made a beautiful bed from it to sleep on. Some say that he made a chair from it. Og made and built sixty cities. The smallest one was sixty miles high. Every day Og ate one thousand oxen and one thousand animals. Og was descended from the angels that fell from heaven. These angels had sexual relations with the women in the days of Noah, and Og was born before the Flood. The water came and drowned the whole world, but Noah and his family survived it. Og went onto the top of the ark and he held on to the roof of the ark and this is how he was protected from the Flood. Og’s father was the <i>angel Shamhazel.</i> The same angel slept with the wife of Ham, the son of Noah, when she was supposed to go into the ark. Ham’s wife became pregnant from that angel and gave birth to Sihon in the ark. He was the brother of Og. This is why Ham slept with his wife in the ark, expecting that people would think that he had Sihon with her and she did not engage in illicit sexual relations, even though nobody was supposed to sleep with his wife in the ark. Yet, one could see how the Holy One helps the righteous. All the strength of Sihon and Og did not help them, as the verse says, “<i>He does not prize the strength of horses, nor value the fleetness of men; but the Lord values those who fear Him, those who depend on His faithful care</i>” [Psalms, 147:10–11]. This means, strong horses and strong men do not help, but the one who fears God and hopes for His grace.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Hukat, <i>Remez</i>, 765.</i>

Balak

“<i>Balak saw</i>” [22:2]. <i>Balak</i>, king of <i>Moab</i> saw that the two mighty kings Sihon and Og and their people could not withstand Israel. Therefore, he was very frightened of Israel. It is written here, “<i>Balak, son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites</i>” [22:2]. The verse does not call Balak, king, from this time onward, since he saw that the two mighty kings could not withstand them. He thought to himself that he was not a king. Therefore, the verse does not call him king. He said: these two kings protected us. We paid them <i>taxes</i> and they perished, <i>how much more so</i> us.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Numbers, 22:2.</i>
“<i>Moab said to the elders of Midian</i>” [22:4]. <i>Moab</i> said to the elders of <i>Midian</i> that the nations have seen that Israel killed all the nations, not as is customary among the other nations. They asked the elders of <i>Midian.</i> Since Moses Our Teacher was raised among you and lived with Jethro, in the land of Midian, therefore tell us what do they know that they defeat all the nations? Even though the two kings, <i>Moab and Midian</i>, hated each other, but they now made up and made peace since they were afraid of Israel. A parable. Two dogs were always inciting each other. A wolf came and attacked one of them. The other dog reflected, if I will not help the dog today or tomorrow, the wolf will also come after me. The two kings thought the same way. Therefore they made peace with each other. They thought that they would attack Israel.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Numbers, 22:4.</i>
“<i>As an ox licks</i>” [22:4]. He said: they will eat us like the ox eats the grass, and where the ox eats; it does not soon grow back. Also, the power of Israel is in their mouth, to pray and to study Torah. <i>Balak</i> became king over Midian from the time that <i>Sihon</i> was killed.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 22:4.</i>
“<i>He sent messengers to Balaam</i>” [22:5]. He sent messengers to Balaam. He said: since Israel’s power is with their mouth, I also want to bring against Israel one who will have power with his mouth to curse.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 22:4.</i> This was <i>Balaam Pethorah.</i>
“<i>Pethor</i>” [22:5]. Balaam’s name was <i>Pethorah.</i> He was able to interpret any dream that a person dreamed. The word <i>Pethorah</i> means, to explicate and interpret. Afterwards, he became a <i>sorcerer.</i> Afterwards, he became a prophet of God for the <i>nations of the world.</i> Therefore, the Holy One allowed the Shekhinah to rest on the <i>nations of the world</i>, expecting that the nations of the world should not be able to say to the Holy One, if You had also given us prophets, we would have been as pious as Israel. He gave them <i>Balaam</i> as a prophet. The good Balaam told them to sin and engage in illicit sex. Previously, the nations had also been pious regarding <i>sexual relations</i>, but Balaam taught them to engage in illicit <i>sexual relations.</i> So too, the Holy One placed kings from the <i>nations of the world</i> over the whole world, <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i> like <i>King Solomon.</i> However, <i>King Solomon</i> built the <i>Temple</i> for God and <i>Nebuchadnezzar destroyed the Temple.</i> God gave great wealth to <i>King David</i> and he gave it all to the Temple. God gave wealth to Haman and he wanted to have <i>all of Israel</i> killed, <i>heaven forbid.</i> Therefore, the portion about Balaam was written. He wants to show us that he was an evildoer, and therefore the Holy One took away the prophecy.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, <i>Balak</i>, <i>Remez</i>, 765.</i>
“<i>Whom you bless is blessed</i>” [22:6]. The one you bless, he will be blessed. Whoever you curse, will be cursed. Balaam was an astrologer. When he saw evil in the stars in heaven for a person, then Balaam also cursed him. Thus, people thought that he had cursed him. In any event, his curses did not help against the Holy One. No person can change the decree of the Holy One. Therefore. Balak also thought that Balaam was able to curse.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Sanhedrin</i>, 105b.</i>
“<i>Versed in divination</i>” [22:7]. The elders of Moab and Midian took with them all sorts of things relating to magic, expecting that Balaam should have no excuse not to do magic. They also took along silver and gold as a payment to Balaam so that he would do magic. The elders of Moab and Midian said: we will see if he knows anything. If he would put the matter off, then it is certainly not upon him. As soon as he said, wait until tomorrow, the elders left and the nobles of Moab sat with Balaam.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 22:7.</i>
“<i>Spend the night here</i>” [22:8]. Spend the night here. The Holy One appears to the <i>nations of the world</i> at night and to Israel He appears during the day. He appears to the nations through dreams. Balaam was haughty. He thought that the messengers were too ordinary. He wanted to have important nobles and therefore he answered them negatively.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 22:8.</i>
“<i>What do these people want of you?</i>” [22:9]. The Holy One, who knows all secrets, asked Balaam, who are these men with you, expecting, that the Holy One wanted to mislead Balaam in order to destroy him. Balaam said: God does not know who these men are, then God does not know everything. Thus, I will seek a time when God will not know and I will curse Israel. The Holy One said to Balaam, do not go with them. Balaam responded: then I will curse them at home. The Holy One responded: do not curse them. Balaam responded: then I will bless them. The Holy One responded: they do not need your blessing; they are already blessed. Balaam came and said to the nobles of Balak, go home. God has told me not to go with you, but with important ministers. Balaam was haughty and did not want to show that he was in the power of the Holy One. Balak immediately sent important ministers and had them say to Balaam: I will honor you greatly, but curse Israel. Balaam responded: if you will give me your whole house filled with silver and gold, I cannot do other than what God tells me. From this we learn that Balaam was someone who desired much money and goods. Balaam said: it is just to give me all of his silver and gold. He must have many people to wage war, and it is a question if he will win. However, he will certainly win with my cursing. Soon afterwards he had to admit that he was in God’s hands. He said: I cannot do anything without God’s will. He said to the ministers: spend the night and you will also hear what God will say to me, that I should not change from blessing to curse. Who wants that he should not continue to bless Israel? He had prophesied that he would bless Israel in the end. Balaam called the ministers, <i>servants.</i> He said: you are servants of a person and you must do what he orders, even though,with regard to God, I must also do what God orders. God said to Balaam: if they will give you money as a payment, go with them. However, in any event, do what I will tell you. Nonetheless, Balaam went with them. He thought to himself: perhaps I will convince God. He girded his donkey himself, even though he had many servants, out of the joy of cursing Israel. The Holy One said: Abraham is the father of Israel. He woke up early to gird his donkey to slaughter Isaac, his son, as a sacrifice to God. Israel benefited from this merit. You will not be able to do anything to them. He angered God that he went with them. However, the Holy One only told him to go and not to curse. At first, God said: you should not go and afterwards, you should go. This teaches us that the way the person understands which way he should go, God guides him. One can ask. Why did the Holy One forbid him from cursing? Let him curse all day and let God bless them. His curses would be for naught. If Balaam had the power to bless, why did he not bless Balak that Israel should not touch Balak and not injure him? All that Balak had desired from <i>Balaam</i> that he should be protected from Israel. When Balaam could not curse Israel, he should have at least blessed Balak that he should be protected, and Balak would have certainly paid him well. From this we learn that he could not bless. If he would have been able to bless, why did he not bless himself to be rich? Then he would not have needed Balak’s silver. We also find that he blessed himself that he should die a clean death, but his blessing was not fulfilled. He had an <i>unnatural death</i>, being killed by the sword. He made magic that he flew in the air under heaven. However, Israel caused, by means of <i>magical names</i>, that he fell down to the ground and was killed with the sword. This shows that his blessing was nothing, and his curse was also nothing. Why did the Holy One forbid him to curse? The Holy One did not want to have that he would curse, since the Holy One knew that many Israelites would fall in the plague, because they had sinned with illicit sexual relations. If Balaam had cursed, the people would have said that they died because Balaam had cursed them. Therefore, the Holy One forbade cursing them. However, Balaam could not curse or bless. He waited for a time when the Holy One was angry, and he cursed at that time. At this time, the Holy One was not angry. An angel placed himself in front of Balaam with his naked sword. The angel spoke: I can kill him without the sword. I will only blow on him and he will die and be burned. However, he undertook to curse with his mouth, which is something that has not been done before. He should have done like the other nations who war with the sword. Therefore, the angel said: I will also do something different and will take a sword. The donkey saw the angel and became very frightened, but Balaam did not see the angel. The angel stood in Balaam’s way, three times in three places. First, in a field that had no fences. This was for Abraham, who had ordinary children on both sides, the children of <i>Hagar</i> and <i>Keturah.</i> Therefore, he thought to curse them. The second place there was a wall on one side, and the donkey pushed Balaam’s foot against the wall. The wall was for Isaac, who had an evil son on one side, the <i>evil Esau.</i> The third place there was a wall on both sides. This was for <i>Jacob.</i> His children were all good and pious. Therefore, the third time he could not move on both sides. Balaam hit the donkey three times and God opened the donkey’s mouth and she said to Balaam. You have hit me three times because you wanted to go to curse Israel, who made pilgrimages three times in the year to Jerusalem, to praise the Holy One. Balaam said: if I had a sword, I would have killed you. The donkey responded: you are supposed to curse a great nation to kill them, and to kill me you need to have a sword? When you can curse with your mouth, put away the sword. He could not respond. The ministers of Moab were amazed, and saw his disgrace and the great miracle. The people asked him: why did you not ride a horse? He responded: I left a horse in the meadow. The donkey answered: I am your donkey. He responded: you are mine to carry a noble burden. She answered: you ride on me. Balaam responded: it happened once this way. She responded: you have been riding on me since your youth, and you lie with me like with your wife. The Holy One opened Balaam’s eyes and he saw the angel with a naked sword. Balaam bowed down and fell to the ground. The angel said: why did you beat the donkey? He said to Balaam: the donkey has no ancestral merit and no ancestral covenant and I have been commanded to respond because you beat the donkey. How much more so am I obligated to punish you because you were not supposed to curse Israel, who have <i>ancestral merit</i> and an <i>ancestral covenant.</i> Balaam responded: I did not know this. The ministers saw that he knew nothing and his disgrace before the ministers was very great. Balaam said: if God wants, I will turn back, since God told me to go with them. This is customary with the Holy One. He told Abraham to bring his son called Isaac as a sacrifice. Afterwards, He again sent an angel to tell him that he should not touch him. The angel responded: go with them. From here we learn, the person is led whichever way he wants to go. The donkey died, so that the nations should not make it a god. The Holy One had compassion on the evildoer so that the people should not remember his disgrace, what happened to him because of the donkey. Another explanation is that the donkey died because the Holy One created it during the <i>six days of creation</i> so that it should speak to Balaam. When it finished speaking with Balaam it died. He built seven altars. He said; seven elders of Israel made seven altars – <i>Adam, Cain, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and Moses.</i> Each one did not make more than one altar. I will make seven, in relation to all of them. Balaam said: it is Your honor that You should receive sacrifices from many nations. However, the Holy One informed him that He did not desire his sacrifices. Balak led Balaam on many mountains expecting that he would see Israel with his eyes and would cast an <i>evil eye</i> on them. God went toward Balaam. He did not want that he should come to the Holy One’s house. A parable. Two people knock on the king’s door; one of them is his friend and the other is a leper. The king says, let my friend come in to me, and let the leper go home. Balaam limped on one foot and blind in one eye. The verse calls him “<i>gever</i>” [24:3].<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">The term “<i>gever</i>” means man, in the verse. It is also used as a term for a rooster and this is the basis of the play on words here.</i> This means, a rooster, since Balaam was like a rooster in that a rooster engages in much sex. So too, Balaam engaged in much sex, even with his donkey. Another way in which he was like a rooster who shows the people when it becomes day, and when it will be midnight. So too, Balaam knew the time when the Holy One was angry, and he would curse Israel then. In addition, Balaam had only one foot. At the time when the Holy One is angry with the people, the rooster closes his eyes and stands on one foot. Similarly, Balaam was blind in one eye and stood on one foot, since he limped on one foot. The rooster crows seven times in one night. So too, Balaam erected seven altars. When he crows, the <i>demons</i> fly away. Therefore, every day we recite the blessing “<i>who gives the rooster intelligence.</i>”<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">It is one of the blessings at the beginning of the morning prayers.</i> This means, You have given intelligence to the rooster that he knows the time of the demons. Balaam shouted very loudly, expecting that all the nations would hear and be envious of Israel. Balaam said to Balak from the city of <i>Aram:</i> if you want that I should curse Israel, their ancestor Abraham left Aram with nothing but blessings. Jacob also went to the city of Aram with nothing but blessings. He ran away because of Esau. Furthermore, if not for Abraham who protected Lot from Sodom, Lot and his daughters would have perished and you would not have come into the world, since Balak was descended from Lot’s daughters, the daughters of Moab. I, Balaam, would also not have been, since before Jacob came to Laban, Laban had no sons. When Jacob came to <i>Laban</i>, the Holy One blessed him and gave Laban a son. I, <i>Balaam</i>, am descended from that son. Therefore, how should both of us curse Israel? Their fathers brought us into the world. Balaam said: if you tell me to curse Jacob, I cannot do this. However, if you should tell me to curse <i>Abraham and Isaac</i>, that I could certainly do. However, I cannot curse Jacob, since Jacob is called God’s <i>guarantor</i> to his beloved people, more than any other nation. Balaam said to Balak. Whoever curses Israel curses himself. Even when they are worthy of being cursed, they were not cursed, as we find when Jacob lied to his father, Isaac, and took the blessing. It would have been just for Isaac to curse Jacob, but he blessed him even more than before. So, how should I curse him? Even when they made the Golden Calf, it would have been just for them to be cursed by God. Yet, God gave them everything good, and gave them the <i>manna</i>, the <i>well</i>, and the clouds encircled them. Balaam said: God is not angry at Israel now. Therefore, I cannot curse Israel, since I know well the time when God is angry. Our sages say: if the Holy One got angry at the same time, there would not be many of Israel left, heaven forbid. Even though the Holy One gets angry at Israel, this does not happen for more than the length of an eye blink, as long as it takes to say the word, second. However, Balaam was smart. He wanted to say the word <i>khulam</i> in <i>Hebrew</i>, which means corrupt them. However, the Holy One reversed his evil thought and made the word <i>melekh</i>, from the word <i>khulam.</i> This means that God is king. Balaam said: Israel is one people when they are happy and have a joyous occasion. This is why they do not mix with the other nations. However, all the other nations, when they have a joyous occasion, they drink with all the nations. They also have many commandments. Who can count all the commandments that they do with the ashes of the <i>red heifer</i>, and the ashes that they made the woman drink who secluded herself with a strange man, and the ashes into which they put the foreskin of the circumcision when they circumcised their children? Balaam asked God that he should die with the death that Israelites died, and his end should be like the end of Israelites. However, the Holy One allowed him to be killed in an evil death. He did not live more than thirty-three years and he was killed with the sword. One can ask, what did Balaam mean when he said that Israel keeps the commandments with the ashes of the red heifer, the ashes of the suspected woman, and the commandment of the mixed seeds? This is that one should not sow grain or wheat in a vineyard. Why did he not mention more important commandments that Israel keep? Balaam was an evil genius. He saw that one could do nothing to Israel with war or with curses. He thought that Israel continues to exist because they are very pious. We find three transgressions that are considered severe by the Holy One. He killed the whole world because of these three severe transgressions, as we find by the Flood. They are, worshiping foreign gods, illicit sexual relations, and stealing. God brought the Flood because of these three transgressions. Now, Balaam said: Israel was warned about these three transgressions. Concerning worship of foreign gods, they made the Golden Calf, for which the red heifer atones for the Golden Calf. When they will think about the ashes of the red heifer, they will guard themselves against making foreign gods. Concerning the transgression of illicit sexual relations, they have the ashes of the suspected woman. As soon as a woman is suspected of having illicit sexual relations, even if there are no witnesses, yet she is given water to drink with the ashes in the Temple. She became swollen from that water. Therefore, each woman was careful not to engage in illicit sexual relations because of the ashes of the suspected woman. Therefore, Balaam said: one can do nothing to them; they have no illicit sex among them. They were even commanded that their animals should not engage in illicit sex, that they should not harness an ox with a donkey. The Flood occurred because the domestic animals, wild animals, and birds became intermixed by lying down with each other. Therefore, Balaam also said that they have commandments by the ashes. When they want to plow the field, they should not plow with an ox and a donkey, expecting that they should not lie together. If the ox and donkey plowed together, they would then come into one stall and would have relations with each other. Balaam said: therefore they are commanded to even protect their animals from illicit sex and even more so themselves. Israel has more commandments with the ashes. They are commanded not to sow grain or wheat near the vineyard, and four cubits from the vine, expecting that the grain or wheat should not take away the strength from the vine. When they are sown close to each other, then one steals the strength of the other. Balaam said: they are commanded concerning the vineyard, so that one should not steal from the other, so how should they steal from each other? Israel are further commanded with the ashes. They have their children circumcised and cover the foreskin with ashes, because they keep circumcision, they do not engage in illicit sex. The ashes with which one covers the foreskin causes them to be protected from illicit sex, and the commandment of circumcision is because of this. Balaam saw all this, that they have the commandments. Therefore, Balaam and Balak thought and said: we must think how we can make Israel sin with these transgressions. These are worshiping foreign gods and engaging in illicit sex, as I will write below in this portion. The <i>evil Balaam</i> shouted very loud when he blessed Israel. <i>Rabbi Joshua son of Levi</i> said: Balaam’s voice was heard seventy miles away. <i>Rabbi Eliezer the Kapar</i> said: the Holy One gave Balaam the strength so that his voice was heard from one end of the world to the other end. Therefore, because He saw all the <i>nations of the word</i> bowing down to the sun, moon, and stars, wood and stone, He caused that his voice should be heard in the whole world. Balak said to Balaam: I called you to curse them and you bless them. Balaam responded: I must do what God ordered. “<i>Go up to the summit of Pisgah</i>” [Deuteronomy, 3:27]. Balak had seen that <i>Moses Our Teacher</i> would die at the “<i>summit of Pisgah.</i>” Therefore, Balak led Balaam to that place to curse. As soon as the ministers saw that he was blessing Israel, several of the ministers left and only a few ministers remained with Balaam. Balak <i>pressed</i> Balaam and asked him, what did God say, since you do not know anything alone, without God? Balaam became angry and said to him: you Balak, you sit. You might also stand on your feet because of the honor of the Holy One. Balaam said: God is not like a person who says something. Afterwards, he thought more and said, God forbade me to curse and he does not repeat.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">The primary source is <i>Tanhuma</i>, Balak, 5–14.</i>
“<i>In sight</i>” [23:21]. Balaam said: the Holy One is not punctilious about the transgressions of Israel, but He sees what kind of commandments they did. Therefore, you Balak, how should I curse them when the Holy One protects them and does not sleep? Balak said: who will lead them after Moses’ death? Perhaps you will be able to do something to him. He responded: this one is Joshua and he is very important. He will only blow the ram’s horn and he will cause important and strong walls to fall with his blasts. Concerning this, the verse said here, “<i>the king</i>’<i>s blasts</i>” [23:21]. This means, he will blow and sound, and his kingdom will be shown.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanhuma</i>, Balak, 14.</i>
“<i>God who freed them</i>” [23:22]. You Balak said that the people went out of Egypt by themselves. This is not true. The strong God took them out of Egypt. When Israel commits a few transgressions, God punishes them immediately, and when they are a little pious, he makes them very important.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanhuma</i>, Balak, 14.</i>
“<i>There is no augury in Jacob</i>” [23:23]. Balaam said: Israel are worthy to be blessed. They do not follow any magic and they learn everything without magic, since their God informs them of everything through the <i>Urim ve-Tumim.</i> The Holy One Himself is their Lord and protector in heaven. All the nations have angels in heaven who protect them when someone wants to do magic against them. Thus, one must begin with their angel. However, the Holy One Himself is the Lord of Israel, His people. Therefore, no magic helps; God knows everything that will happen. However, the angels do not know everything. Balaam saw Israel sitting before the Holy One, like a student sits before his teacher and studies with him, and the angels do not attain this. The angels ask Israel: what did God study with you?<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanhuma</i>, Balak, 14.</i>
They said: “<i>lo, a people</i>” [23:24]. Balaam said: the Israelites wake up in the morning, don <i>phylacteries</i> and <i>talit</i>, <i>read the Shema</i> and praise God. At night when they lie down to sleep, he again <i>recites the Shema.</i> Thus, all the <i>demons</i> will fly away from them, so how can we do anything with magic? Balaam prophesied about himself about how he would be killed with the sword. Balak sought a place where he could have them cursed. He saw in the stars in heaven that Israel will do transgressions with <i>Peor</i>, and many will be killed. He led Balaam to the city of Peor to curse Israel.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 23:24.</i> Balaam said: I hear the words of God and I see the brightness of God descending and he fell. When the Shekhinah appeared to him, he had to fall down. He could not stand because he did not keep the commandment of <i>circumcision</i> and he was not circumcised.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 24:4.</i> He began to bless Israel. He said: how modest does Israel keep their tents. The door of one tent is not opposite the door of his friend’s tent, so that one could not see what he friend was doing in is tent and would not come to envy his friend or cast an evil eye.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Baba Bathra</i>, 60a.</i> He also said: what a beautiful Tabernacle do they have to bring their sacrifices. They have <i>houses of study</i>, to study Torah. They have pious kings and their kings are very strong. <i>Rabbi Abba son of Kahana</i> said: all of Balaam’s blessings were changed into curses, except for the blessings of the schools and <i>study houses</i>, which have remained to the present; Israel have schools and study houses to study Torah.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Sanhedrin</i>, 105b.</i> Balaam said: the one who blesses Israel is blessed; the one who curses you should be cursed. When Isaac blessed, he said: the one who curses you should be cursed. Afterwards, he said: the one who blesses you should be blessed. The righteous first have troubles in this world, but afterwards they have much good in the next world.
“<i>Their boughs drip with moisture</i>” [24:7]. The Torah drips; it is compared to water of the poor people. Therefore, one should be warned about the poor people, since from them come the scholars of the Talmud. Why do the rabbis not have many children who also study Torah as well as the father? In the expectation that they should not say that the Torah is an inheritance that one inherits from one’s father. <i>Rabbi Shisha</i> said: expecting that he should not take over the community, to rule over it. <i>Ravina</i> said in the name of <i>Rabbi Ashi: Rabbi Shisha</i> calls the people donkeys and <i>ignoramuses</i>, because they do not recite a blessing when he begins to teach.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Nedarim</i>, 81a.</i>
“<i>Israel was staying at Shittim</i>” [25:1]. There was much water and many rivers in the world that led people to good and to evil. Some waters make people very ugly and some waters make the people very handsome. Some waters make the people very strong and some waters make the people very weak. The river that is called <i>Shittim</i> causes all the people to engage in illicit sexual relations. This river is the one that flowed near Sodom. However, in the end, when the Messiah will come, the Holy One will make this river, Shittim, dry. Therefore, when Israel also came to Shittim, they engaged in illicit sex.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Numbers, 25:1.</i>
Balaam advised Balak about how to cause Israel to fall. He should build beautiful houses in which they would sell food and drink and linen that Israel would gladly purchase. Put only lovely young female prostitutes in these houses. Let an old woman stand in front of the door, and the young women should remain in the house. Let them serve wine and good bread with it and have whatever they will need nearby. Israel will come into these nice houses to drink and eat, and again go out into the market, among the houses where beautiful clothes and linen were for sale. The old woman would say: do you want to buy? I will sell you a beautiful garment for a gulden that is worth two gulden. Afterwards, he comes again to the house. The young woman asks him to give her a half gulden for such a garment, or even less. Finally, he sees that she presents herself in a very erotic manner. She says to him: eat and drink good wine with me. At that time, drinking wine poured out to foreign gods was not yet forbidden. As soon as he drank and became drunk, he said to her, sleep with me. She responded: will you come with me to a foreign god called Peor, that I have at home, since they made copies of the foreign god Peor, and kept them at home. Thus, he would kiss Peor and would think that kissing is nothing, and would sleep with her. They adorned themselves with beautiful clothes and jewelry and went toward the Israelites. They said: why do you hate us? We are all descended from Terah, who was the father of <i>Abraham Our Father, of blessed memory.</i> Come and slaughter chickens and geese; we won’t do it for you. Some sages say that Balaam did not tell them to get the Israelites drunk, so that the Israelites should not be able to say before God: we were drunk when we engaged in illicit sex. This is what Balaam thought. Balaam said: the God of Israel hates illicit sex and worship of foreign gods and when they engage in illicit sex, worship foreign gods, and afterwards will also <i>shed blood.</i> It is customary that people fight each other because of whores and one kills the other one because of the whore. Later, Balaam saw that the chieftain was killed with the whore. Balaam said: I have succeeded. Israel have committed the three transgressions of illicit sex, worship of foreign gods and shedding blood, just like at the Flood. Perhaps God will kill them, like at the Flood. Balaam advised them: if one of them will want to sleep with you, let the Israelite first slaughter a chicken or a goose to the foreign god which is called Peor. Then, the Israelite would not want to bow to Peor. The gentile woman would say to the Israelite: don’t do anymore than sit down with your back to the foreign god of Peor; then I will sleep with you. They worshiped Peor by having bowel movements before him. If someone had <i>diarrhea</i>, he did something important for the idol.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Numbers Rabbah</i>, 20.23; <i>Tanhuma</i>, Balak, 17–18.</i>
An incident occurred. There was a Jew who rented a donkey to a gentile woman. When he came with her to the house of Peor, the gentile woman went in and did her worship. When she came out, the Jew said: wait, I will also do my worship before Peor. She said: but you are a Jew? He said: what do you care. He went in and showed his <i>posterior</i> to the nose of Peor. The priests said: you have done your worship better than anyone in the world. Another incident happened. A minister came from a distant land to do his worship before Peor. He had brought good oxen and cattle. They said: we do not allow any oxen or cattle to be sacrificed, but uncover your posterior to Peor. The <i>minister</i> was <i>angry</i> and had them killed and wounded. He said: woe to you and your gods. At the same time, the Holy One was angry at Israel and said: see what the gentile did to Peor. The Israelites who worshiped Peor by uncovering; at first the Israelites went secretly to the whores. Afterwards, they became accustomed and went openly with their friends.
“<i>Just then one of the Israelites came</i>” [25:6]. The Holy One commanded that they should hang those who had worshiped the foreign god of Peor. Israel said: we do not know who worshiped. The Holy One said: the cloud that is over all of Israel will be removed from their heads and the sun will shine on their heads. Thus, they will know that he had worshiped Peor and he should be hanged. The tribe of Simeon immediately gathered and came to their chieftain, who was called Zimri, and said: they want to kill us all and you remain silent. He assembled twenty-four thousand men from his tribe and came to the daughter of the king of Midian, whose name was <i>Cosbi.</i> The chieftain said: sleep with me. She responded: I do not want to, but I will sleep with Moses, your lord. So has my father commanded me. The chieftain responded; I am better than Moses. I am from Simeon, the second son of Jacob, and Moses is from Levi, the third son of Jacob. Immediately, he grabbed the gentile woman by her hair and led her to Moses and asked him: may I take her? Moses said: you should not take her. He said to Moses: how did you take a wife from <i>Midian</i>, <i>Jethro</i>’<i>s</i> daughter? He took her and slept with her publicly, in front of all of Israel. Israel cried that Moses did not do anything to him, and did not know the law that he was guilty of the death penalty. Why did Moses forget the law? He expected that Phinehas should come and announce the law and should receive a reward for this. Phinehas remembered the law that he was guilty of the death penalty. He took a spear and placed the iron tip downward so that people should not notice that it is a spear and he hid the iron tip in his bosom. He came to the tent where Zimri was lying with Cosbi. He leaned on the spear so that people should think that it was a staff, since he was afraid of the people of the tribe of Simeon. There were twenty-four thousand men surrounding the tent where he lay with the whore. They asked him: what do want? He responded: I want to come in to Cosbi, since where do we find that the tribe of Levi is better than the <i>tribe of Simeon?</i> They immediately opened the door and allowed him in. He saw them lying together and he prepared his spear. He struck them both, each in their sexual organs. Twelve miracles occurred. The first miracle was that it is customary that one sees people coming, that the two separate from each other. However, the <i>angel</i> held them together. They could not separate. The second miracle was that they did not shout. The angel stopped up their mouths. The third miracle was that the spear went straight into the sexual organs of the woman and also the sexual organs of the <i>chieftain</i> at one time, so that all the people saw that they were still lying together. <i>Phinehas</i> came into the tent, and they should not say that <i>Phinehas</i> also slept with her. The fourth miracle was that the iron tip of the spear became so long that it went through both bodies. The fifth miracle was that God gave Phinehas the strength to be able to pick them both up with the spear. The sixth miracle was that the wood of the spear did not break. The seventh miracle was that they did not slide off the spear. The eighth miracle was that the angel came and turned them around, so that they lay just like a man lies with his wife, so that they could see their shame. The ninth miracle was that the blood did not drip from them. If it had dripped on <i>Phinehas the priest</i>, he would have become ritually <i>impure.</i> The tenth miracle was that the Holy One allowed them to live on the spear, so that they should not make Phinehas the priest ritually impure. The priest is not supposed to touch a corpse. The eleventh miracle was that the angel lifted up the door very high, so that Phinehas could take them both out with the spear on his shoulder, expecting that all the people should see what happened to them. The twelfth miracle was that when he came out the <i>tribe of Simeon</i> wanted to kill him. The angel came and caused a death to befall them that is called a plague. When Phinehas saw how they quickly died, he threw both of them down and prayed for them and the deaths stopped. Therefore, he was worthy that one has to give the priest the <i>shank</i> of the sacrifice. This is the hand of the ox or cattle, because Phinehas carried the spear with two people in his hand. One also has to give the priest the cheeks, because he prayed; he prayed with his cheeks, that is the mouth. Then they also had to give the stomach from the sacrifices, because he pierced them with the spear in the abdomen. He was also worthy in this world to eat of the sacrifices and in the next world, he was worthy that he lived forever. He lived for four hundred years and afterwards, an angel came and took him alive to heaven. He was worthy that <i>eighteen high priests and prophets</i> during the first Temple and eighteen priests in the second Temple were descended from him. These priests did not live long because they sold the meat that they had been given from the sacrifices. They were supposed to take the money, and give it as charity to poor priests. Twenty-four thousand Israelites died in one hour, even though at the Golden Calf only three thousand died. The <i>sin of illicit sex</i> is greater before the Holy One than <i>worship of foreign gods</i>, particularly when here there was also worship of foreign gods. They had worshiped the <i>foreign god of Peor.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanhuma</i>, Balak, 20 –21.</i>

“<i>Phinehas, son of Eleazar son of Aaron the priest</i>” [25:11]. Because twenty-four thousand men died in the plague, Israel said, the plague was not greater, no more than the twenty-four thousand should die. Therefore, the verse says here, I have not destroyed many Israelites for the sake of <i>Phinehas.</i> Had he not been there, many more <i>Israelites</i> would have had to die, <i>heaven forbid.</i> Therefore, the verse says, son of <i>Eleazar the priest</i>, because it wants to show that even though he was a priest and a <i>scholar</i> who studied Torah day and night, and was not accustomed to using a sword or spear all of his life, yet he relied on God who can help. Therefore, the verse notes and says that he is a priest. His father was also a priest and his grandfather was also a priest, <i>Aaron the priest.</i> He was descended only from priests who do not know how one should take a sword or a spear in their hand. Yet, for the sake of the honor of the Holy One, he took a spear in his hand.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Numbers, 25:11–12.</i>
The tribes also denigrated him that he had killed an important chieftain. Therefore, the Holy One mentioned his great pedigree and said that he is important and descended from only important priests.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 25:11.</i>
“<i>My pact of friendship</i>” [25:12]. Since Israel saw how some people had worshiped foreign gods at <i>Peor</i> and engaged in illicit sex with the daughters of Midian, and third, Phinehas spilled blood with regard to the chieftain, all of Israel was frightened. They thought that they had transgressed all three sins that had occurred at the Flood. Therefore, it says here, do not be frightened. It is as if Phinehas had brought a sacrifice when he killed the chieftain. The blood atoned for Peor and for the illicit sex. Therefore, I am giving Phinehas peace because he had made peace for Israel. It is customary that when someone commits a murder, he cannot rest; the blood does not let him rest. However, Phinehas was at peace because he did not commit a murder, but he had brought a sacrifice. Simeon and Levi always stood together with regard to <i>Dinah in Shechem</i> and regarding <i>Joseph the Righteous.</i> Now, Phinehas came from the tribe of Levi and killed a chieftain of the tribe of Simeon. The people thought that they would continue to be enemies. Therefore, the verse says, I have given Phineas peace. Because he protected Israel from death and they lived longer, therefore the Holy One gave him a long life.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Numbers, 25:11–12.</i>
Our sages say that <i>Phinehas is Elijah the prophet.</i> He also killed false prophets for the sake of God in the days of <i>Ahab.</i> He relied on the Holy One and always risked his neck.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Pirke de Rabbi Eliezer</i>, chap. 46.</i>
“<i>Thus making expiation for the Israelites</i>” [25:13]. He atoned for Israel. From here we learn that the one who kills evildoers, it is as if he brought a sacrifice.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Numbers, 25:13.</i>
“<i>The name of the Israelite</i>” [25:14]. The Holy One said how his ancestor, Simeon, killed the city of Shechem because of illicit sex. Now, his descendant, <i>Zimri</i>, was engaged in major illicit sex. Therefore, the verse alludes to and mentions his ancestor, Simeon.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Numbers, 25:14.</i>
“<i>Assail the Midianites</i>” [25:17]. <i>Rabbi Simeon</i> said: it is worse when a person makes his friend sin than if he killed him. This way he only leaves this world, but he still has the <i>world to come</i> in any event. When he makes him sin, he loses both <i>worlds.</i> We find that the <i>Egyptians</i> pursued Israel with their swords to kill them. They did not want to let them leave their land. Though the Holy One forbade Israel that they should kill the two nations, <i>Egypt and Edom</i>, or cause them to suffer, but the Holy One did order that Ammonites and Moabites should never be accepted by Israelites to marry them. This is because the Moabites caused Israel to sin with illicit sex.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanhuma</i>, Phinehas, 3.</i>
“<i>By the trickery</i>” [25:18]. Balaam was a great deceiver. He thought that if they would send a foreign god to Israel to worship, they would certainly not do it. However, Balaam said: we will send them a foreign god that is a mockery and a joke. This is Peor, to whom one shows their rear end. Israel will think that this is no sin because it is a mockery. Our sages said that one is allowed to mock an idol. However, one should not mock other people, but one is allowed to mock the foreign god itself. Therefore, Israel worshiped Peor. They thought to themselves. Since we have only eaten <i>manna</i> and we have no excrement, the <i>manna</i> will harm our bodies. We will become swollen from this. It was customary with Peor that whoever uncovered their rear end before Peor, they got <i>diarrhea.</i> The Israelites thought: we will have a good remedy with this Peor. Therefore, God commanded that they should injure and harm the <i>Midianites</i>, because they caused Israel to sin.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Numbers, 25:18.</i>
Phinehas merited that no circumcision be performed without placing a special chair for him in the synagogue where the child would be circumcised, because he risked his neck for the sake of the Holy One. The Holy One repays <i>measure for measure</i>, because <i>Phinehas</i> is <i>Elijah</i>, who concealed Israelites because of their circumcision. When someone sleeps with a gentile woman, his foreskin grows as if he was never circumcised. <i>Abraham Our Father</i> sits at the gate of the <i>Garden of Eden</i> and whoever slept with a gentile woman, he is not allowed in. <i>Phinehas</i>, who is Elijah, caused that Israelites should not engage in illicit sex with gentile women. Therefore, Elijah comes to every <i>circumcision.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">The source of this idea is <i>Reshit Hokhmah</i>, <i>Sha</i>’<i>ar ha-Yirah</i>, 8.3. My thanks to Dr. Noga Rubin for bringing this source to my attention.</i>
Balaam also knew that the circumcision disappears from illicit sex with a gentile woman. Therefore, he said: “<i>who can count the dust of Jacob</i>” [23:10]. He saw that Israel would fulfill the circumcision. Therefore, he commanded that they should take away the circumcision from them through illicit sex. It was just that the Holy One should have allowed the nation of <i>Moab</i> to be killed because they gave their daughters to prostitution. However, the Holy One saw that <i>Ruth</i> and <i>Naomi</i> would come from them, so that the royal family of Israel would be established from them. Therefore, the Moabite men should never be allowed to marry <i>Israelite women</i>, but an Israelite man can marry a Moabite woman.
“<i>To Reuben, the families of the Reubenites.</i>”<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">This phrase is not found in the Bible, but is based on <i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Phinehas, <i>Remez</i>, 773.</i> The Holy One informs us in His Torah that Israel were modest regarding sexual matters, since the gentiles said: why do the Israelites make themselves so important? The Egyptians engaged in illicit sexual relations with their wives. Therefore, the Torah gives each Israelite <i>family</i> their <i>pedigree</i> separately, each with the name of his father. The Holy One wrote His name near theirs, so that His name should be testimony that they were pure. He wrote a <i>heh</i> before the name of each one and a <i>yud</i> at the end of each name. These two <i>letters</i> give testimony that they were pure.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 26:5.</i> <i>Rabbi Phinehas</i> said in the name of <i>Rabbi Hiyya:</i> Israel was redeemed from Egypt because they protected themselves from illicit sex.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Pesikta de-Rav Kahana</i>, 11.6.</i>
“<i>When they agitated against the Lord</i>” [26:9]. In their quarrel with God. <i>Rav Hisda</i> said: whoever quarrels with a rabbi, it is like he was quarreling with God himself. Thus, when Korah argued with <i>Moses Our Teacher</i>, the Torah writes that he quarreled with God. Thus, God opened the earth and swallowed up Korah and his household.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">B. Sanhedrin, 110a.</i>
“<i>They became an example</i>” [26:10]. They became a sign that nobody should quarrel with their teacher, and even more so with God. The Holy One made a tall mountain in Gehenna and He placed the children of Korah on it, and they sang <i>praises</i> and did not die. Even though the children of Korah began to quarrel with Moses, but they regretted it and repented. Thus, God made them a tall mountain and they stood on it, so that they should not fall into Gehenna.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 26:11.</i>
Some say the place on which the children stood did not collapse, but it all collapsed around them. They could not descend from the mountain.

“<i>By lot</i>” [26:56]. The land was divided by casting lots, and a miracle happened at the casting of the <i>lots. Eleazar</i> donned the <i>Urim ve-Tumim</i> and they wrote land of Israel on twelve pieces and twelve letters. They also wrote the names of the twelve <i>tribes</i> of Israel on twelve letters. The letters were mixed up in a <i>vessel.</i> The chieftain of each tribe came and pulled out two letters. On one of theme was written his <i>tribe</i> and on the other was written the part of the <i>land of Israel</i> that he should take as his <i>inherited portion.</i> A voice went forth. I, the <i>lot</i>, have come to this <i>tribe.</i> A similar voice was heard for each chieftain, so that Israel should not suspect that Eliezer was giving the good land to whom he wanted, since not all the land in Israel was equal. Some of the land was very good.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 26:54.</i>
“<i>Caleb son of Jephunneh and Joshua son of Nun</i>” [26:65]. Even though Joshua was much more important than <i>Caleb</i>, the verse writes Caleb first, before Joshua. This is because Caleb stood up first by the spies, when they spoke evil against God and against the land. Caleb made them be silent for the honor of the Holy One. Therefore, the Holy One honored him and wrote him first in the Torah; since the Holy One repays each person, <i>measure for measure.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Numbers, 26:65.</i>
“<i>The daughters of Zelophehad came forward</i>” [27:1]. The daughters of Zelophehad came before Moses. The women of Israel were always more pious than the men, as we find at the Golden Calf. The women did not want to give their silver or gold rings for the Golden Calf. At the incident of the spies, the women did not agree with them. Therefore, all the men died in the wilderness and did not come into the land of Israel, as the verse says here.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanhuma</i>, Phinehas, 7.</i>
“<i>Among those there was not a man</i>” [26:64]. This means that no man was alive who went out of Egypt, but the women lived and could come into the land of Israel and inherit the land. Therefore, the verse wrote about the daughters of Zelophehad at the <i>lottery</i> for the land of Israel. The daughters of Zelophehad said: our father died in the wilderness. He left no sons, but only daughters. Therefore, let us also inherit in the land of Israel. We should also have a share like our father would have had. Why should the name of our father be diminished in his family? The daughters of Zelophehad were very righteous women. They only wanted to marry a man who was important and had a distinguished pedigree. The youngest one did not marry for forty years. They wanted good <i>matches</i>, even though <i>Rav Hisda</i> said: a woman that a man marries when she is already forty years old, she can no longer have children. How did the daughters of <i>Zelophehad</i> wait so long and did not marry? The Holy One made a miracle for them and they had children, even when they were one hundred years old, like <i>Yocheved</i> who had children at the age of one hundred and thirty years. Therefore, the daughters of <i>Zelophehad</i> came to Moses after forty years, since the Holy One had said that Moses should not hold himself haughty, and should say, how important am I that I have not slept with my wife for forty years, and I contained myself. Therefore, the Holy One said to Moses. Do not consider yourself important and see the daughters of <i>Zelophehad</i> who waited forty years and more, and did not want to marry men, except for good men. They said: our father did not die because of <i>Korah</i>’<i>s advice.</i> They thought that Moses would help them because their father did not argue with Korah against Moses. Nonetheless, we will not receive a share in the land of Israel because our father was not against Moses. Therefore, Moses removed himself from <i>judgment</i> and placed it before the Holy One. He thought to himself. The people will suspect me, because they said good things and said that their father was not my enemy. Therefore, I am helping them and give them a share in the land of Israel. Therefore, Moses said: let the <i>judgment</i> come before the Holy One. Some say that Moses Our Teacher did not know the law. He had sinned in that he held himself haughty and said that all the difficult judgments should come before me, and the easier judgments should come before other Israelite <i>judges.</i> Therefore, the Holy One punished him, and he did not know the law. In particular, such an easy law that each nation knows that when there is no son to <i>inherit</i>, the daughter <i>inherits.</i> The sages say further that Moses could easily have written the law by himself in the Torah, just like other <i>laws</i>, but the daughters were worthy that the law should be written in the Torah through them. Since women brought death into the world, therefore they also caused that when the father dies, the son inherits. However, if there had not been death, then there would not have been any inheritance. Therefore, the law of inheritance was written in the Torah in regard to women. The Holy One said: the daughters of <i>Zelophehad</i> speak correctly, and what is just. Therefore, give the share that their father was supposed to receive to the daughters. Give the father’s share with their uncles.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Phinehas, <i>Remez</i>, 773–774.</i>
“<i>Ascend the heights of Abarim</i>” [27:12]. The Holy One said to Moses. You are supposed to die, ascend mount <i>Abarim.</i> That is why the Holy One told Moses to divide the land for the daughters of <i>Zelophehad.</i> Moses thought that he would certainly come into the <i>land of Israel.</i> Therefore, the Holy One told Moses: ascend the mountain and you will die, since you, Moses, were mistaken.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 27:12.</i>
“<i>Just as your brother Aaron was gathered</i>” [27:13]. From here we learn that Moses desired to die like Aaron died, with a kiss from the Holy One.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 27:13.</i>
“<i>You disobeyed My command</i>” [27:14]. The Holy One informs us what kind of sin Moses committed that he had to die, so that people should not say that he died because of great sins, like other Israelites who died in the wilderness. It is a parable. Two women were punished with <i>lashes.</i> One ate figs from the <i>sabbatical year.</i> The second one was whipped because she engaged in <i>illicit sex.</i> The woman who was whipped because of the figs said: let them write why I was whipped, so that people should not think that I engaged in illicit sex. Therefore, the Holy One always lets us know when the righteous die, for what sin they died. From here we learn that the Holy One is always <i>merciful</i> toward the righteous. Even when it is just to be angry with them, nonetheless He informs us that they did not commit any great sins. How much more so, when He is not angry with them, then the Holy One is even more <i>merciful</i> to the righteous.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 27:13.</i>
“<i>Moses spoke to the Lord</i>” [27:15]. Rabbi Judah said: There are one hundred and seventy-five sections in the Torah where the name of the Holy One is mentioned before Moses. Here, Moses was mentioned first, before the Holy One. Therefore, the Holy One said: Moses was a king over Israel. Therefore, My name was written first. However, now Moses is dying. It is just that his name should be placed first.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">I was not able to find a source for this.</i>
“<i>Let the Lord, source of all breath of all flesh appoint</i>” [27:16]. Moses said to God that he should choose a <i>leader</i> over Israel, who would lead them after his death. When Moses heard the Holy One order that the <i>daughters of Zelophehad</i> be given their <i>inheritance</i>, Moses thought to himself, I must also order that the <i>inheritance</i> of <i>leadership</i> be given to my children. My children should lead Israel as I led them. It is just that the children should inherit from their father. The Holy One responded: My opinion is not so, but <i>Joshua</i> who spent time in the <i>study house</i> and always served you honestly, he must <i>inherit your leadership</i> and should lead Israel into the land. Moses said to the Holy One: place one who will go in front in the war and not like a king of the nations who sits at home and sends his people to war, as I did with the <i>kings of Sihon and Og.</i> He should also merit to protect Israel with his merit. Do not do to him as You have done to me. He should not die in the middle, but he should be worthy to lead Israel into the land.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 27:16–17.</i>
“<i>Single out Joshua</i>” [27:18]. The Holy One said: take Joshua, with kind words, that he has merited to be a <i>leader</i> over Israel. You should place your hands on him, so that Israel should see that he is your replacement. Let him also <i>preach</i> once during your lifetime before all of Israel, so that Israel should not say that Joshua did not have any power to raise his hands during the lifetime of Moses. Give him also from your beauty; your face shines like a light. His face should also shine in the same way. The face of Moses Our Teacher shone like the sun. One could not look into it. The face of Joshua shone like the <i>moon.</i> Take Joshua and place him before <i>Eleazar the priest</i> and let him ask through the <i>Urim veTumim.</i> Thus he will learn what should happen. The Holy One said to Moses. You desired that your son should inherit and be a leader. Now, Eleazar is a member of your family and he also has leadership. Joshua should not do anything without Eleazar. Therefore, it is as if your own son was a leader, since Eleazar is of your family. Moses placed his two hands on Joshua and <i>ordained</i> him. Even though the Holy One told him to place one hand on Joshua, yet Moses was a pious man and placed two hands on his head, and blessed him with two hands and with his whole heart.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 27:18–23.</i>
“<i>The Lord spoke to Moses.</i> … <i>My offerings</i>” [28:1–2]. The Holy One said to Moses: you desire from Me that I should give the children of Israel a leader. Why do you also not tell the children of Israel that they should properly serve Me with sacrifices? A parable. A king’s wife is dying. She asks the king that he should take care of the children. The king responds: tell your children that they should obey me and not do anything against me. The Holy One ordered that a sheep be brought as a sacrifice, along with a tenth measure of fine flour and a quarter quart of wine; one in the morning and another in the evening. The primary food is meat, flour and wine. The Holy One said: bring the sacrifice for Me, expecting that the person should always say that the food is from God. He always gives us enough. Therefore, one was brought when the moon was supposed to rise, that is when it is rising, expecting that the person should say that the food is truly from the Holy One. He guides the sun and the moon. They cause the food to be brought into the world. There are fruits that grow at night, because of the moon, like grain, wheat and wine. <i>Ada son of Rabbi Simon</i> said. The Holy One said: I have given ten clean animals. An ox, a lamb, a goat, a hind, a deer, an ibex, a bison, a wild ox, and a chamois, should all be kosher for a sacrifice. Nonetheless, the Holy One told us to take only those animals that are in the hands of man [domesticated], like the ox, sheep, or goat, for a sacrifice, expecting that the person should not have great exertions seeking animals in the forests or fields to bring a sacrifice.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Phinehas, <i>Remez</i>, 777.</i>
“<i>On the Sabbath day: two yearling lambs</i>” [28:9]. Two sheep were brought on the Sabbath, since everything was doubled on the Sabbath. The <i>manna</i> was two measures for each person.

“<i>A sin offering to the Lord</i>” [28:15]. Concerning the <i>first day of the month</i>, the Torah wrote, a <i>sin offering</i> to God, more than concerning all sacrifices. The Holy One created the sun and the moon along with their light, but the moon has its light from the sun. The moon is dark by itself, but shines from the sun. The moon said before the Holy One: <i>Lord of the Universe</i>, do you not have any power that I should be able to shine on my own, and not from the sun? I am as useful in the world as the sun. The moon said before the Holy One. The nations of the world will say, heaven forbid, that You have no power to create each light separately. The Holy One immediately became angry at the moon and said: do you want to teach Me what to do? Therefore, your light should be diminished, because you spoke against Me. Even the light that you had before, from the sun, will also be diminished. The moon said: <i>Lord of the Universe.</i> My light should be diminished, because I spoke properly? The Holy One responded: I created this that your light should be from the sun. I know very well why I did this, but because you have spoken properly, My children should bring a sacrifice every first day of the month, when the moon appears and is renewed. The sun was for illumination during the day and the moon illumined at night, like the sun during the day. People did not know the difference between day and night. The Holy One said: they must have time to rest from their work, or their business, that they engaged in all day. If it had been as light at night as during the day, the person would have worked day and night, and would have quickly died of overwork. The Holy One further said: the night was given for the study of Torah. It is quiet and whoever wants to study Torah has rest. The Holy One also showed the people that when one does penance, the Holy One is gracious, just as we find concerning the moon. He ordered the bringing of a sacrifice, because it was diminished. The sacrifice should be brought on the first day of the month when the moon appears. The Holy One said: bring a sacrifice for My sake because I have done wrong against the moon. Therefore, it is written, <i>a sacrifice for God</i>, a sacrifice to God, for God’s sake. Because the nations brought sacrifices to the moon, which renews itself every month, therefore the Holy One wrote, bring to God and not to the moon.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Numbers, 28:15.</i>
“<i>On the eighth day you shall hold a solemn gathering</i>” [29:35]. The eighth day of <i>Sukkot</i> is called <i>Azeret.</i> This means, to cease. God said to Israel: for seven days of <i>Sukkot</i> you have brought sacrifices for the nations, and now I rejoice with you. Bring one sacrifice and <i>celebrate</i> for one day. The sacrifices of the seven days of <i>Sukkot</i> were lessened each succeeding day. On the first day, they brought thirteen rams. On the next day, twelve, the third day, eleven rams, and so until the seventh day when they only brought seven rams. This teaches us <i>proper behavior.</i> When one has a guest, he is given stuffed capons. The second day he is given fish to eat. The third day he is given beef to eat. The fourth day he is given beans, and beyond this he is given cabbage, just like the sacrifices of <i>Sukkot.</i> The section on sacrifices ends with “<i>offerings of well-being</i>” [29:39]. This means, your peace offerings. The world stands on peace and therefore we end the <i>Amidah</i> prayer with, <i>may He bless His people with peace.</i> He should bless His people with peace, because this prayer is in place of sacrifices, and prayer is better than the sacrifices.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 29:35.</i>

Matot

In this portion, the Holy One teaches about the oaths that a person swears. The one who does not keep his oaths commits the greatest sin among all the sins. When a person is always angry, he always comes to swearing. Afterwards, he has regret. Therefore, the Holy One said here, when someone makes a vow and he has regret, he should go before three people and say, I have regret. The three people should then <i>absolve him of his vow.</i> The Torah wrote, “<i>heads of the Israelite tribes</i>” [30:2], near the vows and donations that Israelites brought on the <i>festivals.</i> He wants to teach us that the leaders that are in each generation have the power to force the people to give charity and give donations, when they so desire. Our sages explicitly wrote, “<i>an injunction to the courts that they should do.</i>”<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Rosh Hashanah</i>, 6a.</i> This means that the court has the power to force someone to make a donation. If a woman makes a vow and she is still within her father’s authority, and he forbids the vow, then she should not keep the vow, because her father forbade it. When she has a husband and the husband forbids it, then she also should not keep it. When a woman makes a vow not to eat fruit or that she will fast, or that she will not adorn herself with beautiful clothes, or she will not go to the bathhouse, or she says, I will not sleep with you, her husband absolves her of these vows and can forbid her. She must put aside all the vows if her husband so wishes. To take an oath is a great sin even if he wants to keep the oath, as we find with <i>Yannai the King.</i> He owned a thousand cities and they were all destroyed because of a <i>true oath.</i> A person said to his friend: I will go to the city and he swore on it. He went and fulfilled his oath. Why were all the cities destroyed, because they always mentioned the name of God needlessly?<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Numbers Rabbah</i>, 22.1.</i> From here we learn that even though they kept their oaths, yet they were punished. How much more so, when someone swears falsely. However, when the person makes a vow because he is afraid that the evil inclination will dissuade him, then he may swear to keep it, expecting that he wants to overcome the evil inclination. If the person is a glutton and a drunkard and he makes a <i>vow</i> that he will not eat meat or drink any wine, he is a good man. The Torah told us to make such vows, as the verse says, “<i>I have firmly sworn to keep Your just rules</i>” [Psalms, 119:106]. This means, David said: I have sworn to keep the commandments and Torah.
“<i>Avenge</i>” [31:2]. The Holy One said to Moses. Take revenge on the Midianites and then you will die. The Holy One said: I keep My oath that I swore that Moses should not come into the land of Israel. Therefore, take revenge on the Midianites first. The Holy One said: when a person swears and he has regret, he is absolved, but I have no regret and you, Moses, must die. Therefore, the Holy One wrote about the <i>vows and oaths</i> of people and afterwards, God said to Moses: you must die. Nobody can <i>absolve the vow</i>, since I have no regret.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Numbers, 31:2.</i>
“<i>The Lord</i>’<i>s vengeance</i>” [31:3]. Moses said to the Holy One: Lord of the Universe, if we had been uncircumcised or we would have worshiped foreign gods, the nations would not hate us, but they hate us because of the Torah. Therefore, this is a vengeance from God, since they are all against God. God said that they should kill the Midianites and did not order the Moabites be killed, since King David would be descended from Ruth the Moabite. Even though Moses Our Teacher heard that he must first kill the Midianites and then he must die, Moses should have waited and not killed the Midianites so fast, yet Moses did this. He wanted to do what God had told him without delay. Joshua was supposed to kill the gentile kings of the nations in the land of Israel. He said: I know well that when I will kill the kings, I will soon die, like Moses did with Midian and he soon died. Therefore, Joshua did not kill the kings immediately, but tarried for a long time before he killed them. He said: I want to live a little longer. The Holy One said: I will shorten your life by ten years. Joshua was supposed to live for one hundred and twenty years, like his <i>teacher, Moses</i>, who also lived for one hundred and twenty years. However, because Joshua tarried, he only lived for one hundred and ten years. The verse says, “<i>many designs are in a man</i>’<i>s mind, but it is the Lord</i>’<i>s plan that is accomplished</i>” [Proverbs, 19:21]. This means, man has many thoughts, but God’s advice is what remains. Israel saw that the death of Moses was related to Midian. Thus, they did not want to wage war against Midian. They said: let Moses live longer among us. God said to Moses: cast lots and whatever they say, they will have to do. Moses sent Phinehas; he did not want to go himself to wage war against Midian. He said: I was raised in Midian, how could I kill them? Moses further said to Phinehas: you have begun to take revenge for the illicit sex that the daughters of Midian engaged in with the <i>chieftain of Simeon.</i> Therefore, you also continue, since when someone begins to fulfill a commandment, he should complete it. Another explanation is, Phinehas went to take revenge on Midian because the Midianites sold <i>Joseph the Righteous</i> to Egypt. Therefore, Phinehas said: the Midianites sold my relative, Joseph, since Phinehas was from Joseph’s tribe in his mother’s side.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Numbers, 31:2–3; Rashi, Numbers, 31:6.</i>
“<i>You shall dispatch</i> … <i>from every one of the tribes of Israel</i>” [31:4]. The verse teaches us that the <i>tribe of Levi</i> also sent one thousand men into the war with the people of Midian. Here one can ask, there were twelve tribes in Israel without the tribe of Levi, and with the tribe of Levi there were thirteen thousand men who went to war. The verse tells us that there were twelve thousand men who fought the Midianites. The explanation is that the <i>tribe of Ephraim</i> did not send a thousand men. They thought to themselves; Israel will say that we gladly went to war so that Moses should die soon and Joshua should become king, since Joshua was from the <i>tribe of Ephraim.</i> Therefore, the <i>tribe of Levi</i> said: we will go instead of Ephraim and fulfill God’s command. Even though Moses is from our tribe and his life depends on the war.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, <i>Matot</i>, <i>Remez</i>, 785.</i>
“<i>Equipped with the sacred vessels</i>” [31:6]. They took the Ark and <i>Ziz</i> with them. This was a silver strip on which was written the <i>Ineffable Name</i> [of God]. Balaam was able to fly in the air with the nobles of Midian, by magical means, expecting that the Israelites would not be able to do anything to them. Therefore, the Israelites took the strip and placed it before Balaam. They fell down on top of the corpses and were immediately killed with the sword because Balaam had boasted that he would curse Israel with his mouth, since Israel has power with its mouth. Thus, Israel said: you Balaam are taking on something that is our thing, since our blessing is “<i>the voice is the voice of Jacob</i>” [Genesis, 27:22]. We have power with the mouth and your blessing is “<i>by the sword shall you live</i>” [Genesis, 27:40]. Because you changed the blessing, we will also change, and kill you with the sword. Balaam came to receive his reward that twenty-four thousand Israelites died because of his advice that he gave that they should engage in illicit sex. Thus, the Israelites gave him his reward and killed him. Moses sent only twelve thousand Israelites to Midian, even though the Midianites were a numerous people and had strong cities and castles. Moses thought that there were many Israelites who committed sins, through illicit sex with the daughters of Midian and Moab. These would not be able to go to war because they had sinned. Therefore, Moses selected only those who were righteous to go to war against Midian. The Israelites were pious and took all the money and goods and brought them to Moses. Moses and Eleazar went toward them and forbade the youths to keep anything from the booty, as is customary among the youths. Moses was angry with the chieftains that they left the women of Moab and Midian alive, since the women caused the Israelites to sin with illicit sex, and recognized several women who sinned through illicit sex with Israelites. They said: this gentile woman slept with that Israelite man and through this brought disgrace to the Israelite. Perhaps he will sleep with her again. That is why Moses was angry with the chieftains and ordered the women to be killed. From here we learn that when the <i>head of a community</i> or a <i>rabbi</i> will not rebuke their community when they do something bad, then the Holy One will be angry with the leader.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Numbers, 31:6–8.</i>
Moses commanded that they should kill all the <i>men</i>, even babies in their cribs, and all the <i>women</i> who had slept with men. However, the females who had not slept with a man should be left alive. How did they know if she was a virgin or not? They led each woman before the <i>ziz</i>, the sliver band on which the <i>Ineffable Name</i> was written. As soon as the woman came before the silver band, the one that was not a virgin, her face became yellow and green, and those were not allowed to live. However, with daughters of Israel, if one wanted to know if she was a virgin or not, she was not taken to the <i>ziz</i>, but other methods were used. They placed her on a barrel of wine and the one that was a virgin, one could not smell the wine on her breath. However, those who had slept with a man, one could smell the wine on her breath. The Israelites could have led the virgins before the strip on which the <i>Ineffable Name</i> was written. However, the strip was not given to Israel for evil, but for the gentiles it was given for evil to them. Therefore, with the Midianites the strip was shown to them and in that way they know which one was a virgin.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Numbers, 31:17.</i>
“<i>Eleazar the priest said</i>” [31:21]. <i>Simon son Lakish</i> said: a person who gets angry, even though is very wise, his wisdom leaves him.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Pesahim</i>, 66b.</i>
We find this here regarding Moses. He became angry at the Israelites when they asked to allow the <i>Midianite women</i> to live. Therefore, Moses sinned and he forgot the law regarding <i>scalding</i>, that is, cleaning and making kosher the vessels that the Israelites took from <i>Midian.</i> Eleazar came and stated the <i>law.</i> Therefore, it is written here, “<i>Eleazar said.</i>” Eleazar said: whoever has silver, gold, copper or lead vessels, should first scrub off the rust. We find two other times where Moses became angry and forgot the law.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 31:21.</i>
When a prophet became angry, prophecy left him. The Shekhinah does not remain with a person who is angry. Our sages said: when somebody breaks a vessel out of anger, it is like he engaged in worshiping foreign gods.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Pesahim</i>, 66b.</i>
One can ask why did the Holy One not tell them to <i>make kosher the vessels of Sihon and Og</i>, as he did with Midian? The explanation is that the <i>war with Sihon and Og</i> was in a part of the land of Israel, since the land of Sihon and Og was apportioned to the children of Gad and Reuben. Since it was a part of the land of Israel, the Israelites were allowed to use their vessels without immersion and making them kosher. Our sages said that even slabs of bacon were permitted to the Israelites, since the Holy One had said to give Israel houses in the <i>land of Canaan</i> full of goods. However, the land of Midian was not part of the <i>land of Israel.</i> Therefore, the vessels were forbidden to be used and had to be made kosher, since they were only told to take revenge and not to take their land.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban, Numbers, 31:23.</i>
“<i>Take an inventory</i>” [31:26]. The Holy One ordered them to count the people, animals, gold and silver, the garments and ordered that everything be divided. The twelve thousand who went to war should take half, and the other half should go to all of Israel. They should also give a <i>tax</i>, one person out of every five hundred. The same from the cattle, the donkeys and the sheep. The twelve thousand men should give this <i>tax</i> out of their share. This <i>tax</i> should be given to <i>Eleazar the priest</i>, just like the <i>terumah.</i> However, from the share that <i>all of Israel</i> had, they should give a different <i>tax.</i> They should take from fifty people, one person, and similarly from cattle, donkeys, and from sheep. The tax should be given to the Levites who guard the Tabernacle.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers, 31:26–30.</i>
“<i>Moses and Eleazar the priest accepted</i>” [31:51]. Moses and Eleazar divided it in this way. One can ask. Why did Moses and Eleazar divide it alone and did not have the chieftains join them? The Holy One had commanded that the chieftains should also be present. However, the explanation is that this is what the Holy One said to Eleazar and Moses: you should not divide it alone, without the chieftains, so that the people should not suspect that Eleazar is taking more than his share. However, the chieftains said: heaven forbid that we should suspect Eleazar. We will not go there, since he is trustworthy.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban, Numbers, 31:31.</i>
“<i>That half share</i>” [31:36]. Half the sheep was three hundred and thirty seven thousand-five hundred. Cattle were thirty-six thousand. There were thirty thousand-five hundred donkeys. There were sixteen thousand people, and this all was one half. The other half was the same amount. Here one asks a question. What is the Torah telling us about how many there were? However, the Torah is telling us a major piece of news, that from the time that they captured the cattle, sheep, donkeys and people, none of them died. Therefore, the Torah tells us how many there were, from the beginning until they were divided up.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban, Numbers, 31:36.</i>
“<i>Not one of us is missing</i>” [31:49]. None of the Israelites was harmed. It was a great miracle. There were so many Midianites that they were countless, like sand in the sea. The Israelites killed many of them and captured many thousands of them, yet not even one Israelite was killed. Twelve thousand men went to war. Only those who were righteous were chosen. Therefore, they said to Moses: perhaps we had thoughts about the daughters of Midian, and had lust for them? It is the custom among the gentiles that when they go to war, they adorn themselves. Therefore, we also committed sins and had lust to engage in illicit sex. This is a greater sin than illicit sex itself. Why? When the person engages with the prostitute and has sex with her, his evil inclination is finished and he does not desire anything else. However, when he has thoughts about a prostitute, he thinks day and night about what he wants to do with her. He sins much more, since he has no rest from the sin. Therefore, the Holy One ordered that when Israel will go to war with the nations of the world, he is allowed to take a gentile woman from the war as a wife, expecting that the evil inclination will leave him alone. However, here with Midian, the Israelites were all very righteous and repented for the thoughts that they had about the daughters of Midian. They brought all the gold jewelry, their earrings and rings, and gave it to Moses so that it should be an offering to God. The golden vessels that they gave were all whole, and they were taken to be used in the Sanctuary. The weight of all the gold was sixteen thousand and seven hundred and fifty shekels.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Numbers, 31:49, 51.</i>
“<i>The Reubenites owned cattle in very great numbers</i>” [32:1]. The children of Reuben and Gad had many flocks and they loved their flocks and money very much. Our sages say that the wealth that comes from God remains with the person for a very long time. However, the wealth that does not come from God has no permanence. Our sages say that the Holy One gave the world three presents, <i>Wisdom, Power, and Wealth.</i> Two wealthy men arose, Korah among the Israelites and Haman among the nations of the world. Their money caused them to be destroyed in this world and in the next world. Two wise men arose, <i>Balaam</i> from the nations of the world, and <i>Ahitophel</i> from Israel. They were both wise, but not in accord with God’s views and they did things against God. They were destroyed in this world and in the world to come. Then there were two powerful men, <i>Samson among Israel</i> and <i>Goliath the Philistine, among the gentiles.</i> They were both destroyed. All three pairs did things against God and stole from the people. The children of <i>Reuben and Gad</i> did the same. They were very rich with money and many flocks. They said to Moses: we will remain outside the land of Israel, since we have many flocks and they wanted to separate themselves from their brothers because of their animals and money. Therefore, they were first exiled to foreign lands and their cities were devastated, since one should not be quick to get money by theft. It has no permanence when the Holy One does not want it, since everything comes from God. The wife of a <i>nobleman</i> asked <i>Rabbi Simeon ben Halafta:</i> in how many days did God create the world? <i>Rabbi Simeon</i> responded: in six days. She then asked: what does the Holy One do from the six days of creation until now? <i>Rabbi Simeon</i> said: He makes ladders and leads some people up and others down, as the verse says, “<i>God is who gives judgment; He brings down one man, He lifts up another</i>” [Psalms, 75:8]. God makes one high and the other one low. He takes the money from one person and gives it to the other person. So did the children of <i>Gad and the children of Reuben.</i> They loved their animals more than their own lives. Therefore, they were punished with exile more than the rest of Israel. Moses was angry with the children of Gad and the children of Reuben. He said to them: you will make Israel liars because they will be afraid to go to the land of Israel, since they will look at you. The children of Gad and Reuben answered: We will build pens for our animals and houses for our wives and children. Then we will also go to the land of Israel to help wage war with the nations of the world. We will always go first at the front against the nations, and we will not go home until we have helped all of Israel obtain their land. The children of Gad and Reuben were the strongest people among the Israelites and they always went in front in the wars. Now we will build strong cities for our wives and children that they should be protected because we will remain outside with Israel. The <i>children of Gad and Reuben</i> had good deeds, and they relied on the commandments of the Holy One who would help them. Moses responded to the children of <i>Gad and Reuben:</i> if you will keep your oath and will help Israel in their land, then we will tell you to remain in the land of <i>Sihon and Og.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanhuma</i>, Matot, 5–7.</i>
“<i>You should be clean before the Lord and Israel</i>” [32:22]. You should be clean before God and Israel. From here we learn that each person should always make themselves clean before God and before people. Our sages said that there was a family called the <i>house of Garmi</i>, who made the <i>showbread</i> in the Temple. They did not want that fine flour bread be made in their houses so that people should not suspect them that they took fine flour from the Temple. Even though they were wealthy people and could afford to eat fine flour bread, they only ate whole wheat bread. There was a family called the <i>house of Abtinas.</i> They made the <i>incense for the Temple.</i> It had the same odor as other <i>incense.</i> They did not want that any bride from their family should be <i>perfumed.</i> Even though it is the custom that every bride is perfumed; in their family no bride was perfumed with incense so that nobody should suspect that they took the perfume from the incense.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Yoma</i>, 38a.</i>
“<i>They built Dibon and Ataroth</i>” [32:34]. They built the cities of <i>Ataroth and Dibon.</i> Our sages say that one should not think that one word in the Torah was written without purpose, heaven forbid, even the names of the cities, <i>Ataroth and Dibon.</i> They said that each Jew is responsible to read the weekly portion every week. What does this mean? First he should read the portion himself. Then he should read the Targum on that portion. The second time he should read it with the cantor in the synagogue. The sages said that one is even responsible to read the Targum of <i>Ataroth and Dibon,</i> when this is found in the portion.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Berakhot</i>, 8a-b.</i>

Masei

“<i>These are the marches</i>” [33:1]. King Solomon said: “<i>the beginning of wisdom is</i> – <i>acquire wisdom</i>” [Proverbs, 4:7]. This means, first buy the wisdom of the Torah before all other wisdoms. The one who has not seen in the Torah all the wise signs and wonders that the Holy One did for Israel in the wilderness; he does not know what the Holy One can do. The person will not believe in any wonders from God, but he would say that the world goes on its way by itself and the Holy One cannot change anything for good or evil. The person would say that the signs in the wilderness are nothing, since the wilderness was like other lands in that grain, wheat and wine grow there. Therefore, the Holy One wrote in this portion, separately and consecutively at one time all the cities where Israel moved in the wilderness and also lets us know and tells what kind of wilderness this was. There were large snakes, as thick as beams, fiery serpents and scorpions. There was also no water. There was some bitter water and God made it sweet. It is impossible for the person to live without water for one day, particularly with a large people, women and children, for forty years where no person could survive for one day. Therefore, the Torah wrote very explicitly each city in the wilderness, so that they should see the signs and wonders that God possesses.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Masaei, Introduction.</i>
Another explanation is that he wrote the cities in the wilderness where the Israelites traveled, so that the people should not say that the Israelites were in the wilderness for forty years like the penitents who do not rest one night where they rested the previous night. Therefore, the Torah tells us where they traveled in the forty years. For nineteen years they stayed in the city of <i>Kadesh</i>, with prosperity and enjoyment. Their primary travel was in the first year of the forty years and in the last year of the forty years. The first year they traveled to fourteen cities, from <i>Ramses</i> to the city of <i>Rimthah.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 33:1.</i>
Moses sent the spies from <i>Rimthah.</i> Why was the city called <i>Rimthah</i>, because Israel spoke evil with the spies against the land of Israel? Rithmah means, burning coals, and the one who speaks slander is compared to a burning coal.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 33:18.</i>
Afterwards, they traveled to five cities after the death of Aaron on <i>Mount Hor</i> until the plains of Moab. This was in the fortieth year. Therefore, the Torah informs us that Israel was like those who have gone astray. They do not know the way and they have no rest, but the Holy One led them with the cloud and the fiery pillar; they illumined by day and night. Our sages gave a parable about a king who took his son to a physician in another, distant, country, to have him healed. When the king and his son returned to their home, the king said to his son. Dear son, do you remember that we rested in this place. We cooled down in this place because of the heat. In this place, your head hurt. So too, the Holy One wrote all the travels that Israel followed in the wilderness, at one time, in one place in the Torah. He showed them the good that He did for them for forty years. In each place he said, in this city you had this good, and in the other city you had that good. Therefore, he wrote the travels because He wanted to show the cities in the wilderness where things went well for Israel with wonders. So too, some Israelites will come into the wilderness in the days of the Messiah. The Holy One will do all the signs, <i>miracles, and wonders</i> as happened at the Exodus from Egypt. He will feed them with good food. He will lead them with light and clouds as He did for Israel in the wilderness, as the verse says, “<i>and I will bring you into the wilderness of the nations</i>” [Ezekiel, 20:35]. And I will bring you into the wilderness of the nations, in the days of the Messiah. Therefore “<i>their starting points</i>” [33:2] is written here twice. He shows us the Exodus from Egypt and the Exodus from the exile. Since the wilderness accepted the Israelites and things went well for Israel in the wilderness, the Holy One will pay the desert a good reward in the days of the Messiah. Beautiful and fragrant trees will grow there, like cloves and roses, beautiful fields and vineyards, and all sorts of good fruits and good oil. Where the people previously lived, these lands will become desolate and the wilderness will become habitable for people. The wilderness is as large as where people now live. From here we learn that the Holy One wants to pay a good reward to the wilderness, because it accepted Israel to dwell in it. How much more so, when a householder takes a scholar and honors him in his house, the Holy One will give him a <i>doubly</i> good reward.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Numbers, 33:2.</i>
Some sages say that the Holy One wrote the names of the cities where God did <i>miracles and wonders</i> for Israel, so that if an Israelite should wander into these cities, he should recite a blessing and should praise God for His wonders and signs. Therefore, each city was listed separately by name, so that they should be known by their names. Therefore, one should be advised that every Israelite should learn the name of the cities in order to know them.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Numbers, 33:2.</i>
“<i>The Egyptians meanwhile were burying those among them whom the Lord had struck down, every first-born</i> – <i>whereby the Lord executed judgment on their gods</i>” [33:4]. The Egyptians buried all the firstborn, since God had killed all the firstborn and God judged all of their idols. Our sages say that the verse was written here, that the Egyptians buried the firstborn, even though it was not relevant here. The Torah shows us here that the idols were destroyed the same night that the firstborn were killed. That night, the Egyptians cried the whole night because of their firstborn and did not see that their idols were destroyed. However, the next morning when they went to bury their firstborn in their houses of worship, as is their custom to bury their dead in their houses of worship. They came and saw that their idols were broken and destroyed. The idol that was silver or gold was melted, and the one that was wood was rotten and the one that was stone, was broken in pieces.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Numbers, 33:4.</i>
“<i>Aaron died there in the fortieth year after the Israelites had left the land of Egypt, on the first day of the fifth month</i>” [33:38]. Aaron died in the fortieth year in the fifth month, that is the <i>month of Ab</i>, on the first day of the month. Our sages say: why did the verse say here on which day he died? When he died should have been written in <i>the portion of Hukat</i>, since the <i>proper death of Aaron</i> was written there. Furthermore, we do not find regarding our ancestors, <i>Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob</i> that the Torah writes on which day they died. However, the Torah does write on which day that Aaron died, on the first day of the <i>month of Ab.</i> The Canaanites thought that the <i>month of</i> Ab was good to wage war against Israel, since they will have it as a month of troubles and exile in the future. In particular, the clouds were removed and Aaron died. The Canaanite thought to himself, I will wage war with Israel. Therefore, it is written in this verse, “<i>he died in the fifth month</i>” [33:38]. This means that Aaron died in the fifth month, which is the <i>month of Ab.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Numbers, 33:38.</i>
“<i>The Canaanite heard</i>” [33:40]. This means, the Canaanite heard that Aaron died in the <i>month of Ab</i> and he came to wage war against Israel.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 33:40.</i>
“<i>They encamped by the Jordan from Beth-jeshimoth as far as Abel-shittim in the plains of Moab</i>” [33:49]. Israel rested by the Jordan from the city of <i>Beth-jeshimoth</i> to <i>Shittim</i>, in the <i>plains of Moab.</i> From here we learn how wide and long [the area] was where Israel rested at one time and in one place. <i>Rabah bar bar Hanah</i> said: I was at that place and I saw that where Israel rested was twelve miles long. The people of Israel was so numerous that they needed a place that was twelve miles wide.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 33:49.</i>
“<i>This is the land that shall fall to you as your portion, the land of Canaan</i>” [34:2]. The land that falls to you with the lots. Our sages said: the verse says that the land that falls to you in the lottery is right for you. A parable. A king who has male and female servants, and he gives the male servants, wives from foreign lands. The king reconsiders and says: I have male and female servants who are from my land. Why should I give my male servants foreign wives? I would rather give my male servants my female servants as wives. So said the Holy One. Israel is called My land, as the verse says, “<i>for the land is Mine</i>” [Leviticus, 25:23], and Israel is My people and My servants, as the verse says, “<i>for it is to Me that the Israelites are servants</i>” [Leviticus, 25:55]. It is better that I should give My land to My servants and to my children.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanhuma</i>, Masaei, 10.</i>
Our sages say that it is written in the verse that the lot that falls means that the Holy One overthrew seven kings who were placed over the seven nations of the land of Israel and bound the kings before Moses and said to Moses: see that they no longer have any power and do not fear the nations, since their kings have been bound.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 34:2.</i>
“<i>These are the names of the men through whom the land shall be apportioned for you</i>” [34:17]. The men will enable you to inherit the land. The Holy One said: you should choose a chieftain from each tribe, who should see how many <i>families</i> there are in his tribe and if the family is large. They should see that it is just to give that tribe more land. However, the chieftain will make it, so should it remain. The verse mentions <i>Eleazar before Joshua</i>, even though Joshua will be in place of Moses, but in any event Joshua must first ask Eleazar what should be done. The verse mentions ten chieftains, even though there were twelve chieftains of tribes. However, the tribes of <i>Reuben and Gad</i> had their share of the land, <i>outside the land of Israel.</i> Therefore, the verse only mentions ten chieftains who should divide the land. One can ask, why does the verse not mention with regard to three tribes that their <i>administrators were chieftains</i> and important people, as he says with regard to the seven tribes, where he calls them chieftains. The verse first mentions, “<i>from the tribe of Judah, Caleb</i>” [34:19]. This means, to the tribe of Judah, the <i>administrator</i> should be the one called Caleb. It does not tell us that he was a chieftain. However, as soon as he comes to the <i>tribe of Dan</i> and the other tribes, it says, “<i>from the tribe of Dan, a chieftain, Buki son of Jogli</i>” [34:21]. This means, for the tribe of Dan, the <i>administrator</i> was a chieftain called, Buki son of Jogli. The verse calls him a chieftain. Also with the other tribes, they are called chieftains. However, the Torah did not write this concerning the tribe of Judah, its administrator is not called important, since the whole world knows that Caleb was pious and important. Therefore, it does not have to say that the <i>administrator of Judah</i> was important. With regard to the <i>tribe of Simeon</i>, it also does not call him a chieftain. The tribe of Simeon was not worthy to have the word, chieftain, written because they engaged in illicit sex with the daughters of Midian, and their evil chieftain was killed. Therefore, the Torah does not write the word, chieftain. Concerning the tribe of Benjamin, it also does not write the word chieftain, because the tribe of Benjamin would commit sins regarding illicit sex with regard to the <i>concubine in Gibeah.</i> Some sages say that chieftain is not written regarding the tribe of Benjamin, because the chieftain was a prophet. Thus, it did not want to call him chieftain. One would have thought that he was like the other chieftains, and the truth was that he was a prophet.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Numbers, 34:17.</i>
“<i>You shall provide yourselves with places to serve you as cities of refuge</i>” [35:11]. You should prepare cities, so that when a person accidentally kills his friend, he should run to this city. No person should harm him there. The custom was that when a killer ran to the city, whether he killed deliberately or accidentally, the <i>court</i> sent for him and examined him. If he did it deliberately, he is put to death. If he did it accidentally, then he is returned to the city and remained there until the <i>high priest</i> died. Then he was allowed to leave and no person could harm him. <i>King David</i> said: “<i>Good and upright is the Lord; therefore He shows sinners the way</i>” [Psalms, 25:8]. God is good and upright and compassionate. Therefore, He shows the sinful person a way to repent. King David said: <i>Lord of the Universe</i>, you are compassionate to the killer, in that you have prepared a city to flee to because he killed accidentally. The compassion is already from the time of Adam, since Adam brought death into the world upon all people. You had compassion on him and expelled him from the Garden of Eden, like a <i>penitent</i> who wanders around, and forgave him his sin. Therefore, You also ordered them to make <i>cities of refuge</i>, to which the killer, who killed accidentally, should flee. Concerning this, the verse says, “<i>O Lord, be mindful of Your compassion and Your faithfulness; they as old as time</i>” [Psalms, 25:6]. This means, Your grace and compassion is from the beginning of time. This is since the time of Adam. He did not willingly kill his friend, his heart was not in it, and he was not guilty of death, since all the sins depend on the heart. When somebody fulfills a commandment and his heart is not in it, in that he does not <i>intend it to be for the sake of heaven</i>, then his act is as nothing. Moses Our Teacher said to the Holy One: <i>Lord of the Universe</i>, when somebody has killed his friend in a different land, how does he know to find the <i>cities of refuge</i>, since he was not in that land? The Holy One responded: place large pillars in the markets and write on them, <i>killer, cities of refuge.</i> Place the pillars in the direction of the cities of refuge, in many places. Thus, the killer would read the inscription and would find the way. Concerning this, the verse said, “<i>good and upright is the Lord</i>” [Psalms, 25:8]. God is good and compassionate to the killer and makes a path for him. How much more so for the righteous, as the verse says, “<i>He guides the lowly in the right path</i>” [Psalms, 25:9].<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanhuma</i>, Masaei, 11.</i>
The Holy One ordered that three cities be made in the land of Reuben and Gad and another three cities in the land of Israel, even though there were nine tribes in the land of Israel, and the land of Reuben and Gad had two and one half tribes. Why did the two and one half tribes have as many cities of refuge as the nine tribes? This is because there were many killers in the land of Reuben and Gad. Therefore, they had to have many cities of refuge. Also, the inhabitants of the land of Reuben and Gad were killers; this was the nature of the land.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 35:14.</i>
The killer had to sit in the city and could not leave. If he left, then the relative of the one killed could kill him. “<i>Until the death of the high priest</i>” [35:25]. The killer sat in the cities of refuge until the death of the one who caused the <i>Shekhinah</i> to rest among Israel. The killer caused the Shekhinah to be removed. Therefore, it was not just that the <i>killer</i> should be free while the high priest lived. The <i>high priest</i> was also supposed to pray that no killing should happen in his days. Therefore, the killer must sit until he died, and the killer prayed that the <i>high priest</i> should die.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Numbers, 35:25.</i>
Another explanation why they waited until the high priest died, because when the same relatives, who were relatives of the killed, will see that the high priest dies, they would be consoled and say that the high priest was an important person and yet he died? Therefore, is this like the death of our relative? The relatives will no longer hate the killer.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Numbers, 35:25.</i>
The mother of the high priest brought food to the killer so that he should not pray that the high priest should die.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Makkot</i>, 11a.</i>
“<i>The killer may return to his land holding</i>” [35:28]. The killer may return to his land holding. <i>Raba</i> said: the killer returns home to his barns, fields, and vineyards. However, the official position that he previously had is not given back to him. <i>Rabbi Meir</i> said that he is given back his position of authority.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">B. Makkot, 13a. In the Talmud, Rabbi Judah, rather than Raba is cited.</i>
“<i>You may not accept a ransom for the life of a murderer</i>” [35:31]. They should take no money from the killer when he is guilty of the death penalty, or he is guilty of running to the <i>cities of refuge</i>, since the sin of killing is the greatest sin of all sins, as we find concerning Ahab, who was an evil king. The Holy One allowed his sins to accumulate. No greater sin was found, but the killing that he caused to happen, the murder of <i>Naboth</i>, and therefore, the Holy One allowed him to be killed because of this sin, even though Ahab did not kill him with his own hands. Rather, he ordered him to be killed. How much more so, when someone has killed with his own hands, how great is the sin. Therefore, he should not be redeemed with any money.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Numbers, 35:31.</i>
“<i>You shall not pollute the land</i>” [35:33]. You should not engage in any flattery. That is, when somebody commits a sin in secret that no person knows about and he presents himself as very important. Our sages said: a person who engages in flattery comes to Gehenna. When somebody engages in flattery so that his friends should give him honor, he will have much shame in the end. When someone flatters the Holy One, his prayer is not accepted. <i>Rabbi Eleazar</i> said: the one who engages in flattery with his friend, in the end he will fall into his hands.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Sotah</i>, 41b.</i>
“<i>In which I myself abide</i>” [35:34]. The Holy One said: do not engage in flattery, because I am among you. Israel are beloved even when they are impure and even more so when the Shekhinah is among them, as the verse says, “<i>which abides with them in the midst of their uncleanness</i>” [Leviticus, 16:16]. <i>Rabbi Nathan</i> said: when Israel are, there the Shekhinah is among them. The Shekhinah was with them in Egypt. The Shekhinah was with them in Babylon. The Shekhinah is with us in this exile, as the verse says, “<i>who is this coming from Edom</i>” [Isaiah, 63:1]. When we will again go to Jerusalem, the <i>Shekhinah</i> will go with us, as the verse says, “<i>then the Lord will restore</i>” [Deuteronomy, 30:3]. This should soon come to pass. <i>Amen and so may it be His will.</i>

“<i>These are the words that Moses addressed to all Israel</i>” [1:1]. These are words of rebuke that Moses spoke to Israel at the Jordan. He recounted the transgressions that they had committed. The first is, you spoke evil in the wilderness and said that it would have been better that we would have died. The second is, you committed a sin with Peor, in Shittim, in the <i>plains of Moab.</i> You committed a sin when you came to the sea. You said, was there not enough to bury us in Egypt and afterwards, you spoke evil about the <i>manna</i>, which was very good. You said that it caused your innards to swell. You committed a sin against God about the Holy Land, with the spies and did evil regarding Korah. You argued against God and against Moses, and you made the Golden Calf. These are seven sins. It is written in the <i>rebukes</i>, “<i>I will go on to discipline you sevenfold for your sins</i>” [Leviticus, 26:18]. This means, I will punish you sevenfold for your sins.

From Horeb it was only eleven days journey until <i>Kadesh-Barnea</i>, which is near the <i>land of Israel.</i> When they came to <i>Kadesh-Barnea</i>, they sent the spies and had to remain in the wilderness for forty years.

Therefore, God said to them: look further, as far as “<i>the great river, the river Euphrates</i>” [1:7].

“<i>These are the words</i>” [1:1].

“<i>How can I bear unaided the trouble of you</i>” [1:12]. Moses said: the Israelites are worse. When somebody loses a <i>legal case</i> against his friend, he says that he will find other <i>judges</i>, or I will bring more witnesses. Therefore, I cannot do enough alone <i>to judge Israel.</i> When they saw Moses going in front, they said; why is Moses so important? You think that he thinks about your good? This is not true.

“<i>You have been skirting this hill country long enough</i>” [2:3]. The Holy One did not tell them to war with Esau, since Esau had properly honored his father. [Midrash] <i>Rabbah</i> writes in this portion. <i>Rabbi Eliezer</i>’<i>s students</i> asked him. Tell us how great is the reward when one honors his father and mother? He responded: see what a gentile whose name was <i>Damah</i>, in the city of <i>Ashkelon</i>, did. His mother was <i>mentally ill</i> and beat her son, <i>Damah</i>, in the market among all the people, and the son remained silent. He allowed himself to be beaten. He said: it is already enough my dear mother. Our sages said: it happened once to <i>Damah</i> that the sages of Israel came to purchase a precious stone, since the Israelites had lost a <i>precious stone</i> from the <i>Temple. Damah</i> had a similar precious stone. They told him that they wanted to give him one thousand gulden for that precious stone. When <i>Damah</i> came to his warehouse, he found his father sleeping on the chest that contained the precious stone. He did not want to wake him, and the sages had to leave with nothing. The Israelites thought that <i>Damah</i> wanted more money and they said to him: we will give you ten thousand gulden for it, but give us the precious stone. When his father awoke, <i>Damah</i> went and brought it to the Israelites. The Israelites wanted to give him the ten thousand gulden. <i>Damah</i> responded: I do not do this because I should benefit from it, because I honored my father. I will not sell the reward for <i>honoring father and mother.</i> I will not take more from you than what I first asked from you. The Holy One paid him his reward that same year; his cow gave birth to a <i>red heifer.</i> He sold it for much money, more than ten thousand gulden. We should see how the Holy one repays the merit of <i>honoring father and mother. Rabbi Simeon ben Gamaliel</i> said: nobody honored his or her father and mother more than I did. However, in any event, Esau honored his father Isaac more than I did. When I served my father or mother, I wore ordinary soiled clothes. I put on nice clothes when I went to the market. However, Esau put on his best clothes when he wanted to serve and honor him, as we find, <i>Rebecca</i> said to <i>Jacob:</i> take the beautiful garments that Esau used to don when he served Isaac. Thus, Isaac, your father, will think that you are Esau and will bless you because of the way that Esau honored his father. Thus, the Holy One forbade that anything should be done to Esau.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy Rabbah, 1.15.</i>

“<i>Indeed, the Lord your God has blessed you</i> … <i>you have lacked nothing</i>” [2:7]. He said that the Holy One blessed you and did not bring you misfortune. A parable.

However, the Holy One fed Israel for forty years in the wilderness, always the same way; on the last day, like the first day. <i>Rabbi Nechuniah</i> said: nothing concerned the Israelites in the wilderness, but talking with their mouths. As soon as someone wanted something, it was given to them. The <i>manna</i> became whatever he desired. If he desired from the <i>manna</i> that it should taste like veal, it tasted that way, and the same with chicken.

“<i>Do not harass the Moabites</i>” [2:9]. The Holy One pays each one his reward. The two daughters of Lot slept with their father and had children from their father. The older one had a son and named him Moab. This means, he came from my father. Thus, she revealed the shame. However, the younger one named her son Ammon. This means, he is from my people. The words of the younger one were more modest. Therefore, God said to Moses that they should not frighten the children of the younger one by showing them the signs of war.

However, it was permitted to frighten them.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Deuteronomy, 2:9.</i> Also, because Moses will be buried in their land.

“<i>Everywhere under heaven</i>” [2:25]. The Holy One said to Moses: I will give fear of you in all of heaven, since on the day when he battled with Og, the sun stood longer than other days. Thus, the whole world saw the wonders of Moses that he made the sun stand still. The sun stood still in a similar way for <i>Joshua</i> and also for <i>Nakdimon ben Gurion</i>, as the Talmud says in [tractate] <i>Ta</i>’<i>anit.</i> Once, Israel went on the pilgrimage to Jerusalem and did not have any water to drink. Nakdimon went to a <i>hegemon</i> and borrowed twelve wells of water from him, and set a time to repay with water or give him ten thousand gulden. When the time came, the <i>hegemon</i> sent to <i>Nakdimon</i> that he should be paid. Nakdimon said: it still might rain today. The <i>hegemon</i> mocked him and said: there has been no rain for a whole year, so how will it rain today? He was joyous and went to the <i>baths.</i> Nakdimon was very sad and went to the <i>Temple</i> and prayed. The wells were filled and there was more water than before. Nakdimon sent to the hegemon and said: send me money, as I have given you extra water. The hegemon responded: the sun set a long time ago, and you have <i>gone past</i> the <i>stated time.</i> He prayed and it again became day and the sun shone longer than normal.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Ta</i>’<i>anit</i>, 19b-20a.</i>
It is written in the <i>Midrash. Joshua</i> said to the sun, stand silent, because when the sun travels, it sings and praises the Holy One, as the verse says, “<i>from east to west the name of the Lord is praised</i>” [Psalms, 113:3]. This means, the sun praises God from the heaven when it shines, until night, when it sets. Therefore, Joshua said to the sun, stand silent. That is, do not sing and remain still. The sun responded: You, Joshua, are very small compared to me, so how do you tell me to stand? Furthermore, I was created on Wednesday and you were created on Friday. Joshua responded: I am a <i>free person</i>, like a son to the father, and you are a servant. The son, even when he is small, makes fun of the servant, even though he is big. The sun immediately stopped, as the verse says, “<i>the sun halted in mid heaven</i>” [Joshua, 10:13]. This means, the sun stood in the middle of heaven.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Deuteronomy, 2:25.</i>
“<i>We retained as booty only the cattle</i>” [2:35]. At the war with Sihon, the Israelites loaded up with clothes and cattle. By the war with Og, they did not want to take cattle or garments; it was disgusting to them. However, they took gold and silver and they hacked up the garments and burned them and they chased away the sheep.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Deuteronomy, 2:34.</i>
“<i>Because the Lord had stiffened his will</i>” [2:30]. Sihon did not want to allow Israel into his land, because the Holy One had incited him so that he would not allow Israel to go into his land, expecting that Israel should destroy him because he would not let him go through his land. People ask: if the Holy one had incited him that he should not allow Israel to go through his land, what kind of evil did he do when he did not let them go, when God incited him and placed in his heart that he should not allow Israel to go through, what was Sihon guilty of? The explanation is that when the Holy One sees that the evildoer did evil, three or four times, the Holy One incites him further to do evil, expecting that he will not repent and should be destroyed. If he should want to repent, then the Holy One puts it into his mind that he should continue to do evil so that he should be destroyed. The Holy One did the same to Pharaoh.
“<i>The Lord said to me: do not fear</i>” [3:2]. The Holy One said to Moses: do not be afraid of Og. I gave him into the hands of Israel long ago, in the days of Abraham. Abraham made a banquet for his son, Isaac, when he was circumcised on the eighth day. Og attended that banquet and other nobles were there with him. They said to Og: you said that Abraham would have no children. See how the Holy One has given him a son. Og responded: if I would lay my small finger on him, he would die. The Holy One said: this time you belittle him, you evildoer. You will see so many of his descendants, like the sand in the sea. You will fall into the hands of his descendants. When Israel came to the border of their land, Moses and the Israelites came early before the city of <i>Edrei.</i> They saw Og sitting on top of the wall and Og’s feet reached the ground. The Holy One said to Moses: This is Og, and his feet were thirty-eight ells long. Moses was frightened of him. The Holy One said: do not be afraid. Og took a large mountain and threw it on Israel. Moses took a little earth and recited the <i>Ineffable Name</i>, and the mountain stopped.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Deuteronomy Rabbah</i>, 1.24.</i>
Therefore, our sages also said that it would have been just to recite songs of praise about Sihon and Og, as they did at the Exodus from Egypt regarding Pharaoh. However, King David came and recited songs of praise about them, as the verse says, “<i>Sihon, king of the Amorites, His steadfast love is eternal; Og, king of Bashan, His steadfast love is eternal</i>” [Psalms, 136:19–20].<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Hukat, <i>Remez</i>, 765 (at the end).</i>

“<i>I pleaded</i>” [3:23]. <i>King Solomon, of blessed memory</i>, said: how great is the reward when somebody gives charity and has compassion on the poor, as the verse says, “<i>he who is generous to the poor makes a loan to the Lord; He will repay him his due</i>” [Proverbs, 19:17]. This means, the one who has compassion for the poor, is like one who has lent the Holy One money and He repays it to the one who has compassion for the poor. It is known that the wealthy person relies greatly on his wealth and little on God. Or, he relies on his friends and on his devotees, since the whole world hates the poor person. Therefore, the poor person places all of his hopes in the Holy One. That is why King Solomon said: because the poor person has few friends and nobody has compassion for him, I will have compassion for him. The Holy One said: whoever will have compassion for the poor person, it is as if he had compassion for Me, and I am obligated to pay him his reward. People bless him, since his attributes and custom is from the Holy One and he blesses the people who serve Him. He freely gives gifts, even to those who do not worship properly Him, since God is only compassion.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Veethanan, Introduction.</i>
Therefore, the verse begins here with “<i>I pleaded</i>” [3:23]. This means, Moses said: I will ask God that he should have compassion on me to accept my prayer, since the righteous, even though they are pious, yet they do not want to hold themselves high and ask the Holy One that He should give them <i>undeserved gifts</i>, and will not ask for the sake of their piety and good deeds. The prayer of Moses was that the Holy One should allow him to go into the land of Israel. Moses said; since I vanquished Sihon and Og, the oath that the Holy One made is abrogated, since I have begun to conquer the land of Sihon and Og, then I will continue to conquer the land of Israel.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Deuteronomy, 3:23.</i>
“<i>Enough</i>” [3:26]. The Holy One said to Moses: <i>Adam</i> brought death into the world, so that each person must die. Moses responded: <i>Lord of the Universe</i>, <i>Adam</i> committed a sin. The Holy One said: did <i>Abraham</i> have to die? He allowed himself to be thrown into the fire for the sake of God. Moses responded: an evil son, <i>Ishmael</i>, came from <i>Abraham.</i> The Holy One said: <i>Isaac</i> stretched out his neck to be slaughtered for the sake of God and he had to die. Moses said: the <i>evil Esau</i> came from Isaac. The Holy One said: Jacob had twelve <i>righteous</i> children and he had to die. Moses said: however, Jacob did not ascend to heaven like I did, and he did not receive the Torah, as I did. Moses said: there were <i>six hundred thousand</i> Israelites and they sinned many times, and You forgave them, and You do not want to forgive me? The Holy One responded: one does much more for the sake of a community than one does for the sake of an individual. Moses said: punish me with torments to my body, but do not give me into the hands of the <i>angel of death.</i> I will tell Your praises in the whole world, as the verse says, “<i>I shall not die but live and proclaim the works of the Lord</i>” [Psalms, 118:17]. The Holy One responded: there is a gate through which even the righteous have to enter, as the verse says, “<i>this is the gateway to the Lord</i> – <i>the righteous shall enter through it</i>” [Psalms, 118:20]. Moses saw that he could not win his case, so he went to heaven and earth and said: pray for me. They responded: we have to pray for ourselves, since we will also be destroyed in the end, as the verse says, “<i>the heavens should melt away like smoke, and the earth wear out like a garment</i>” [Isaiah, 51:6]. This means, the heavens will dissolve like smoke and the earth will melt like a skein of thread. So Moses went to the stars and to the sun and moon, and the high mountains. They all responded: we have enough to deal with. He came to the sea and the sea said to Moses: what happened to you? You beat me with your stick and I had to split. The Shekhinah always stood at your right hand. As soon as Moses heard that the sea spoke about the wonders that he did in his youth, Moses ran and screamed, and cried before the highest angel and said: pray for me. The angel responded: I have heard that your prayers will not help. Moses immediately shouted and cried. The Holy One said: I have sworn two oaths. If you want to remain alive, then Israel must be destroyed, <i>heaven forbid.</i> If Israel were to remain alive, then you must die. Moses responded: I and my thousands should be destroyed, before any Israelite should be destroyed. The Holy One said: if your fear of the <i>angel of death</i> is so great, then I will place the angel of death in your hands. Moses responded: how should my mother, <i>Yocheved</i>, not mourn? She has already buried two children, and should she also bury the third one? The Holy One said: the time has come for Joshua to be a king over Israel. Therefore, you must die. Moses said: if this is why I must die, I will be a <i>disciple to Joshua</i> and let him be the teacher. The Holy One responded: If you want to do that, then it is good. Moses immediately went to the tent of Joshua, early in the morning, and stood by the door. Joshua taught Torah to Israel and did not see Moses, since Moses had bent down so that he should not be seen, and closed his mouth with his hands, so that he should not be recognized. All of Israel came to Moses’ tent and they found him with Joshua. Moses stood and Joshua sat. <i>All of Israel said to Joshua:</i> what is this? You are sitting and your teacher is standing? As soon as Joshua saw that Moses was standing, he tore his garments and cried, and said: <i>my</i> teacher, my teacher, my lord, what are you doing? The Israelites said to Moses, teach us Torah. Moses responded I am not supposed to. They said: we will not allow you. A <i>heavenly voice</i> came down from heaven and said: learn Torah from Joshua. They immediately learned Torah from Joshua and Moses sat at the right hand of Joshua and Eliezer on his left side, and Joshua taught Torah before Moses. Afterwards, when <i>all of Israel</i> left the <i>house of study</i>, all of Israel came to Moses and said to him: teach us and explain what Joshua had said. Moses responded: I cannot do it. That hour, Moses said: <i>Lord of the Universe</i>, it is time; I will die. They said to Moses: there is still an hour to your death. Moses said: let us wait a while; I will first bless Israel. He blessed each tribe separately. Then he saw that it was almost time to die; he blessed all of Israel together. Then they said to him: Moses, there is still a half hour before your death. He began to ask forgiveness of all of Israel and said: I have troubled you many times to study Torah, forgive me. Then they said: Moses there is still a minute to your death. Immediately, he said: <i>blessed be His name, who lives and exists forever.</i> He said to Israel: when you will come to the land of Israel, remember me. They said: how should we not remember you? You have done everything good for us. Immediately they said: Moses, there is still half a minute before your death. Moses immediately put both hands on his heart and said to Israel. These hands that received the Torah will be buried in the earth. His soul immediately left him. No man and no angel buried him, but the Holy One himself. He died on the seventh day of the month of <i>Adar</i>, the same day that he was born. The Holy One counts the days of the righteous.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanhuma</i>, <i>Veethanan</i>, 6.</i>
“<i>You shall not go across yonder Jordan</i>” [3:27]. The Holy One said to Moses: you will not cross the Jordan, and even your bones will not cross it. <i>Moses</i> said: <i>Lord of the Universe</i>, why am I worse than <i>Joseph the righteous one</i>, that his bones were taken to the land of Canaan? The Holy One responded: did you deny your land? When you came to Jethro, his daughters said: an Egyptian came and helped us draw the water. You, Moses, heard everything. They called you an Egyptian and you remained silent. You allowed yourself to be called by a foreign name. You should have said: I am a Jew. Therefore, you are not worthy to come into your land, since you disowned your own land. However, Joseph the righteous one, when the gentile woman, his master’s wife, wanted that he should sleep with her, she said about Joseph: my lord has brought a Jew, from the Jews. He wanted to sleep with me. He did not disown that he was a Jew and said: I was stolen from the Jews, from the Jewish land. Therefore, he was worthy to be buried in the Jewish land. The Holy One said: when you, Moses, will be buried among the people in the wilderness, because of your merit they will come into the land of Israel. A parable. Someone loses a penny or other copper coins in the dark. He reflects, if I were to ask people to provide light to search for my cheap coins, the people would not listen to me. That person went and threw a golden gulden among the ordinary coins and shouted, I lost a golden gulden. The people came immediately and provided a light. When he took the golden gulden, he also took the ordinary coins along with it. So too, the Holy One said to Moses: when you will be buried <i>outside the land</i>, you will take along all of Israel into the land of Israel. However, Jacob was worthy to be buried with his flesh and bones in the land of Israel. Joseph was worthy that his bones were buried in the land of Israel, but his flesh and skin decayed outside the land. Long after his death, the children of Israel carried him to the land of Israel.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Deuteronomy Rabbah</i>, 2.8–9.</i>
“<i>To observe, so that you may live</i>” [4:1]. From here we learn that study is not primary, but good deeds. This is primary and this is life.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Deuteronomy, 4:1.</i>
“<i>You shall not add</i>” [4:2]. The verse teaches that the person should not be too clever and not want to <i>add new commandments</i> than what the Torah had commanded. However, when people make a vow to fast when it is not commanded, or they do not eat meat for several days, or other penitential acts, these are permitted, to fend off the evil inclination. That is why the Torah wrote near this verse about the foreign god of Baal Peor, that you worshiped. One uncovered oneself and placed one’s read end toward the foreign god, and defecated before the foreign god. Even though one may mock the foreign god to shame it and make it despicable, before the foreign god. However, a foreign god where the nations of the world do this as an act of worship that which is despicable, no Jew should do this, even though the Jew intends to shame. Therefore, the Israelites thought that they were doing the right thing by defecating before Peor. However, the Holy One killed them all. So too, the one who wants to add some commandments, more than what the Torah had commanded, he does not do right. When he is zealous for the sake of God, yet he should not add, just like at Peor, even though the intention of the Israelites was good, to mock the foreign god. He thought that he would have a reward from this.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Keli Yakar, Deuteronomy, 4:2.</i>
So too, the commandments that one wants to add, the person might soon commit a sin. The Holy One gave the Torah full and complete, without any defects. One should not add, as one who wants to make phylacteries with five passages, and wants to take on <i>Sukkot</i> an <i>etrog</i>, a palm frond, myrtle and willows, and add something to them, or if he wants to make five <i>zizit</i>, or wants to sleep in the <i>sukkah</i> on the eighth day; he should not do these things.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban, Deuteronomy, 4:2.</i>
“<i>You, who hold fast to the Lord</i>” [4:4]. Our sages said: how is it possible to cleave to God? The verse tells us that one should perform their deeds like God. The Holy One does acts of lovingkindness with people, so too one should do with his friend.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Shabbat</i>, 133b.</i> Or, one who cleaves to a scholar, it is like he cleaved to the Shekhinah.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Ketubot</i>, 111b.</i> Similarly, whoever cleaves to a righteous person will be protected for his sake.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Veethanan, <i>Remez</i>, 824.</i>
“<i>So close at hand as is the Lord</i>” [4:7]. <i>Rabbi Hananiah</i> and <i>Rabbi Joshua</i> said: where are there a people like Israel? When someone should have a <i>case</i> before <i>judges</i>, he is sad and worries that he should not lose the case. He wears black clothes and allows his hair to grow. However, Israel, when the <i>New Year</i> comes, which is the <i>Day of Judgment</i> when people are judged. Israel dresses in white, groom themselves, eat good things, and are happy, since they know well that the Holy One will forgive them their sins, since the Holy One is close to Israel to hear their prayers. Another explanation. It is customary that when somebody has a relative and that relative is rich, he says, this is my relative. However, when he is poor, he says, this is not my relative. However, the Holy one is not so. Israel was poor, naked and insignificant in Egypt, and He said, “<i>Israel is My first-born son</i>” [Exodus, 4:22]. This means, Israel is My first-born child.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, <i>Veethanan</i>, <i>Remez</i>, 825.</i>
“<i>These, the Lord your God allotted to other peoples</i>” [4:19]. The Torah tells us that you should not follow the foreign gods that the nations worship. When things go well for the gentiles, it is because the Holy One allows it to happen so that because things go well for them, they will be destroyed along with their foreign gods. <i>Rabah the son of Isaac said to Rabbi Judah.</i> There is a foreign god that when people desire rain, something appears to them and says to them: slaughter a person and then I will allow the rain to fall. As soon as they slaughter a person, the rain falls. Rabbi Judah responded: If I had been dead, you would not have understood this. However, now I will tell you how this happens. I heard Rav say that the Holy One misleads the nations of the world that they should think that it is something good for the foreign god and they should be destroyed. God leads the person the way that he wants to go.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Deuteronomy, 4:19.</i>
“<i>Bezer, in the desert</i>” [4:43]. A city called <i>Bezer.</i> This was a city of refuge. When a killer had accidentally killed his friend, he ran there and nothing should be done to him there. The Torah wrote this near the verse regarding the cities of refuge.
“<i>This is the Teaching</i>” [4:44]. This teaches us that the Torah is a city of refuge for a person. Whoever studies Torah, is protected by the Torah. Nobody can do anything to him when he studies Torah, as we find with <i>Rabbi Hisda.</i> The <i>angel of death</i> could do nothing to him, since he studied day and night. His mouth did not stop studying Torah. The <i>angel of death</i> went and split a large tree that was very strong. Rabbi Hisda stopped studying and the angel of death killed him. <i>Resh Lakish</i> said: the angel of the city of <i>Rome</i> will run to the city of refuge in the days of the Messiah, since he will think, I have allowed many Israelites to be killed. I am a killer. However, he will make three mistakes. The first is that he will run to <i>Bazarah.</i> This is not the <i>city of refuge</i>, but <i>Bezer</i> is the city of refuge. The second is that he killed Israelites willingly and the <i>city of refuge</i> was given to those who killed accidentally. The third mistake is that he is an angel and the <i>cities of refuge</i> only accept human beings and not angels.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Deuteronomy, 4:43.</i>
“<i>I the Lord am your God</i>” [5:6]. The <i>Ten Statements</i> are like a king who builds a new land and placed the people in it. The king writes <i>permits</i> about what the people are obligated to do for the king, and how the people should behave to one another. Therefore, the Holy One gave the <i>Ten Statements</i> on two tablets. On one Tablet was written how the people should relate to the Holy One. On the second Tablet was written how the people should relate to each other. The first <i>Statement</i> is “<i>I the Lord am your God</i>” [5:6]. This means, know that I am God who took you out of Egypt where you were in captivity. Therefore, keep me as your Lord, who has given you this land. If you want to have me as your Lord and will say, I want another Lord like Me, therefore the second <i>Statement</i> was written, “<i>you shall have no other gods</i>” [5:7]. This means, you should have no God other than Me. You shall not serve anyone but Me alone. Afterwards, the king said to the people. When you accept me as your lord, then you should honor me honestly. Therefore, the Holy One wrote the third <i>Statement</i>, “<i>you shall not swear falsely by the name of the Lord your God</i>” [5:11]. This means, you should not swear falsely by My name, not to keep what you say. With this, he desecrates his name and is as if he considers Me as nothing. Afterwards, the king says to his people. Make a <i>memorial</i> that I have given you this land. You shall not forget to honor Me, and make a day of rest, to be joyous that I have given you this land. Therefore, the Holy One said the fourth <i>Statement</i>, “<i>observe the Sabbath day and keep it holy</i>” [5:12]. This means, rest on the Sabbath to make it holy. You should remember that I took you out of Egypt and I gave you the <i>land of Israel.</i> Afterwards, the king said to the people. You are people who die, and who will know after your death that I gave you the land? Your children will accept another king. Therefore, I command you that the son should honor the father, and he should keep what he promised. Therefore, your children should also say that I gave the land. Therefore, the Holy One said the fifth <i>Statement</i>, “<i>honor your father and your mother</i>” [5:16]. This means, honor your father and mother and do what they tell you, that I created the world and I took you out of Egypt. These five <i>Statements</i> were written on one Tablet, on which was written how the person should relate to the Holy One. On the other Tablet was written how one friend should relate to the other one. First, He wrote, do nothing to your friend’s body to kill him. This is, “<i>you shall not murder</i>” [5:17]. Afterwards, he said, do not touch your friend’s wife, who was given to him by God. The wife is also a part of the husband, like his body. This is the second <i>Statement</i>, “<i>you shall not commit adultery</i>” [5:17]. If you will remember that I will not do anything to his body, and I will not take his <i>money.</i> Therefore, the Holy One wrote the third <i>Statement</i>, “<i>you shall not steal</i>” [5:7]. This means, do not steal his money and if you will remember that I will not take his money, but I can hurt him with my words, to give false witness about a friend. Therefore, the Holy One wrote, “<i>you shall not bear false witness against your neighbor</i>” [5:17]. This means, do not give false witness against any friend. The fifth <i>Statement</i> the Holy One said: if you would say, I will not damage my friend with my mouth, but in my thoughts, in my heart, I might do him damage, to envy him or give him an <i>evil eye</i> on his goods. Therefore the Holy One wrote, “<i>you shall not covet</i>” [5:18]. This means, you should not covet something of your friend’s, like a wife or his house, or his ox, or his donkey. An <i>evil eye</i> comes from this lust. You can bring him harm with an <i>evil eye.</i>
“<i>May they always be of such a mind</i>” [5:26]. May the hearts of Israel always be so, to be good. From here we learn that everything is within the power of the Holy One, but that he should fear God, this is in the power of the person. He may be good or evil. The Holy One has given the person the power so that he may do what he wants.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Deuteronomy, 5:26.</i>
“<i>Hear, O Israel. The Lord is our God, the Lord alone</i>” [6:4]. The verse mentions three <i>divine names.</i> First, <i>YHVH.</i> This shows that the Holy One was God before the world was created. The second <i>divine name</i>, <i>our God</i>, shows that He was God when the world was created. The third <i>divine name</i>, <i>YHVH</i>, shows that the Holy One will be God, even if the world ends. The word <i>one</i> shows that He will be <i>one</i> at all times. The person should know that when he says, <i>one</i> when he prays, he should have his heart in it, and his intention for what the word <i>one</i> is. He should not move his mouth without having his thoughts on it. Therefore, the verse began with <i>hear.</i> This means, understand what you are saying. Moses said to Israel: you said, “<i>we will do and we will hear</i>” [Exodus, 24:7] on Mount Sinai. This means, you will do and you will hear. Since you made the Golden Calf, you did not do what God had told you. Therefore, it continued further with the word “<i>we will hear.</i>” Therefore, we recite “<i>Hear, O Israel</i>” every day. A parable. A king betroths a woman with two <i>precious stones</i>, and she loses one precious stone. The king says: be careful with the other precious stone.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Deuteronomy, 6:4.</i>
Israel were worthy to say, “<i>Hear, O Israel</i>,” from Jacob onward. Jacob said to his children when he was dying, I fear that when I die, you will accept another god. The children said all together, “<i>Hear, O Israel. The Lord is our God, the Lord alone</i>” [6:4]. This means, listen our father Israel, your God is our God. Therefore, we say every day, “<i>Hear, O Israel.</i>” Another explanation is that Moses was in heaven and he heard the angels say, “<i>blessed be the name of His glorious majesty forever and ever.</i>” This means, praise His Name and give Him honor. His Kingdom exists forever and ever. When Moses came down to Israel, he taught them to say, “<i>blessed be the name of His glorious majesty forever and ever.</i>” He said to Israel: you should not say this loudly, but silently, so that one does not hear it. A parable. Someone steals a goblet from the king’s table. He gives the goblet to his wife and says to her. Do not show the goblet to people, but use the goblet in the house. However, on Yom Kippur, we say, “<i>blessed be the name of His glorious majesty forever and ever</i>,” out loud. Israel praises the Holy One and the Holy One praises Israel. A parable. A pious religious man has a pious wife. He praises his wife among all the men and she praises her husband among all the women, how she has a husband whose piety is beyond compare. This is how the Holy One praises Israel before the angels. He says, there is no better people than Israel, as the verse says, “<i>only one is my dove, my perfect one</i>” [Song of Songs, 6:9]. Israel says: <i>The Lord is our God, the Lord alone</i>” [6:4].<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, <i>Veethanan</i>, <i>Remez</i>, 834.</i>
“<i>You shall love the Lord your God</i>” [6:5]. You should love God, because He is One, and created the world alone. The one who worships the Holy One out of fear does not properly worship Him, but one should worship Him out of love. One should fulfill the commandments that the Holy One has commanded and one should be joyous when one fulfills a commandment.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Deuteronomy, 6:5.</i>
“<i>With all your heart and with all your soul</i>” [6:5]. You should love the Holy One with your heart, because the heart is the first thing created in the womb. When the person dies, the heart dies last. When all the organs are dead, then the heart dies. Therefore, it says that you should love God with your heart from the time you first live until you die.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Deuteronomy, 6:5.</i>
“<i>With all your might</i>” [6:5]. You should love God with your money. You should not love your money more than the Holy One when a commandment comes to hand. We find concerning <i>Rabban Gamaliel</i> who bought an <i>etrog</i> for one thousand gulden. He wanted to fulfill the commandment. Our sages said in the Talmud, in [tractate] <i>Baba Kama.</i> Rabbi Zeira said: when a person has an <i>etrog</i> and a <i>lulav</i> or a Torah scroll for fifteen gulden, and afterwards he finds more beautiful <i>etrogs</i> or <i>Torah scrolls</i>, he is obligated to spend an extra five gulden for the more beautiful object. He should make the commandment more beautiful before the Holy One, as the verse says, “<i>this is my God and I will glorify Him</i>” [Exodus, 15:2]. This means that he should glorify God with beautiful commandments. Some sages say, “<i>with all your might</i>” [6:5] means, you should love God with all the fortitude that he gives you, whether good or evil. You should always praise God. Some sages say that you should love God, “<i>with all your heart</i>” [6:5]. This refers to Abraham, who loved God with his whole heart and brought many people to the love of God. “<i>With all your soul</i>” [6:5]. This refers to Isaac, who put his <i>soul</i> in peril, and was ready to allow himself to be slaughtered on the altar. “<i>With all your might</i>” [6:5]. This refers to Jacob, who gave a tithe from his money and from his children.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Deuteronomy, 6:5.</i>
“<i>Which I charge you this day</i>” [6:6]. The commandments that you fulfill should not be like an old commandment in your eyes, but like they were given today. When a person is accustomed to do something often, then it is nothing new to him. However, the commandments should be in your eyes like a letter that the king writes to someone. He listens to each word that is in the letter. So too should the commandments be in your eyes.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Deuteronomy, 6:6.</i>
“<i>Recite them</i>” [6:7]. You shall speak in the Torah and your primary speech should be in the Torah. The Torah is not <i>fulfilled</i> except by shouting with his voice. However, prayer should be silent and not loudly shouted in the synagogue.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Deuteronomy, 6:7.</i>
“<i>A sign on your hand</i>” [6:8]. One should place the <i>phylactery</i> on the left hand, in the middle of the hand opposite the heart.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Deuteronomy, 6:8.</i>
“<i>As frontlets on your head</i>” [6:8]. The <i>phylactery of the head</i> should be over the brain.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Deuteronomy, 6:8.</i>
“<i>The doorposts of your house</i>” [6:9]. One should write the <i>mezuzah</i> and place it on the right doorpost, when he goes in to the house, since the person first steps into his house with his right foot. One writes the [divine] name <i>Shaddai</i> on the outside of the <i>mezuzah</i>, since the gentiles say that when things go well for a person in his house, it is caused by the zodiac constellations in heaven. Therefore, the Holy One ordered that the [divine] <i>name Shaddai</i> be written. This shows us that the Holy One can change the zodiac constellations and move them as He wants. Our sages said: <i>king Artaban sent a precious stone</i> to <i>Rabbi</i> [Judah the Prince] and informed Rabbi, send me something better than this <i>precious stone</i> in return. Rabbi sent him a <i>mezuzah.</i> The king responded: I sent you a precious stone that no person can pay for, and you send me a <i>mezuzah</i> that one can buy for two pennies. Rabbi responded: you sent me something that one can buy with much money. However, I sent you a thing that has no measure and no set amount. Furthermore, what you sent me is something that one must carefully guard from thieves. However, what I sent you is very protected and protects you and your whole house, as the verse says, “<i>when you lie down it will watch over you, and when you are awake it will talk with you</i>” [Proverbs, 6:22]. This means, when you sleep it will protect you and when you are awake it talks with you.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Deuteronomy, 6:9.</i>
“<i>Houses full of all good things</i>” [6:11]. The Holy One promised that Israel should find very good thing in the houses in the land of Israel where the nations lived. Even the meat of the pigs became permitted to the Israelites where they found it belonging to the gentiles. Similarly, other things that the Torah forbade to Israel, the Holy One allowed for seven years while they waged war in the land of Israel; it was all permitted. However, they had no benefit from the idolatrous things. Maimonides<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">In Bahya’s commentary it is Nahmanides.</i> wrote explicitly that it was permitted to eat <i>non-kosher meat and pork</i> when they were hungry and did not have what to eat and to drink <i>non-kosher wine.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Deuteronomy, 6:11.</i>
“<i>Take heed that you do not forget</i>” [6:12]. The Torah teaches us that when things go well for the person, he should not forget how bad things were for him when he was poor. Therefore, the verse says here, take heed and remember how you had it in Egypt, and now you have enough of everything. Now remember that the Holy One has given you everything.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Deuteronomy, 6:12.</i>
“<i>Swear only by His name</i>” [6:13]. The Torah commanded that when you want to fulfill a commandment, you should swear by the Holy One and not by any other god. <i>Rabbi Osiah</i> said: a person should swear to his evil inclination that he would not follow it, as we find with Abraham. He swore, “<i>I lift up my hand to the Lord</i>” [Genesis, 14:22]. This means, I lift up my hand to God that I will not take anything that is not mine. So too, <i>Boaz</i> swore, “<i>as the Lord lives</i>” [Ruth, 3:13]. <i>Ruth</i> came to him at night into his bed. He did not want to touch her, to sleep with her. This is what the righteous do. However, the evildoers are the opposite. They swore that they will do the will of the inclination and they keep their word.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, <i>Veethanan</i>, <i>Remez</i>, 840.</i>
“<i>Do not try the Lord your God</i>” [6:16]. The verse tells us that we should not test the Holy One.

Rather, he should worship with his whole heart, whether He gives you good fortune or not.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Deuteronomy, 6:16.</i>
“<i>It is not because you are the most numerous</i>” [7:7]. The verse shows us that even though we are among the smallest among the nations of the world, yet nonetheless, God desires us as a people. Therefore, it is just that you should serve the Holy One. Our sages said: the Holy One said to Israel: because you do not hold yourself important, therefore I want you to be My people.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Deuteronomy, 7:7.</i>
“<i>But who instantly requites with destruction those who reject Him</i>” [7:10]. The Holy One repays the evildoer his reward, to destroy him; He does not tarry. Some sages say that the Holy One pays the evildoer himself his reward, and not to his children. When the evildoer does something good, God immediately repays him in this world, expecting that he should have no good in the next world. A parable. A person is very sick; he will certainly die. The physician says: give him what he desires to eat and drink; he will certainly die. So too, the Holy One gives the evildoer his reward in this world for the good that he did, since he will certainly have troubles in the next world. The Holy One said: I will give the evildoer his reward for the few commandments that he fulfilled in this world, since this world is short and soon passes. His joy will soon end, he will not be given his reward in the next world which is eternal and long lasting, since the honor is greater in the next world. However, for the righteous person, I will repay him for his few sins in this world, which soon passes, and his positive deeds should remain for the next world, which is long lasting. Furthermore, in this world only the body is punished. However, in the next world the soul and the body are punished. Thus, the evildoer will have great troubles in the next world. Our sages say that the Holy One waits on the evildoer in three ways and allows him to have a good time in this world. The first is that he should repent. The second is that he may have fulfilled a commandment. The third is that he should raise a son who will be righteous. Therefore, God waits for him and does not immediately kill him.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Deuteronomy, 7:10.</i>
“<i>With which I charge you today</i>” [7:11]. The sages say that this world was given that one should fulfill commandments, and the next world was given so that one should receive his reward.

Therefore, the person should think to fulfill commandments while he lives, expecting that in the next world he will have for what to receive a reward.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Deuteronomy, 7:11.</i>

“<i>If you will heed</i>” [7:12]. Our sages said that the verse teaches us that the commandments that we fulfill with our feet, that one goes to the synagogue, or to a <i>sermon</i>, or <i>visiting the sick</i>, to someone who is sick, or to attend a funeral, or console the <i>mourners</i>; all of these commandments have great merit. Even on the Sabbath, one may run or walk quickly to go to the synagogue. Whoever does not fulfill the commandments, after his death the commandments will complain about him on the <i>Day of Judgment</i>, as the verse says, “<i>the encompassing evil of those who would supplant me</i>” [Psalms, 49:6]. This means, the sins that he commits with his feet will surround him. Similarly, when he is arrogant with his feet or he runs to commit sins, he will be punished. In particular, the one who engages in arrogance with his footsteps will be punished, as we find regarding the daughter of <i>Rabbi Haninah</i>, who was forced into a brothel because of the sin of arrogance she engaged in with her haughty walk. She said herself: I have sinned in that I walked haughtily with my feet. The Holy One is <i>punctilious</i> with the steps of the people. Therefore, the portion begins with “<i>If you will heed</i>” [7:12]. This means, when you will keep the commandments that one does with one’s feet, then the Holy One will give you the land, and everything that the Holy One promised you. Another explanation is that the reward for the commandments is at the end, in the next world. The <i>reward</i> of the evildoer for the few commandments that he fulfilled is in this world. Concerning this the verse said, “<i>If you will heed</i>” [7:12]. This means, when you will hear the commandments. Thus, God will repay you the reward in the end, in the next world.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Deuteronomy, 7:12.</i>
The word, <i>ekev</i>, means the bottom, like the heel of the person’s foot is the bottom part of the person. So too, the reward will be paid in the end. Another explanation is that the verse teaches us that the commandments that one holds insignificant and easy to fulfill, like something that one steps on with his foot, since he considers them as nothing. So too are some commandments that the person considers ordinary and easy. You should keep these commandments. You should not say that this commandment is good and the other one is not good. <i>Rabbi Aha</i> said in <i>Sefer Tanhuma:</i> a parable. A king puts some <i>workers</i> in a garden to plant all sorts of trees and he does not tell them what their payment will be. If he would tell them the payment then each one would work on the good trees in the garden and would receive a good payment. Nobody would work on the ordinary trees and the garden would not be properly made. So too, the Holy One did not make explicit what the reward is for the commandments, expecting that the person should not choose which commandments to do. Rather, he should do what comes to hand. <i>Rabbi Simeon bar Yohai</i> said: The Holy One made explicit the <i>reward</i> for two commandments. One is a very easy commandment. When someone comes across a nest in which there are birds, he must send away the mother from the children and then he may take the children. The Holy One wrote here that when the person will do this, his reward would be that he would live long. The Holy One also wrote about the reward for the most difficult commandment. This is “<i>honor your father and your mother</i>” [5:16], expecting that you will live long. The Holy One compared the easiest commandment to the most difficult commandment, to give the same reward. As great as the reward is, so too, the punishment is as great for the one who does not honor father and mother. The ravens and birds will peck at him and the eagle will eat him. The Holy One pays everything, <i>measure for measure.</i> Therefore, the raven is not compassionate to its children, since its children are born white and it is black. The male says to the female. You exchanged with another bird and therefore your children are white, and they leave their children. The Holy One makes them food; flies are created from their spittle until they are grown and strong. Afterwards, they become black. Since ravens are not compassionate, that is why the Holy One sends the ravens to the person who is not compassionate to his father and mother, and they pick out his eyes and peck at his flesh. However, they do not eat his flesh. The Holy One sends the eagle, who is compassionate to its children, and who eats the flesh of the person who does not honor his father or his mother. The eagle carried its children on its wings. It is afraid that someone would shoot at its children. However, other birds that carry their children with their feet are afraid of other birds. When the eagle comes to its nest, it flaps its wings. It does not want to frighten its children.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanhuma</i>, <i>Ekev</i>, 2.</i>
“<i>God will faithfully maintain</i>” [7:12]. All the good things that the Holy One gives to Israel in the world are from the blessing that Balaam had blessed Israel. However, the blessing of our ancestors, <i>Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob</i>, and the blessing of the other prophets will be fulfilled at the end. Concerning this, the verse said, “<i>faithfully maintain.</i>” This means, He will wait and hide your reward for the end.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Deuteronomy Rabbah</i>, 3.4.</i>
“<i>The Lord will ward off from you all sickness</i>” [7:15]. This means, the Lord will ward off from you all sickness. Rav said in <i>tractate Baba Mezia.</i> The verse shows us that the <i>evil eye</i> is the greatest sickness.

“<i>You shall consign the images of the gods to the fire</i>” [7:25]. Our sages said in <i>tractate Avodah Zarah.</i> When there still are foreign gods, they must be burned, and one should have no benefit from them. However, when the gentile has decommissioned them as foreign gods, then they are permitted to an Israelite. Therefore, one sometimes buys silver crosses, since the gentile has decommissioned them.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Avodah Zarah</i>, 52a.</i>
“<i>You shall not bring an abhorrent thing into your house</i>” [7:26]. From here we learn that one should not rent a house to a gentile in the <i>land of Israel</i>, since the gentile places his foreign god in the house. Our rabbis write that <i>outside the land of Israel</i> it is permitted to rent one’s house to a gentile. So writes <i>Rabbenu Hananel</i> and some other rabbis. However, a righteous person does not rent his house to a gentile even <i>outside the land of Israel.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Deuteronomy, 7:26.</i>
“<i>All the Instruction that I enjoin upon you</i>” [8:1]. From here we learn that each person should see to it that they do it completely, when they fulfill a commandment. We find concerning <i>Moses Our Teacher</i> that he fulfilled a commandment and brought the bones of <i>Joseph the Righteous</i> out of Egypt, into the wilderness, to take them to the <i>land of Israel.</i> He did not complete the fulfillment of the commandment, and did not bring him all the way to the <i>land of Israel.</i> Afterwards, the Israelites carried the bones into the <i>land of Israel.</i> Thus, the <i>Torah</i> wrote about the Israelites, that they had fulfilled the <i>commandment</i>, as if the <i>Israelites</i> had fulfilled the <i>commandment</i> alone, and not Moses.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Deuteronomy, 8:1.</i>
“<i>He subjected you to the hardship of hunger and then gave you manna to eat</i>” [8:3]. The verse shows us that the <i>manna</i> was given to Israel. Whoever ate it became smart and received a clear intelligence. Therefore, the verse says that it made you hungry, because you had previously digested bread from the earth and afterwards you ate bread from heaven. This was different bread. This bread caused them to receive greater intelligence and they were able to cleave to the Shekhinah.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Deuteronomy, 8:3.</i>
“<i>The clothes upon you did not wear out</i>” [8:4]. The clothes of the Israelites did not rot for forty years. This was a great miracle, to wear the same shirt for forty years. Nowadays, when a person wears a shirt for <i>thirty days</i>, he has troubles. How much more so for forty years? The Holy One caused a good wind to blow and it caused all the clothes to be new and it did not get sweaty. <i>Rabbi Eliezer</i> asked <i>Rabbi Simeon:</i> with what did the Holy One clothe the Israelites in the desert? He responded: with silk garments that the angels clothed the Israelites. If someone was small, the garments grew with him, so that it fit properly even when he was grown. They did not smell from sweat. The <i>well</i> caused good vegetation to grow and they were fragrant from one end of the world to the other end. The Israelites wafted the smoke from this vegetation over themselves and no sweat was smelled from them, as the verse says, “<i>He makes me lie down in green pastures</i>” [Psalms, 23:2]. King Solomon also said, “<i>the scent of your robes is like the scent of Lebanon</i>” [Song of Songs, 4:11]. This means, the scent of your clothes is as fragrant as good <i>incense.</i> Your feet were not swollen. Some sages say that the Levites who carried the <i>Holy Ark</i> in the desert went barefoot, without shoes. Nonetheless, their feet were not swollen. Some sages say that the Israelites also went barefoot, since the soles of their shoes rotted, and yet their feet were not swollen.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Deuteronomy, 8:4.</i>
“<i>The Lord your God disciplines you</i>” [8:5]. The Holy One punished you by not giving you bread at one time, but every day you had to wait for bread from heaven.
With this, the Holy One accustomed you that you should look to the Almighty God. <i>Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Ashi</i> argued with each other. One said that it is not the same. The one who has bread at one time in his house, or when he does not. The one who does not have cannot become sated immediately. The other one said: it is not the same when one sees what one eats, or the one who does not see what he eats. <i>Rabbi Joseph</i> said: from here we learn that a blind person cannot be immediately sated, even if he eats much. <i>Abbaye</i> said: The one who has a meal to eat should eat it during the day and not at night.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, <i>Ekev</i>, <i>Remez</i>, 850.</i>
“<i>A land where you may eat food without stint</i>” [8:9]. God said: you will have enough bread in the land. Our sages say that this verse shows us that the sages in the land of Israel have purer intelligence than the sages in other lands, since the air of the land of Israel is purer and makes the people who live in the land of Israel smarter so that they can understand the Torah better. Therefore, the verse said, you will have a land in which you will have enough bread. He means with this that the Torah is called bread. Just as one cannot live without bread, so one can also not be without Torah. Afterwards, the Torah praises that in the land of Israel you will have enough iron and enough copper, since iron and copper are necessary for all sorts of vessels. However, silver and gold are not necessary. Therefore, the verse does not praise the land for its silver and gold.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Deuteronomy, 8:9.</i>
“<i>Give thanks to the Lord your God</i>” [8:10]. The verse teaches us that someone who benefits from something in this world and eats something or drinks something; he must first recite a blessing. He shows with the blessing that God has given this as sustenance for the person. However, the one who eats and drinks something without a blessing, it is like he steals something from the Holy One. The person who does not recite a blessing brings hunger into the world.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Deuteronomy, 8:10.</i>
“<i>Beware lest your heart grow haughty and you forget</i>” [8:14]. This verse shows us that when the person is rich and he has everything, he becomes arrogant and forgets the Holy One. He says: my intelligence made this that I am so rich and my constellation in heaven made this. Therefore, the verse wrote, “<i>remember that it is the Lord your God</i>” [8:18]. This means, remember that it is God that gave you everything and not your wisdom or your constellation.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Deuteronomy, 8:18.</i>
“<i>At the end of those forty days</i>” [9:11]. From here we learn that the Israelites made the Golden Calf on the same day that they received the Tablets. As soon as Moses saw that they were making the Golden Calf, he broke the Tablets. He said: it is better to break them. Thus, the Holy One will not punish them so severely that they made the Golden Calf, since they did not have the Tablets and did not have the Torah. Thus, the sin of the Golden Calf was not so great. As soon Moses saw the Golden Calf, he ran away with the Tablets. The Israelite elders ran after him and began to tear the Tablets from Moses, but Moses was stronger than all the elders, and the tablets remained in Moses’ hands. Moses looked at the Tablets and the letters flew up to heaven. The tablets immediately became very heavy in Moses’ hands, because the letters had left. Moses could not hold them because of the heaviness. Thus, Moses let them fall and they were broken. The Holy One showed Moses that he should carve out the tablets from good precious stones that were under the <i>Throne of Glory.</i> The Holy One said: you should carve the Tablets and I will write on the Tablets.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">J. <i>Ta</i>’<i>anit</i>, 4.8.</i>
“<i>The Lord was angry enough with Aaron</i>” [9:20]. The Holy One wanted to kill the four children of Aaron because he had made the Golden Calf, but Moses prayed. Thus, only two of Aaron’s children died, and two remained alive. Even though Aaron did not intend to make a foreign god, but he made the Golden Calf. He only wanted to calm Israel for a while. However, in any event it was a <i>desecration of God</i>’<i>s name</i> to make a foreign god, and he caused all of Israel to sin. The Holy One is more punctilious with the righteous; even over a small sin He punished the righteous greatly.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Deuteronomy, 9:20.</i>
“<i>Aaron died there</i>” [10:6]. The verse that Aaron died was written near the verse where the Tablets were broken, since the Torah compares one to the other. For the Holy One does not like that the righteous should die, just like the Holy One did not like that the Tablets were broken.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Deuteronomy, 10:7.</i>
“<i>At that time the Lord set apart the tribe of Levi</i>” [10:8].

“<i>And now, O Israel, what does the Lord your God demand of you? Only this: to revere the Lord your God</i>” [10:12]. The verse teaches us that the Holy One desires to forgive the person, if only he would repent for his sins. Thus said God: even though you worshiped foreign gods, yet only repent and fear God. The verse teaches us that everything is in the hands of God and the person should fear God. This is in the person’s hands. The person has the power; he can fear or not. Therefore, the person should reflect and be pious and fear God. Charity is the greatest commandment. Our sages give a parable. A person was taken before the king to stand in judgment. That person has three good friends who always helped him. Now that he has been taken before the king, he comes to his best friend and asks him to go with him to the king. He responds: I will not even take a step with you. He goes to the next one. He responds: I will go with you to the door. He comes to the third one. He responds: I will go with you to the room of the king, but I will not speak for you. The person remembers an ordinary friend, whom he never considered important. He comes to him and says to him: go with me. He responds: you have always considered me as nothing. Yet, I will speak for you before the king and I will save you from death, and he helps him. So too, when the person dies, he has a friend who was the one he loved most. This is money; it does not accompany him for one step. The second friends are his family, his wife and children. They go with him to the grave. The shroud that he wears, they go with him into the grave before <i>the king, the Holy One.</i> However, they do not speak for him and they cannot help him. However, the friend he considered insignificant, the commandments he fulfilled and his charity. They go with him to the judgment before the Holy One and speak for him and they save him from Gehenna, as the verse says, “<i>charity saves from death</i>” [Proverbs, 11:4]. Our sages say that there was a communal leader who was called <i>Nabal of Carmel.</i> He was very wealthy, but did not want to give anything to a poor person. Therefore, the Holy One sent him an <i>unnatural death.</i> Our sages learn from the verse, “<i>what does the Lord your God demand of you?</i>” [10:12]. That the person should make one hundred blessings every day. <i>King David</i> made one hundred blessings every day, since one hundred people died every day. Therefore, they made one hundred blessings.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Ibn Shuaib, <i>Derashot</i>, II: 440–441.</i>
“<i>Who shows no favor</i>” [10:17]. The Holy One does not <i>favor</i> anyone, not even the most righteous person with regard to the most insignificant transgression. He punishes him immediately. He takes no <i>bribes</i>, that the Holy One should say the righteous one has fulfilled a thousand commandments and one transgression. I will let it pass, no. The Holy One pays the righteous person for his transgression. He also pays him in full for the commandments he has fulfilled, and he does not abrogate the positive commandments because of the transgression.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Deuteronomy, 10:17.</i> The Holy One does <i>justice for widows and orphans</i>, even though the Holy One is very important and mighty.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Deuteronomy, 10:18.</i>
“<i>Serving Him with all your heart</i>” [11:13]. Our sages say that the verse teaches us regarding prayer, that the essence of prayer is with the heart and good thoughts to the Holy One. They know that prayer abrogates the <i>evil decrees.</i> When someone cannot have children, because his star shows that he cannot have children; he can change his star through prayer, as we find concerning Isaac. He prayed and Rebecca became pregnant and had children. When our sages organized the prayers, they did not write any extraneous words.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Deuteronomy, 11:13.</i>
However, the prayer is not everything; one should not shout aloud, but one should pray quietly, as we find regarding <i>Hannah.</i> She prayed silently in the <i>Temple</i>, but her lips moved. The <i>high priest</i> thought that she was drunk. Thus, the high priest said to her: what are you doing here, you drunken woman? She responded: you are no true prophet, I am praying. The <i>priest</i> immediately <i>said to Hannah:</i> you should be blessed, God will accept your prayer and you will have a son this year.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">I Samuel, 1:9–17.</i> From here we learn that one should not shout during prayers, and women in particular, since they cause that others cannot pray with proper <i>intention.</i>
Women commit another sin when they shout during their prayers. The men hear their voice and have evil thoughts about that woman. Our sages say that when a strange man hears the voice of a woman, it is as if he had sexual relations with her.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Berakhot</i>, 24a.</i>
Therefore, the person should stand with humility, resignation and fear and should take as an example as if the person was standing before a <i>king of flesh and blood.</i> He might tremble and fear, <i>how much more so before the Holy One, the King of Kings.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">M. <i>Berakhot</i>, 5.1.</i>
As soon as the person wakes up, he should praise the Holy One that he returned his soul to him, since at night when the person sleeps, the soul goes up to heaven. When he wakes up, the Holy One returns the soul to him. The person should know that the soul is clean before the Holy One. It came back as soon as he awoke. The soul is very happy and he should note that he is clean before the Holy One. Sometimes, the person wakes up and is very sad and depressed. He does not know what is wrong with him. He should know that his soul was not clean before the Holy One that night.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">This is very much like the <i>Mode Ani</i> prayer that is first mentioned in Moshe ibn Machir’s <i>Sefer Seder ha-Yom</i>, Venice, 1599.</i>
Since we are discussing prayer, we will write a little more about it. Each person should be warned that he should know where he should bow down. He should not be like a fool who bows down every minute. Therefore, he should know that he is obligated to bow when he begins the <i>Amidah prayer</i> [<i>shemoneh esreh</i>]. The second time he should bow is at the shield of Abraham [<i>magen Avraham</i>]. The third time he should bow is when he comes to we thank you [<i>modim</i>]. The fourth time is when he says to whom it is fitting to give thanks [<i>ha-tov shimkha u-lekha naeh le-hodot</i>]. The fifth time is when one ends author of peace [<i>oseh ha-shalom</i>]. He should move his left foot first. He should step back three steps and then he should bow. Each person should be warned that he should not bow more than is written.

“<i>You shall gather in your new grain and wine and oil</i>” [11:14]. You shall gather in your grain and wine and oil.

“<i>I will also provide grass</i>” [11:15]. The Torah wrote that God makes the vegetation grow and all the grain, not as the nations of the world say that everything grows because of the constellations and stars. Therefore, the Torah wrote, “<i>I will also provide</i>,” and I will give vegetation. Our sages said: one should first feed the animals, before one eats. Therefore, the Torah wrote, “<i>I will also provide grass in the fields for your cattle</i>” [11:15]. This means, I will give vegetation to your cattle and afterwards the Torah writes, “<i>you shall eat</i>” [11:15]. This means, you shall eat afterwards.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Deuteronomy, 11:15.</i>
“<i>Take care not to be lured away</i>” [11:16]. Be warned that I do not lure you to do evil. Our sages said: when a person is rich, he is very arrogant in his heart and this leads him to do evil.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Deuteronomy, 11:16.</i>
Therefore also “<i>for the Lord</i>’<i>s anger will flare up against you, and He will shut up the skies so that there will be no rain</i>” [11:17]. This means, when you will be evil, then I will give no rain. The Talmud in [tractate] Ta’anit writes: <i>Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Joshua</i> argued over from where the rain comes. <i>Rabbi Eliezer</i> said: the rain comes from the sea that is called the <i>Ocean.</i> The Holy One sends clouds and they drink from this sea and carry water to the whole world, as the verse says, “<i>but a flow would well up from the ground and water</i>” [Genesis, 2:6]. This means, a cloud rises from the earth and waters the earth. <i>Rabbi Joshua</i> said: the rains come from the waters that are in heaven <i>from the six days of creation. Rabbenu Bahya</i> writes: the two rabbis were both correct. Sometimes, rain comes from heaven and sometimes rain comes from the <i>Ocean.</i> The rain that comes from the Ocean is called rain [<i>geshem</i>] and the rains that come from heaven are called <i>geshem</i> and <i>matar</i> [synonyms for rain]. The rain that comes from the sea makes the earth pregnant, like a woman who is a widow and becomes pregnant from strange men. Therefore, the blessing is not entirely good from the rain from the sea. However, the rain that comes from heavenly water is like a woman who becomes pregnant from her husband. The blessing from that rain is very good, as the verse says, “<i>the Lord will open for you His bounteous store, the heavens</i>” [Deuteronomy, 28:12]. This means, God will open for you His treasury of goods from heaven.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Deuteronomy, 11:17.</i>

“<i>If, then, you faithfully keep</i>” [11:22].

The verse teaches us that the person should rely on the Holy One and should not fear any person, but fear God on whom he trusts. The Holy One protects from all troubles, as the verse says, “<i>he who trusts in the Lord shall be safeguarded</i>” [Proverbs, 29:25]. This means, the one who relies on God will be strengthened and the one who keeps the commandments and goes to the synagogue evening and morning, he will live long. We find a story in <i>Sefer Yelamdenu.</i> A woman who was very old came before <i>Rabbi Yose son of Halafta.</i> She said to him: I am very old and my life is very disgusting. I cannot eat or drink or sleep. I would gladly die. <i>Rabbi Yose</i> said to her: what commandments were you accustomed to fulfill in your day. The woman said: I was one of the first to go to the synagogue, evening and morning. <i>Rabbi Yose</i> said to her: do not go to the synagogue for three days. The woman did so, and did not go to the synagogue for three days. The woman became sick on the third day and died. King Solomon said about this, it is well for the person who goes to the synagogue; he will find long life.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, <i>Ekev</i>, <i>Remez</i>, 871.</i>

“<i>See, this day I set before you blessing and curse</i>” [11:26]. <i>King Solomon, of blessed memory</i>, said: How evil is the attribute of indolence and laziness for the one who has it. The one who has the attribute of indolence has great damage in many ways. The one who is indolent in his house, when a beam breaks and he does not have it repaired immediately, his whole house might collapse. When someone is indolent with his body, and he does not buy food at the appropriate time, when it is plentiful, later he must pay double for it. Sometimes, he cannot find any food and must die of hunger. When someone is indolent with his soul, and does not fulfill commandments, he comes to Gehenna in the end. The person’s soul is compared to a field. Sometimes one finds a field that is easy to plow and things grow easily on it. Sometimes, one finds a field that is difficult to plow and things do not grow easily on it, yet one does what one can, and plows the difficult field, expecting that something will grow from it, even if it is difficult for him. So too it is with people. One finds that some people follow their desires to excess, day and night, and are not punished, and do not want to study Torah. However, when he will take pains, and wants to accustom himself to commandments and Torah, he will come into it and become pious. The one who does not become accustomed to the commandments and the Torah, will not have anything in the next world, since the person has the power to be good or evil. Therefore, the Torah portion begins.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, <i>Re</i>’<i>eh</i>, Introduction.</i>
“<i>See, this day I set before you blessing and curse</i>” [11:26]. This means, see and be warned about it. I say to you: I give you the good path and the evil path. You can go in which way you want. However, I say that you should go in the good path, as the verse says, “<i>choose life</i>” [Deuteronomy, 30:19]. This means, you should choose the good path. If the Holy One in heaven had commanded that the person should be pious or evil, then the person would have no transgression when he was evil, since God had decreed that he must be evil. Similarly, if the Holy One had decreed upon the person that he must be pious, it would be no novelty that the person is pious. Therefore, this cannot be, but the person has the ability to be good or bad. The person must know this and should always have before him that he can do what he wants.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Deuteronomy, 11:26.</i>
“<i>But look only to the site that the Lord your God will choose</i>” [12:5]. The Holy One said that you should bring no sacrifice except in the city where God will show you. For three reasons, the Torah did not explicitly write how this place where one should bring the sacrifice is called, <i>Mount Moriah or Jerusalem.</i> If the Torah had explicitly written the place, the nations would have fought with each other. Each one would have wanted to have that place, because it was holy, and would have killed each other because of it. Secondly, if the nations knew that Israel would bring sacrifices to Jerusalem, they would have destroyed and devastated it. Third, if Israel had known that Jerusalem was a holy place, they would have argued with each other. Each one would have wanted this holy place, just like they argued in the incident of Korah; each one wanted to be a priest. Therefore, even Israel did not know the place where the sacrifices would be brought, and how much more so the gentiles.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Deuteronomy, 12:5.</i>
“<i>When the Lord enlarges your territory</i>” [12:20]. <i>Rabbi Abahu</i> said: it is written that you should not forget the Levite, to give him food and what he needs. Thus, the Holy One will expand your boundaries, and you will become rich. Concerning this, the verse said, “<i>a man</i>’<i>s gift eases his way</i>” [Proverbs, 18:16]. This means, that which the person gives, causes that God expands his boundaries. A story occurred with <i>Rabbi Eliezer</i>, <i>Rabbi Joshua</i>, and <i>Rabbi Akiva.</i> They came to a Jew who was pious and had become impoverished. He saw the rabbis coming to his house and he did not have anything to honor them with, and he was very sad. His wife came and asked him, why are you sad? He said: how should I not be sad? I have nothing with which to honor these good rabbis. His wife was very righteous, and she said: we still have a field left. Sell half the field quickly and we will honor the good <i>rabbis.</i> He immediately sold the half field and gave the <i>rabbis</i> to eat and drink. The <i>rabbis</i> blessed that good man that God should give him double. The rabbis went home and he went to plow the half field. The earth opened under the feet of his ox, and the ox broke its foot in the hole. The good man wanted to pull the ox out, and the Holy One showed him a <i>treasure</i> with <i>gold and silver</i> in the hole. He took the silver and gold and became rich. The rabbis came again to the <i>householder</i> and asked him, how is it going? He responded: your blessing came true and <i>the rabbis honored him.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Re’eh, <i>Remez</i>, 884.</i>
<i>Bahya</i> writes a parable. Somebody says to his friend, lend me a gulden. He responds: I do not know you. He says: trust me once. He gives it to him and he repays him quickly. The <i>rich man</i> says to him: take as much as you want, twenty or thirty gulden. So too is the Holy One. He tests the person and makes him rich. If he keeps his word and repays it, that he helps the poor and feeds them from what God had given him, then the <i>Holy One gives him double.</i> gives him double. The Holy One said: I give a person money so that he should give to the poor. The person who is wealthy is like the <i>communal official</i> who should distribute what God has given him. He should remember, this money is not mine, but the Holy One is the owner of these goods, and has given it to people for a while. Therefore, he should not boast, as the verse says, “<i>let the rich man glory in his riches</i>” [Jeremiah, 9:22]. This means that he should not boast about his wealth, that he would say, this wealth is mine.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">I was not able to find this in Bahya’s commentary. However, the core of the parable is found in <i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Re’eh, <i>Remez</i>, 884, immediately following the previous passage.</i>
“<i>When the Lord enlarges your territory, and you say, I shall eat some meat</i>” [12:20]. The Torah teaches us that when the person is rich, he may eat meat. He should not desire it except when things are good for him. The Talmud in [tractate] <i>Hullin</i> said: <i>Rabbi Eleazar son of Azariah</i> said: if a person has one gulden, he should eat vegetables. If he has a hundred gulden, he may eat meat every day. However, in any event when he cannot afford it, <i>for the honor of the Sabbath</i> he should always eat good meat. <i>Rab</i> said: concerning the words of <i>Rabbi Eleazar</i>, we must defer to him regarding the eating of meat. <i>Rabbi Yohanan</i> came and said: I believe what the good rabbi said. He is healthy and strong. He can eat something ordinary when there is no meat. However, when we have a penny, I and my like should eat meat, so that we can become strong. Rabbi Nachman said: I and my like, even if we have no money, we should borrow and eat in order to become strong in God’s service.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Hullin</i>, 84a.</i>
“<i>But make sure that you do not partake of the blood</i>” [12:23]. The Torah wrote concerning this, that one is warned not eat blood. The Holy One will give him much good and also to his children, as the verse says here, “<i>thus it will go well with you and with your descendants after you</i>” [12:28]. Our sages learn from here the reward for the commandments. They say: the Holy One gives a good reward when the person does not eat blood. No person has a desire for this, since it is very disgusting to eat blood. Nonetheless, God gives him a good reward. How much more so, when a person does not engage in illicit sex or does not steal. People desire these things much more. Thus, the Holy One will give him a great reward.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Deuteronomy, 12:28.</i>
“<i>Do not inquire about their gods, saying, how did those nations worship their gods</i>” [12:30]. The Torah teaches us that Israel should not say, we will worship God like the nations worship their foreign gods, with beautiful worship. The nations have chosen everything that God, <i>blessed be His name</i>, hates. They do this for their foreign gods, as the verse says, “<i>because its speech is seductive to him till his iniquity be found out and he be hated</i>” [Psalms, 36:3]. This means, the evildoers do everything that the Holy One hates and will anger God. Therefore, the verse says here that the nations can do no worse against the Holy One than that they burn their children before their foreign gods. <i>Rabbi Akiva</i> said: I saw a gentile who burned his father alive for the foreign god. How can anybody anger God more than to burn a person who was created for the person’s sake?<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Deuteronomy, 12:29.</i>
“<i>When the Lord your God has cut down before you the nations</i>” [12:29]. <i>Rabbi Tanhuma</i> writes: A parable. A king plants a vineyard in his field. There are tall fir trees in that field, and there were also thorns. The king went and cut down the fir trees and allowed the thorns to remain. The servants said to the king, what did you do? You chopped down the good trees and you allowed the thorns that tore our clothes to remain in the garden. The king responded: if I had allowed the fir trees to remain, with what would I have protected the garden? This way I have made a strong fence from the fir trees. So too Israel are protected by the Holy One. He brought Israel into the land of Israel and chopped down the fir trees. These are the nations of the world. He allowed the children of the nations of the world to live, expecting that Israel will keep the Torah. If, heaven forbid, they will not keep the Torah, then these children will persecute them. However, if Israel will keep the Torah, then the Holy One will burn the nations of the world, their thorns.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanhuma</i>, <i>Re</i>’<i>eh</i>, 9.</i>
It is written in <i>Sefer Yelamdenu</i> that when the nations of the world dwelled in the land of Israel, the Israelites wandered in the wilderness. However, when God destroyed the nations of the world, Israel came to their rest. The Holy One sometimes punishes the nations of the world, expecting that Israel should fear and should repent for their sins. The nations of the world said before the Holy One, your children, Israel, have committed sins, and we were punished. The Holy One responded: your thousands should be destroyed for the sake of Israel, but allow Israel to be pious. I will eliminate you from the world for the sake of Israel. So too, in the days of the Messiah, the verse says, “<i>the future of the wicked shall be cut off</i>” [Psalms, 37:38]. This means, the tent of the wicked will be destroyed. Near it is written, “<i>the deliverance of the righteous comes from the Lord</i>” [Psalms, 37:39]. The help for the righteous is from God, very soon. Therefore, the person should remember the good that the Holy One does, and the Holy One wants that he should repent and should think about being pious.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Re’eh, <i>Remez</i>, 885.</i>
“<i>If there appears among you a prophet</i>” [13:2]. When a prophet will arise and will say that he is a prophet from God, and has spoken with God, and will show you signs in heaven or signs on the earth, do not follow him when he wants to dissuade you from worshiping God, but you should worship a constellation or some foreign god, do not follow him. When he gives you great signs and wonders, he may have done this by magic. However, when a prophet says to you that you should fulfill the commandments, since the Holy One wants to have them, then you may follow him, since he acted as a prophet and is still pious and does not follow his desires. We accept the assumption that the person is pious, as we find regarding Elijah who brought sacrifices outside of Jerusalem, where God had forbidden bringing sacrifices. Yet, Israel followed him, because his intention was to strengthen belief in God. He showed the false prophets that what they believed was wrong. We also find concerning Joshua that he conquered the city of Jericho on the holy Sabbath, all of Israel desecrated the Sabbath and followed Joshua. Joshua did all this at one time, but heaven forbid that he had the intention to desecrate the Sabbath. Therefore, Israel made everything that was in the city of Jericho sacred to the Temple, and had no benefit from that city, because it had been conquered on the Sabbath. This is all when the prophet says that God ordered this to be done, and nothing more should be done. At that time you may believe him. When he has not been previously pious and a shout comes, as if from heaven, that says that one should not fulfill the commandment, then one should not listen to the shout, as we find in the Talmud, [tractate] Baba Mezia. A voice came from heaven into the study house. <i>Rabbi Joshua</i> said: we do not listen to the voice, since the Holy One gave us the Torah once on Mount Sinai. It is written that which the majority of the sages want, so should it remain. Therefore, we will not listen to the heavenly voice. When a prophet says that much evil will come into the world, heaven forbid, it will happen that it does not occur as the prophet said. Then you will consider that prophet to be a false prophet. Then you do not do rightly, since what the prophet had certainly heard from the Holy One was that much evil would come, but the Holy One is compassionate. When the people repent, then the Holy One does not bring evil into the world. Even though He had decreed an evil decree, yet it does not come when the people are pious. The Holy One <i>abrogates the decree</i>, as we find with regard to Jonah the prophet. He said about the city of <i>Nineveh</i> that it would be destroyed after forty days. However, because they repented, the Holy One did not destroy the city.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Deuteronomy, 13:2, 6.</i>
“<i>If your brother, your own mother</i>’<i>s son, entices you secretly</i>” [13:7]. If your brother, who was with you in your mother’s womb, incites you to worship foreign gods, do not listen to him. The verse teaches us that even such a brother, who is on your mother’s side and will not inherit, yet do not listen to him. How much more so, when he is your brother on your father’s side, he hates you because of the inheritance and therefore do not listen to him.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Deuteronomy, 13:7.</i>
“<i>Whom neither you nor your fathers have experienced</i>” [13:7]. The evildoer convinces his friend to worship a foreign god that he does not know, and his father also did not know. It is known that he believes in the Holy One. This is divided into two parts. The first is that the person believes in the Holy One in the way that his father instructed him, that God is one. However, this belief is good, but it is not completely the proper belief. When a gentile will want to dissuade him, he can quickly dissuade him, heaven forbid, since he believes in wisdom and intellect. It is a parable. Many blind people follow one another and one holds on to the other one. A seeing person goes first and shows the way and they hold on to the person who can see and who shows them the right way. However, when he goes alone, he stumbles and falls. Similarly here, he believes because he heard it from his parents, they way they received it, back to Moses Our Teacher. When the person wants to believe in this way, without wisdom, when the gentile who wants to dissuade him, they will soon dissuade him, just like the blind person, when he goes alone, he stumbles and falls. However when he believes with intellect, then he cannot be easily dissuaded, since he can refute each gentile. Therefore, each person should be warned that he should believe what his parents told him, and should also think about God himself, that He is one. It is not enough that he should believe what his father or his teacher said. He must apply his wisdom and his intellect to this, that God is one. Our sages said: study Torah so that you will be able to answer the gentile and the unbeliever. Therefore, the verse says here, “<i>Whom neither you nor your fathers have experienced</i>” [13:7]. This means, the evildoer will dissuade from God, and that you should serve an idol that you do not know with your intellect, and have not heard it mentioned by your parents. Therefore, do not listen to him.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Deuteronomy, 13:7.</i>
“<i>You shall investigate and inquire</i>” [13:15]. The verse shows us that one should properly question the witnesses. One should not quickly kill a person because of witnesses, but one should first ask the witnesses in which sabbatical cycle, what day of the month, what day and what hour of the day, in what place, and type of garment was he wearing white or red.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Deuteronomy, 13:15.</i>
“<i>You are children of the Lord your God</i>” [14:1]. The Torah wrote this portion about those who worship foreign gods. It shows us that the Holy One said to Israel: you are children of God. Therefore, no person should have pity when his father is killed because of worship of a foreign god. He should not mourn him, because he worshiped foreign gods.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Deuteronomy, 14:1.</i>
“<i>You shall not gash yourself</i>” [14:1]. You should not gash yourself for a <i>corpse</i>, like the nations used to do, to tear their hair out when they had a <i>death.</i> The nations think that the world is primary, and when the person leaves the world, they say that he is lost. Therefore, they cry and wail very much over a <i>corpse.</i> Therefore, our Torah comes and tells us, you are children of God. You should not gash yourself and wail over a <i>corpse</i>, since the <i>world to come</i> is prepared for you. Therefore, it is better for the person when he dies; he comes to eternal life. Therefore, the verse says, “<i>You are children of the Lord your God</i>” [14:1]. When you cleave to the Holy One, you will come into the holy world, which is the world to come.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Deuteronomy, 14:1.</i>
“<i>You shall no boil a kid in its mother</i>’<i>s milk</i>” [14:21]. You should not boil meat with milk. The Torah wrote three times that you should not boil meat with milk. This shows us the meaning of not boiling meat with milk. Even when you do not want to eat it, you would boil it for a gentile and the people were not warned about this. They boil meat with milk for gentiles in their homes. The second thing is, one should not eat meat with milk. The third is, one should have no benefit when one boils meat with milk, if one wanted to sell it to a gentile. He should not even give it to his dog.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Deuteronomy, 14:21.</i>
“<i>You shall set aside a tenth part</i>” [14:22]. When you have given a tenth to the Levite, go and give yourself a tenth and take it to Jerusalem and eat it there. <i>Rabbi Yohanan</i> said in the <i>Talmud,</i> [tractate] <i>Ta</i>’<i>anit:</i> Give a tenth expecting that you should become rich. Even though one should not test the Holy One when he will give the tenth, but if he will give the tenth so that God should make him rich, then he will be testing God. However, our sages said: the Torah told us to test God with the tenth and with giving charity, as the verse says, “<i>put Me to the test</i>” [Malachi, 3:10]. This means, God said, test me with charity and giving tithes, if I will not give you double and ten times as much. The custom is that when somebody has a field and asks a friend to plow it, sow and cut it, he will give him a third or a quarter. The Holy One brings the rain and makes the grain grow and gives good dew, and desires no more than a tenth. A story occurred to someone who gave a tenth from his field every year; a hundred measures since a thousand measures of grain grew on his field every year. He left a will for his son; dear son, give the tithe properly. The first year the son gave one hundred measures, and he said: what a great amount I must give as a tithe, and the second year he only gave ninety measures. The third year he gave eighty measures and every year the field grew ten measures less every year than it used to grow, until the field grew no more than one hundred measures, just like he used to give as a <i>tithe.</i> His relatives came to him in beautiful clothes. He said to them: you rejoice over my disaster. They said: heaven forbid, we are rejoicing that you have become a priest. Previously, you were the <i>owner</i> of the field and now you are a priest. You take a tithe and the Holy One is the <i>owner</i> of the field. Therefore, Moses said: give a tenth, expecting that you should be <i>worthy</i> to give tithes in the future and you will remain wealthy.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Deuteronomy, 14:23.</i>
“<i>The yield of your sowing that is brought from the field</i>” [14:22]. Our sages said: if you will <i>tithe</i> properly, then you will sow the field and it will grow. However, if you will not properly <i>tithe and give charity</i>, then the <i>evil Esau</i> will come and take away that which grows. Concerning him it is written, “<i>Esau came in from the field</i>” [Genesis, 25:29], and here, concerning the <i>tithe</i>, it is written, “<i>that is brought from the field.</i>” We used to say, the one who will not give to Jacob, will give to Esau.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Deuteronomy, 14:23.</i>
“<i>The tithes of your new grain and wine</i>” [14:23]. The Holy One said to Israel: if you will give <i>tithes</i>, the grain is called your grain. However, if you will not give <i>tithes</i>, then the grain will be Mine, as the verse says, “<i>I will take back My new grain in its time and My new wine in its season</i>” [Hosea, 2:11]. This means, I will take My grain and My new wine, said God.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Deuteronomy, 14:23.</i>
“<i>Do not harden your heart</i>” [15:7]. When a poor person asks you, speak good words with him and you should not shout at him. Concerning this, <i>King Solomon</i> said, “<i>riches are ransom for a man</i>’<i>s life, the poor never heard a reproof</i>” [Proverbs, 13:8]. This means, the <i>wealth</i> is an <i>expiation</i> for the person, and he remains wealthy when the <i>poor person</i> does not hear shouting from the <i>communal leader</i>, but he gives with kind words. <i>Rabbi Yannai</i> saw how a <i>communal leader</i> deliberately gave a <i>poor person</i> money in the street before all the people. Rabbi Yannai said: it would have been much better that you would not have given it to him, since you have <i>embarrassed</i> him.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Hagigah</i>, 5a.</i> Our sages said: whoever does not give <i>charity</i>, is like someone who worshiped foreign gods, as the Talmud said in [tractate] <i>Baba Bathra.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Baba Bathra</i>, 10a.</i>
If you want to ask why the person who does not give charity, it is like he has worshiped idols? The <i>Zeror ha-Mor</i> writes. It is like he has worshiped foreign gods, since the person who does not give <i>charity</i> to the poor person said: I have exerted myself with my <i>wisdom</i> day and night and accumulated my wealth. How should I give it away? Therefore, our sages say that the person who talks like this, is like one who worshiped idols. He does not believe in the Holy One, who has given him the wealth. He thinks that his wisdom accomplished everything, and not the Holy One. Therefore, it is like he had denied God. Therefore, you should not harden your heart, but you should give him kind words when you do no have any money. However, if you do have money, “<i>do not shut your hand</i>” [15:7]. Do not close your hand and give him.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Zeror ha-Mor, Deuteronomy, 15:7, 9.</i>
There are many poor people who might die before they might take charity. Therefore, the Torah wrote shortly afterwards, “<i>and lend him</i>” [15:8]. You should lend him money and you should not demand it of him.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Deuteronomy, 15:8.</i>
If the person would think, the Holy One has ordered me to rest on the seventh year. One should not plow and not sow, so where would I have enough to eat, and how should I give to the poor person? Therefore, the Torah wrote here, “<i>beware lest you harbor the base thought, the seventh year is approaching</i>” [15:9]. This means, be warned not to speak against the sabbatical year, like when I told you that you should give to the poor. I can <i>increase</i> it all for you. However, when you will speak ill of the <i>sabbatical year</i>, “<i>you will incur guilt</i>” [15:9]. Thus, the commandment of the <i>sabbatical year</i> will become for you a sin, since the <i>sabbatical year</i> will make you sin and you will come to the sin through the positive commandment. “<i>Give to him readily</i>” [15:10]. That is to say, the Torah wrote that one should give charity many times. It is better to give a penny a hundred times to a poor person than to give a hundred pennies at one time. In this way the person will accustom himself to give often, and he will be accustomed to give. “<i>For in return</i>” [15:10]. A wheel rotates in heaven with regard to people.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">This interpretation is based on a play of words. The verse says <i>biglal</i> [for/because], which is reinterpreted as <i>galgal</i>, a wheel.</i> Today he is rich; tomorrow the other person is rich. Therefore, the person should be warned to give to the poor, since the rich person causes the poor person’s poverty. The wealthy one is at the <i>top</i> of the wheel above in heaven and therefore, the poor person is at the <i>bottom</i> of the wheel, as the verse says, “<i>for there will never cease to be needy ones in your land</i>” [15:11]. This means, the poor person will not disappear since the <i>wheel</i> turns. Therefore, the wealthy person should be warned to give to the poor, so that the Holy One should not lower him, and raise the poor person, since the Holy One can quickly change one’s luck. One should help the poor before they fall completely, as the verse says, “<i>if your kinsman, being in straits, comes under your authority, and you hold him</i>” [Leviticus, 25:35]. This means, when your brother will become poor, help him immediately, before he falls completely. Concerning this, the verse says here, “<i>there shall be no needy among you</i>” [15:4]. This means, before he is poor, you should help him. The word <i>efes</i> means, not. That is to say, when he is not yet a pauper, help him, and see that there should not be any <i>pauper</i> among you, that he should fall very low. So writes the Toldot Yizhak.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Deuteronomy, 15:7–11.</i>
“<i>Lend him support</i>” [15:8]. You should give him enough, but you are not obligated to make him rich. “<i>Whatever he needs</i>” [15:8]. You are obligated to give him what he needs. You are obligated to rent a wagon for him, and even to find a wife for him, if he does not have a wife.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Deuteronomy, 15:8.</i>
“<i>You must open your hand</i>” [15:8]. You are obligated to bring the charity to the poor person to his door, to his house, when he does not want to come. However, in any event, one should see that the poor person should not be shamed, as the Talmud writes in <i>tractate Ketubot. Ravah</i> had packets of money tied to his garment and threw the packets behind himself, so that the poor should take it and not know who threw it at him. <i>Ravah</i> also did not know who had taken it. Thus, the poor person was not shamed. <i>Rabbi Akiva</i> had a poor person near his house. Every Friday he sent money to that poor person with his wife. Once his wife came and said, he does not need it. I heard him shouting in his house, which vessels should we prepare, silver or gold? Therefore, <i>Rabbi Akiva</i>’<i>s</i> wife said: he is a liar; he does not need it. He only makes himself to be a pauper. <i>Rabbi Eliezer</i> said: we will thank the charlatans, the liars, who make themselves poor and are rich. Since we know for certain that there are charlatans, then we committed no sin when sometimes a poor person comes and wants money from us, then I can say that he is a charlatan. Then I have no sin when I do not give him money, because there are charlatans. However, in any event, the person should see what he does and should think about how he should give to the poor person properly.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Ketubot</i>, 67b-68a.</i>
<i>Rabbi Hiyya</i> said to his wife: when a poor person comes to the door, give him bread immediately, expecting that when your children will be poor and will come to the door of people, then it will be given to them. His wife responded: why are you cursing your children and opening your mouth to evil? <i>Rabbi Hiyya</i> responded: it is written, “<i>for in return</i>” [15:10]. This means, give to the poor person because there is a wheel in heaven that makes someone rich today and the other thing tomorrow. Today somebody is poor and tomorrow he is rich, unexpectedly.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Shabbat</i>, 151b.</i>
Our sages also said: how great is charity; with one penny he is worthy to see the Shekhinah, since the Shekhinah appears to the person who gives charity to the poor person, as the verse says, “<i>then I, justified, will behold your face</i>” [Psalms, 17:15]. This means, one should be warned, when one wants to pray, one should first throw some money in the charity box, then the Holy One will appear and his prayer will be accepted.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Baba Bathra</i>, 10a.</i>
“<i>Observe the month of Aviv</i>” [16:1].

“<i>Then you shall observe the Feast of Weeks for the Lord your God, offering your freewill contribution</i>” [16:10]. You should make <i>Shavuot</i> joyous and make the poor rejoice according to your ability. Therefore, the Torah wrote concerning Shavuot more than the other <i>festivals</i> that the person should not say, since Shavuot is not more than one day and Passover is seven days, Sukkot is also seven days, he would think that he does not have to celebrate Shavuot with so much rejoicing. Therefore, the verse says here, you should rejoice on Shavuot and make the poor rejoice. The Holy One said: when you will make four types of poor people rejoice; they are, the <i>Levites</i>, the <i>stranger</i>, the <i>orphan</i>, and the <i>widow.</i> I will make your four rejoice. These are, your son and daughter, your maid and your male servant.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Deuteronomy, 16:10.</i>
“<i>You shall rejoice in your festival</i>” [16:14]. You should rejoice on your festivals. Our sages learn from here that one should not get married on <i>festivals.</i> You should not mix up the joy of the festivals. One should not forget the joy of the festival. The Torah wrote <i>joy</i> with regard to <i>Shavuot</i> and <i>Sukkot</i>, since on Shavuot and Sukkot the grain is ready in the land of Israel. Then he can feed the poor. He can rejoice and make the poor rejoice, but on Passover, the new grain is not ready and the old grain was eaten long ago. Therefore, joy and blessing are not written regarding Passover.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Deuteronomy, 16:14.</i>
The Talmud writes in [tractate <i>Pesahim</i>], <i>chapter ten.</i> The men should rejoice with drinking and the women with beautiful clothes. This is the primary joy of the women and not drinking.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Pesahim</i>, 109a.</i>
On Sukkot the Torah wrote, “<i>you shall have nothing but joy</i>” [16:15]. This shows us that the person wanted to be very joyous and wanted to forget the Holy One, heaven forbid, and in particular because the person has gathered his grain and his wine. He wants to get drunk very much. Therefore, the Torah wrote, “<i>nothing but joy</i>” [16:15]. This means, you should praise God and you should reduce your joy slightly on Sukkot, as the verse says, “<i>serve the Lord in awe; tremble with fright</i>” [Psalms, 2:11]. This means, serve God with joy and be happy with trembling. So writes Rabbenu Bahya.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Deuteronomy, 16:15.</i>

Shoftim

<i>King Solomon</i> said: the verse “<i>her ways are pleasant ways, and all her paths, peaceful</i>” [Proverbs, 3:17]. This means, the ways of the Torah only make joy, and also, the world was only created with peace, since the Holy One had to have peace when he created heaven. He created it out of fire and water. It is known that fire and water cannot exist together. However, the Holy One made <i>peace</i> between them, as the verse says, “<i>He imposes peace in His heights</i>” [Job, 25:2]. The name of the Holy One is peace, as the verse says, “<i>he called it, Adonai-shalom</i>” [Judges, 6:24]. Israel are called peace because they worship the Holy One and received the Torah, which is peace for the body, from the person to the person’s soul. When the person is pious, the Holy One gives him health on his head, as the verse says, “<i>healing for the whole body</i>” [Proverbs, 4:22]. The soul comes to a proper rest through the commandments and Torah, as the verse says, “<i>the teaching of the Lord is perfect, renewing life</i>” [Psalms, 19:8]. This means, the Torah restores the soul to its proper place, and our prayers, which end with peace, just as the sacrifices also end with peace. Also, when they went to war against the nations, they had to first begin with peace, if they wanted to make peace. They did not do anything to the city and even in heaven among the angels one must have peace. The Holy One must make peace between <i>Michael</i> and <i>Gabriel</i>, as the verse says, “<i>dominion and dread are His, he imposes peace in His heights</i>” [Job, 25:2]. Michael is the highest angel and is called <i>dominion</i>, because he rules over all the angels and prays for Israel. Even the dead need peace, as the verse says, “<i>you shall go to your fathers in peace</i>” [Genesis, 15:15]. Therefore, the portion begins with:<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Shoftim, Introduction.</i>
“<i>Magistrates and officials</i>” [16:18]. Just as peace causes the world to stand, so too the world stands on <i>justice.</i> If there were no <i>justice</i>, the world might collapse. One might steal from his friend and kill him. The <i>judges</i> and <i>communal leaders</i> make peace in the world. Therefore, the Torah said: you should make judges in all your cities you judge you properly. Therefore, the Torah wrote that you should make <i>judges</i> near the <i>commandment of the three pilgrim festivals.</i> It shows us that on the three pilgrim festivals and on the holidays, people come to fight over drinking when they are very joyous. Therefore, the Torah ordered that <i>judges</i> be appointed who will see to it that no sins should occur as a result of drinking and excessive rejoicing. Therefore, they should choose judges who do not engage in flattery. There should be three <i>judges</i> so that two will not be able to unite, but the third should balance them. However, he should not <i>judge</i> alone. Even the Holy One did not <i>judge</i> alone, as the verse says, “<i>all the host of heaven standing in attendance</i>” [I Kings, 22:19]. This means, the angels stand on the right side and the left side of the Holy One, to judge the <i>world.</i> There was a tribunal of twentythree men when they had to <i>judge</i> someone <i>liable for the death penalty.</i> They were called, the <i>small Sanhedrin.</i> They were established in every city. Afterwards, seventy-one men were in Jerusalem. They were called, the <i>great Sanhedrin.</i> Their leader was called the <i>president.</i> He sat at the center. It is a great positive commandment to judge properly. When one <i>judges</i> properly on the earth, then the Holy One <i>judges with mercy</i>, above in heaven. <i>Justice</i> is to the Holy One to judge. When the person judges properly, in the place of the Holy One, then the <i>Holy One judges him with mercy.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Deuteronomy, 16:18.</i>
“<i>You shall not judge unfairly</i>” [16:19]. You should be warned to choose judges who will not flatter, and such a judge who knows all the <i>laws</i> and is not an <i>ignoramus.</i> Whoever chooses an <i>ignoramus</i> to be a <i>judge</i>; it is like he gave false judgments. Therefore, he wrote, “<i>you shall not set up a sacred post</i>” [16:21]. This means, you should not plant a linden tree, like the gentiles do near their foreign gods. It wants to teach us that when somebody chooses an <i>ignoramus</i> or someone argumentative to be a <i>judge</i>, it is like he had worshiped a foreign god. Therefore, it is written that you should not place a linden tree near the altar. This shows us that the judge should not be like a linden tree. It is very tall and beautiful. However, it has no fruit and one finds no help from it. There are some <i>judges</i> who are very handsome and appear to be pious, but their heart is false. Therefore, the Torah wrote here, “<i>you shall not set up a sacred post</i>” [16:21]. You should not plant a linden tree near the altar, since the <i>judges</i> sat near the altar.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Deuteronomy, 16:19.</i>
“<i>You shall show no partiality</i>” [16:19]. This teaches us that the <i>judge</i> should not say to the wealthy person, sit down and allows the poor person to remain standing. Thus, he will not be able to properly make his <i>case.</i> You should take no bribes when you want to give a proper judgment, since it is impossible. You must judge falsely when you have taken bribes.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Deuteronomy, 16:19.</i>
“<i>Justice, justice shall you pursue</i>” [16:20]. You should properly pursue and seek with your words. You should not speak falsely with your mouth and your heart is not in it. There were six steps going up to <i>King Solomon</i>’<i>s</i> throne. When <i>King Solomon</i> wanted to ascend it, they first called out, “<i>you shall not judge unfairly</i>” [16:19]. At the second step, they called out, “<i>you shall show no partiality</i>” [16:19]. At the third step, they called out, “<i>you shall not take bribes</i>” [16:19]. At the fourth step, they called out, “<i>do not set up a sacred post</i>” [16:21]. At the fifth step, they called out, “<i>do not erect a stone pillar</i>” [16:22]. At the sixth step, they called out, “<i>you shall not sacrifice an ox</i>” [17:1].<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Deuteronomy Rabbah</i>, 5.6.</i>
“<i>Sweep out evil from your midst</i>” [17:7]. The Torah tells us to seek the evildoers in order to punish them. If he is <i>guilty of the death penalty</i>, then he should be put to death. Sweep him away, just as one sweeps away the leaven. Therefore, the verse says, “<i>sweep out</i>,” just as it written concerning the leaven, <i>sweeping out the leaven.</i> They should search in each city what people are doing, so that they should not commit sins, just like one searches for the leaven in order to <i>sweep it out.</i> Therefore, it is also written “<i>from your midst.</i>” This means, <i>from your relatives.</i> You should not flatter your relatives when they do something evil.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Deuteronomy, 17:2.</i>
“<i>You shall make a thorough inquiry</i>” [17:4]. You should thoroughly question and investigate the witnesses, if they are not giving false witness. Do not believe one <i>witness</i> and do not convict on one <i>witness.</i> The witnesses had to first begin to stone the one <i>guilty of the death penalty.</i> Then all of Israel helped to stone him, expecting that each one should see that the one who commits sins is put to death, and they will be afraid to commit more sins.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Zeror ha-Mor, Deuteronomy, 17:2, 7.</i>
“<i>Appear before the priests</i>” [17:9]. When a person has a court case or a <i>question of religious law</i>, he should come to the priests. They will tell him the <i>laws.</i> Our sages learn from here that because it is written here, “<i>the magistrate in charge at the time</i>” [17:9], one asks, why does it have to say, in your days. It is obvious that he should go to the judge that is in his days. However, the verse teaches us that you should always go to your judge, the one who is in your days, even if he is not as important as the judges of previous generations. Yet, treat him with <i>respect</i> and have your case before him, just as if he was important, even though he does not have the wisdom of the <i>judges</i> of the past.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Deuteronomy, 17:9.</i>
“<i>Set a king over yourself</i>” [17:15]. You should make a king over you, expecting that he will destroy Amalek and erase the name of Amalek from the world, before the Temple would be built. Even though Israel did not need a king, since the Holy One is always their king, but the Holy One knows the thoughts of Israel better. In the end, they would desire a king. Therefore, the Holy One said, according to your opinion, take a king for yourself. However, it will not end well for you, because you desire a king like the gentiles, who rely on their king, and not on God. One had to respect the king. One should not ride on his horse and not sit on his throne. Nobody should put on his crown. Nobody should use his vessels, and he could not forego the honor due him. When he died, his vessels were burned and nobody was supposed to take his male and female slaves, except for another king of Israel. His wife was forbidden to another man and even a prophet who came to him had to stand and bow to him. However, the king had to stand before the high priest when he wanted to consult the <i>Urim ve-Tumim.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Deuteronomy, 17:15.</i>
“<i>Chosen by the Lord your God</i>” [17:15]. The verse teaches us that all authority that a person has is from the Holy One, since all the authority is from God, as the verse says, “<i>Yours, Lord are greatness, might</i>” [I Chronicles, 29:11]. This means, the authority belongs to God, <i>blessed be His name.</i> The Talmud says in <i>tractate Berakhot</i> concerning the verse “<i>Yours, Lord are greatness.</i>” Even the smallest authority that the person has comes from God, <i>blessed be His name.</i> Whoever, considers himself haughty with authority must die young, as we find concerning <i>Joseph the Righteous.</i> He held himself haughty with authority, and the portion alluded to this, “<i>set a king over yourself</i>” [17:15].<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Berakhot</i>, 55a.</i> This shows us that authority is an <i>elixir of life</i> to the person who behaves properly with his <i>authority, for the sake of heaven.</i> However, when that person holds himself high, then the authority is a <i>poison</i> to the person. Therefore, the verse says, “<i>you shall set</i>” [17:15]. This means, authority is an herb that makes a person dead or alive.
“<i>He shall not keep many horses</i>” [17:16]. The king of the Jews should not do as the kings of the nations who collect many horses, gold, silver, and wives. The king of Israel should not do this. He should not rely on many horses or on much gold, but the king of Israel had to have a personal Torah scroll. He should always read it in order to fear God, as the verse says here. He should not have many horses, expecting that he should not return the people of Israel to Egypt, since the best horses were brought from Egypt. This is so that Israel should not learn from the evil ways of the Egyptians. The commandment was only in effect during the time that they did not need to travel to Egypt. However, in the present generations one may certainly live in Egypt, since there are large and important communities in Egypt. Would the Torah have forbidden living in Egypt forever? How could our sages stood by and not issued a ban of excommunication on those communities? They would have had to leave. He was also not to have many wives, but he was allowed to have eighteen wives, expecting that they would not convince him to do evil. Adam had one wife and she convinced him to do evil. He should not accumulate an excessive amount of money, expecting that he should not burden Israel with taxes and would want to make treasuries. Wealth is compared to fire. One puts wood on it and one burns it. So too it is with the one who has much money. He never has enough. King Solomon was punished for all three things. He assembled many horses, forty thousand stables, and he took seven hundred wives, all noble and important women. He also took three hundred concubines. He gathered silver in Jerusalem, like large stones. He relied on his wisdom instead of the Torah. Therefore, he sinned with all these things. The wives made him sin and the money made him haughty.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Deuteronomy, 17:16, 17.</i>
“<i>He and his descendants</i>” [17:20]. The verse teaches us that the son inherits the kingdom. One does not need to anoint his son with oil, because he was born from a king. Thus, he was already holy. Even though King Solomon was anointed with oil, and he was born from <i>King David</i>, this had to be done because of war. There was one called <i>Adonijah son of Hagit</i> who wanted to be king after David’s death. Therefore, King David ordered that they should make Solomon the king.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Deuteronomy, 17:20.</i>
It is written in the <i>Sifre</i>, that a <i>communal leader, cantor, or ritual slaughterer</i>, and other positions of authority, it is just that the son should inherit the position of authority; when he is qualified, he takes precedence over others.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Sifre, Deuteronomy, 162.</i> <i>Ibn Shuaib</i> also writes this.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Ibn Shuaib, <i>Derashot</i>, II: 463.</i>
“<i>The levitical priests, the whole tribe of Levi, shall have no territorial portion</i>” [18:1]. The verse also tells us, that just like with the king, I told you that you should not accumulate silver and gold. So too, the priests should also rely on God. They should also not accumulate wealth, but they should wait for their service in the Temple. They will have enough to eat, but they should not desire any wealth, since wealth will negate their divine service. Similarly, the scholars in all generations are instead of the priests. They should not desire wealth, but to study Torah and <i>issue religious rulings</i>, just like the priests <i>issued rulings.</i> Therefore, one is obligated to support <i>scholars</i>, expecting that they should study Torah. Because the priests studied Torah day and night, they became weak. Therefore, they were given three parts. The <i>shoulder</i>, which is the same as the <i>leg</i>, the cheeks are the <i>cheeks</i> and the stomach of each animal is the same as the <i>stomach.</i> These three things were given to the priests because <i>Phinehas</i> took <i>revenge</i> with his own hands, regarding the illicit sex, for the honor of the Holy One when he risked his life and killed a chieftain of Israel. Therefore, the priests are given the <i>forelegs</i> of the animal sacrifices. Phinehas prayed that the plague should cease in Israel. The prayer was with the cheeks, that is, with the mouth. Therefore, the priests were given the cheeks of all the animals. Because Phinehas stabbed the chieftain and the whore in their intestines, therefore, the stomach of the animal was given to the priests.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Zeror ha-Mor, Deuteronomy, 18:1.</i>
“<i>You should not learn</i>” [18:9]. Our sages learn from this verse that even though one should not do any sorcery, but nonetheless, the <i>Sanhedrin</i> had to learn sorcery, expecting that they should be able to <i>judge</i> each person properly. There were many evildoers who knew sorcery and one cannot burn them or drown them in water. Perhaps there will be some Israelites who will engage in sorcery and will do all sorts of evil. It will not be possible to put them to death for their evil. Therefore, the <i>Sanhedrin</i> had to learn sorcery, expecting that they would know how to kill them; they should be put to death because they were engaging in sorcery.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Deuteronomy, 18:9.</i>
“<i>Consigns his son or daughter to the fire</i>” [18:10]. The Torah forbade us to worship foreign gods. There were some nations who used to burn their children, sons and daughters, to their foreign gods. They took their son and laid two fires, in two piles, and carried the child between them until it was burned. His intention was that all of his children that he would have later should remain alive. Therefore, he burned the first son as a sacrifice. <i>King Ahaz</i>, the father of [king] <i>Hezekiah</i>, allowed his children to be carried through the fire and be burned, as the gentiles did. Therefore, <i>Hezekiah</i>’<i>s</i> mother smeared Hezekiah with the blood of an <i>animal called salamander.</i> Whoever is smeared with this blood will not be harmed by fire.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Leviticus, 18:21.</i>

“<i>One who consults ghosts</i>” [18:11]. He brings a dead person out of his grave and makes him speak and tell him everything that is supposed to happen. One could not raise the <i>ghost</i> on the Sabbath. The dead person walked on his hands and not on his feet. Our sages write how it was possible to bring a dead person back to life. However, they said that the sorcerer could only do this in the first twelve months after his death, to bring him up and make him alive. A gentile asked: you say that the souls of the righteous are under the <i>Throne of Glory.</i> How could the witch bring <i>Samuel the prophet</i> back to life; he was certainly righteous? They answered him that in the twelve months the body is still whole and the soul ascends to heaven for a while and returns again to the body. It does this for twelve months and after twelve months it remains above, under the <i>Throne of Glory</i> and does not come again to the body.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Deuteronomy, 18:10–11.</i>
“<i>Familiar spirits</i>” [18:11]. There is an animal called a <i>familiar</i> and one takes a bone from this animal called a <i>familiar</i> and places it in the mouth of the dead person. Then the bone tells him everything he wants to know.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Deuteronomy, 18:11.</i>
“<i>One who inquires of the dead</i>” [18:11]. This means he lies down in the <i>cemetery</i> among the dead. He mortifies his body with fasts and sleeps in the <i>cemetery</i>, expecting that the <i>spirit of impurity</i> would come upon him. When <i>Rabbi Akiva</i> came to this verse, he cried and said, when somebody lies in the <i>cemetery</i> the <i>spirit of impurity</i> comes upon him, because he mortified himself severely and made himself <i>impure.</i> How much more so, the <i>Holy Spirit</i> comes upon the person who mortifies himself and keeps himself <i>pure.</i> We are not worthy to have the <i>Holy Spirit</i> rest upon us, because but our sins cause this.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Sanhedrin</i>, 65b.</i>
“<i>You must be wholehearted with the Lord your God</i>” [18:13]. You should not pursue sorcery, but rely on the Holy One who can help you. Be whole with your speech. Do not speak divided words. You speak well with your mouth, but your heart is not in it. This means, <i>wholehearted</i>, whole speech. You should not pursue sorcery since you will have prophets who will reveal and tell you with certainty. However, the sorcerers often tell you lies. Therefore, the Torah wrote the <i>laws</i> concerning prophecy near those of sorcery.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Deuteronomy, 18:12–14.</i>
“<i>You shall set aside three cities</i>” [19:2]. You should set aside three cities into which the killer who killed accidentally can escape. The Torah teaches us that when a person makes his friend commit sins, this is worse than if he had killed him. When he kills his friend, he only takes him away from this world. However, when he causes his friend to sin, he brings him away from this world and the next world. Therefore, the Torah wrote, “<i>that prophet shall die</i>” [18:20], and “<i>You shall set aside three cities</i>” [19:2]. That is to say, you shall have no <i>mercy</i> for a false prophet who wants to make you sin, but when he kills someone accidentally, have <i>mercy</i> on him, since he did not want to do this, and make three cities that the killer can run to.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Zeror ha-Mor, Deuteronomy, 19:1.</i>
“<i>When the Lord your God enlarges your territory</i>” [19:8]. In the days of the Messiah you should make additional cities for the killer to flee to, since the number of Israelites will be greater then.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban, Deuteronomy, 19:8.</i>
It says, “<i>you will purge Israel of the blood of the innocent</i>” [19:13]. This teaches us that the judges sometimes rule according to their reason when somebody is not completely guilty of the death penalty, when there is not clear testimony that he committed the murder, expecting that the people will fear to do evil. This is the meaning of “<i>the blood of the innocent.</i>” This means, the blood that is not completely guilty, yet you may put him to death in order to instill fear, as we find in in a story in tractate <i>Yevamot</i> [90b]. Somebody was riding on a horse on the Sabbath. He was brought to the <i>court</i> and they stoned him and killed him. Even though he was not guilty of death, but they instilled fear in Israel that they should properly observe the Sabbath. There was a Greek king in those days who made Israel transgress the commandments of the Torah. An incident occurred, somebody slept with his wife during the day under a fig tree. They gave him <i>thirty-nine lashes</i> in front of the people. They wanted to instill fear. From here we learn that the <i>leaders and judges</i> in each community should punish their <i>householders</i> with <i>fines</i> and other types of shaming, in order to instill fear in Israel.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Zeror ha-Mor, Deuteronomy, 19:11.</i>
Another explanation is “<i>purge innocent blood</i>” [19:13]. By killing the murderer, the murderer has expiation for his sins. Thus, you will clean out appropriate blood from the world. That is to say, he will come pure and clean from this world into the next world. However, if you will not want to put him to death and you will have pity on him. The murderer does not die with clean blood, since he was full of sins, and it will be worse for him in the next world. From here we learn that one should have no pity on the evildoers and punish them, since they have repentance by being shamed and have expiation, as we find in [tractate Kiddushin] <i>chapter four.</i> An incident occurred. They brought Jewish young women who had been captives, to be redeemed. They were brought to the house of <i>Rabbi Amram the pious</i>, and were put in his attic, and the ladder was taken away. <i>Rabbi Amram</i> looked at the attic and saw a young woman whose beauty shined, and his inclination overcame him. <i>Rabbi Amram</i> took a heavy ladder that ten men could not lift. Rabbi Amram lifted it alone and went halfway up the ladder. He began to shout and said, it is burning in the house of Rabbi Amram. The neighbors came and wanted to extinguish the fire. His students and the rabbis also came. They said to him: Rabbi, you have shamed us and caused an embarrassment. Rabbi Amram responded: it is better that you should be ashamed of me in this world than you should be ashamed of me in the next world. Therefore, because I was shamed in this world, then I have <i>expiation in the next world.</i> The evil inclination burned in him like a fire. He adjured it with <i>holy names</i> and it left him like a fiery pillar. <i>Rabbi Amram</i> said to the evil inclination. You are fire and I am flesh and blood, and I am better than you are.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Kiddushin</i>, 81a.</i> From this story we can learn that we should shame the <i>ignoramuses</i> when they commit sins, expecting that they should have <i>expiation in the world to come.</i>
“<i>The two men shall appear before the Lord</i>” [19:17]. The Torah says that when a person stands before the <i>judges</i>, he should fear, like he was standing before the Holy One. When there is a proper judgment on the earth, the Holy One is also present, as the verse says, “<i>among the divine beings He pronounces judgment</i>” [Psalms, 82:1]. This means, the Holy One is at the judgment.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Deuteronomy, 19:17.</i>
“<i>You shall not move your countryman</i>’<i>s landmarks</i>” [19:14]. You should not move the landmarks of your friend, so that you want to take a piece of your friend’s land. Great quarrels come because of land. One must have testimony for it. Therefore, the Torah wrote the <i>laws of testimony</i> and <i>judges</i> near the <i>laws of moving landmarks.</i> The neighbors quarrel with each other all the time.
Therefore, one must have testimony and <i>judges.</i> However, in any event, properly question the witnesses and if they will testify falsely with their words, then kill them. Did they want to do differently with their words, but to destroy a person?<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Zeror ha-Mor, Deuteronomy, 19:14.</i> Therefore, the Torah wrote here: “<i>you shall do to him as he schemed to do</i>” [19:19]. This means, you should do to the witnesses, as they desired to do. Our sages learn from this verse that when the witnesses testified about a person how he desecrated the Sabbath, committed a murder, or other similar transgressions. The person was put to death through their testimony. The <i>Sanhedrin</i> allowed him to be killed because of their testimony. Later, other witnesses came and said about the first witnesses that they gave false testimony about the person who had been killed through their testimony. He was innocent. Nothing was done to the witnesses, because it already happened that he was killed. One does nothing to the witnesses, since the Holy One does not send to the judges that they kill an innocent person. He must certainly have been guilty of death because of another transgression. The <i>Holy Spirit</i> was present in the Sanhedrin and they certainly did not condemn somebody for no reason. However, when the witnesses were found to be false before the person was killed because of their testimony, then they killed the false witnesses. Some sages said: they did not kill the witnesses when the person was already killed, because, one can say, why would you believe the second witnesses? Perhaps the first witnesses were better? However, when the person is still alive, then he supports the second witnesses. Thus, the second witnesses have become three, together with the person, concerning their testimony. Therefore, we believe the later ones. They are three and the first ones are two. So writes Rabbenu Bahya.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Deuteronomy, 19:19.</i>
Some sages say that they did not kill the witnesses even though the person was put to death through their testimony, since it is known that death through the Sanhedrin is an expiation for the murderer. Therefore, also when through their testimony a murder happened, that the <i>judges</i> allowed him to be killed because of their testimony, the witnesses committed a great sin, to kill an innocent pious person with their words. Therefore, the witnesses were not killed, expecting that they should have no expiation. However, when through their testimony the person was not yet killed, the witnesses have not committed such a great sin. Therefore, the witnesses are killed, expecting that they should have expiation for their sin. They wanted to kill a pious innocent person with their speech. So writes the <i>Zeror ha-Mor.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Zeror ha-Mor, Deuteronomy, 19:19.</i>
“<i>Hear O Israel, you are about to join battle with your enemy</i>” [20:3]. Hear O Israel, you are about to join battle with your enemy. Whichever Israelite had built a house and not yet lived in it, he should not go to war, since his thoughts will be about his house and will make the other Israelites fainthearted in the war. Similarly, someone who married a wife and had not lived with her, he should also remain at home. Similarly, when he had a vineyard and had not yet eaten its fruit, he should also not go to war. His thoughts would be on his wife and his vineyard. The Torah wrote that three people should return home, expecting that other Israelites should not be ashamed. The one who committed sins had to leave the war, so that Israelites should not die because of his sins. Those who had to go home because they had sins were ashamed. All of Israel saw that they had committed sins. Therefore, the Holy One commanded that whoever had built a house, or married a wife and had not lived with her, or he had planted a vineyard, he should also go home from the war. Thus, the people would not know which one had committed a sin, or which has a wife, or a house, or a vineyard. The Torah insists that nobody should be embarrassed, even if he had sinned. They should also see how great is peace, even when the war was against the nations of the world. First, they had to offer peace. Joshua sent three letters to the nations of the world, before he waged war with them. It was written in the first letter that whoever wants peace should come and we will make peace with them. One nation, called the <i>Gibeonites</i> came and they made peace. In the second letter it was written that whoever wants to leave the land, they may leave. One nation, called the <i>Girgashites</i>, left the land of Israel. The third letter was written to whoever wants to wage war with us. They should prepare for war. Thirty kings of the nations gathered and waged war with Joshua.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Deuteronomy, 20:10.</i>
“<i>Are trees of the field human?</i>” [20:19]. The Torah tells us that man must eat. Therefore, do not chop down any tree that has fruit. You can benefit and eat from it. Particularly, when you come before a city where the trees are cut down, then you cannot nourish yourself from it. The Torah says, “<i>wielding the ax against them</i>” [20:19]. You should not cut off the branches, since the fruit grow from them. Afterwards it says, you should also not chop down the tree itself. Therefore, it compares the tree to a person. Just as the person has those things that grow, so too the tree has the power to grow. Our sages said: when one chops down a tree, it cries out and its voice goes from one end of the world to the other. Just as the tree has children, so the tree has fruit.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Zeror ha-Mor, Deuteronomy, 20:19.</i>
The Torah wrote, “<i>when you take the field against your enemies</i>” [20:1]. When you go to war against the nations. Afterwards, it is written in the Torah, “<i>if someone slain is found lying in the open</i>” [21:1]. This means, when you find a dead person who was killed, and it is not known who did it. That is to say, it sometimes happened that a Jew had an enemy and he could not take revenge on him. It was in the war against the nations that he was able to have revenge and he killed him. Therefore, the Torah ordered the <i>elders</i> of the city that they should go together and properly investigate, if he did not have an Israelite <i>enemy.</i> The <i>elders</i> brought a calf and killed it on a spot that had not been plowed and that spot was never supposed to be plowed, expecting that they should remember that a murder happened there. Perhaps they would learn who was the murderer.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Zeror ha-Mor, Deuteronomy, 21:1.</i>
The priests said, “<i>absolve Your people</i>” [21:8]. You should absolve Israel. When Israel were pious in that generation, that calf went to the house of the murderer. Thus, they knew that he was the murderer, and he was put to death. If the generation was not worthy, then the calf did not go and they killed the calf in the valley. Also, a worm went from the body of the calf and ran to the murderer, and the worm killed the murderer. Therefore, the person should be warned not to do evil. One cannot hide from the Holy One in the whole world. Therefore, also because the killer killed three people, since he has three souls and powers. One is that he has a power within himself that he eats and excretes like an animal. The second is that he has a power like a tree that grows. So too the person grows. The third is that the person has a soul like the angels that are pure intellect. In return, these three things are done in relation to the murderer. They first took a calf from the animals representing the power of the soul that was in the person from the animal. They killed the animal on a place that had not been sown and nothing had grown on it. This represents that the killer killed the person, who can no longer grow. The priests had to say many words over the calf. “<i>Absolve your people Israel, our hands did not shed this blood</i>” [21:7, 8]. This is related to the soul that was in the person from the angels. With this soul, the person can speak and has intellect.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Deuteronomy, 21:1.</i>
Therefore, the elders and the priests had to pray to God that the murderer should be found. They said with their prayer: we did not see the person who was killed; that we should have given him bread and food; that we should have accompanied him on his way. From here the Torah teaches us that one should not allow a guest leave one’s house without bread and other food. One should also accompany him. Thus, the guest will be protected on the way.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Deuteronomy, 21:7.</i>
They said: “<i>absolve Your people</i>” [21:8]. Forgive Your people Israel who live here. “<i>Whom You redeemed</i>” [21:8]. These are the dead who were redeemed through money that the people give charity for the dead. This helps the dead. From here we learn that one should give <i>charity</i> for the dead. Therefore, one must <i>remember the souls</i> every <i>festival</i> and one gives charity for their sake. This is expiation for the <i>dead.</i> Similarly, when one recites the Kaddish for father and mother, one redeems them from Gehenna.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Deuteronomy, 21:8.</i>
The Talmud states in <i>tractate Kallah.</i> An incident occurred to <i>Rabbi Akiva.</i> He encountered a person in the field who was carrying a very heavy load of wood. <i>Rabbi Akiva</i> asked him: why are you working so hard? He said to <i>Rabbi Akiva:</i> I committed all the sins in the world. Now I have to carry the wood for them to burn me every day. Therefore, do not make me tarry. The <i>angels of destruction</i> will beat me with fiery rods. <i>Rabbi Akiva</i> asked him: Did you leave a son in the world? He responded: my wife was pregnant when I died. Rabbi Akiva went to that city and asked about his wife and children. They said to him: why are you asking about him? He was a great evildoer. He slept with a <i>bride</i> who was <i>betrothed</i> to her <i>groom</i> on <i>Yom Kippur. Rabbi Akiva</i> went to his house and waited until his wife gave birth to a child, who was his son. Rabbi Akiva taught the son to recite the <i>Kaddish</i> and <i>Borchu.</i> The same person appeared to <i>Rabbi Akiva</i> again and praised and thanked him very much. He had redeemed him from <i>Gehenna</i> with the <i>Kaddish</i> that his son had recited.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Tractate <i>Kallah Rabbati</i>, 2.9.</i>

Ki Teitzei

<i>King Solomon, of blessed memory</i>, said: “<i>give your mind to me, my son; let your eyes watch my ways</i>” [Proverbs, 23:26]. This means, give your heart to me and your eyes should watch my ways. The verse teaches us that the person should serve the Holy One with all of his limbs. It is known that the eyes and the heart bring the person to commit all sins and lusts, since the eyes and the heart desire. When the heart and the eyes are whole with the Holy One, the person is pious in the service of God. Therefore, we say every day, “<i>so that you do not follow your heart and eyes in lustful urge</i>” [Numbers, 15:39]. This means, you should not follow your hearts and eyes who make you inconstant, like a whore who misleads people. Therefore, it says, “<i>follow lustful urges</i>” [Numbers, 15:39]. Since the one who goes after his eyes and heart, is like somebody who goes after a whore. Therefore, <i>King Solomon, of blessed memory</i>, also said about this verse, “<i>a harlot is a deep pit; a forbidden woman is a narrow well</i>” [Proverbs, 23:27]. The one who goes to the house of the harlot is like one who goes near a large, deep pit and falls into it. He certainly has wounds and other harm. So too, the one who goes to the house of the harlot. He does not come out without harm and sins. He is like a fountain that gushes. The more water one takes out of it, the more water the fountain has. So too, the one who goes after harlotry. All day he thinks of nothing but that he wants to quiet his evil inclination, and the evil inclination incites him even more. From speaking with an unrelated woman, he comes to looking at her. When he looks at her, he has thoughts, and from these thoughts comes that he touches her hand.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Ki Teizei, Introduction.</i>
The Talmud says in [tractate] Shabbat. <i>Rav</i> said: whoever looks at the small finger of an unrelated woman, he has a great sin. Rav Hisda said: one who looks at the bare foot of an unrelated woman, it is as if he had illicit sex with her. Samuel said: a loud shout or the voice of a woman is as if he had illicit sex with him. <i>Rav Sheshet</i> said: the woman who shows the hair of her head, it is like he engaged in illicit sex.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Part of this passage is found in B. <i>Shabbat</i>, 64b. However, the whole statement is found in B. <i>Berakhot</i>, 24a.</i>
Therefore, the Torah also writes. “<i>You take some of them captive. And you see among the captives a beautiful woman</i>” [21:10–11]. This means, when you will see a beautiful woman in the war and will want to marry her. Here the Torah commanded that you should not hurry when you want to marry her. You should sleep with her once during the war, expecting you will quiet your evil inclination. However, you should not sleep with her again in the war. You have to bring her home first. The Torah knows well that someone is wanton during the war and will not be able to refrain from engaging in illicit sex. Therefore, it is better that the Torah allowed him one time, which is like not at all. When the evil inclination strengthens within him and he will want to sleep with her again, then he must first cut her hair and have her nails grow, and must remove her beautiful clothes, since when the nations go to war, they put on beautiful clothes, so that people should come to them to engage in illicit sex. Therefore, he has to wait thirty days, expecting that she will mourn her father and mother, after she heard that they had been killed. Another explanation for why he must wait thirty days. He should not sleep with her, expecting that in the meantime his inclination will subside and she will become disgusting to him, because she must mourn. She must cut her hair, let her nails grow and don despicable clothes and he will see her crying. Perhaps, he will send her away. Another explanation that he must wait thirty days, expecting that she will forget her father and mother who worshiped foreign gods and cleave to her husband who is a Jew. She will convert and she will be modest, and not like the nations who ware brazen, and run from one house to another house. Afterwards, the man says that she should cut her hair. Just like when a woman immerses herself, she must carefully examine her hair and comb it out. So too, the woman had to cut her hair, since she cannot be warned about properly cleaning her hair as it should be done. Afterwards, she cleans her nails, so that there should not be anything under them, so that her immersion should be properly done. She removes the clothes that she wore when she was menstruating.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Deuteronomy, 21:11, 13.</i>
The Torah writes that when you will have done everything and will take a gentile woman, nonetheless you will regret it in the end. The child you will have with her will become a “<i>wayward and defiant son</i>,” who will engage in everything evil.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Deuteronomy, 21:11.</i>
“<i>A wayward and defiant son</i>” [21:18]. The Torah wrote that when a son steals from his father and buys meat and wine, his father and mother bring him before the <i>court</i>, and the <i>court</i> allows him to be stoned. With this, a fear was created over all of Israel. They called out that <i>a wayward and defiant son</i> had been stoned, and therefore everyone feared to do evil.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Deuteronomy, 21:18, 21.</i>
“<i>His corpse must not remain</i> … <i>overnight</i>” [21:23]. When an Israelite was hanged, he was not allowed to hang overnight. This is for the honor of the Holy One, since they hanged someone the Holy One reviled, killed and cursed. Therefore, if he would hang for a long time, the people might talk about the one who blasphemed against the Holy One and it might become an embarrassment for the Holy One. Another explanation is that they should not let him remain hanging overnight, since the person is created in God’s image. Therefore, since the person is in God’s image, therefore it is a <i>degradation of the Holy One</i> that his image should hang. A parable. Two brothers who have a similar face and one can’t distinguish from the other. One became a king and the other became a robber. They hanged the robber. Whoever went by, thought that the king was hanging, since he looked the same. Therefore, the king commanded, take him down.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Deuteronomy, 21:22–23.</i>
“<i>You must take it back your fellow</i>” [22:1]. The Torah teaches us that one should return to his friend or his brother that which he had lost. One is obligated to help his friend with everything. The Holy One commanded the commandment so that one should acquire merit by helping his friend with lovingkindness and charity. Through this commandment, that one returns to his friend what he found, one is worthy that the Holy One will again return the dead to life in the days of the Messiah, <i>measure for measure.</i> He will also return the soul into the body, where it was previously.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Deuteronomy, 22:1.</i>
“<i>A woman must not put on a man</i>’<i>s apparel</i>” [22:5]. A woman should not wear the garments of a man, since she will want to go to war. She will appear to be a man and come to illicit sex through this. Similarly, a man should not don women’s garments, so that he should not mix with women. From here our sages learned that a man should not look into a woman’s mirror. However, when he is sick, he can look at himself and see what his face looks like. A woman should not wear a sword. Therefore, a woman named <i>Yael</i> took a nail and killed Sisera with the nail. She was not supposed to take a sword in her hand.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Deuteronomy, 22:5.</i>
“<i>Let the mother go</i>” [22:7]. When you come across a bird’s nest, take the children and allow the mother to remain, expecting that the mother will have birds again. Therefore, the Holy One will also lengthen your life, because you allowed the mother of the birds to live. Therefore, one should not take the mother with the children. One should not cause anguish for the mother who has great love for her children. Therefore, one should send away the mother. From here we learn that one should have compassion for a person when the Holy One said that we should have compassion for the birds, how much more so for people. The Torah wrote the reward near the commandment. You will live long, even though the commandment is not very great. <i>How much more so</i>, when one fulfills a great commandment, even more so the Holy One will give him long life and a great reward. Our sages say that whoever fulfills the commandment of sending away the mother of the birds; he has children who are sons. Therefore the verse says, “<i>let the mother go, and take only the young</i>” [22:7]. When you will send away the mother from the birds, you will be worthy to have children. One is also worthy of children when you honor guests, as we find concerning Sarah. She honored the angelic guests and they told her, you will have a son. So too the <i>Shunamite</i>, who <i>honored Elisha.</i> He told her, you will have a son.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Deuteronomy, 22:7.</i>
“<i>You shall make a parapet</i>” [22:8]. The Torah said: you should be sure that no person would be hurt in your house. You should not have a defective ladder or a bad dog who bites people. If a person should fall off the ladder and die, then you will be guilty of the death. The Holy One does not kill any person for no reason. He must have committed sins. Similarly, it did not happen accidentally through his ladder, but it was sent to repay evil to the evildoers through such people, who were also evildoers. Therefore, be careful not to harm another person in your house.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Deuteronomy, 22:8.</i>
“<i>You shall not plow with an ox and an ass together</i>” [22:10]. You should not plow with an ox and a donkey together, since the ox has great strength and the donkey has less strength. Thus, the donkey will be left behind. The master will beat him to go together with the ox, and the donkey will be in anguish. From here we should learn that one should not cause anguish to any animal. How much more so, one should not cause anguish to a person. Another explanation is that the Torah prohibited plowing with his donkey and ox at one time, because when they would plow together, they will become <i>attached</i> to each other and become used to being together, and afterwards they will try to mate with each other. The Torah forbade that each <i>species</i> and creature should mix with each other. Therefore, the Torah wrote near it, “<i>you shall not wear cloth combining wool and linen</i>” [22:11]. You should not sow <i>mixtures</i>, like wheat near your vineyard.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Deuteronomy, 22:10.</i>
Therefore, also because the Torah said here that one should not make mixtures of animals, one <i>species</i> with a different <i>species</i>, even more so one should not mix a woman with an unrelated man. This is the greatest <i>mixture.</i> Therefore, the Torah wrote the remedy that the person should not engage in illicit sex. This is the <i>commandment of zizit</i>, which protects the person from illicit sex, as we find in the Talmud, tractate <i>Menahot,</i> a story about someone who observed the <i>commandment of zizit</i> very strictly. This person heard of a prostitute who lived across the sea. He sent four hundred gulden, so that she should prepare to sleep with him, since whoever wanted to sleep with her had to give her four hundred gulden. When he came the prostitute, she lay on seven beds, one on top of the other. Six beds were silver and the seventh was gold. In between each bed there was a silver ladder. At the top bed there was a golden ladder. She got undressed and seated herself on the golden bed at the top. He also got undressed and seated himself on top next to her. The zizit that he had been wearing came before him and he became frightened and immediately descended to the ground. The prostitute followed him and said to him: what did you see in me, what kind of defect? He said: I have never seen a person as beautiful as you in all my life. However, God has commanded us one commandment, which is <i>zizit</i> and wrote concerning it, “<i>I am the Lord your God</i>” [Numbers, 15:41], two times. This means, I am God who rewards the evildoer for his evil deeds, and I am God who rewards the righteous for their good deeds. Now, the zizit are like four witnesses and will testify against me. The prostitute swore: I will not let you go. You must write down your name, your city, the name of your study house and the name of your teacher. He wrote it all down, gave it to her and went away. The prostitute divided her money into three parts. One part she gave to the king, one part she gave to the poor and one part she kept for provisions. She came to the city and the study house of Rabbi Hiyya and said to him, convert me. He said: my dear daughter, perhaps you are converting because you desire a handsome young man? She took out the note and showed it to Rabbi Hiyya. Rabbi Hiyya said: go and marry that man and the bed you previously offered him with forbidden things, now bed him properly in a permitted way and she did so.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Menahot</i>, 44a.</i> From this story we should learn how great is the reward of <i>zizit.</i> They give a reward in this world and in the next world.
Therefore, the portion wrote here the commandment regarding mixtures, that one should not mix animals, one <i>species</i> with another <i>species.</i> How much more so, a person should not engage in illicit sex, but the evil inclination is very great, particularly for illicit sex. Therefore, the Torah taught remedies for the evil inclination, which is zizit, and wrote about zizit near <i>mixtures.</i> “<i>You shall make tassels</i>” [22:12]. He shows that zizit is a remedy for <i>mixtures.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Zeror ha-Mor, Deuteronomy, 22:12.</i>
The Torah wrote another remedy for illicit sex. This is, one should marry a wife. Then the evil inclination is removed, as the Talmud writes in the <i>first chapter of</i> [tractate] <i>Kiddushin.</i> Rav Hisda said: I am better than my colleagues because I married at sixteen years old. If I had married at fourteen years, I might have blinded the evil inclination. As soon as I married, the evil inclination left me.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Kiddushin</i>, 29b.</i> Therefore, the Torah wrote about <i>zizit near mixtures.</i> The person can fulfill these at eight years old and can negate the evil inclination. When he become fourteen years old, he should take a wife in order to subdue the evil inclination. The Torah also showed this and wrote after the <i>zizit</i>, “<i>a man married a woman</i>” [22:13]. A man should marry a wife to negate the evil inclination. Therefore, it is just that the man should honor his wife, since she protects her husband from the evil inclination.
Therefore, the Torah wrote here, “<i>he defames her</i>” [22:14]. This means, when the husband defames his wife, he must give a hundred weight of silver to her father because he had defamed his <i>daughter</i>, that she was not a virgin. They had to show the sheet to the court, that she was a virgin, and they took women who understood the blood of virginity. However, when it is found that she has engaged in illicit sex, then she should be put to death. When a man, <i>heaven forbid, rapes</i> a woman, then she is <i>innocent</i> and is permitted to her husband. However, when she willingly engaged in illicit sex, then she is put to death. If she is pregnant with a child, they do not wait but put her to death with the child. However, when she is about to give birth, then they wait until she gives birth.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Deuteronomy, 22:17, 22.</i>
“<i>This case is like that of a man attacking another and murdering him</i>” [22:26]. This is like someone who stands up and kills his friend. Our sages learn from here that one who sleeps with a married woman, it is like murder. When a nobleman commands a Jew and says to him, go and kill your friend. If you will not do it, he would kill you. He must allow himself to be killed. Similarly, when the nobleman commands a Jew that he should sleep with a married woman, he must allow himself to be killed, rather than sleep with a married woman. Even concerning a widow our sages said: a story occurred that someone had a great desire to sleep with a certain widow. He became sick because of his great lust and his heart broke. All the physicians said that he would die if he did not sleep with her, or she should only stand before him naked. Then he would be able to live. They informed the sages that he would die if he did not sleep with her. The sages responded that he should die and he should not sleep with her, and she should not stand naked before him. He said: they should let her speak with him behind a fence, and perhaps he will remain alive. The sages said that they should also not do this, expecting that they should make a fence for the sin and also a disgrace for the family.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Deuteronomy, 22:26.</i>
“<i>There was no one to save her</i>” [22:27]. When nobody wants to help a woman who is being raped, then she is innocent. From here we learn that one should help a Jew in any way one can. When one sees a Jew running who wants to kill another Jew, then one is allowed to kill the one who wants to commit the murder. From here our sages learned that a woman who is having a difficult childbirth and she cannot give birth to the child and her life is in danger, then it is permitted to kill the child, expecting that the mother will remain alive. One is allowed to give the mother something to drink so that the child will die and come out of the mother. One may also make a smoke for the woman so that the child would die and leave the mother. However, in any event when the head of the child and the <i>majority of the body</i> is out of the mother, then they should not kill the child, since the child does not desire to kill, but it also wants to come into the world. Therefore, the child is not called a murderer.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Deuteronomy, 22:26.</i>
“<i>No one misbegotten shall be admitted into the congregation of the Lord</i>” [23:3]. A <i>mamzer</i> means that one slept with his mother, sister or a <i>married woman.</i> The child is not to marry a <i>proper Israelite</i>, but is allowed to marry a <i>convert.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Deuteronomy, 23:3.</i>
“<i>No Ammonite or Moabite shall be admitted into the congregation of the Lord</i>” [23:4]. Because the Ammonites did not bring bread and water to the Israelites in the desert, therefore the Holy One ordered that no Ammonite should be accepted among the children of Israel. No <i>Moabite</i> should also be accepted into Israel because they hired <i>Balaam</i> that he should curse Israel. However, in any event, the women of <i>Ammon and Moab</i> are allowed to <i>marry</i> Israelites, since the women of <i>Ammon and Moab</i> were not responsible, since they could not carry bread. It is not the custom for women to bring bread or water. You may <i>marry</i> an <i>Edomite</i> or an <i>Egyptian</i> after three <i>generations</i>, even though <i>Edom</i> attacked Israel in the <i>wilderness</i> with a sword, to wage war with Israel. The <i>Egyptians</i> threw the children of Israel into the water, yet the Holy One said that you may marry them after three <i>generations.</i> However, <i>Ammon and Moab</i> caused Israel to sin through illicit sex. Therefore, the Holy One ordered that on should not <i>marry</i> them.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Deuteronomy, 23:5, 8.</i>
It is worse when someone causes his friend to sin than if he killed him. When he kills him, he only brings him out of this world. However, when he causes his friend to sin, then he takes him out of this world and the next world. Therefore, it says immediately, “<i>be on your guard against anything untoward</i>” [23:10]. Our sages learn from here that one should not engage in any illicit sex and one should not engage in <i>slander.</i> Thus, the Torah shows us that whoever causes his friend to sin with great sins. He can cause his friend to sin, even with speaking. He brings his friend out of this world and the next world with <i>slander</i> that one speaks. The one who listens to <i>slander</i> is punished by God, as the Talmud says in [tractate] <i>Erakhin.</i> Three are killed because of the sin of <i>slander.</i> The one who <i>slanders</i> someone else. The one who listens to <i>slander</i> will die and will also lose the next world, as the Talmud says: for three sins people are punished in this world and loses the next world. They are <i>idol worship</i>, <i>illicit sex</i>, and <i>murder.</i> However, slander is equivalent to them, he loses this world and the next world.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Arachin</i>, 15b.</i>
Therefore the verse says here, “<i>with your gear you shall have a spike</i>” [23:14]. Our sages interpret this in <i>tractate Ketubot.</i> You should put your finger into your ear, to stop it up, in order not to hear <i>slander.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Ketubot</i>, 5b.</i>
Our sages also say that the verse “<i>with your gear you shall have a spike</i>” [23:14] teaches us that they took an iron spike and placed it near their sword. When he wanted to excrete during the war, he took the nail and dug a hole in the ground and covered his excrement so that nobody should not see it and it should not stink. This happened when they stopped eating the <i>manna.</i> When they ate the <i>manna</i>, it was digested in their intestines they and had no excretion from the <i>manna.</i> The other food that they ate along with the <i>manna</i>, the <i>manna</i> caused that it did not stink when what they ate was excreted. However, when they ceased eating the <i>manna</i>, their excrement stank and they had to have an iron spike, expecting that the <i>camp</i> should remain clean, particularly when the holy clouds were present. Therefore, the person had to go to the back of the people to take care of his needs. The clouds were on three sides, but in the back of the people there was no cloud, expecting that the <i>Ark</i> should not receive the smell.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Deuteronomy, 23:14.</i>
“<i>You shall not bring the fee of a whore</i>” [23:19]. You should not bring a <i>present</i> from a whore into the house of the Lord, since this is disgusting. The Torah wrote nearby, “<i>you shall not deduct</i>” [23:20]. This means, you should not give <i>interest</i> to your Israelite friend. This teaches us that there are many Israelites who <i>transgress regarding interest</i>, and accumulate much money from <i>interest.</i> He buys many honors in the synagogue to go up to the <i>Torah.</i> This is like he brought a fee from a whore into the house of God. Concerning this, the prophet said, “<i>bringing oblations is futile, incense is offensive</i>” [Isaiah 1:13]. The Torah first wrote that one should not give interest. Then the Torah also wrote that one should also not take interest, since God will punish both of them. If you will think, how will I feed myself if I do not give or take interest? Therefore, the Torah wrote here, “<i>so that the Lord your God may bless you in all your undertakings</i>” [23:21]. This means, when you will not take or give interest, God will bless you with all things in all your endeavors.
The Torah wrote, “<i>when you make a loan to your countryman</i>” [24:10]. You should lend the poor person and near it is written, “<i>in cases of a skin affliction, be most careful</i>” [24:8]. With this the Torah shows that whoever does not want to lend to his friend, he will be punished with leprosy, as <i>Midrash Rabbah</i> writes in this portion. <i>Rabbi Meir</i> said that leprosy comes in no other way but from an evil eye because he does not want to give <i>charity</i> and perform <i>acts of lovingkindness. Rabbi Isaac</i> said: the custom is, one comes to a <i>householder</i> to borrow an ax. He says, I do not have one. What does the Holy One do? He sends leprosy on that house. Thus, he must clean out all the utensils from the house, axes and sieves that he denied he had. He must put everything out in the street. They see his disgrace and he gets an evil eye, because he did not want to lend the utensils to his friend. The Torah shows us here that he, who does not lend to his friend, will get leprosy.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Deuteronomy Rabbah</i>, 6.8.</i>
Rabbi Levi said: some women have four bad traits. The first is that they have long necks, as we find concerning Eve and eating the apple. The second is that the women strive to hear all the secrets and want to know everything. It is written concerning Sarah, “<i>Sarah was listening</i>” [Genesis, 18:10]. She wanted to hear everything and know things not related to her. The third one is that they envy everyone, as we find concerning <i>Rachel.</i> She was <i>envious</i> of her sister, <i>Leah</i>, because <i>Leah</i> had children and she did not have any children. The fourth is that they are indolent and lazy, as we find concerning Sarah. It is written, “<i>quick, three seahs of choice flour</i>” [Genesis, 18:6]. This means, Abraham shouted at Sarah: go quickly and hurry. She was walking slowly, like someone who is indolent and lazy. The <i>rabbis</i> say that they have two additional bad traits. They cannot tolerate negative things about them and they get very angry at it very quickly, as we find concerning Sarah, who was angry with <i>Abraham because of Hagar.</i> The other thing is that women speak a great deal, as we find concerning <i>Miriam,</i> “<i>Miriam spoke</i>” [Numbers, 12:1]. <i>Rabbi Joshua</i> said: when the Holy One wanted to create the woman, the Holy One first thought about from which of the man’s organs he should create her, as the verse says, “<i>the Lord God fashioned the rib</i>” [Genesis, 2:22]. This means, God wanted to create the woman. The Holy One said: I will not create her from the eye of <i>Adam.</i> She will have a big eye to see everything. Though she was not created from the eye, nonetheless, she looks at everything, like Eve, who desired with her eye to eat the apple. The Holy One said: I will not create the woman from the ear. She will want to hear everything. If I would create her from the mouth, then she would want to speak much. If I would create her from the hand, then she would become a <i>thief.</i> If I would create her from the foot, then she would run from house to house. Thus, the Holy One said: I will create her from an organ that is hidden, from a rib from <i>Adam</i>’<i>s</i> side. However, none of it helped. It all occurred, even with the most important women. The first, with Eve and her eye. Concerning Sarah, with her ear; she heard what the angels were saying. Concerning <i>Rachel</i>, she stole <i>Laban</i>’<i>s</i> images with her hands. Concerning <i>Leah</i>, she was a runner, as the verse says, “<i>Leah went out to meet him</i>” [Genesis, 30:16]. Concerning <i>Miriam the righteous woman</i>, she spoke <i>slander</i> against her brother, Moses. This was because he was not fulfilling his <i>marital obligations</i> with his wife <i>Zipporah.</i> Therefore, each woman and each man should be warned not to engage in slander.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Deuteronomy Rabbah</i>, 6.11. The explanation for Miriam’s speaking against Moses is found in <i>Deuteronomy Rabbah</i>, 6.14.</i>
Some women can be frivolous and they can be quickly persuaded. They can be persuaded, even when they are mourning their dead, as we find written in [tractate <i>Kiddushin</i>] chapter four, in the <i>Tosafot.</i> A story about a woman who cried very much, day and night in the <i>cemetery</i>, over her husband who had died. Near the cemetery there was a gallows on which a thief was hanging. A man was guarding him so that the thief should not be cut down, since the king had commanded that <i>guard</i> to guard the thief on the gallows. The <i>guard</i> heard the woman crying in the <i>cemetery.</i> He came to her and convinced her to sleep with him in the <i>cemetery.</i> He did not have to say much and she did as he asked. During this time, the thief was cut down from the gallows. The guard cried out and said: what will I say to the king? He will kill me, because I have allowed the thief to be cut down from the gallows. The woman was compassionate to the guard and said to the guard: I will give you an idea. Dig up my husband out of his grave and hang him on the gallows instead of the thief. The guard immediately did so and hung her husband on the gallows. From here we can learn that some women are frivolous. However, heaven forbid, one should not say this about all women.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Tosafot, “Ki”, B. Kiddushin, 80b. The story is also found in the <i>Mayse Bukh.</i> It is No. 107 in the Gaster edition and No. 108 in the critical edition of Astrid Starck.</i>
Because of slander, the Shekhinah removes itself from Israel. <i>Midrash Rabbah</i> writes in this portion, since slander is like worshiping a <i>foreign god</i>, therefore the Shekhinah removes itself. That is why the Torah wrote here, “<i>remember what the Lord your God did to Miriam</i>” [24:9]. This means that she spoke <i>slander.</i> Therefore, the Shekhinah removed itself from Israel.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Deuteronomy Rabbah</i>, 6.14.</i>
The Torah also wrote nearby, “<i>when you lend to your countryman</i>” [24:10]. This means, you should lend to your friend. That is to say, from slander the Shekhinah removes itself, and when you give charity and lend to your friend, then the Shekhinah will appear to you, as we find in <i>Midrash Rabbah. Rabbi Abin</i> said: the poor person stands at his door and the Holy One stands at the right hand of the poor person, as the verse says, “<i>He stands at the right hand of the needy</i>” [Psalms, 109:31], and pays each one his reward.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Leviticus Rabbah</i>, 34.9.</i>
“<i>It will be to your merit before the Lord your God</i>” [24:13]. That is to say, with your charity, God will be before you.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Deuteronomy, 24:13.</i>
“<i>You shall not abuse the needy</i>” [24:14]. You should not delay payment to the poor person who worked for you. Pay him before it becomes night, so that he should not call to God, and then you will have a transgression.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Deuteronomy, 24:13.</i>
“<i>You shall not take a widow</i>’<i>s garment in pawn</i>” [24:17]. You should not take a pledge from the widow. You should not go into her house to take a pledge, but she should bring out a pledge for you, when she owes you.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Deuteronomy, 24:17.</i>
“<i>Do not turn back to get it</i> … <i>in order that the Lord your God may bless you</i>” [24:19]. When you have forgotten some grain in your field, you should not go back to get it. It should be for the poor person. From here our sages learn that when a communal leader has a penny fall from his wallet, and the poor person finds it, the elder has merit as if he had given it to him. Even though he had not intended to give charity, but just like the one who forgot his grain in the field and the poor person takes it, God gives him a great reward.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Deuteronomy, 24:19.</i>
“<i>Do not go over them again</i>” [24:20]. You should leave the poor the best in your field. The verse teaches us that when you give the poor something, do not boast and make yourself look good with the poor person. You would call out, I have given charity, as the verse says, “<i>he calls many a man his loyal friend, but who can find a faithful man</i>” [Proverbs, 20:6]. This means, there are many people who call out the charity that they give to the poor. However, one who gives charity secretly and does not call out; where do we find such a person?<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Deuteronomy, 24:20.</i>
“<i>He may be given up to forty lashes</i>” [25:3]. The one who transgresses the commandments of God shall be given forty lashes at one time. One should not give him more than thirty-nine. They then tied his hands to a pillar. He was uncovered up to his heart and the <i>beadle</i> took a belt of ox hide or donkey hide and they hit him with it. They showed the person that he was worse than an ox, since the ox knows its master and also the donkey, as the verse says, “<i>an ox knows its owner, an ass it</i>’<i>s master</i>’<i>s crib</i>” [Isaiah, 1:3]. This means, the ox knows its owner and the donkey the crib of its master. However, the evildoer does not want to recognize God, who does everything good for man. Therefore, he should be beaten with a strap from an ox and a donkey. He was given forty lashes, since the person was created in the womb in forty days, and he did not keep the Torah that was given in forty days. Therefore, he should be given forty lashes. So too, <i>Adam</i> was punished with forty. <i>Adam</i> was cursed with ten <i>curses</i>, Eve with ten <i>curses</i>, the snake with ten <i>curses</i> and the earth with ten <i>curses.</i> So too, the spies were afflicted with forty years in the wilderness. From this portion our sages learn that the one who beats his friend or he beats his wife, he is beaten with forty lashes. When he accepts the lashes, he has expiation, like he suffered.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Deuteronomy, 25:3.</i>
“<i>Let your brother be degraded before your eyes</i>” [25:3]. Our sages said: when he has suffered the lashes, then he is your brother. You should not denigrate him and do not throw before him that he was shamed. This is expiation for his sin. Therefore, it is written here, your brother. This has the numerical value of thirtynine. That is, when he has suffered thirty-nine lashes, which like the word your brother, has its numerical value. He is your brother as before.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Zeror ha-Mor, Deuteronomy, 25:1.</i>
“<i>When brothers dwell together</i>” [25:5]. When two brothers have wives and one of them has no children and dies without children, the other brother should make a levirate marriage with her, expecting that the name of his brother should not be erased and forgotten. Since he dies without children, his name would be forgotten. The commandment is that the oldest brother engages in the <i>levirate marriage.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Deuteronomy, 25:6.</i>
This is how the <i>removal of the sandal</i> is done. The brother stood before the judges and the brother’s wife took off the sandal from his right foot and spit at the brother-in-law before the <i>judges</i> and she spits so that the <i>judges</i> could see it. The explanation of the <i>levirate marriage</i> is that the soul of the person is sometimes created three times. When the person dies, the same soul comes into a woman and again becomes a person in the world, as the verse says, “<i>truly, God does all these things two or three times to a man, to bring him back from the Pit, that he may bask in the light of life</i>” [Job, 33:29–30]. This means, the Holy One who created people, two or three times, expecting that he should come from <i>Gehenna</i> into the <i>Garden of Eden</i>, into the great light. The <i>Sefer Bahir</i> also writes how it often happens that a righteous person has bad things happen in this world. This happens because the soul that is now in the world that is in the righteous person may have previously been in an evildoer who had done all sorts of evil things. Therefore, the soul must now suffer in the righteous person, where it is purified and has the light of the <i>world to come.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Deuteronomy, 25:9.</i>
A parable. Somebody plants a vineyard and it does not flourish. He rips out the first roots and plants others in the garden. So too, the Holy One tests the person several times. <i>Rabbi Moses Cordovero</i> also writes that the person is created several times, in three ways. The first is if the person dies and was not able to fulfill all the commandments. The Holy One then creates him a number of times, expecting that he should fulfill all the commandments in order to come into the Garden of Eden. If one wants to ask, how is it possible to keep six hundred and thirteen commandments when someone is not a priest? He cannot keep or fulfill the commandments that the priests were commanded. In any event, there are some commandments that are comparable to the commandments of the priests. However, when one fulfills the commandments, this is accepted as if he had fulfilled the commandments of the priests. Or, the Holy One created him again and he comes into the body of a priest or a Levite, then he can fulfill the <i>commandments of the priests.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Pardes Rimonim</i>, Gate 31, chapter 7.</i>
The second is, the Holy One creates the person two or three times, expecting that the soul will <i>guide</i> the people to do good. When the soul of <i>Abel</i> later came into <i>Shem</i>, he had a <i>yeshiva</i> in the days of <i>Abraham</i> and in the days of <i>Jacob.</i> Later this same soul came into <i>Moses</i> who caused Torah to be taught to Israel. Therefore, the name of Moses had three letters. The <i>mem</i> alluded to <i>Moses</i>, the <i>shin</i> alluded to <i>Shem</i>, the <i>heh</i> alluded to <i>Abel.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Genesis, 4:25.</i> The third is, the person is often created because of his sins, that he should be purified of his sins. However, <i>Gehenna</i> cannot cause him to be cleansed and purified of his sins, when he did not keep one commandment. Therefore, the Holy One must create him again, so that he should fulfill this commandment. The Holy One does an act of lovingkindness with the people, to purify them. Sometimes the soul of an evildoer comes into a cow or a wild animal. This is because the evildoer did not keep himself <i>holy</i> and slept with gentile women, and where he was not supposed to sleep. Therefore, God brings him into a cow or a wild animal. The soul has great anguish and it comes and becomes a woman that previously was a man, or she becomes a cow. She is worthy that this cow comes into the hands of a Jew who slaughters it with a blessing and its meat is eaten on the Sabbath or a festival. Thus, the soul has merit and can be repaired. Therefore, the Torah wrote in this portion that the brother should marry his brother’s wife. Perhaps his soul will transmigrate into his wife through his brother. This is a great pleasure for the person that it comes through his brother.
“<i>Seize him by his genitals</i>” [25:11]. When two men are fighting with each other and the wife of one of the men comes and wants to help her husband and she grabs his genitals, it would be just to chop off the woman’s hand, because she had grabbed a strange man’s genitals. However, one takes money in the value of the hand, because she wanted to help her husband.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Deuteronomy, 25:12.</i>
“<i>Larger and smaller</i>” [25:13]. You should not have two weights that you will buy with the larger weight and you want to sell with the smaller weight. When one will have false weights in Israel, the Holy One will send the <i>nations of the world, heaven forbid</i>, against Israel. Therefore, the Torah showed and wrote, “<i>remember what Amalek did to you</i>” [25:17]. That is to say, when you will have false weights, then, heaven forbid, the enemies will come against you.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Deuteronomy, 25:17.</i>
“<i>Cut down all the stragglers</i>” [25:18]. <i>Amalek</i> captured the Israelites who were evildoers. The cloud threw out the evildoers from the group of Israelites. <i>Amalek</i> captured them and cut off their circumcisions and threw them toward heaven and called out, take your circumcisions. Therefore, the Holy One ordered that you should erase the name of Amalek. When you will have erased the name of Amalek, then the <i>Throne of Glory</i> and the name of God will be whole, as the verse says, “<i>but the Lord abides forever; He has set up His throne for judgment</i>” [Psalms, 9:8].<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Deuteronomy, 25:18–19.</i>

Ki Tavo

<i>King Solomon, of blessed memory</i>, said: “<i>honor the Lord with your wealth, with the best of all your income, and your barns will be filled with grain, your vats will burst with new wine</i>” [Proverbs, 3:9–10]. King Solomon showed us in this verse that the person should rely on the Holy One and the person should honor the Holy One with what he can and owns, and should feed the poor. He should know that God will repay him double. He should not think that when he will give the poor person, his wealth will decrease, but he should rely on the Holy One, who will increase his money even more, as the verse says, “<i>one man gives generously and ends with more</i>” [Proverbs, 11:24]. There are many who are not stingy and spend money on the poor. With this, they gather even more. Therefore, the verses said that you should honor the Holy One with your goods. Then the Holy One will make you rich, will increase your grain and your wine. We find this concerning the tithes. The Holy One explicitly wrote, “<i>put me to the test</i>” [Malachi, 3:10]. This means, the Holy One said test me and give <i>tithes and charity</i>, and I will make you rich. Even though concerning all the commandments, the person should not say, I will fulfill a commandment, expecting that I should have good luck with my money, as the verse says, “<i>do not try the Lord</i>” [Deuteronomy, 6:16]. This means, do not test God. However, concerning tithes, one may test God and may say, I am giving tithes and charity expecting that it will make me rich. Our sages also learned from these verses, “<i>honor the Lord with your wealth</i>” [Proverbs, 3:9]. You should honor God with what God has given you. When someone sees that he has a good voice to sing and praise God, he should not spare himself, and should sing to honor the Holy One. However, in any event he should not do it so that women and men would praise him for his voice, but to honor the Holy One. Similarly, when he was worthy to be a scribe, he should write books to learn from them. The one who writes a <i>Torah scroll</i>, his reward is like he had <i>received the Torah</i> on <i>Mount Sinai.</i> Similarly, he can be a <i>mohel.</i> His reward is very great because thirteen <i>covenants</i> were said concerning the <i>commandment of circumcision.</i> The verse “<i>honor the Lord with your wealth</i>” [Proverbs, 3:9] says this. This means, with whatever God has blessed you; you should honor the Holy One. Also, Israel are called <i>first.</i> Thus, it is just that they should bring the <i>first</i> of their <i>grain</i> and fruits to the Holy One, who is called <i>first</i>, since He is the first, before everything. Therefore, the Torah wrote here that one should bring the first fruits to the Holy One before he tests them. This is the meaning of “<i>you shall take some of every first fruit of the soil</i>” [26:2].<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Ki Tavo, Introduction.</i> This means, you should take some of every first fruit of the soil.
Toldot Yizhak writes. The intention was that the Holy One commanded them to bring the <i>first fruits</i>, because the Holy One wants to teach us that we should be whole, with all the <i>good attributes</i>, with God and with people. The first is that he should have a good attribute, that he should not have a tall neck, that is, be a glutton and a drunkard. Many bad things come from this. He quickly becomes poor from this, since he eats everything and in the end he must steal and he comes to <i>killing.</i> When he overeats, <i>bad diseases</i> come from this and in the end he will die from these diseases. However, the Torah teaches us <i>remedies</i> as to how the person should behave with eating, so that he should not come to <i>illnesses.</i> The greatest <i>physicians</i> and <i>doctors</i> write in their books, that one should guard against excessive eating and not to eat everything.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Deuteronomy, 26:1–10.</i>
So too writes the <i>Menorat ha-Maor.</i> Whoever keeps themself properly and eats little, he needs no physician, since he does not become sick.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Aboab, <i>Menorat ha-Maor</i>, <i>Ner</i> 6, <i>Klal</i> 1, <i>Helek</i> 1, <i>Perek</i> 7.</i>
Therefore, the Torah wrote here, you should bring the first fruits that grow in your garden to the Holy One. You should also wait to eat from them, but you should first bring it to the Holy One, even though the evil inclination incites you. When somebody sees something new in his garden, something he hasn’t seen for a whole year, he would gladly eat it, but he must wait. He will have benefit from eating little, and he will not eat everything that he desires. As soon as he sees a nice fig or a bunch of grapes, he had to tie a string to it as a sign that this is the first <i>fruit</i> and he will bring it to the Holy One. Thus, he will abstain from being a glutton. The second thing is that they brought the <i>first fruits</i> expecting that the person should not be arrogant. Therefore, he had to bring the <i>first fruits</i> to the priest who was in his day. Even if the person who brought the first fruits was very important and rich, yet he had to come to the priest himself. Even a king had to take the basket on his shoulder, and carry it from the <i>Temple Mount</i> to the <i>Temple courtyard</i>, and had to recite the <i>passage.</i> With this, it was shown that no person should be haughty. He had to recognize and say that God had kept His word to bring us into this good land. Therefore, they displayed the good <i>fruits</i> in the <i>Temple.</i> With this they instilled proper belief in the Holy One, since the spies had said that the Holy One had no power to bring Israel into the good land. However, now they all recognize that God had kept his oath to bring us into the good land. If the person wanted to say that the land was an inheritance, therefore they had to say at the offering of the first fruits: “<i>my father was a fugitive Aramean</i>” [26:5]. This means, <i>Laban the Aramean</i> wanted to destroy our ancestor Jacob. Therefore, we recognize that the first fruits did not come here through inheritance, but the Holy One brought us into this land. Jacob came to Egypt with a small group. Pharaoh also caused us great troubles in Egypt, and the Holy One took us out of Egypt with His power. He brought us into the land of Israel to the good fruits. We say this when things are going well for us, to remember how things went for him in the past, when he was povertystricken. Therefore, we remember at the <i>celebration of the first fruits</i>, how it was in the exile of Egypt and that God helps the poor.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Deuteronomy, 26:1–10.</i>
Zeror ha-Mor writes. The Torah wrote the two portions together. One is about Amalek and the other is about the first fruits, because Amalek came to stop Israel, that they should not come into the land of Israel to take the blessing of Isaac.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Zeror ha-Mor, Deuteronomy, 26:1.</i>
“<i>Of the dew of heaven and the fat of the earth</i>” [Genesis 27:28]. Amalek was descended from Esau, who wanted to take revenge on Jacob, who had taken away the blessings. Therefore, we praise God with the first fruits and say that the first fruits are called “<i>the first fruits of the soil</i>” [26:10]. Amalek was called “<i>a leading nation is Amalek</i>” [Numbers, 24:20]. His [Balaam’s] advice did not succeed and Israel conquered the land. “<i>The fat of the earth</i>” [Genesis, 27:28]. We have the good fruits from God who is called <i>First,</i> the first, before the first ones. They praised God for the lovingkindness that the Holy One helped us escape from Amalek and in addition we mentioned the other good things that God has helped us.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Zeror ha-Mor, Deuteronomy, 26:2.</i>
“<i>My father was a fugitive Aramean</i>” [26:5]. That is to say, Laban was a scoundrel and wanted to kill Jacob, but the Holy One helped him. Later in Egypt, Pharaoh also thought much against Israel, but the Holy One helped them. The portion teaches us about the world to come. Therefore, it says there, “<i>when you enter the land</i>” [26:1]. This means, the <i>world to come</i>, which was called, <i>the land of life</i>, that one lives forever. The world to come is called “<i>a hereditary portion</i>” [25:19], since this world is no inheritance and not a proper dwelling for the person. He is not certain every moment that he might migrate to the next world. Therefore, he says, you should take “<i>some of every first fruit of the soil</i>” [26:2]. This means that the Torah is called, the <i>beginning of wisdom.</i> In the next world they first ask you if you studied Torah. Therefore, see that you should study Torah in this world and to have Torah in the next world. “<i>Go to the place</i>” [26:2]. When you will study Torah, you will come to the Holy One, who is called <i>Makom</i>, because the Holy One is the center of all worlds, and all worlds depend on him. “<i>You shall go to the priest</i>” [26:3]. This is <i>Michael the angel</i> in heaven who <i>offers the souls</i> of the righteous before the Holy One and says, this is the soul of this righteous person and that is the <i>soul</i> of that <i>righteous person.</i> Therefore, it says, “<i>you shall then recite</i>” [26:5]. The soul praises the Holy One for the lovingkindness that He protected him from the evil inclination that is called <i>Laban the Aramean.</i> The evil inclination is full of deceit to entice the person. The soul says, “<i>with meager numbers and dwelled there</i>” [26:5]. This means that the soul says that she lived in the body with few people, since all the organs of the body follow the evil inclination, and the soul and the good inclination have few organs who follow them. Therefore, it says, “<i>you shall then recite</i>” [26:5]. This means, the organs of the person testify about the person.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Zeror ha-Mor, Deuteronomy, 26:4.</i>
The <i>first fruits</i> were brought from seven items: wheat, barley, grapes, figs, pomegranates, olives, and honey. He had to bring the best of the fruits, since for the Holy One, it is just to bring the best and the nicest. Similarly, when he has a guest, it is just to present the guest with the best from the bowl. What one gives the poor person at his table; this is in place of the <i>sacrifices</i> and <i>first fruits</i> that were an honor for the priest and an honor for the Holy One and a favor for Israel. It was an honor for the priest. They had to exert themselves to bring him good fruits for him to eat. An honor for God; one prayed on it and praised the Holy One, from whom everything good comes. It was a favor for Israel that saw its grain and fruits had increased. The core commandment was that one put each fruit in its own vessel. If someone did not want to carry many vessels, he could carry them in one vessel, but then he had to <i>organize</i> them. The barley in the bottom, the wheat on top of them, pomegranates on top of them, and figs on the very top. Between each one was a leaf. Grapes near the basket, and a pair of turtledoves hung from the basket for a sacrifice. A second pair of turtledoves was brought as a gift for the priest. The priests divided this among themselves. The whole way to Jerusalem he could give it to his servant to carry. However, when he came to the <i>Temple Mount</i>, the householder had to carry the basket on his shoulder. On the way he recited the Torah portion and praised God. Even if he was a king, he had to carry it on his shoulder. When he lowered the basket from his shoulder, the priest came and took it out of his hands. If someone had bought a tree and did not have any <i>land</i>, he brought <i>first fruits.</i> He did not recite the <i>Torah portion</i>, because he did not own any land. Therefore, he could not say: You have given me this land. A convert who brings the first fruits also does not recite the Torah portion, since he cannot say: You have given to our ancestors, since he did not have Israelite ancestors. Some sages say that the convert should recite the Torah portion, since Abraham is the father of all converts. The custom was that each householder had to recite the Torah portion by himself. If he did not know how to recite the portion, then someone read it before him and he repeated it. Later, they made a ruling that it should be read before each person, expecting that he should not be ashamed that he couldn’t read. We do the same thing today with the Torah scroll; it is read for each one. This is how they brought the first fruits. When someone on his journey came to a city with the first fruits, the important people of the city assembled with their first fruits. They slept in the street and not in any house, expecting that nobody should become ritually impure in a house. Early the next morning the leader of the group said: it is time to go. An ox went in front, to be a sacrifice. Its horns were covered in gold and a wreath of olive branches was on its head. A trumpeter went in front and blew his trumpet. They did this until they came to Jerusalem, and along the whole way they recited, “<i>I rejoiced when they said to me, we are going to the House of the Lord</i>” [Psalms, 122:1]. They walked the whole day, but they walked two parts and rested the third part. When they came close to Jerusalem, they sent messengers to inform them that they were coming. The nobles and important people of Jerusalem went out of Jerusalem toward them. When there were many people who came with <i>first fruits</i>, many people went out to meet them. When few came, a few went out toward them. When they came to the gates of <i>Jerusalem</i>, they said: “<i>our feet stood inside your gates, O Jerusalem</i>” [Psalms, 122:2]. All of the <i>craftsmen of Jerusalem</i> stood up from their work and greeted them. The trumpeter went before them until the <i>Temple Mount.</i> When they came to the <i>Temple Mount</i>, each one put down his basket and said: “<i>hallelujah, praise God in His sanctuary</i>” until “<i>let all that breathes praise the Lord, hallelujah</i>” [Psalms, 150]. The <i>Levites</i> sang [in response], “<i>I extol You, O Lord, for You have lifted me up</i>” [Psalms, 30:2]. The <i>communal leaders</i> brought their first fruits in silver and gold vessels; the poor people in a wicker basket. The poor person had to leave his basket with the priest. However, the communal leader took his vessels home with him. Our sages learn from here and say that the poor person always lost. The poverty dragged after him wherever he went.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">This passage summarizes and paraphrases M. <i>Bikkurim,</i> chapters 1–3.</i>
“<i>My father was a fugitive Aramean</i>” [26:5]. Laban wanted to kill our ancestor Jacob. Our sages say: even though he did not kill him, however, Laban had intended to kill him. When a gentile desires to commit a sin, the Holy One credits it as if he had actually committed the sin. When a gentile has the desire to fulfill a commandment, the Holy One does not credit him until he has fulfilled the commandment. When an Israelite has the desire to fulfill a commandment, even if he has not fulfilled it yet, the Holy One credits him as if he had already fulfilled the commandment. Concerning this, <i>King David</i> said: “<i>had I an evil thought in my mind, the Lord would not have listened</i>” [Psalms, 66:18]. This means, even if I had the thought in my heart to commit a sin, yet God does not accept it. Therefore, because he desired to build the <i>Temple</i>, the verse wrote about David as if he had built the House, as the verse says, “<i>A psalm of David, a song for the dedication of the House</i>” [Psalms, 30:1].<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Deuteronomy, 26:5.</i>
“<i>I have given it to the Levite</i>” [26:13]. One first had to separate the <i>great terumah</i> for the priest. Afterwards, one had to give the <i>first tithe</i> to the Levite. The Levite had to separate a <i>tithe</i> to give the <i>priest</i>, from his <i>tithe.</i> Then the Israelite had to separate a <i>tithe</i>, which he kept, to bring it to <i>Jerusalem</i>, and had to eat it in Jerusalem. Afterwards, he had to give the <i>tithe for the poor</i> in the third year of the <i>Sabbatical cycle.</i> When he brought the <i>first fruits</i>, he said and praised God that he had brought all the <i>tithes</i> and <i>terumot.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Deuteronomy, 26:13.</i>
“<i>The Lord your God commands you this day to observe</i>” [26:16]. Even though the Holy One said this forty years after the time that the Holy One had given the Torah, and now says, I have given you the Torah, because He wants to teach us and show that the person should always have his thoughts as if he had just received the Torah now. It is so beloved by the person that he thinks it is something new and he must write down the Torah, because the people will forget the <i>giving of the Torah.</i> Therefore, the Holy One says, he should think that he received the Torah today. The verse began with “<i>this day</i>” and ends “<i>with all your soul</i>” [26:16]. This shows us that the person should risk his life for the Torah, just like at <i>Mount Sinai</i>, there was great fire, lightning and thunder, nonetheless Israel stood and wanted to hear the words of the Holy One.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Deuteronomy, 26:16.</i>
“<i>Observe all the Instruction</i>” [27:1]. The Holy One commanded that when you will come to cross the Jordan, you should take twelve stones and you shall place them as a sign and a <i>memorial.</i> You should write the whole Torah on them. There were twenty-four stones. Twelve of them were in the river Jordan; the priests who carried the ark had to stand on them, so their feet should not sink into the mud of the Jordan. The other twelve were taken from the Jordan and they built an altar from them. They wrote the Torah on Mount <i>Ebal.</i> Afterwards, they took these stones to the city of <i>Gilgal</i> and they wrote the whole Torah from “<i>In the beginning</i>” [Genesis, 1:1] until “<i>before all Israel</i>” [Deuteronomy, 34:12] on those stones in seventy languages.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Deuteronomy, 27:1.</i>
“<i>To enter the land that the Lord your God is giving you</i>” [27:3]. That is, when you study Torah and also write it, you will be worthy to come into the land of Israel. The Torah causes the enemies to be cut down in the land.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Deuteronomy, 27:3.</i>
“<i>The following shall stand to bless</i>” [27:12]. Six tribes of Rachel and Leah stood on mount <i>Gerizim</i> to bless Israel; those who fulfill the Torah. Six <i>tribes of Bilhah and Zilpah</i> stood on mount <i>Ebal</i> to curse Israel, those who would not fulfill the Torah. Levites and priests and all of Israel stood between these two mountains. The priests turned their faces to <i>mount Gerizim</i> and blessed Israel. They all said <i>amen</i> to this. Then the priests turned their faces to <i>mount Ebal</i> and cursed whoever would not fulfill the Torah, and they said <i>amen</i> to this.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Deuteronomy, 27:12.</i>
They mentioned eleven sins in their curses. First they mentioned the one who worships foreign gods and wants to deny the Holy One, which is comparable to all the other sins. Afterwards, they mentioned the one who does not honor his father and mother. These sins are compared to each other because there are three who help create the person. First is the Holy One, and afterwards, father and mother, as the Talmud says in <i>tractate Nidah.</i> Three are <i>partners</i> in the person, father, mother and the Holy One. The father gives him the white of the bones, the veins and nails, the brain and the white of the eyes. The mother gives the person the red, the skin and flesh, the blood and the black of the eye. The Holy One gives the soul and the visage and that he can hear, speak, walk, and wisdom and intellect. When the time comes for the person to die, the Holy One takes His part and allows the part of father and mother to lie there. <i>Rav Papa</i> said: the people have a saying. When the salt leaves the flesh, the flesh stinks and one gives it to the dog. So too it is when the soul was in the person, the body was beautiful and did not stink. However, when the soul left, the body stinks.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Nidah</i>, 31a.</i>
The Talmud writes in the first <i>chapter of</i> [tractate] <i>Kiddushin.</i> The Holy One said: since there are three partners in the person, when the son honors father and mother, it is appropriate that He honor Me.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Kiddushin</i>, 30b.</i>
“<i>Cursed be he who will not uphold the terms of the Teaching</i>” [27:26]. Cursed be the person who does not want to keep the commandments with their whole heart. He must have in his thoughts to fulfill the commandment and should believe that God commanded the commandment. Therefore, when he fulfills commandments, he should be happy to keep it, because God has commanded it. Our sages learn from this verse that the <i>one who lifts the Torah scroll</i> in the synagogue must show the <i>Torah scroll</i> with the writing to the people so that they should see the writing.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban, Deuteronomy, 27:26.</i> <i>Rabbi Yudin son of Simon</i> said: The verse says, “<i>return, O Israel to the Lord your God</i>” [Hosea, 14:2]. This means repentance. When someone does something like worshiping foreign gods, God forgives him.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Pesikta de Rav Kahana</i>, 24.4.</i>
Our sages say in the <i>Pesikta.</i> “<i>Return, O Israel to the Lord your God</i>” [Hosea, 14:2]. A parable. A person <i>embarrasses his friend</i> before many people. Afterwards, he wants to ask forgiveness. The friend responds: you have shamed me before many people. Bring together many people and ask my forgiveness. However, the Holy One is not like this. When someone worships foreign gods and says many bad things about the Holy One, the Holy One said: be pious and have regret in your heart, even if no person knows anything, but Myself. Then I will forgive your sins. This is the verse that says, “<i>to the Lord your God.</i>” That is to say, only repent so that God knows and no person knows. That is, you should have regret in your heart and speak quietly with your mouth that you will never again commit that sin.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Pesikta de Rav Kahana</i>, 24.12.</i>
However, <i>repent with joy</i>, with your whole heart, since the person is obligated to fulfill each commandment with joy and happiness, with a joyous heart, as the verse says in this portion, “<i>because you would not serve the Lord your God in joy</i>” [28:47]. This means, the curses that are written in this portion will come upon those who fulfill the commandments and are not joyous in doing them. The Holy One pays a double reward when the person fulfills a commandment with joy.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Deuteronomy, 28:47.</i>
His intention should be to fear God, as the verse in the portion says, “<i>to reverence this honored and awesome name</i>” [28:58]. This means, you should fear God and keep the commandments. This is the best attribute. He should fear God, and the person can fulfill this commandment <i>every moment</i> wherever he goes. He can think about fearing God in his heart, day and night. However other commandments, like phylacteries and zizit, and other similar ones, he can only fulfill them when he is wearing phylacteries or zizit. However, fearing God he can fulfill at any time. Concerning this, the verse says, “<i>the fear of the Lord is pure, abiding forever</i>” [Psalms, 19:10]. This means, fear of God is a pure thing, which is eternal and is easy and doable at any time.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Deuteronomy, 28:58.</i>
The Holy One only desires repentance with a whole heart. The Holy One will forgive us for our sins and will redeem us from the exile, as the verse says in the portion, “<i>when all these things befall you</i> – <i>and you return to the Lord your God</i> – <i>He will bring you together again from all the peoples</i>” [30:1–3]. This means, when you have accepted all the curses and were dispersed among the nations. When you will repent, then the Holy One will gather you in your land, as previously with our ancestors.

Nitzavim

King Solomon, of blessed memory, said. “<i>Open reproof is better than concealed love</i>” [Proverbs, 27:5]. This means, open rebuke is better than concealed love.
He lets us know that reproof makes the one who accepts it alive, and it makes the one who does not accept it dead, as the verse says, “<i>a healing tongue is a tree of life</i>” [Proverbs, 15:4]. This means, the tongue that reproves the people makes life and makes death, as the verse says, “<i>he who spurns reproof will die</i>” [Proverbs, 15:10]. The one who does not want to hear reproof, will die. Whoever wants to reprove his friend, must tell him the truth, and should not flatter him. Concerning this the verse says, “<i>Open reproof is better</i>” [Proverbs, 27:5]. That is to say, it is better when someone reproves his friend openly with words and tells him the truth, even if he will hate him because of it. This is better than someone who refrains and does not want to tell his friend the sins that he committed. He does not want that his friend should hate him. This is the meaning of the verse “<i>than concealed love</i>” [Proverbs, 27:5]. It is known that there are many rabbis who reprove the people. They avenge themselves on the people and talk about their disgraces, but not <i>for the sake of heaven.</i> Therefore, the verse says here, “<i>Open reproof is better than concealed love</i>” [Proverbs, 27:5]. That is to say, the reproof is good when one tells the people, but only when it is with love from the scholar. This is the meaning of the verse “<i>than concealed love</i>” [Proverbs, 27:5]. <i>Kimchi</i> writes about the verse: the reproof is good when one expresses it, but in any event when he loves his friend, then he reproves him privately, alone, not to shame him, as the verse says, “<i>Open reproof is better</i>” [Proverbs, 27:5]. It is good that the reproof from the Holy One to Israel were public. They are called, <i>love</i>, since it is just to love Him. Since the reproof comes from the Holy One, it is good. Despite all the curses that were in the time of the first Temple, the second Temple, and the two exiles, yet Israel has continued to exist.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Nizavim, Introduction.</i>
Therefore, the verse says here in the portion, “<i>You stand this day, all of you, before the Lord your God</i>” [29:9]. That is to say, you Israel do not fear the curses and reproofs that were foretold the previous week, in the previous Torah portion, that will come upon Israel when they will commit sins. However, in any event, Israel will continue to exist, and will eternally remain standing. Moses gathered all of Israel to make them swear that they would keep the Torah. The first oath that Israel swore at Mount Sinai, they did not keep this oath and made the Golden Calf as a foreign god. Therefore, Moses made Israel swear again in the land of Moab and said, “<i>You stand this day, all of you, before the Lord your God</i>” [29:9]. That is to say, you are all standing before God, just like at Mount Sinai where God was with you. Therefore, fear and <i>faithfully</i> swear to keep it, as the verse says here, “<i>you stand.</i>” This shows us that Israel will have a permanent existence in the world. Therefore it says, “<i>You stand this day</i>,” just like the verse says, “<i>the Lord exists forever; Your word stands firm in heaven</i>” [Psalms, 119:89]. Afterwards, the verse says, “<i>before the Lord your God</i>” [29:9]. That is, you will have eternal life and existence not only in this world, but even in the world to come; you will come before the Holy One. This is the meaning of “<i>before the Lord your God</i>” [29:9], the world to come. Therefore, it also says, “<i>all of you</i>” [29:9]. That is to say, all of Israel, as the sages say, <i>all of Israel has a share in the world to come.</i> Our sages say, “<i>you stand this day</i>” [29:9]. As the day was first dark and then it becomes light, so too is your exile; it is dark, but in the end it will become light, as the verse says, “<i>for the Lord shall be your light everlasting</i>” [Isaiah, 60:19]. This means, God will be a light for you. “<i>All the men of Israel</i>” [29:9]. Our sages say, from this verse all of Israel were <i>guarantors</i> for each other. When someone commits a sin, then the others must also suffer, as the verse says, “<i>they stumble over each other</i>” [Leviticus, 26:37]. Our sages said that one Israelite must suffer for his brother who commits sins, since all Israelites are <i>guarantors</i> for each other. Similarly, a righteous person also helps all of Israel, as the verse says, “<i>the righteous is an everlasting foundation</i>” [Proverbs, 10:25]. Our sages explain that the whole world exists for the sake of one righteous person.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Deuteronomy, 29:9.</i>
“<i>With its sanctions</i>” [29:11]. With an oath. The Holy One commanded an adjuration and an oath. He will not exchange Israel and they will be His people forever, even when they will be evil. God is their God forever, as the verse says, “<i>seeing that the Lord undertook to make you His people</i>” [I Samuel, 12:22]. This means that the Holy One swore that Israel should be His people. The word “<i>seeing that</i>” means to swear, just as the word <i>alah</i> also means to swear.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Deuteronomy, 29:11.</i>
“<i>Not with you alone</i>” [29:13]. The oath that Israel took was to keep the Torah and it was also for all future generations and not only for those who were present at that time. Our sages say that all the souls that were created since the creation of the world. They were all present at that oath. Therefore, each person should know and remember that he swore to keep the Torah. He should be warned to keep his oath. However, perhaps there are those who do not believe in the oath. They are, because of our sins, transgressing and say, I am not afraid of the curses. He says, I will go after my heart’s desire. There are many righteous people in the world. They will protect me. I am an individual who commit sins, and I will follow my heart’s desire until I have had a taste and then I will stop. However, he does not know anymore that he will only have his bite. He will have more desire to commit sins and he never has enough. He thinks he will make his evil inclination satiated. First, he makes the evil inclination very hungry by having thoughts of committing sins. Afterwards, God punishes him for these evil thoughts, since much depends on the heart’s thoughts. When the person is happy in his heart to fulfill a commandment, then his reward is great. Similarly, when he is happy to commit sins, then his evil payment is very great. There are some people who are sad in their heart when they have committed a sin, and they say, why have we sinned? His heart is stopped up and his sin is not so great because his heart is stopped up and also because his heart has regrets. However, there are also many people whose heart burns for the sin. They would gladly commit the sin again. This has a double evil payment, to pay him with pain and suffering. Concerning this, our sages said, “<i>thoughts of a sin are worse than the sin itself.</i>” This means that the sin that the person thought about for a long time and then does it, this sin is very evil because he first had impure thoughts to do evil. Maimonides writes. When the person <i>contaminates his thoughts</i> so that his heart has thoughts to commit sins, his <i>soul becomes impure.</i> This is a great sin that he thinks about the sin. He wants to do it again and he does it. The Holy One <i>judges</i> him with <i>evil punishments.</i> However, before he does the act, the Holy One does not <i>judge</i> him for the evil thoughts, since the Holy One does not <i>judge</i> Israel for evil thoughts alone, when he has not yet committed the sin. However, the person should not accustom himself to have evil thoughts, since in the end he will have to do this. The Holy One leads the person in accordance with the evil thoughts for which the person has desires.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Deuteronomy, 29:18.</i>
“<i>Perchance there is among you some man or woman</i> … <i>whose heart is even now turning</i>” [29:17]. This means, perhaps there will be a man or woman who will turn their heart to commit sins. Afterwards, the verse says, “<i>the Lord will never forgive him</i>” [29:19]. This means, God will not want to forgive the sins. Here one asks a question. When somebody does not repent, then it is just that God does not forgive. However, when he does repent, how is it possible that the Holy One should not forgive him? The explanation is that He first says, “<i>whose heart is even now turning away</i>” [29:17]. This means, his heart desires to commit sins, and when he repents, the Holy One forgives him because the evil inclination incited him and brought forth his desires. However, afterwards the verse says, “<i>I follow my own willful heart</i>” [29:18]. This means, the person says, I will commit sins willfully and afterwards he wants to repent for it.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Deuteronomy, 29:17–19.</i>
Through repentance I will have more reward than if I had always been righteous, as the Talmud says, “<i>the place where penitents stand, even completely righteous people cannot stand.</i>”<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Berakhot</i>, 34b.</i> This means, in the Garden of Eden, where the <i>penitents</i> stand, even the most <i>righteous</i> will not have such a good place. Therefore, the verse tells us here that when the person would willingly commit sins, expecting that he would do penance so that he would have a good place in the Garden of Eden, the Holy One will not forgive that person his sins, as the Talmud states, “<i>the one who says, I will sin and repent, he is not forgiven the opportunity to repent.</i>” <sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">M. <i>Yoma</i>, 8.9.</i> This means, the one who will commit sins expecting that he will repent, God does not forgive him.
“<i>The Lord uprooted them</i> … <i>and cast them into another land</i>” [29:27]. Because Israel did evil, the Holy One destroyed them and threw them out of their land into foreign lands. That is why [the letter] <i>Lamed</i> is larger in the word <i>va-yashlikhem</i> [cast them out]. That is, rulership and dominion were taken away from Israel.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Deuteronomy, 29:27.</i>
“<i>Concealed acts concern the Lord our God</i>” [29:28]. The concealed things are for God and the open things are for us. That is to say, the sins that we see Israelites commit, we are obligated to punish them. However, the hidden sins that Israelites commit are for God, since God will punish the concealed sins. Israel are guarantors for each other. Therefore, one should watch who commits a sin in order to punish them, so that the innocent should not be liable.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Deuteronomy, 29:28.</i>
Another explanation is that there are some commandments that we don’t know the reason why the Holy One commanded them. Therefore it says, “<i>Concealed acts concern the Lord our God</i>” [29:28]. That is, we should do the concealed commandments for God’s sake, because He commanded them.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Deuteronomy, 29:28.</i>
“<i>Overt acts, it is for us and our children</i>” [29:28]. That is to say, the commandments that we do whose reason is written and we understand. We should reveal them and tell their reason to our children, just as the Torah wrote concerning the <i>Exodus from Egypt</i>, “<i>teach them to your children</i>” [11:19]. This means, you should teach the Torah to your children and you should make them knowledgeable about the reason for every commandment, to the extent to which you know the reason.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Deuteronomy, 29:28.</i>
Another explanation is “<i>Concealed acts concern the Lord our God</i>” [29:28]. That is to say, concealed sins are for the Holy One. One should repent for the hidden sins that are against the Holy One. One should repent to God alone and He will forgive them. However, “<i>Overt acts, it is for us and our children</i>” [29:28]. That is to say, that which is overt, that is for us together and for our children. However, for the same sins one must publicly repent for what one did to one’s friend and must atone for what he did to him.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Deuteronomy, 29:28.</i>
“<i>You return to the Lord your God</i> … <i>with all your soul. Then the Lord your God will restore your fortunes</i>” [30:2–3]. This verse teaches us that the Messiah does not come until all the souls have been created. There is a treasury in heaven and all the souls are there from the <i>six days of creation.</i> Therefore, the verse says here, when all the souls that have been created will come before the Holy One. At that time the Messiah will come to redeem us from all the ends of the earth where we have been dispersed. The Holy One will remove all the stopped up hearts, as the verse says, “<i>the Lord your God will circumscribe your heart</i>” [30:6]. The <i>evil inclination</i> will be removed in the days of the Messiah, and even the nations of the world will keep the Torah.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Deuteronomy, 30:2–3.</i>
“<i>It is not too baffling for you, nor is it beyond your reach</i>” [30:11]. The verse teaches us that the Torah is easy for the people to learn, since one can learn Torah with one’s mouth and heart. One does not have to go to heaven or across the sea for the Torah. Therefore, it says here, “<i>in your mouth and in your heart, to observe it</i>” [30:14]. Since all the commandments are in these three. The first is to speak Torah with the mouth. The second is to think that God is <i>one</i> with his heart. The third is that one must go to fulfill commandments. Concerning this, our sages said: the world stands on three things. On Torah, this is speaking with the mouth, and on <i>prayer</i>, this is having good thoughts for God in one’s heart, and <i>charity</i>, that one must do with one’s money.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Deuteronomy, 30:14.</i>
<i>Ramban</i> writes. This verse teaches us about repentance that it is easy for the person, but with mouth and heart to have good thoughts of regret. Therefore, it says here, “<i>the thing is very close to you in your mouth and in your heart, to observe it</i>” [30:14].<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban, Deuteronomy, 30:11.</i>
Therefore, it also says here, “<i>see, I set before you this day life and prosperity</i>” [30:15].<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">From here to the end of this Torah portion is drawn from, Aboab, <i>Menorat ha-Maor</i>, <i>Ner</i> 5, <i>Klal</i> 1, <i>Helek</i> 1, <i>Perek</i> 1–3.</i> That is to say, see before you the day that is written for a person to live, for life and good and for death and evil. Therefore, think to repent. The time comes that God accepts the repentance of the person. Therefore, one must begin to remind people about repentance. It is known that repentance among people is divided into seven parts. The first repentance and the best repentance is that the person repents as soon as he committed the sin. He repents for it and has regret for it. Concerning this repentance, the Talmud says in <i>chapter ten</i> [in tractate <i>Sanhedrin</i>], that in the place where the <i>penitents</i> stand in the <i>Garden of Eden</i>, even the greatest righteous people cannot stand there, since the place of the <i>penitents</i> in the Garden of Eden is higher than that of the righteous.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Sanhedrin</i>, 99a.</i> The righteous person who never had any desire for a prostitute, since he was very careful to separate himself from women, it is no novelty that he did not solicit a prostitute. However, the evildoer who was accustomed to go to prostitutes and he repents. He accustoms himself and when he has the opportunity to go after prostitutes, he compels his evil inclination and afflicts his body, since he does not want to go to prostitutes. He has a great reward from the Holy One and his place in the Garden of Eden is greater than that of all the righteous ones. Some rabbis say that the <i>penitent</i> stands in such a place in the Garden of Eden where no righteous person should stand. That is to say, the <i>penitent</i> must have a different path where he should go to the Holy One in the Garden of Eden, since on the way, before he comes to the Holy One, there are many evil angels who do not want to allow the penitent to go before the Holy One. They say to him: you have committed great sins. You are not worthy to come before the Holy One. Thus, the Holy One must make him a different path, not where the other righteous people go before the Holy One, expecting that he should miss these evil angels. The Holy One is compassionate and wants that people should repent. Concerning this, <i>Rabbi Abahu</i> said: where the <i>penitents</i> stand, no righteous people stand in that place,<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Berakhot</i>, 34b.</i> since the Holy One makes a separate place for the penitents. The penitents soon have regret for their sins. This is the best repentance among the seven parts that we will write about. This means that the penitent had a desire for such sins that the intellect itself did not think of, like illicit sex with a married woman, since it was contemptible. The person said: it is not wrong, but the evildoer has a desire for such sins and refrains for the sake of God, because God has forbidden it. Therefore, his reward from the Holy One is great. His intellect thinks that it is not wrong, but when he desires to kill or maim people and to rob and steal, the person himself could think on his own that killing is wrong, even if the Torah had not forbidden it. Therefore, when the person desires to commit these sins and he stops himself and does not do them, his reward is not as great, since what kind of novelty is it that he does not do it? His intellect does not allow him to do it, even if the Torah had not forbidden it.
The second group of <i>penitents</i> is when someone is full of sins all of his days and recognizes in his youth to repent and has regret when he is young. The evil inclination burns very strongly in a young person, more than in an old person from whom the evil inclination has departed. However, when he is young and has committed a sin a number of times and he desires to do it again and can do it again, but if he leaves the sin for the sake of the Holy One and not do it, as the Talmud says in [tractate Yoma] <i>chapter eight.</i> Who is called a <i>penitent? Rabbi Judah</i> said: when he is still young and has previously committed the same sin with the same woman and he does not do it again, he is called a <i>penitent.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Yoma</i>, 86b.</i>
The third group is when he is young and strong. When the sin is not before him, as in the previous case, or he is ashamed and removes himself from doing it, this is also a form of repentance that the Holy One accepts. Concerning this, the Talmud says in the first chapter of [tractate] <i>Avodah Zara.</i> “<i>Happy is the man who fears the Lord</i>” [Psalms, 112:1]. <i>Rabbi Amram</i> said: happy is the man who fears God, when he is a man and is strong and young. Therefore, the verse says, <i>man.</i> That is to say, a young and strong man.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Avodah Zara,</i> 19a.</i>
The fourth <i>attribute of repentance.</i> He commits no sin because he fears troubles and people who would punish him, as we find concerning the city of <i>Nineveh.</i> They did not repent until they were punished and Jonah made the people afraid that the city of <i>Nineveh</i> would be destroyed in forty days. They immediately repented out of fear, yet the Holy One accepted their repentance because they had regret. Thus, the Holy One accepted their prayer and repentance, as the Talmud says in [tractate <i>Ta</i>’<i>anit</i>] <i>chapter two.</i> The one who dons a sack or fasts does not help much, but repentance and <i>good deeds</i> do help, as the verse says concerning the city of Nineveh, “<i>God saw what they did, how they were turning back from their evil days</i>” [Jonah, 3:10].<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Ta</i>’<i>anit</i>, 16a.</i> This means, the Holy One saw their good deeds and they had regret for their evil deeds, but fasting and donning a sack were not mentioned.
The fifth attribute of repentance is when someone has regret for his sins because he has troubles, yet the Holy One accepts his repentance, as the verse says, “<i>when you are in distress because all these things have befallen you and in the end, return to the Lord your God</i>” [Deuteronomy, 4:30]. This means, when you will have troubles and you will repent, the Holy One will forgive you.
The sixth form of repentance is when he is old and does not have the strength to commit sins. He has regret even for the sins that he committed when he was young. When he repents with his whole heart, the Holy One accepts the repentance, as the verse says, “<i>you return man to dust</i>” [Psalms, 90:3]. This means, you should repent when you are old and have no more strength. Though you are buffeted and broken; yet the Holy One will accept your repentance. Concerning this, the Talmud says in the first chapter of [tractate] <i>Kiddushin. Rabbi Simeon</i> said: a righteous person who is righteous all his life and in his last days he becomes evil, he has lost all of his merits, as the verse says “<i>the righteousness of the righteous shall not save him when he transgresses</i>” [Ezekiel, 33:12].<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Kiddushin</i>, 40b.</i> This means, the righteous deeds that the righteous person did for a long time do not help when he becomes an evildoer in the end. When somebody was an evildoer all of his days and he becomes righteous, his earlier sins are wiped out, as the verse says, “<i>nor shall the wickedness of the wicked cause him to stumble when he turns back from his wickedness</i>” [Ezekiel, 33:12]. This means, the sins of the evildoer are not remembered when he repents for his earlier sins and regrets the sins that he had committed for a long time.
The seventh form of repentance is when he has no <i>regret</i> all of his days, but when he sees that he is close to death, then he has regret and repents now, when he is about to die. This repentance is very small and the worst form of repentance of all the forms of repentance, yet the Holy One accepts it, as the Talmud says in [tractate <i>Shabbat</i>], <i>chapter two.</i> When the person is still healthy he should let himself think that he has been called before a judge, and that he must die the way he will defend himself. If he has become sick, then he should let himself think as if he has been imprisoned. When he is lying in bed and ill, he should let himself think that he is being led out to be put to death. When he has many good <i>intercessors</i>, then he might be protected.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Shabbat</i>, 32a.</i> However, when it is not so, he must die. However, when the person repents when he is about to die with his whole heart and has regret, the Holy One forgives his sins. However, when the person dies and has no regret for his sins, then he goes into Gehenna forever. Concerning this, <i>King Solomon</i> said: “<i>for there is no action, no reasoning, no learning, no wisdom in Sheol, where you are going</i>” [Ecclesiastes, 9:10]. This means, when you can repent in this world, do it soon, before you will die, since in the depths of Gehenna there are no <i>good deeds</i> and no <i>repentance.</i> Therefore, the prophet wrote, “<i>turn back from your evil ways, that you may not die, O House of Israel</i>” [Ezekiel, 33:11]. That is to say, repent before you will die, and when you repent, the Holy One will forgive you.
It is known that the <i>penitents</i> are divided into five parts. It is like five <i>groups</i> that are traveling on a ship on the sea. They travel for a long time and cannot reach the <i>shore.</i> A day comes when the wind blows strongly and leads the ship onto a mountain in the sea. It is surrounded on all four sides by the sea and there are beautiful trees with many varieties of good fruit on that mountain. There are also very nice fountains on that mountain and the people enjoyed themselves very much there. There were five <i>groups</i> on the ship. One <i>group</i> thought to itself. How can we leave the ship and go onto the mountain? Perhaps a strong wind might come and carry away the ship, and we will be stranded on the island and will die. Should we be lost for the sake of fruits and other delights? They did not want to leave the ship. The second group went a short distance from the ship and did not tarry long and soon went back to the ship and took their places in the ship. The third group leaves the ship and goes out onto the mountain and eats good fruits until a wind comes and the ship’s crew trumpet that they should come back to the ship. This group runs quickly to the ship, but they find it is tight in the ship since other people were sitting in their seats. The fourth group is those who eat and drink good fruits on the mountain for a long time. They go all over the mountain for a long time to see everything and when they trumpet from the ship, this group says: they first have to raise the sails; we will remain for a while. When they raise the sail, this group says that they will eat first. They tell the crew: we will remain for a while and eat and drink on the mountain, until they see the ship moving away from the mountain. This group says: if we tarry a bit longer, we will not be able to get to the ship. They immediately run to the ship and have to go into the water up to their necks, since the ship had left the port. They come into the ship and find their place is very tight. They have lost their place. The fifth group eats and drinks on the mountain and do not think about coming to the ship. The ship left long ago and they must remain on the island. Winter comes and it is very cold and all the fruits fall off and <i>wild animals</i> come after them and they are all killed and destroyed. So too is the person in this world. The <i>good deeds</i> are like the ship. When the person goes in a good way, this way leads him to the <i>world to come.</i> So is the first group of people, the very righteous who never committed sins. They do not follow the <i>evil inclination</i>, but they study day and night and watch their place. They do not go onto the mountain of delights, which are the sins. The second group from the ship is those who went to the garden on the mountain and run back to the ship. So are some people who go a little after the evil inclination and soon report, because they are still young and this is the best repentance. The third group goes onto the mountain, but when they hear the trumpet from the ship, they quickly run back to the ship. So are some people who do not repent until they are old and they see that their time is short; then they repent. He is afraid that he will die without repentance, and even though they repent, they find their place in the Garden of Eden to be cramped. The fourth group is those who remained on the mountain until the ship began to leave, and had to go into the water up to their necks. So too are the people who do not repent until they are about to die. He is afraid of death, and even though the repentance helps, yet his place in the Garden of Eden is very cramped. The fifth group is those who remain on the mountain forever. So too are some people who do not repent and they die without repentance. They come into Gehenna, into the great fire. The Midrash also writes this. “<i>Who cries, woe! Who, alas!</i>” [Proverbs, 23:29].<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanna Debe Eliyahu Rabba</i>, end of ch. 15.</i> This means, to whom is it woe and alas? To those who leave behind much money and take many sins with them into the grave. They are those who gather much money unjustly and do not properly give charity from it. He does not want to have guests in his house, and he does not lend money to the poor. When the person dies, the charity and <i>good deeds</i> accompany him, and he must leave the silver behind.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Aboab, <i>Menorat ha-Maor</i>, <i>Ner</i> 5, <i>Klal</i> 1, <i>Helek</i> 1, <i>Perek</i> 1–3, ends here.</i>

Vayeilech

<i>King Solomon, of blessed memory</i>, said: “<i>come, eat my food and drink the wine I have mixed</i>” [Proverbs, 9:5]. He compares the Torah to bread and to wine. The food of the soul is the Torah and the commandments. Therefore, the verse says, “<i>come.</i>” That is, you must go to seek the Torah where one can find it to study it. One makes oneself humble to hear from someone who knows it well. <i>King Solomon</i> teaches us that one must remove the <i>attribute of jealousy</i> from oneself and one should not hold oneself too haughty to go study Torah from his friend. How much more so, to a rabbi who is more important than he is. <i>King Solomon</i> showed even more. He compared the Torah to bread and wine, since the custom is that one must exert oneself for bread and wine, before they come to fruition. So too, the Torah; one must search for it day and night to study it. When he struggles for the sake of bread to feed the body, how much more so must he exert himself to study Torah to feed the soul? When the person can fulfill his commandments in his place, he has a reward from the Holy One, in any event. However, when he goes and exerts himself to fulfill the commandments, then the Holy One gives him a <i>double</i> reward, since he has a reward for the journey and he has a reward for fulfilling the commandment. Therefore, the portion wrote here:<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Yayelech, Introduction.</i>
“<i>Moses went</i>” [31:1]. Moses went from one <i>gate</i> to the other <i>gate</i>, to the Levites and the <i>Israelites</i> to console them. He said to them: when I will die, yet there is still Joshua who will lead you and will teach you Torah, just as I have taught you. Even though all of Israel stood together, <i>Moses</i> waited until each one had gone to his house, and then Moses went to each one separately, to their house, expecting that he would receive the reward for the trip.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban, Deuteronomy, 31:1–2.</i>
“<i>I am now one hundred and twenty years old</i>” [31:2]. Moses lived for one hundred and twenty years, which was related to the three times that he was on Mount Sinai for forty days each time, and three times forty is one hundred and twenty. The first time he received the first <i>Tablets</i> and Israel made the Golden Calf. Moses broke the Tablets, and again went up the mountain and prayed that the Holy One should forgive them for the sin of the Golden Calf. The third forty days <i>Moses received</i> the second Tablets. Therefore, Moses was worthy to live one hundred and twenty years, or three times forty. Moses was born on the seventh of <i>Adar</i> and died on the seventh day of the month of <i>Adar</i>, since the Holy One makes full the days of the righteous, as the verse says, “<i>I will let you enjoy the full count of your days</i>” [Exodus, 23:26].<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Deuteronomy, 31:1–2.</i>
“<i>I can no longer come and go</i>” [31:2]. Moses said: I can no longer go to war, and even though his <i>strength</i> was as in his youth, but Moses was consoling Israel. That is to say, do not mourn my death. I am no longer strong enough to go to war for you. Moses said all this so they should not worry, since <i>Joshua</i> would be a better <i>leader</i> than I. Our sages said: Moses said, I cannot go before you. That is, I can no longer teach you Torah. Moses was comparable to the intellect of the Torah. They asked him and he could not answer. The Holy One did this so that Moses should not mourn his death. Since he had lost his intellect, it was despicable for him to live. Another reason is that he forgot the Torah, expecting that Joshua should be better able to answer the Israelites about the Torah. Thus, they will see that Joshua was more worthy to be a leader. Moses previously wrote the whole Torah for Israel.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Deuteronomy, 31:1–2.</i>
“<i>The time is drawing near for you to die</i>” [31:14]. The day of your death is near. This verse teaches us that the Holy One decrees the time of how long the person should live and the Holy One makes the people approach the stated time for the person. Sometimes, the Holy One lengthens the time and he lives longer. Sometimes, the Holy one shortens his life. It is known that the Holy One has given everything into the power of the constellations in heaven to make someone rich and poor, as the Talmud says in [tractate <i>Moed Katan</i>], <i>chapter three.</i> The life of the person, children for the person, and food for the person, all these do not depend on the merit of good deeds, but depend on the constellations. <i>Ravah</i> and <i>Rav Hisdah</i> were both very righteous. One of them lived forty years and the other one lived sixty years. In the house of Ravah, his household did not have enough barley bread and at Rav Hisdah’s, the household did not want to eat fine flour bread, since there was so much of it in his house. Even though the Holy One placed these three things in the power of the constellations, but in any event the Holy One has power over them and can change them when the Holy One so desires, as we find concerning <i>Hezekiah.</i> He was supposed to die. The Holy One said: I will lengthen his stated years, so that he should live longer, another fifteen years. Sometimes, the Holy One shortens someone’s life, as we find concerning <i>Ahaziah son of Ahab.</i> He worshiped foreign gods and the Holy One shortened his life, as the verse says, “<i>you shall not rise from the bed which you are lying on; but you shall die</i>” [II Kings, 1:16]. This means, the prophet told him: you might have lived longer, but because you have worshiped foreign gods, therefore you must quickly die, before your time comes. The Holy One has power over the constellations to change them. The person can avert everything with his merits, even if the constellation points to an evil end, but the person has anguish in his heart and even if he does not pray, yet he averts the evil constellation with his anguish, as the verse says, “<i>He fulfills the wishes of those who fear Him</i>” [Psalms, 145:19]. This means, the Holy One does the will of the righteous, what they desire with their heart and in their prayers. However, three things are decided above, having children, having enough food, and living long. These, the person cannot <i>abrogate</i> the constellation, but he must <i>pray</i>, as the verse says, “<i>He hears their cry and delivers them</i>” [Psalms, 145:19]. He can abrogate the evil decree with prayer, and the Holy One gives him children, enough food, and long life. We find this regarding Rachel, who had no children, as the verse says, “<i>God heeded her and opened her womb</i>” [Genesis, 30:22]. This means, the Holy One heard the prayer of Rachel and gave her children. We also find this with regard to long life for <i>Hezekiah</i>, as the verse says, “<i>I have heard your prayer</i> … <i>I hereby add fifteen years to your life</i>” [Isaiah, 38:5]. This means, I have heard your prayer. I will lengthen your life by fifteen years. The food we find concerning Elijah and Elisha. God gave them food when there was famine. Therefore, our sages taught us that one could abrogate the constellation, to have children through prayer; similarly, with food and long life. The Midrash writes: Moses said, with the word “<i>Mark</i> … <i>to the Lord your God</i>” [Deuteronomy, 10:14]. I have praised you always and now You tell me with the word “<i>Mark</i>” that I will die. That is to say, You said, “<i>Mark, the time is drawing near for you to die</i>” [31:14]. The Holy One responded: with that which you praised Me, with that you will die. That is to say, death is a favor for you. You will also have more honor in the world to come. Our sages learn from here that the Holy One will bring the dead back to life. Therefore, it says, “<i>you are soon to lie</i> … <i>and will arise</i>” [31:16]. This means, though you will lie in the grave, you will rise again.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Deuteronomy, 31:14.</i>
“<i>The alien gods in the land</i>” [31:16]. The verse teaches us that no angel is appointed over the land of Israel, but the Holy One Himself is the Lord over the land of Israel. However, angels and constellations are placed over other lands. However, the Holy One Himself is the Lord in heaven over the land of Israel. Over <i>Ishmael</i> is the <i>constellation</i> called <i>Cancer.</i> Over the <i>king of the Persians</i> is the <i>constellation</i> called <i>Sagittarius.</i> Over the Philistines there is a <i>constellation</i> called <i>Capricorn.</i> Over Edom there is a <i>constellation</i> called <i>Libra.</i> Therefore, the Holy One punishes Israel more than all the other nations when they worship foreign gods, since Israel is the portion of the Holy One, but the nations are the portion of the constellations. Therefore, the nations who lived in the <i>land of Israel</i> were destroyed because they worshiped foreign gods in the holy land, in the <i>land of Israel.</i> However, in other lands when the nations worshiped foreign gods, He did not punish them, since the Holy One has His <i>supervision</i> over the <i>land of Israel</i>, and the <i>land of Israel</i> is blessed more than other lands, as the verse says, “<i>who gives rain to the earth, and sends water over the fields</i>” [Job, 5:10]. This means, the Holy One Himself gives rain over the <i>land of Israel.</i> However, over other lands He sends rain through messengers.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Deuteronomy, 31:16.</i>
“<i>Since it will never be lost from the mouth of their offspring, for I know what plan they are devising</i>” [31:21].<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The entire text from here to note 13 is one commentary. I was not able to find an author and it may well be by the author of the <i>Ze</i>’<i>enah U-Re</i>’<i>enah.</i></i> The Holy One said: the warning that is written in the Torah to Israel, that they should study Torah, will not be forgotten. The Holy One also said: the evil inclination of Israel is evil. It incites them to commit sins. Therefore, remember to repent, particularly now it is time to repent. The one who has regret for sins; he must mention the sin with his mouth. He needs to bring no other sacrifices, as the Talmud says in, [tractate <i>Yoma</i>] <i>chapter eight. Rabbi Isaac</i> said: the Holy One and His <i>attributes</i> are unlike those of people. When one person becomes angry with another, there is a question if he will be able to be reconciled with him. He does not know if he can reconcile with money or with words. However, with the Holy One, he will certainly be reconciled with words, as the verse says, “<i>take words with you</i>” [Hosea, 14:3].<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Yoma</i>, 86b.</i> This means, take good words with you to repent. The Talmud says in the first chapter of <i>tractate Sotah.</i> Judah confessed that he had slept with Tamar, his daughter-in-law. Thus, he was worthy of the world to come.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Sotah</i>, 7b.</i> Reuben also repented for throwing out Bilhah’s bed. When Rachel died, Jacob took Rachel’s bed and placed it in Bilhah’s room. Reuben went and took the bed and threw it out and said: you are a servant, how do you want to inherit Rachel’s bed, which was important? Jacob was angry and therefore Reuben repented and the Holy One forgave him, so that he had a <i>share in the world to come.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Shabbat</i>, 55b.</i> The person must explicitly state the sins that he has committed against the people, so that the people know about the sin, expecting that the people should see that he has repented. However, if it is a sin against God alone that the people do not know about, he must quietly say before God. <i>Rabbi Yannai</i> said: there were two good leaders for Israel, Moses and David. Moses, who said before God that they should write down his sins, so that people will know what sins he had committed, as the verse says, “<i>because you did not trust me</i>” [Numbers, 20:12]. Because you did not believe in me, therefore you must die. <i>David</i> said that they should not write his sins.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Yoma</i>, 86b.</i> How are Moses and David similar? A parable. Two women sinned. One of them engaged in illicit sexual relations and the other one ate figs that were forbidden to be eaten. Both of them were punished for their sins. Both of them were punished for their sins. The woman who ate the figs called out. I ask you: let them announce my sin so that people should not think that I have committed a great sin, like my colleague. They hung a fig on that woman and called out that she had eaten figs during a time when it was forbidden. Therefore, we recite [the prayer] <i>for the sin</i> [<i>Al Het</i>] on <i>Yom Kippur</i>, since all the sins are written in <i>for the sin.</i> Therefore, it is good that the woman who does not understand <i>Hebrew</i>, should be careful to recite the <i>for the sin</i> [<i>Al Het</i>] in Yiddish, expecting that when she will come to the sin that she committed that year, she will take it to heart that she did this and will cry and plead with God that He should forgive her. She will never again do it. However, when she does not understand, she will forget what she had done and would not plead about it, since the person must be sad in his heart for the sin that he did. His repentance is better than many tears, as the verse says, “<i>God, you will not despise a contrite and crushed heart</i>” [Psalms, 51:19]. This means, a broken heart and sadness do not embarrass God. When someone has committed a sin with his eye, that he saw what he should not see, he should cry and be sad and shed tears, since the tears and crying greatly help repentance. Our sages said: since the destruction of the <i>Temple</i>, the gates of prayer have been closed in heaven, but in any event the gate where the tears enter heaven are open in heaven. Just as when the body is sick, he searches for a remedy so that the illness should go away. He must also do this when the soul is sick, he must search for its remedies. When his soul is sick and desires to have much money, then he must become accustomed to giving charity and must not be stingy in giving charity. Through this, the desire for money will be removed. He should think that much good and evil comes from the money. When his soul is accustomed to pursue arrogance and haughtiness, then he must accustom himself to be humble. He should walk stooped and must think about death and how the worms will eat him in the grave. He must pursue this for a long time and through this he will become accustomed to restore this trait.
The book <i>Rokeach</i> writes that there are four kinds of repentance.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Eleazar of Worms, <i>Sefer Rokeach</i>, Hilkhot Teshuvah.</i> One is called the <i>repentance of offering.</i> This means, we he committed a sin with a <i>married woman</i>, and he encounters the same woman again, and he again desires her, and there is a place where he can again have a liaison with her, and he compels his evil inclination [not to sin], this is called the <i>repentance of offering.</i> The second form of repentance is called the <i>repentance of the fence.</i> This means, he makes himself a fence to the sin. He does not look at any woman and does not look at her clothes, or when the women dance. It is evident that he should not dance with them. The sin cannot be bigger; Gehenna is too small for him. The third form of repentance is called <i>proportionate repentance.</i> This means, the pleasure that he had from the sin, so too he must torment himself. He must fast and should not eat meat and not drink wine, except for festivals. He should not bathe himself, except for festivals. He should not go to banquets and should give himself lashes. He should not lie on a pillow, except on festivals and on the Sabbath. The fourth form of repentance is the <i>repentance of the biblical text.</i> This means, the one who slept with a <i>married woman</i> must suffer great anguish that should be as severe as death. He should sit in the cold on the ice, or in the water, or in the snow, for an hour every day. In the summer he should sit amidst flies, or mice, or bees. He should be further warned that he should not speak with women. He should repent for the sin every day, because he made that woman forbidden to her husband. He must suffer great pains, since he had persuaded a married woman. Thus, this woman is forbidden to her husband. However, when he slept with a <i>married woman</i> by force, that woman is not <i>forbidden</i> to her husband. Then he does not need more than to allow himself to receive <i>lashes</i> and must fast for forty days, and must lie on the ground. He should not bathe and should not attend celebrations. He must recite the <i>confession</i> three times with tears and mourning. If he slept with a woman who was not married, he should think that she was a menstruant because she had not immersed herself for him. He must lie on the ground and must allow himself to receive lashes every day and must fast for forty days and must confess the sin every day three times and should also not go to any celebrations. If he slept with a gentile woman, he must fast, receive lashes, eat no meat and drink no wine, and not bathe for forty days. If he stole something from his friend and had regret, he must return it to him or his heirs and should confess. He should abstain in the future from the money of strangers and should give much charity. He should ask forgiveness from the one he had stolen from, etc. The person should confess to repent and overcome his evil inclination. Therefore, the verse in the portion said, “<i>for I know his plans</i>” [31:21]. This means, I know well the thoughts of the person. When the troubles will come upon the person, the song will testify that I have warned him. From here our sages learn that in the end when the Messiah will come, the commandments of the Torah will be ended, since when the evil inclination will be abrogated, then the Torah will also be abrogated, but Purim will never be abrogated even when the Messiah will come.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">The commentary to Deuteronomy, 31:21, ends here.</i>
“<i>Since it will never be lost from the mouth of their offspring, for I know their plans</i>” [31:21]. The Torah would not be forgotten. Therefore, when the evil inclination is with them, but when the <i>evil inclination</i> will disappear in the days of the Messiah, then no Torah will be needed. This means that the <i>resurrection of the dead</i> will occur long after the Messiah, since the Messiah will come first before the <i>resurrection of the dead.</i> Therefore, one should repent. One should know that the Holy One has warned us that we should be pious. Then the Holy One will send us the Messiah.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Deuteronomy, 31:21.</i>

Ha'Azinu

<i>King Solomon, of blessed memory</i>, said: “<i>the mouth of the righteous produces wisdom, but the treacherous tongue shall be cut off</i>” [Proverbs, 10:31]. This means, the righteous person only speaks wisdom and piety. The evildoer only speaks falsehood and the opposite of the righteous one. The righteous person is compared to a tree that grows and produces leaves that protect the fruit, and also causes the fruit to grow. If the leaves were not there, then the fruit might be burned by the heat. So too is a righteous person. He speaks ordinary words when he needs to reprove his household and teaches them to engage in business. This is all necessary. Afterwards, he again speaks with his tongue the Torah and commandments. Just as with a tree where the fruit is primary, one must still have the leaves. They make the fruit grow properly. So too are the words of the righteous that he talks about merchandise and about discipline. He needs these for the Torah, since when there is no merchandise there is no Torah. Just as the leaf falls away, so too the words about merchandise are lost, but one <i>at least</i> has some pleasure from the fruit. So too are the words of Torah that the righteous person speaks. They are useful in this world and in the next world. However, the evildoer is the complete <i>opposite</i> of the righteous person. All of his attributes are the opposite of the righteous person who follows his soul in everything. However, the evildoer follows his body, which disappears and is lost. It is known that the body was created from the earth and the soul is from heaven. Therefore, while the person lives, he has a part from the earth and from heaven. Just as heaven and earth become related to the person, his soul is in heaven and his body is in the earth. Therefore, Moses warned Israel that they should study Torah and presents heaven and earth as witnesses, just like one warns someone before his relatives. Therefore, the portion says here:<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Ha’azinu, Introduction.</i>
“<i>Give ear, O heavens, let me speak; let the earth hear the words I utter</i>” [32:1]. This means, understand heaven and I will speak, and the earth should hear the words of my mouth. Therefore, Moses said to the heavens that they should understand his words, like when someone is close to another person and he says, understand me. Moses was now close to heaven. Because he was about to die, his physical powers were diminishing and everything was drawn to his soul that wanted to ascend to heaven. To the earth, Moses said: “<i>let the earth hear.</i>” This means, the earth should hear my words, like someone who is far from his friend and he must say, hear me, what I will speak. He had lost the physical powers of the body, which is from the earth. Therefore, he took heaven and earth as witnesses, since when Israel will not keep the Torah, heaven and earth will come and punish them. The heaven will not give rain and dew and the earth would not allow things to grow. Another explanation is, heaven and earth were taken as witnesses, because heaven and earth stand forever. If he had taken people as witnesses, the people would die and there would not be any witnesses. Therefore, the Holy One took heaven and earth as witnesses, since they remain forever. Another explanation is, Moses said to Israel: see if heaven changes at the command of the Holy One. See if the sun rises other than in the east. Similarly the earth, see if it changes its rules. When someone sows wheat or barley, if it does not grow from the earth as is customary. <i>Rabbi Judah son of Menasia</i> said: in the time that Moses said to the heaven, understand me, the whole heaven was silent. In the time that he spoke to the earth, hear me, the earth and everything that was on the earth was silent. Another explanation is that he said, “<i>Give ear, O heavens, let me speak</i>” [32:1]. This means, understand heaven and I will speak. Afterwards, he said, “<i>let the earth hear</i>” [32:1]. This means, the earth will hear. It should have said, <i>listen, you earth.</i> This means, listen, you earth. The explanation is that the heavens tell the praises of the Holy One that he created the world. We learn this from the heaven, as the verse says, “<i>keep in mind that the Lord alone is God in heaven and on earth</i>” [Deuteronomy, 4:39]. This means, when you will see and will know the day; that the sun rises and sets and rises again. There must be someone who causes this and that is the Holy One. However, when Moses received the Torah, and Moses told the Torah to Israel, in which it is written that the Holy One created the world. Thus, one should not need any more that the heaven with the sun show that the Holy One created the world and guides the world, since the Torah will show this. Therefore, it says, “<i>give ear, O heavens</i>” [32:1]. Just as one says to a friend, be quiet and hear what I will say, so Moses said to the heaven: both of us can tell and show that God is the creator of the world. However, in any event, because I will say Torah to Israel, you heaven listen, remain silent, and let me speak. The earth will hear that I am talking Torah. That is to say, the people who are on the earth will hear from me that I am talking Torah. Thus, they will understand and know that the Holy One is the creator. The heaven would say to Moses: why do you want to speak Torah and want to show that the Holy One is the creator of the world, and why should we, the heavens, not show this? And Moses was silent. The explanation is that the heavens cannot say the name of who is the creator. Therefore, Moses said: with my saying Torah, I will explicitly say the name of the Holy One, who created heaven and earth. Therefore, Moses says here in the portion, “<i>for the name of the Lord I proclaim; give glory to our God</i>” [32:3]. This means, since I alone can call the name of the Holy One, therefore, you heavens, should remain silent and you should understand that I am explicitly saying the name of the Holy One. You should give praise and reverence to God. You will hear that I am explicitly saying the name of the Holy One.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">I was not able to find a source for this comment.</i>
“<i>May my discourse come down as the rain</i>” [32:2]. My teachings should flow like dew, that my teachings should be <i>accepted.</i> That is to say, Moses prays that his teachings should be accepted by the people, like the rain that makes everything grow. So should my teachings be for the people. The Midrash says, “<i>may my discourse come down as the rain</i>” [32:2]. Just as the rain gives life to the world, so too the Torah is life for the world. Just as dew is a joy for the world, so too the Torah is a joy for the people.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Deuteronomy, 32:2.</i>
“<i>Give glory to our God</i>” [32:3]. Moses said: when I will call and mention the name of the Holy One, you should say, <i>blessed be the name of His majesty forever and ever</i>, after every blessing in the Temple, and <i>amen</i> after every <i>blessing</i> in the whole land.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Deuteronomy, 32:3.</i>
“<i>The Rock</i> – <i>His deeds are perfect</i>” [32:4]. <i>Rashi</i> writes: The Holy One is strong, yet when He brings a <i>trouble</i> on the evildoers, the Holy One brings the trouble slowly, not with anger, but with <i>law and justice</i>, because the Holy One is whole in all of His deeds.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Deuteronomy, 32:4.</i>
<i>Zeror ha-Mor</i> writes: “<i>May my discourse come down as the rain</i>” [32:2]. Moses said: when heaven and earth should remain still, the fools would say that this is not possible, since the world would end when the <i>constellations</i> and heaven stand still. Therefore, Moses said: my teaching should drip like rain. That is to say, when I will teach Torah, then the world will have an <i>existence</i> through my words. It will receive rain and dew through my words, when heaven and the <i>constellations</i> will stand still, since the heavens have their light from the light of the Torah. The righteous person who studies is greater than the <i>constellations.</i> Concerning this, the verse says, “<i>O Lord, our Lord, how majestic is Your name throughout the earth</i>” [Psalms 8:2]. The angels said: how strong is the name of our Lord on the earth, as the verse says, “<i>You who have covered the heavens with Your splendor</i>” [Psalms, 8:2], that the people on the earth give light and splendor to the heavens. If you want to ask, from where does this come, therefore, the verse says further in the same <i>Psalm</i>, “<i>from the mouths of infants and sucklings, You have founded strength</i>” [Psalms, 8:3]. That is to say, the Torah that the children study; from this comes the splendor in heaven and the light in heaven and on the earth. Zeror ha-Mor further writes, “<i>may my discourse come down as the rain</i>” [32:2]. My words in the portion are like a great rain that tears out all the trees and vegetation and does much damage. So too are my words here, that I will punish the people with harsh words that the Holy One will punish them with all kinds of punishment when they will not keep the Torah and God’s commandments. Therefore, Moses said: when my words are heavy like a rain, yet, “<i>my speech distill as the dew</i>” [32:2]. It will drip from the harsh words and punishments like the dew that gives joy to the people. That is to say, the Holy One punishes the one he loves, that he should remember to be pious and should not do any evil. Therefore, Moses also says, “<i>like showers on your growth</i>” [32:2]. My words are like a great wind that comes on the grass and on the grain, as if it would tear out the grain or the vegetation and destroy it. The truth is that this is very good for the grain or vegetation; it grows better because of this. The same strong wind makes the grain very strong. However, the people are very frightened by this wind, since they do not understand it. So too, are my words in the portion. They frighten the people, that I will punish the people when they will be evil. However, in truth the words are very good for the people, that they will become pious and will have blessings from these words. Therefore, the verse also says, “<i>for the name of the Lord I proclaim</i>” [32:3]. When I will call on God, and whoever will say something about God, whether it be good or evil in your eyes, you should give praise and reverence to God.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Zeror ha-Mor, Deuteronomy, 32:2–3.</i>
Zeror ha-Mor wrote further, “<i>for the name of the Lord I proclaim</i>” [32:3]. Moses said: I have committed a small sin. I called Israel “<i>rebels</i>” [Numbers 20:10], and the Holy One severely punished me. Nonetheless I call Him God and say that God is just in his deeds that He does to the people. How much more so, Israel, you have angered God many times. Therefore, “<i>give glory to our God</i>” [32:3]. You should give much more praise to God.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Zeror ha-Mor, Deuteronomy, 32:3.</i>
Therefore also, because Moses sinned four times against the Holy One, he first recounted his sins before God and praised God that He had punished him justly. The first was when the Holy One wanted to send him to <i>Pharaoh</i> in Egypt. Moses said: “<i>I have never been a man of words</i>” [Exodus, 4:10]. I have a heavy tongue and mouth to speak. The Holy One responded: who made and created speech for the person? I did this. I can also make you speak before Pharaoh. I am God the creator and the one who can heal all the people. Therefore, the Holy One said: Moses, because you did not want to go on My mission to Pharaoh, therefore, you will not be worthy to lead Israel into the <i>land of Israel</i> to conquer the thirty-one kings. Therefore, Moses says here, “<i>the Rock</i> – <i>His deeds are perfect</i>” [32:4]. That is to say, I have not done right against God when I said; I cannot speak, since God is a greater <i>artisan</i> than all <i>artisans</i>, over all the <i>craftsmen.</i> He could have made me speak before <i>Pharaoh.</i> Therefore, I praise God who correctly punished me. Concerning the second <i>sin</i> that <i>Moses</i> said to God: why have you allowed Israel’s servitude to Pharaoh to be heavy? The Holy One responded to him: now you will see what signs I will do for Israel. However, you will not see the <i>miracles</i> that I will do for Israel in the land of Israel. Concerning this, Moses says here, “<i>yea, all His ways are just</i>” [32:4]. That is to say, God is just in all of his deeds. The third sin was that Moses said: “<i>could enough flocks and herds be slaughtered to suffice them?</i>” [Numbers, 11:22]. That is to say, how can enough meat be given to Israel? The Holy One said: do I not have the power to give enough meat to Israel? If I want to, I have the power to do everything. Concerning this, he also said to <i>Moses:</i> you will see that I can give enough. However, you will not see the <i>miracles</i> that I will do in the <i>land of Israel.</i> Therefore, Moses here praised the Holy One and said: “<i>a faithful God</i>” [32:4]. God is truthful with all of His deeds. “<i>Never false</i>” [32:4]. He did not do anything unjust when He punished me. Concerning the fourth sin, Moses was supposed to speak to the rock to give water. Moses hit it with his staff. Thus, the Holy One punished him publicly and said: you will not come into the land of Israel, but you will die in the wilderness. Concerning this, Moses said here: “<i>true and upright is He</i>” [32:4]. That is to say, the Holy One is just with His <i>law</i> and judgment in what He did. Therefore, Moses said to Israel: you must <i>accept the judgment</i> and praise God that he <i>forgave</i> your sins. The Torah also alluded here to four exiles that Israel will have, because of their sins. Concerning this, they should say, “<i>the Rock</i> – <i>His deeds are perfect</i>” [32:4]. That is to say, when Israel will have troubles, they should say, “<i>the Rock</i> – <i>His deeds are perfect</i>” [32:4]. The first exile was in Babylonia. This was a strong and heavy exile, like a strong and heavy rock, and a much heavier stone than the Egyptian exile. Concerning this, he said: “<i>the Rock</i> – <i>His deeds are perfect</i>” [32:4]. This means, a strong rock of the Babylonian exile. This is much stronger than the Egyptian exile. With this, the Holy One is also just that he punished us and afterwards he said: “<i>yea, all His ways are just</i>” [32:4]. Concerning the <i>exile of the Medes</i>, that the Holy One punished them because they had pleasure at the <i>banquet of Ahasuerus</i>, and bowed down to the image. For these two sins, Mordecai and Esther said, “<i>fast in my behalf; do not eat</i>” [Esther, 4:16]. You should fast and not eat and drink. That is, because you ate by <i>Ahasuerus</i>, therefore you should fast and not eat. Here one can ask. One knows well that when one fasts, one does not eat. But the explanation is, he told us: you should fast because you ate by Ahasuerus. Therefore, you should not eat now. Regarding the sin that Israel bowed down to the image, therefore Mordecai did not want to bow down before Haman, since he made himself to be an image and a foreign god. Because of this, Mordecai placed himself in danger. Concerning this, the verse said here, “<i>yea, all His ways</i>” [32:4]. That is to say, the Holy One does everything, <i>measure for measure</i>, like by <i>Ahasuerus.</i> Afterwards, it says here, “<i>a faithful God, never false</i>” [32:4], in relation to the <i>Greek exile.</i> They hurt Israel very much with their evil decrees. They wanted to harm Israel’s observance of Torah and commandments. The Holy One kept his word that He said concerning the priests, “<i>bless, O lord, his substance</i>” [33:11]. That is to say, the Holy One blessed them with few people. The priests should have the power to struggle against the nations. It was also so in the time of the <i>Greeks.</i> The children of <i>Yohanan</i>, the priests, killed many nations. Concerning this, he says here, “<i>a faithful God</i>” [32:4]. That is to say, the Holy One, who is truthful with His words and does no injustice. Afterwards, he said, “<i>true and upright is He</i>” [32:4], regarding the <i>exile of Edom</i> that we are in now. This exile has no time for how long it will last. Therefore, he says, “<i>true and upright is He</i>” [32:4]. That is to say, even if it lasts long, yet the Holy One is righteous and true. He knows well why this exile should last so long.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Zeror ha-Mor, Deuteronomy, 32:4.</i>
Bahya writes. “<i>The Rock</i> – <i>His deeds are perfect</i>” [32:4]. Moses said about <i>Adam</i> that he brought <i>death</i> into the world. Therefore, Moses must also say on the day that he will die, that is why he said <i>the Rock.</i> That is to say, the Holy One created <i>Adam.</i> It is written concerning him, “<i>the Lord God formed man</i>” [Genesis, 2:7]. God created the person. “<i>His deeds are perfect</i>” [32:4]. That is to say, the Holy One created Adam that his <i>deeds</i> should be as pious as an angel. However, because Adam sinned, therefore God put him to death. Therefore he also said, “<i>His deeds are perfect</i>” [32:4]. That is, the Holy One had created him so that his deeds should be whole and he should live forever. This is the meaning of “<i>His deeds are perfect</i>” [32:4]; the person should live forever. However, because he committed a sin, he must die. Concerning this, he says here, “<i>all His ways are just</i>” [32:4]. That is to say, the Holy One was just in putting Adam to death. Afterwards, he says, what <i>Adam</i>’<i>s</i> sin was, that he did not keep what God had said, “<i>you must not eat it</i>” [Genesis, 2:17]. You should not eat the apple. Therefore, it says here, “<i>unworthy of Him</i>” [32:5]. That is to say, <i>Adam</i> destroyed and did not keep the words that God had said, “<i>no</i>”; you should not eat it. The Torah showed four worlds, this world and the next world. When the person dies, his soul lives on in the [next world]. The third world is that we will live again in the days of the Messiah. The fourth world is when they will judge the people after they come back to life. We also recite the verse, “<i>The Rock</i> – <i>His deeds are perfect</i>” [32:4], at the cemetery, when a person has died. That is, the person comes from one world to the next world.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Deuteronomy, 32:4.</i>
Toldot Yizhak also writes about the four worlds. The verse first spoke about the world we are in now. It gives a righteous person anguish, poverty, and other troubles. It gives the evildoer wealth and happiness. Concerning this, the verse says, “<i>His deeds are perfect</i>” [32:4]. That is to say, the Holy One is whole with his deeds, what he does with the people on this world. In the next world, when he has died, some people are led into the Garden of Eden, and some other people are led into Gehenna. Why so, “<i>all His ways are just</i>” [32:4]. That is to say, in the next world we can see that God only does justice. He leads the evildoer who was rich in this world into Gehenna, because of his sins that he did in this world. The righteous person who had troubles and enough Gehenna in this world, he comes immediately into the Garden of Eden. However, the evildoer had enough Garden of Eden in this world, for the few commandments that he fulfilled. Therefore, he comes to Gehenna immediately in the next world. The Holy One pays the righteous person for his few sins in this world, expecting that he should have the next world immediately. It is not possible that a person should not commit sins, as the verse says, “<i>for there is not one good man on earth who did what is best and does not sin</i>” [Ecclesiastes, 7:21]. That is to say, the righteous person does much good, yet he has also committed sins. Concerning this, the verse says, “<i>the judgments of the Lord are true, righteous altogether</i>” [Psalms, 19:10]. That is to say, when people see that things go poorly for the righteous in this world and it goes well for the evildoer, they wonder why things should go badly for the righteous. Therefore, the verse says that the <i>judgments of the Holy One</i> are all just. When he would join the two <i>worlds</i>, then he would see that the Holy One is just. Thus, the righteous person had troubles in this world, but he has everything good in the next world. He does good for the evildoer in this world, but the Holy One causes troubles for him in the next world for his sins. Regarding the <i>world of the Messiah</i> it says here, “<i>a faithful God</i>” [32:4]. God is truthful. He will bring the Messiah to the dead, so that they should all arise. Some will not arise. This is the third world. Concerning this, he says, “<i>never false</i>” [32:4]. That is to say, He does no injustice when He brings some to life and not others. After this life that many people will come back to life, the Holy One will judge them for their sins. Some will remain alive with body and soul. This is called the <i>world to come.</i> This is the fourth world. Some will die and their body and soul will be lost forever. Concerning this, he said, “<i>true and upright is He</i>” [32:4]. That is to say, He is righteous because He lets them live. “<i>Just</i>,” He is just in that He destroys the evildoers forever.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Deuteronomy, 32:4–5.</i>
<i>Toldot Yizhak</i> writes further. Our sages gave signs for the [Torah] portions, how one should begin or end when the <i>cantor</i> calls someone to the Torah. The <i>cantor</i> is obligated to call each one and to begin with positive words and end with good words in the <i>Torah scroll.</i> However, in the portion of <i>Ha</i>’<i>azinu</i>, our sages said in <i>tractate Megillah</i><sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">J. <i>Megillah</i>, 3.7.</i> that one should make the divisions according to the abbreviation, <i>ha-ziv lakh</i>, to call up seven men to the <i>Torah scroll</i>, and should end each section with evil words, expecting that the people should be frightened, so that they would repent. They should not be angry with the cantor, because the sages made and indicated the sections, where to begin and to end. Particularly now, when it is close to <i>Yom Kippur</i>, the person should remember to repent. The portion is divided into six sections. The first section begins, “<i>give ear</i>” [32:1]. This tells all the good that the Holy One did with Israel, because they are God’s creation, and that God does lovingkindness with each person, even the non-Israelite, but he is a person. Therefore, the verse says in the first section with [the letter] <i>heh</i>, “<i>is He not the Father who created you</i>” [32:6]. He created you and therefore, it is just to praise Him. The second section begins with <i>zayin.</i> This is “<i>remember the days of old</i>” [32:7]. This tells us the good that the Holy One did for Israel in the wilderness, because they studied Torah. Therefore, it is written in the section, “<i>for the Lord</i>’<i>s portion</i>” [32:9]. That is to say, Israel are the portion of the Holy One. Therefore, He does much good for them. The third portion begins with <i>yud</i>, “<i>He set him</i>” [32:13]. This tells us the good that the Holy One did for Israel in the <i>land of Israel.</i> Therefore, it says, “<i>He set him atop the highlands</i>” [32:13]. This is the land of Israel that is higher than all lands in the world. This land is good with much milk and much honey. The fourth portion is the <i>vav</i>, “<i>the Lord saw and was vexed</i>” [32:19]. This tells us that Israel were very evil. Though they received much good from God, they committed many sins. Therefore, the Holy One was angered at Israel and said, “<i>I will hide</i>” [32:20]. I will hide myself from Israel and will not help them when they are needy. The fifth portion is the <i>lamed.</i> This is, “<i>but for fear of the taunts of the foe</i>” [32:27]. This tells us that when the Holy One punished Israel for their sins, yet they did not repent. They thought that all this was not from God, but they thought that the bad things happened by accident. Therefore, he says here, “<i>were they wise, they would think upon this</i>” [32:29]. That is to say, if Israel would be wise, and thought about how does it happen that a gentile pursues a thousand Israelites or two gentiles pursue ten thousand Israelites. This must be because the Holy One does this; He is punishing us through the hands of the enemies. The sixth section is the <i>khaf.</i> This is the section that begins “<i>for the Lord will vindicate His people</i>” [32:36]. The Holy One will judge the nations of the world, that they forced a great exile upon Israel. Therefore, he says here, “<i>Lo, I raise My hand to heaven</i>” [32:40]. That is, I will raise My hand to heaven and will swear that I will take revenge on the gentiles.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Ha’azinu, Introduction.</i>
<i>Hizkuni</i> writes. “<i>His deeds are perfect</i>” [32:4]. What deeds the Holy One does are whole. However, a person who builds a house, he did not make the stones, but they were there long before. Similarly, wood or clay are not his work.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Deuteronomy, 32:4.</i>
“<i>Unworthy of Him</i>” [32:5]. That is to say, when the Holy One punishes the person, it is not from God, but the sins and his deeds do it.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Deuteronomy, 32:5.</i>
“<i>Do you thus requite the Lord</i>” [32:6]. Moses said: will you do evil to God, who has done all this good for you? He is your true father who created you. Remember how the Holy One punished the generations who preceded you. Ask the prophets and the elders; they will tell you everything. First, in the <i>generation of the dispersion</i>, they built great towers in order to go up to heaven. The Holy One could have easily drowned them all, but He allowed them to remain alive, expecting that the twelve tribes of Israel would be descended from them.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Deuteronomy, 32:8.</i>
“<i>For the Lord</i>’<i>s portion is His people</i>” [32:9]. That is, Israel are the people of God who were among the nations. That is to say, they were born from them. Therefore, the Holy One did not kill all the nations.
“<i>He found him in a desert region</i>” [32:10]. The Holy One found Israel truthful in the desert, more than all the nations. <i>Ishmael</i> and Esau did not want to receive the Torah and Israel followed the Holy One in the desert, where there were only ruins, and no people were there. The Holy One surrounded them with good clouds and allowed them to make four banners, like those kings traveled with. He taught them wisdom and gave them the Torah. He protected them from the snakes and wild animals, and from the nations.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Deuteronomy, 32:10.</i>
“<i>See how they fare in the end</i>” [32:20]. The book <i>Keli Yakar</i> writes. Israel has three names: <i>Israel, Jacob, Jeshurun.</i> The Holy One said: I see the final letters of the three names is <i>lavan.</i> That is to say, from the <i>merit of Jacob</i>, their sins will be whitened, since the word <i>lavan</i> means white. However, Israel commits sins and turns aside, and the word <i>lavan</i> becomes <i>naval</i>, which means vile. Concerning this, the verse says here, “<i>for they are a treacherous breed</i>” [32:20]. This means, this is a perverse nation. The word <i>lavan</i> [white] becomes <i>naval</i> [vile].<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Keli Yakar, Deuteronomy, 32:20.</i>
“<i>Like an eagle who rouses his nestlings</i>” [32:11]. The Holy One who led Israel in the desert was like a bird that carries its children on its wings, and like an eagle when he wants to come to his children, he first beats the branches of the tree so that they should wake up, should not be frightened and should be able to endure him. So too was the Holy One at Mount Sinai. He was very strong and had many angels, and He came from four sides to Mount Sinai. The eagle, when he wants to carry his children to another place, he places his children on his wings and flies with them. He does not fear other birds that might take his children. No bird can fly higher than the eagle. Therefore, he does not carry his children between his feet. He is afraid that they might shot arrows at his children. However, other birds carry their children between their feet. They are afraid that other birds might take their children from their wings. So too, when Israel went out of Egypt, the <i>Egyptians</i> pursued <i>Israel</i> and shot arrows at them. An angel came between the Egyptians and Israel. Thus, the Egyptians could not do anything to Israel.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 19:3.</i>
The Holy One did much good for them. He gave them the <i>land of Israel</i>, a rich fat land with good fruit and good fat sheep and good wine. They did evil against God because they had so much good. The Holy One became angry and said about Israel, “<i>I will reduce them</i>” [32:26]. I will disperse Israel over all the corners of the world. The Talmud says in [tractate <i>Sanhedrin</i>] chapter ten, Israel had three exiles. Some were expelled by the Holy One behind the river <i>Sambatyon</i> and some were exiled to the land of <i>Antiochus.</i> Some Israelites had a cloud come over them and cover them.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Deuteronomy, 32:26.</i>
“<i>For the Lord will vindicate His people</i>” [32:36]. The Holy One will again have compassion for Israel that they had enough exile and will take revenge on the nations. The Holy One said: I was a little angry at Israel and the nations caused them great troubles, more than the sins that Israel committed.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Deuteronomy, 32:36.</i>
“<i>I, I am He; there is no god beside me</i>” [32:39]. I am God, to bring the people down and to raise up the people, and there is no god who can do this. I have killed Israel; I will again bring them to life. From here we learn that the Holy One will again bring the dead back to life in the days of the Messiah. Bahya asks a question. Why did the Torah not write explicitly that God would bring the dead back to life? The explanation is that the Torah was given to the ordinary people, who did not understand everything well, particularly that which is a great novelty.

V'Zot HaBerachah

<i>Bahya</i> writes. King Solomon, <i>of blessed memory</i>, said: “<i>what a rare find is a capable wife</i>” [Proverbs 31:10]. This means, a clever wife who is capable of working day and night to maintain her house. She gives charity to the <i>poor</i> from her work or her earnings. This woman is worthy of praise. Therefore, the verse praised her, since the woman can bring her husband and children to the <i>world to come.</i> She does the necessary work in the house and her husband and children can study Torah, just as the body is given to the soul expecting that the person should properly serve God. So too the wife was given to the person so that she should help her husband serve God properly. Concerning this, our sages said, <i>he merited a helpmate.</i> That is to say, when the person is worthy, God gives him a wife who helps him properly serve God. However, when the woman has no beauty, you would think that she is not praiseworthy. Therefore, the verse said, “<i>grace is deceptive, beauty is illusory</i>” [Proverbs, 31:30]. That is to say, one should not praise that the woman is beautiful or lovely, but one should praise her when she has done good deeds. The Midrash writes about the verse “<i>what a rare find is a capable wife</i>” [Proverbs, 31:10]. This means, he compared the Torah to a clever wife, since the Torah contains within it much wisdom and good deeds. Through this, the person can come to the <i>world to come.</i> People praise the person who studies Torah and bless him, even though the person is blessed by God. However, in any event, the Holy One gave it into the hands of people that they should bless people. The Holy One first blessed <i>Adam</i> and <i>Noah</i> until <i>Abraham our Patriarch</i> came and the Holy One gave into his hands that he should bless whomever he wanted. Whomever he will bless, they will be blessed. Isaac also blessed Jacob and Jacob blessed his children. Moses did this here in the portion and he blessed all of Israel before his death. Concerning this it says here:<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Zot Ha-Brachah, Introduction.</i>
“<i>This is the blessing with which Moses blessed</i>” [33:1]. The Holy One said: Balaam supposedly blessed Israel with seven blessings; he had built seven altars. However, Balaam was an evildoer. He had an evil eye and only blessed Israel with three blessings. The Holy One said: Moses should come. He has a good heart and he should bless Israel with four more blessings, expecting that there should be seven blessings in all.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Deuteronomy, 33:1.</i>
One asks a question. The portion begins with “<i>this is the blessing.</i>” This means, this is the blessing that Moses blessed Israel. Then he talks about other things for many verses before he blesses them. The explanation is that Moses was not arrogant. Therefore, Moses thought to himself: who am I to bless Israel? It is customary for a father to bless his children and I, Moses, am not their father. It is also <i>customary</i> that a <i>king</i> blesses the people, and I am no king. Therefore, Moses said, “<i>the Lord came from Sinai</i>” [33:2], and he gave the Torah to Israel. It also says, “<i>they followed in your steps</i>” [33:3]. This means, Israel crowded to push their feet under Mount Sinai to receive the Torah. Then it says, “<i>accepting Your pronouncements</i>” [33:3]. This means, they only heard two Statements. This is “<i>I am the Lord your God</i>” [Exodus, 20:2] and the second <i>Statement</i> is “<i>you shall have no other gods</i>” [Exodus, 20:3]. Because the voice of the Holy One was very strong, all of Israel died. Thus, they asked Moses that he should tell them the other <i>Statements.</i> Concerning this, it says here, “<i>Moses charged us with the Teaching</i>” [33:4]. This means, Moses taught us Torah and thus, they accepted him as a rabbi. Therefore, it is just that he should bless Israel, as is the custom that the rabbi blesses the children.
Afterwards, it says, “<i>he became King in Jeshurun</i>” [33:5]. <i>Hizkuni</i> writes here. Moses was a king over Israel. “<i>When the heads of the people assembled</i>” [33:5]. This means, Moses was called a king, like a king who assembles the people. So too, Moses also gathered Israel with trumpets, like a king. Therefore, it is just that Moses should bless Israel, because he was a king.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Deuteronomy, 33:5.</i>
“<i>He became King in Jeshurun</i>” [33:5]. <i>Rashi</i> says that this means that the Holy One was king over Israel.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Deuteronomy, 33:5.</i> <i>Hizkuni</i> says that this means that Moses was king over Israel.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Hizkuni, Deuteronomy, 33:5.</i> The verse teaches us that this means that both explanations show that the custom is that sometimes a <i>communal leader</i> or <i>judge</i> is appointed and the people who appointed him does not properly examine if he was appropriate to be a communal leader or a judge. They are often mistaken. Therefore, the verse says, “<i>gaze after Moses</i>” [Exodus, 33:8]. This means, they looked many times at Moses, at all of his deeds. Therefore, the verse also says here, “<i>He became King in Jeshurun</i>” [33:5]. This means, Moses was a king with oversight and they found that he was a proper king.
<i>Rashi</i> further says what the verse says refers to the Holy One. The verse teaches us that even though Israel tested the Holy One many times, yet in any event, they accepted the Holy One as a king. Therefore he says, “<i>He became King in Jeshurun</i>” [33:5].<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Deuteronomy, 33:5.</i> This means, they accepted the Holy One as their king, with much oversight and examination, since the word <i>Jeshurun</i> means oversight and supervision.
“<i>Man of God</i>” [33:1]. Moses was called a Godly man, because he did everything good with justice and other commandments. Therefore, he was called “<i>man of God</i>,” like a husband who can abrogate the vow of his wife and can allow the vow to stand when he so desires. So too was Moses. He had said to the Holy One, “<i>advance, O Lord</i> … <i>return, O Lord</i>” [Numbers, 10:35–36]. That is to say, arise God and when he wanted he said, rest among us, God, just like a husband who commands his wife. Therefore, Moses was called the husband of God.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Deuteronomy, 33:1.</i>
“<i>Before he died</i>” [33:1]. The <i>Angel of Death</i> was standing by Moses to take his soul. Moses made the <i>Angel of Death</i> tarry and he blessed Israel.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Deuteronomy, 33:1.</i>
“<i>The Lord came from Sinai</i>” [33:2]. Toldot Yizhak writes in the name of Ramban. The verse teaches us that Moses first recounted the good deeds of Israel and said that the Shekhinah began to appear at Mount Sinai. Afterwards, the Shekhinah came into the Tabernacle and remained with Israel. The Midrash says that the Holy One came to the nations and wanted to give them the Torah, and they did not want to accept the Torah. The verse says here that <i>Esau and Ishmael</i> were the children of <i>Abraham and Isaac</i>, yet they did not <i>accept</i> the Torah.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Deuteronomy, 33:2–5.</i>
“<i>Lover, indeed, of the people</i>” [33:3]. The Holy One gave them the Torah and called them My beloved people. “<i>Their hallowed are all in your hand</i>” [33:3]. All those holy ones <i>sanctified the Name of God.</i> This is the <i>tribe of Levi</i> who risked their necks at the Golden Calf and killed all those who had worshipped the Golden Calf. “<i>They followed in Your footsteps</i>” [33:3]. The Levites were in great danger when they carried the Ark and other <i>sacred vessels.</i> Later, some were killed when they were not properly prepared. “<i>Accepting Your pronouncements</i>” [33:3]. This means, the <i>Levites</i> taught Torah and <i>issued rulings for religious laws for all of Israel.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Deuteronomy, 33:3.</i>
“<i>Moses charged us with the Teaching, as the heritage of the congregation of Jacob</i>” [33:4]. The Levites said: we have accepted from Moses that we are the congregation of <i>Jacob.</i> He mentioned Jacob and not <i>Abraham and Isaac</i>, because <i>Ishmael</i>, the son of <i>Abraham</i>, did not want to accept the Torah. Esau also did not want to accept the Torah, and he came from Isaac. The verse here mentions Jacob alone. The verse teaches us that the land of Israel was given to Israel because of the Torah. When they will not keep the Torah, they would be driven out from the land, as we are now in exile, outside of our land.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Deuteronomy, 33:4.</i>
“<i>He became King in Jeshurun</i>” [33:5]. The Holy One is king among Israel when Israel are at peace with each other, so that they were not at war with each other.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban, Deuteronomy, 33:5.</i>
“<i>May Reuben live and not die</i>” [33:6]. Reuben should live in this world and his life should not be shortened, and he should not be punished in the next world. One should not mention the deed that he disturbed the bed of Jacob and broke the bed of Bilhah. He should be counted among his brothers. Moses blessed Reuben first since he was the oldest and the firstborn. Reuben was also the first to take a share in the land of Israel. Moses next gave his <i>blessing to Judah</i>, who will also be first to have a share in the land.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Deuteronomy, 33:6.</i>
Rashi writes. He mentions Judah near Reuben because they both confessed their sins and repented for their sins.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Deuteronomy, 33:7.</i>
Judah was also blessed that he should be strong in order to wage war with the nations. The Talmud says in [tractate] Makkot. All the forty years that the Israelites were in the wilderness, they carried the bones of the tribes, each one in a separate coffin. The bones of Judah were constantly rolling on his coffin, and had no rest. He had been excommunicated from the time that he was a guarantor for Benjamin. He said, “<i>I shall stand guilty before my father forever</i>” [Genesis, 44:32], if I do not bring Benjamin. Moses said: the one who caused that Reuben had confessed for his sins also caused Judah to confess for his sins. The Holy One immediately accepted Moses’ prayer and caused that the bones of Judah joined together. Similarly, he was not allowed to ascend to the heavenly yeshiva until Moses prayed and requested this. Then he was included in the yeshiva to study Torah. He was not able to <i>engage in the discussions</i> until Moses also prayed about this. He did not know how to respond to questions in the yeshiva and did not know how to <i>rule on religious laws</i> until Moses prayed for it.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Deuteronomy, 33:7.</i>
“<i>And of Levi he said</i>” [33:8]. They killed all those who worshiped the Golden Calf, even his stepfather who was an Israelite, who had a wife from the tribe of Levi and even his own stepbrother also. They were killed if they worshiped the Golden Calf. They kept the commandment of circumcision in the wilderness, when other Israelites did not circumcise their children. However, the Levites circumcised their children in the wilderness. They issued rulings from the Torah for Israel, and brought sacrifices. They put to death the evildoers who opposed the priests in the wilderness. He also said prophetically that the priests in the days of the <i>Hasmoneans</i>, the children of <i>Mattathias</i>, the priests, would kill many of the <i>Greeks.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Deuteronomy, 33:8–11.</i>
“<i>And of Benjamin he said</i> … <i>he rests between His shoulders</i>” [33:12]. Bahya writes. He showed three Temples. One will be in the portion of Benjamin. Therefore, he was worthy that there were no worms in the grave where Benjamin rested. The Talmud says in [tractate <i>Baba Bathra</i>] <i>chapter one.</i> There are seven who were not eaten by worms in the grave. They are <i>Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, Aaron, Miriam, and Benjamin.</i> Some sages say that <i>King David</i> was also not eaten by worms. Since Benjamin was blessed more than the other tribes because the Shekhinah rested in his portion, therefore, there is no <i>vav</i> in his name, as there is in all the other tribes whose names contain a <i>vav.</i> This teaches us that the blessing of Benjamin was separate.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Deuteronomy, 33:12.</i>
“<i>And of Joseph he said</i>” [33:13]. He blessed Joseph that his land should have good grain and fruit. The earth would have gold and silver and gold and silver would be dug from the land. The Midrash explains why Joseph was blessed with the earth. The explanation is that <i>Adam</i> followed his wife to do evil, and the earth was cursed because of him. However, Joseph did not want to follow his master’s wife to sleep with her. Therefore, the earth was blessed for his sake.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Toldot Yizhak, Deuteronomy, 33:13–16.</i>
The Torah wrote <i>tavotah</i> [rest], a long word, about Joseph. It should have written <i>tavo</i> [come]. This means, the blessings would come to Joseph. The explanation is that the Torah wrote <i>tavotah</i>, a long word. It is like there were two words. This teaches us that just as Joseph came to Egypt first, into the exile before the other tribes, so in the days of the Messiah, Joseph will come first into the <i>land of Israel</i>, forty-five years before the other tribes.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Deuteronomy, 33:16.</i>
<i>Rabbi Isserl</i> writes. Why did Moses not explicitly bless Simeon when he blessed the other brothers? The answer is: The Talmud says in [tractate <i>Pesahim</i>] <i>chapter four.</i> Our sages fasted twenty-four fasts that no scribe of <i>phylacteries</i> or <i>Torah scrolls</i> or <i>elementary teacher</i> should become rich.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Pesahim</i>, 50b.</i> Since if they became rich and had much money, they would not want to be an elementary teacher and would also not want to be a scribe of phylacteries or Torahs. Therefore, there is no <i>blessing</i> in this trade and in teaching children, or to have profit from the writing of books. Therefore, Moses also did not want to bless Simeon because only <i>teachers and scribes</i> would come from his tribe. Though Moses did not explicitly bless Simeon, but Moses remembered Simeon in <i>Judah</i>’<i>s blessing.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Beurei Maharai, Deuteronomy, 33:7.</i>
<i>Ibn Shuaib</i> writes. Moses did not bless Simeon, because Jacob was angry with Simeon in [the portion] “<i>Jacob lived</i>” [Genesis, 47:28]. Even though Jacob was also angry with Levi, but in any event Levi repented and taught Torah. The tribe of Levi did much good at the incident of the Golden Calf. They risked their necks and killed those who had worshiped the Golden Calf. Again, when the Israelites engaged in illicit sex with the daughters of Moab, the chieftain of Simeon engaged in illicit sex with the daughter of the king. <i>Phinehas</i> came from the <i>tribe of Levi</i> and risked his neck and killed an important chieftain for the sake of God. Therefore, the tribe of Levi was blessed, but Simeon had sinned with the daughters of Moab. Therefore, Moses did not bless him explicitly.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Ibn Shuaib, <i>Derashot</i>, <i>Vayehi.</i></i>
Rabbi Isserl asks a question. Why did Moses say here the <i>praises of the tribe of Levi</i> first, and afterwards he blessed the other tribes and did not say their praises? The explanation is that Moses very much wanted to be correct before the people, that they should not say that he was flattering his relatives. This is Levi. The people would say that Moses did not bless Simeon, because Jacob had been angry with him. Jacob had also been angry with them and Moses flattered and blessed them, because the <i>tribe of Levi was his relatives.</i> Therefore, Moses first said the praises of the tribe of Levi. That is to say, I am not flattering them. They are well worth to be blessed since they are pious and have taught Torah. From here we should learn that each <i>communal leader</i> or official should see that he should not flatter his relatives and should behave correctly, so that he should not be suspected and should not make the people sin, that they might suspect him.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Beure Maharai, Deuteronomy, 33:8.</i>
“<i>Rejoice, O Zebulon, on your journeys</i>” [33:18]. He blessed Zebulon that they would engage in business and would give food to Issachar, who studies Torah day and night. Therefore, the Torah first mentions Zebulon even though they were few, and Issachar was older. However, Zebulon causes with his merchandise that Issachar can study Torah. Therefore, Moses honored him and blessed him before his older brother, Issachar. Concerning this, our sages said that a communal leader who honors <i>scholars</i> and helps the study of Torah, he is worthy to sit near the Shekhinah. Moses blessed Zebulon at length and blessed Issachar briefly. That is to say, his blessings are not from this world, but in two worlds. Therefore, there are two <i>shins</i> in the name Issachar. This alludes to two rewards, that the Holy One will give him two rewards, one in this world and one in the next world. The <i>shin</i> also alludes to reward. That is, he will have a great reward.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Deuteronomy, 33:18.</i>
“<i>Zebulon shall dwell by the seashore</i>” [Genesis, 49:13]. Zebulon will rest near the water. The Midrash writes. Zebulon said to the Holy One: why have You given my share of the land near the water and my brothers have good fields and vineyards. The Holy One responded: a fish will go in the sea whose name is <i>hilazon.</i> All of Israel will have to purchase this very expensively to dye blue wool in order to make the <i>tekhelet</i> for the <i>zizit.</i> One asks a question. Zebulon had desired fields and the Holy One responded that they would buy blue wool from you. The explanation is that Zebulon said: all the rivers flow into the sea, and the river <i>Shittim</i> which flows near Sodom causes the evil inclination to incite engaging in illicit sex. The Israelites who came to the <i>river Shittim</i> also engaged in illicit sex, as <i>Ibn Shuaib</i> writes in the <i>portion of Phinehas.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Ibn Shuaib, <i>Derashot</i>, II: 398.</i> Thus, Zebulon said: my portion of the land is by the sea, and all the rivers flow into the sea. Thus, I will also be incited by the river Shittim that flows into the sea, to engage in illicit sex. The Holy One responded: Israel will have to purchase from you the blood of the fish that is called the <i>hilazon</i>, because you will deal with <i>zizit.</i> Thus, you will be protected from the evil inclination. A story happened to someone who wanted to sleep with a prostitute. When he saw his <i>zizit</i>, he ran away from the prostitute.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Menahot</i>, 44a.</i> However, when the Messiah will come, the evil inclination will be removed and a river of good water will flow from the Temple and will water the river Shittim, as the verse says, “<i>a spring shall issue from the House of the Lord and shall water the wadi of the Acacias</i>” [Joel, 4:18].
Amen, so may it be the will of the Lord.

Song of Songs



Chapter 1

“<i>The Song of Songs</i>” [1:1]. The <i>Yalkut</i> writes that all of the <i>deeds of King Solomon</i> were in three forms. <i>Rabbi Judah</i> said that Solomon was first a king and afterwards <i>Asmodeus</i> cast him very far from his kingdom where he was not known and he became a beggar and afterwards again regained his kingdom.
<i>Rabbi Haninah</i> said that he was first a king and Asmodeus deposed him from his kingdom; he became a beggar and never returned to his kingdom. Solomon was called by three names, <i>Yedidiah, Kohelet, Solomon.</i> He composed three books, <i>Proverbs, Song of Songs and Ecclesiastes.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Song of Songs, <i>Remez,</i> 980.</i>
“<i>By Solomon</i>” [1:1]. To the Holy One is the peace. He makes peace when the sun, the moon, and the stars circulate around the heavens and none of them damages the others. Similarly, the rain and hail are only water. Lightning and thunder are only fire. Yet, they exist in the world at the same time and the water does not extinguish the thunder and the lightning.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Song of Songs, <i>Remez,</i> 980.</i>
“<i>Let him give me kisses</i>” [1:2]. The Yalkut writes: <i>Rabbi Johanan</i> said that an angel ascended <i>Mount Sinai</i> when the Torah was given and the Holy One said, “<i>I am the Lord your God</i>” [Exodus, 20:2]. The same angel went to every Israelite person and said: receive what the Holy One said, and this means that God said, “<i>I am the Lord your God.</i>” You must understand what God wants to have with this speech. The Israelite then answered, I gladly want to understand and receive everything that God will command. The angel immediately kissed the Israelite. From then on, when Israel heard “<i>I am the Lord your God</i>” from the Holy One; they remembered it well and did not forget it. However, later they heard everything else, the other <i>Statements</i> [<i>dibrot</i>] from <i>Moses Our Teacher</i>, and they forgot all of it. They said to Moses: we would like that the Holy One should appear again and speak to us himself so that we should not forget what we learned. This is the meaning of the verse “<i>Give me the kisses of your mouth</i>” [1:2]. <i>Moses Our Teacher</i> responded to the <i>Israelites:</i> you may desire that the Holy One should appear to you and teach you Torah Himself, but this cannot be at Mount Sinai. When the Messiah will come, the Holy One will appear and personally teach Torah to Israel. The verse says, “<i>I will put My Teachings into their inmost being and inscribe it upon their hearts</i>” [Jeremiah, 31:33]. This means, I have given my Torah in their hearts, as if it were inscribed on their hearts and they would not forget their learning.
“<i>More delightful</i>” [1:2]. The Torah is better than wine. Therefore, he compares the Torah to wine. Just as wine must be kept in earthen vessels and goes bad in golden and silver vessels, similarly, the one who studies Torah should keep himself humble and if he studies Torah with arrogance, his Torah will leave him.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Song of Songs, <i>Remez,</i> 981.</i>
“<i>The fragrance of your ointment</i>” [1:3]. He compares the Torah to oil. How is oil? It is a remedy for the body and makes his face clear. The Torah that he studies is similar to oil. If one puts a drop of oil into a barrel containing water, the oil drop will float to the surface. Whoever studies Torah and is full of Torah is similar. If he listens to <i>idle talk</i>, he forgets an amount of the Torah equal to the <i>idle talk</i> that he heard.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Song of Songs, <i>Remez,</i> 981.</i>
“<i>Draw me after you</i>” [1:4]. The Yalkut writes: <i>Rabbi Meir</i> said that on Mount Sinai the Holy One said to Israel, bring me a <i>guarantee</i> that you will keep the Torah and then I will give you the Torah. The Israelites answered: we will give <i>Abraham, Isaac and Jacob as guarantors.</i> The Holy One answered, I will not accept <i>Abraham</i>, since he said, “<i>How shall I know</i>” [Genesis, 15:8]. This means that he did not believe that the Holy One promised to give him the <i>land of Israel.</i> I also do not want <i>Isaac</i> as a guarantor because he loved <i>Esau. Jacob</i> said, “<i>My way is hidden from the Lord</i>” [Isaiah, 40:27]. This means that my ways are hidden from the Holy One. The Israelites then said, our children will be our <i>guarantors.</i> The Holy One said: I will accept them as <i>guarantors.</i> As soon as Israel does not keep the Torah, the <i>guarantors</i> must suffer for their fathers. He said: not only the <i>guarantors</i>, who are the children, must suffer. Even I, the Holy One, <i>as it were</i>, also have harm from persecuting the <i>guarantors</i>, who are the children. Who will say “<i>borchu</i>” and “<i>amen, yehei shemei Rabbah</i>” that the children said in the synagogue, as the verse says, “<i>Because you have spurned the Torah of your God, I, in turn, will spurn your children</i>” [Hosea, 4:6]. This means, if you Israel forget the Torah, I will forget your children and will punish them. The verse ends “<i>I also.</i>” That is to say, I, the Holy One, am also punished when I punish the children. Who will say “<i>amen, yehei shemei Rabbah</i>” and “<i>Borchu?</i>”<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Song of Songs, <i>Remez,</i> 981.</i>
“<i>The king has brought me to his chambers</i>” [1:4]. This means that the Holy One brought those He wanted to be <i>prophets</i> up to Heaven and showed them everything. The Holy One showed <i>Elijah</i>, in the Heavenly chambers, that in the in the Messianic Age there will be a <i>Great Ox</i> [<i>Shor ha-Bor</i>] and <i>Leviathan.</i> The Holy One brought Ezekiel up to Heaven and showed him the <i>Merkavah</i>, which is the <i>Throne of Glory</i>, and similarly with the other prophets.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Song of Songs, <i>Remez,</i> 982.</i>

“<i>Your cheeks</i>” [1:10]. The Yalkut writes in the name of <i>Rabbi Joshua:</i> For each statement of the <i>Ten Statements</i> [<i>Aseret ha-Dibrot</i>] that the Holy One uttered on Mount Sinai, the whole world was filled with the smell of good <i>perfume.</i> It was asked, if the whole world was filled with the smell of good <i>perfume</i> from the first <i>Statement</i>, what happened to the <i>perfume</i> and pleasant odors of the other <i>Statements?</i> He gives an answer, that as soon as the world was filled from the first <i>Statement</i>, a wind came and carried the good odors to the <i>Garden of Eden.</i> When the Holy One uttered the next <i>Statement</i>, the world was again filled and so it was for each <i>Statement. Rabbi Joshua</i> said that with each <i>Statement</i> that the Holy One uttered the soul of each Israelite left them and they died.

“<i>Your dove-like eyes</i>” [1:15]. Israel is likened to a dove.

That is, each one <i>recognizes his place</i> where it is appropriate for him to dwell and where it is appropriate for him to be. Another explanation, when one wants to slaughter a dove, it offers its throat and does not tremble. Other birds do not offer their throats.

The Talmud writes in tractate <i>Yoma chapter three.</i> Someone called <i>Nicanor</i> traveled to the distant city of <i>Alexandria</i> to bring back beautiful boards to make doors for the <i>Temple.</i> On his way back home with the boards, waves rose up in the sea and threatened to drown him. He took one of the boards and threw it into the <i>sea</i>, but the waves continued to grow and the people wanted throw another board into the sea in order to lighten the ship. <i>Nicanor</i> cried and said to the people, throw me also into the sea along with the boards. It is better that I die. As soon as he said that, the sea became calm. Nonetheless, he was still anguished about the first board that had been thrown into the sea. When he came to the shore, he was anguished and looked out to sea for the board and the board swam in from the sea. Some scholars say that a sea creature brought the board from the sea.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Yoma,</i> 38a; <i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Song of Songs, <i>Remez,</i> 985.</i>

Chapter 2

“<i>Rose</i>” [2:1]. [Midrash] <i>Shohar Tov</i> writes: The sages said that the earth recited this verse. That is to say, I, the earth, have a deposit. All the deceased people are hidden and concealed in me. That is why I am beloved by the Holy One and when the Holy One will desire these dead people I will return them all in the days of the Messiah. And I, the earth, will again be fresh, strong, and beautiful as a rose and will sing praises, as the verse says, “<i>from the ends of the earth we hear singing</i>” [Isaiah, 24:16].<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Midrash <i>Shohar Tov,</i> 1.20; <i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Song of Songs, <i>Remez,</i> 985.</i>
“<i>Like a rose</i>” [2:2]. Just as a rose is recognized in the midst of the thorns, so too are Israel in exile among the nations and they are recognized among the nations. <sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Song of Songs, <i>Remez,</i> 986.</i>
“<i>Like an apple tree</i>” [2:3]. He compares Israel to an apple tree in the forest which flowers in the month of <i>Sivan,</i> just like Israel that accepted the Torah in the month of Sivan.
“<i>Sweet</i>” [2:3]. The <i>manna</i> was sweet to my <i>palate</i> and the <i>manna</i> had five hundred and forty-six tastes, equal to the numerical value of the word sweet [<i>matoq</i>].<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Song of Songs, <i>Remez,</i> 986.</i>
“<i>The house of wine</i>” [2:4]. He compares the Torah to wine. Just like wine, the more one drinks the more one wants to drink, so too are the <i>words of the Torah.</i> The more one learns, the more one desires to learn Torah. Another explanation, just as when one drinks wine one is recognized by his speech that he is drunk and he reveals many secrets. It is the same with <i>words of Torah.</i> He is recognized for what kind of person he is by the <i>words of Torah</i> that he speaks.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Song of Songs, <i>Remez,</i> 986.</i>
“<i>His banner of love was over me</i>” [2:4]. <i>Rabbi Aha</i> said: even an <i>ignoramus</i>, who cannot read <i>Hebrew</i> properly in the Torah, is also beloved by Me, so says the Holy One. That is to say, he should read “<i>ve-ahavta</i>,” you shall love God, and the <i>ignoramus</i> reads it as “<i>ve-eivat</i>,” which means, you shall hate the Holy One, heaven forbid. God says that it is the same. Let the ignoramus read in the Torah, even if he does not read it properly. This is the meaning of the verse “<i>His banner of love was over me.</i>” That is to say, just as if it would say “<i>ve-digulo.</i>” This means that when the <i>ignoramus</i> skips over [a word] and does not properly read the Torah, it is still beloved to Me and I accept his learning.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Song of Songs, <i>Remez,</i> 986.</i> From this we can see that every person should study even if he sometimes cannot read the Hebrew properly, but his intention is for God.
“<i>The voice of my beloved</i>” [2:8]. <i>Rabbi Judah</i> said: when <i>Moses Our Teacher</i> came to the Israelites and said to them, the <i>redemption</i> has come to leave the exile of Egypt. The Israelites answered, we are supposed to serve in <i>Egypt</i> for four hundred years and we have only served in Egypt two hundred and ten years. Moses responded, when the Holy One wants to redeem you, he skips over the time and does not look at His <i>calculations</i> of the exile.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Song of Songs, <i>Remez,</i> 986.</i>
“<i>My dove</i>” [2:14]. [Midrash] <i>Rabbah</i> writes: <i>Rabbi Huna</i> said in the name of <i>Rabbi Abba.</i> Why did <i>Sarah</i> and <i>Rebecca</i> and other <i>righteous women</i> not get pregnant immediately, but only after many years? The reason for the waiting is that their husbands should have pleasure from their beauty, since when a woman becomes pregnant she becomes ugly.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Song of Songs Rabbah</i>, 2:8; <i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Song of Songs, <i>Remez,</i> 986.</i>
“<i>Let me hear</i>” [2:14]. The Holy One says to Israel: come here and let me hear what you have learned through hearing. That is to say, you have heard words of Torah from a person through his voice, which he said to you. Show me the Torah that you have learned through seeing with your eyes, that you saw a book yourself with your own eyes. This is the meaning of the verse “<i>let me see your face</i>” [2:14]. Show me what you have learned by your seeing it in a book. “<i>For your voice is sweet</i>” [2:14]. The Torah that you received through someone telling you the Torah is sweet and smells nice. “<i>Your face is comely</i>” [2:14]. The Torah that you studied through seeing with your eyes, that you learned yourself from the book, this Torah is also beautiful, but not sweet. It is much better to hear Torah than a person learning it himself from a book.
“<i>When [the day] blows gently</i>” [2:17]. The <i>Tanhuma</i> writes that this verse also applies to Abraham. It says concerning him, “<i>as the day grew hot</i>” [Genesis, 18:1]. The Holy One created a great heat in the world so that no guests would come.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanhuma</i>, <i>Vayera</i>, 3.</i> “<i>At givat haaraloth</i>”<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Lit., the mount of foreskins.</i> [Joshua, 5:3].

He piled them, one on top of the other, in his house and a stream of <i>blood</i> flowed from these foreskins. The Holy One said to the angels: let us go to <i>Abraham</i>’<i>s house to visit the sick.</i> The angels said: <i>Lord of the Universe</i>, it stinks and it is quite repulsive in Abraham’s house, because of the foreskins.

Chapter 3



Chapter 4

“<i>You have captured my heart, my sister, my bride</i>” [4:9]. You take me to heart, my sister, my bride. “<i>You have captured my heart with a glance of one of your eyes</i>” [4:9]. “<i>With a glance of one of your eyes.</i>” These are the <i>good attributes</i> that you have. “<i>With one coil of your necklace</i>” [4:9]. This is <i>Abraham Our Patriarch</i> who was called a giant [<i>anaq</i>], as the verse says, “<i>a great man among the giants</i>” [Joshua, 14:5]. The Holy One said this to Israel as a parable of a groom speaking to his bride. However, one can ask about this parable, why does the groom boast about the bride that she has one eye? The verse says, “<i>You have captured me, my sister, with one of your eyes</i>” [4:9]. It would be better if she had both eyes. The explanation is that this is a parable. A king wanted to take a queen for himself from a distant land and wanted to see for himself that she had no physical defects. However, when the distance was too great and he could not leave his land. What did the king do? He sends for his painter and orders him to paint an accurate likeness, with all of her limbs. The painter paints her with great diligence and brings the image to the king with great joy. The painter thinks that he will be well rewarded for his diligent work. When the king sees the painting, he throws it away and is very angry with the painter. He quickly sends for another painter and orders him to correctly paint the figure. The painter thinks about what the king meant and understands the true meaning and says [to himself]. If I painted the figure full face with both eyes, like two people facing each other, then one could see that the face has no defects. However, one could not see the back and she might easily have a hunchback. Therefore, the painter was smart and painted the right side of the face with one eye and afterwards the left side, also with the left eye, so that one could also see the back. He brought it this way to the king. The king saw the painting and loved it very much and was very happy with the wisdom of the painter and gave him great <i>presents.</i> This is the meaning of the verse. It is a parable about the <i>groom</i> who boasted about the <i>bride</i>, you have captured my heart with one of your eyes, and loved her so much afterwards that he knew that she had no <i>defects.</i> This is what he means when he says further; you have captured my heart with a coil of your necklace. The Holy One says the same thing to Israel, that she will have no <i>defects in her Torah</i>, as the verse says, “<i>Your brow [gleams] like a pomegranate</i>” [6:7]. This means that the most insignificant among you is fuller with <i>mitzvot</i> and <i>good deeds</i> than a pomegranate is full of seeds.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Erubin,</i> 19a.</i>

Chapter 5



Chapter 6

“<i>To the nut grove</i>” [6:11]. The <i>Yalkut</i> writes that the Torah is compared to a nut. Just like a nut, even if it is covered with manure, it is not loathsome. It is the same with a <i>sage</i>; even when he stinks, he is not loathsome because of the Torah that is in his body. Another explanation is, when fruits fall to the earth, no sound is heard. However, with nuts, when one of them falls to the ground, one hears it bang. The righteous ones of Israel are the same; when they die, their voice and <i>good name</i> are widely heard. Another explanation is, there are three types of nuts. Some are easy to open and one can take out all of their contents to eat. There are some nuts that one breaks open to take out what is inside them. The third kind is some nuts that are hard to break open and one derives little benefit from them. It is the same with some in Israel. There are some who allow others to have benefit from them and give to charity. There are some others in Israel that one must speak with that they should contribute to charity and as a result of the request they give charity. The third group is those from whom one demands that they give to give charity and they still don’t give charity. <i>Rabbi Levi</i> said: “<i>the door that is not open to a mitzvah is open to the physician.</i>” This means that the door that does not give charity, the same door must be ready for the <i>physicians</i> to enter, for there will be many sick people in that house.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, <i>Song of Songs</i>, <i>Remez</i>, 992.</i>

Chapter 7

“<i>A king is held captive in the tresses</i>” [7:6]. The Yalkut writes: <i>King David</i> said, “<i>O that I might dwell in Your tent forever</i>” [Psalms, 61:5]. This means, let me live in two worlds. One asks a question, how is it possible to live at the same time in two <i>worlds?</i> The answer is that <i>King David</i> said: <i>Lord of the Universe</i>, let <i>words of Torah</i> be said because of me, in this world after my death. This will be as if I am living in two worlds, since my lips will move in the grave, just like when <i>words of Torah</i> are said because of me in the world. Concerning this, the verse says, “<i>And your mouth like choicest wine</i>… <i>gliding over the lips of sleepers</i>” [7:10]. The lips of the <i>sages</i> move <i>in the grave</i> where they sleep.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Song of Songs, <i>Remez,</i> 992.</i>
“<i>The mandrakes yield their fragrance</i>” [7:14]. The Yalkut writes: “<i>mandrakes</i>” refers to the <i>two tribes of Issachar and Zebulun</i>, the two tribes that were born as a result of the <i>mandrakes</i> that Leah gave her sister Rachel so that Jacob would sleep with her. These same <i>mandrakes</i> give a pleasant odor from the Torah that <i>Zebulun</i>, who engaged in business and made money which he gives to his brother Issachar for his needs, since he spent all of his time engaged in the study of Torah, as the verse says, “<i>Rejoice O Zebulun on your journeys, and Issachar, in your tents</i>” [Deuteronomy, 33:18]. This means, rejoice Zebulun on your journeys for merchandise and Issachar in your tents with the Torah.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Song of Songs, <i>Remez,</i> 993.</i>

Chapter 8

“<i>If only it could be as with a brother</i>” [8:1]. This means, Israel talks to the Holy One, who would love you more; you treat me with love like one brother to another. The Yalkut writes concerning this verse. Which brothers did Israel mean? We find that from the beginning of the world that brothers hated each other. The first brothers were <i>Cain and Abel</i>, and <i>Cain</i> killed his brother <i>Abel. Ishmael</i> also hated his brother <i>Isaac. Esau</i> hated his brother <i>Jacob</i> and wanted to kill him. Joseph’s brothers also hated their brother Joseph. What kind of brother did Israel mean when they said to the Holy One that He should show them the love of one brother for another? <i>However</i>, this means <i>Moses and Aaron</i> who were brothers who loved each other. When <i>Moses assumed the kingship</i> and <i>Aaron the priesthood</i>, each rejoiced and one did not envy the other.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Song of Songs, <i>Remez,</i> 993.</i>
The verse continues, “<i>I could kiss you when I meet you in the street</i>” [8:1]. I find you outside and I kiss you. This means that when the Holy One sent <i>Moses Our Teacher</i>, <i>peace unto him</i>, the first time to <i>Pharaoh, king of Egypt</i>, God spoke to Aaron that he should go to meet Moses. Aaron encountered Moses at God’s mountain and kissed him. This is what Israel means; that the Holy One should also show them the same love that the two brothers had for each other. Another explanation is that they mean how <i>Joseph the righteous</i> treated his brothers even after all the bad things they did to <i>Joseph the righteous.</i> Nonetheless, he had compassion for them, kissed them, and cried over them and said, “<i>I will sustain you</i>” [Genesis, 50:21]. This means, I will feed you and show you nothing but love. Israel also asks this, even when they are at times rebellious against God, Blessed be He. Similarly, He should be <i>merciful</i> and again show them love like Joseph showed his brothers.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Song of Songs, <i>Remez,</i> 993.</i>
“<i>Hurry, my beloved</i>” [8:14]. Make me fly from the exile, my friend, Holy One. “<i>Swift as a gazelle</i>” [8:14]. This means that Israel is compared to a stag. A stag, even if it runs to the ends of the earth, it always comes back to the first city from which it started. We find a story about a king called <i>Dekeltinus</i> who hunted several stags and covered their horns with gold and sent them to distant lands that are called <i>Africa.</i> After thirteen years, the stags came back to the first city where the king had hunted them and he recognized them because of their gilded horns. Similarly, Israel is compared to the stags, who even now are dispersed in the exile, from one end of the world to the other. When the Messiah will come, we will again return to the first place, to <i>Jerusalem</i>, as the verse says, “<i>I will go and return to my first place.</i>”<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">This “verse” is a conflation of Hosea 2:9 and 5:15.</i> This means that I will go and will again return to my first city, Jerusalem. This should be soon, in our days, and let us say amen.

Ruth



Chapter 1

“<i>It was in the days that the Judges judged</i>” [1:1]. It was in the days that the Judges were judged and there was a famine in the land and a man from <i>Bethlehem in Judah</i> went to live in the plains of Moab, he, his wife and his two sons. Scripture informs us of two things. The first was the story of <i>Ruth and Boaz</i> that occurred in the days when a king did not yet rule, but Israel had <i>Judges</i> who led and <i>judged all Israel.</i> However, everywhere that Scripture has an extra word, “<i>when the Judges judged</i>,” when it should have only said, “<i>It was in the days of the Judges</i>,” it wants to show that the Judges were judged. When the Judges became evil and they were to be judged, or one can say the people were so evil that when the Judge wanted to punish them, they would <i>denigrate the Judge</i> and say to him, you want to punish me, punish yourself. This is the meaning of the verse “<i>the Judges judged.</i>” This means that they judged the Judges.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Baba Bathra,</i> 15b.</i> Since the generation did not want to follow its leaders, therefore <i>all of Israel cried woe.</i> That is why the verse begins with “<i>And it was in the days</i>” and wherever the phrase “<i>And it was in the days</i>” is found, it indicates that there was trouble and suffering in those times.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Genesis Rabbah,</i> 42.3.</i> That is why “<i>and it was</i>” is mentioned two times, to show that there were two types of hunger and suffering. There was famine and they had no bread. The second was that there was no Torah in the land.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Ruth, <i>Remez</i> 597.</i> This teaches me that when there is famine of Torah, there also comes, <i>heaven forbid</i>, famine of bread and the result of this famine was that Elimelech and his household died and that his sons intermarried with the nations of the world.
<i>Elimelech</i> was a very rich man<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Baba Bathra,</i> 91a.</i> and when the famine came, he said: now all the people will come and stand before my door and ask me for bread and I will not be able to resist.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ruth Rabbah,</i> 1.4.</i> He had an evil heart and would derive no pleasure from giving the people [bread]. Therefore, he left the <i>land of Israel for another country.</i> He intended to keep his wealth and remain in a <i>foreign land</i>, but God, blessed be He, who is in the whole world, finds the person everywhere to pay them their due. The person thinks that when he gives the poor something, he will become poor because of this. He does not know that he eats with the poor. Therefore, God, blessed be He, punished <i>Elimelech</i>, because he moved from the Holy Land to an impure land and he mixed with the <i>gentiles.</i> From this we learn that one sin brings another<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">M. <i>Avot,</i> 4:2.</i> and Scripture shows how much God loves the one who goes to the land of Israel and how much God hates the one who leaves the <i>land of Israel.</i> That is why Scripture says that he left the <i>land of Israel.</i>
“<i>And a man went from Bethlehem in Judah</i>” [1:1]. It does not say that he went with his cattle, even though he had many cattle. When he traveled in the land of Israel, it is written that he went with camels, horses and donkeys. <i>However</i>, he wants to tell us how much God hated this person because he was leaving the land of Israel and therefore does not want to write about him and how he traveled.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Ruth, <i>Remez</i> 598.</i>
We find ten famines from the beginning of the world until the Messiah will come. The first was in the days of <i>Adam</i>; the second in the days of <i>Lamech</i>; the third in the days of <i>Abraham</i>; the fourth in the days of <i>Isaac</i>; the fifth in the days of <i>Jacob</i>; the sixth in the days of <i>Boaz</i>; the seventh in the days of <i>King David</i>; the eighth in the days of the <i>prophet Elijah</i>; the ninth in the days of <i>Elisha</i> in the cities of <i>Samaria</i>; the tenth will be in the days of the Messiah; not hunger for bread, but hunger to study Torah.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Genesis Rabbah,</i> 25.3.</i>
Why do we read [the Book of] Ruth on <i>Shavuot?</i> We demonstrate that the Torah that was given on <i>Shavuot</i> is only <i>fulfilled</i> through suffering and pain.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Ruth, <i>Remez</i> 596.</i> Some say that we read [the Book of] Ruth on <i>Shavuot</i> because this was the time of the harvest in the land of Israel. This also shows us that we should give charity and perform acts of lovingkindness, just like Boaz did with Ruth.
“<i>The man</i>’<i>s name was Elimelech</i>” [1:2] The man’s name was <i>Elimelech</i> and the name of his wife was <i>Naomi</i> and the names of his two sons were <i>Machlon and Chilion</i>, people from the city of <i>Bethlehem in Judah</i> and they came to the plains of Moab. One can ask why does Scripture say the husband’s name? However, it wants to show that he was an important man, who was well known and of noble descent, a son of <i>Nahshon ben Aminadav</i>, who was a prince of Israel in the time of Moses Our Teacher.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Baba Bathra,</i> 91a.</i> Also, God punished him severely because he left the land of Israel and even the <i>merit of his ancestors</i> did not help him.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Baba Bathra,</i> 91a.</i>
Since his parents were very religious and some sages say that the Holy One judged the world at that time and the court was standing in heaven. The Holy One concealed Elimelech from the court so that Elimelech should not be <i>judged</i> and that is why it says, “<i>a man went from Bethlehem in Judah</i>” [1:1]. This means that a man left Bethlehem and he was not mentioned by name. Afterwards, Scripture says, “<i>the man</i>’<i>s name was Elimelech</i>” [1:2]. This means, Elimelech was mentioned by name. The heavenly angels of the <i>attribute of judgment</i> did not want to tolerate him and brought him before [the court] and the decree was soon issued that Elimelech and all his children must die. Furthermore, one can ask, why does it have to mention his wife’s name or those of his children? However, Scripture shows that when the husband does not want to give charity to the poor and the wife or children tell the husband to give charity or the opposite, then the <i>evil decree is annulled.</i> When they all agree not to donate, heaven forbid, they are all equally culpable and all must die. Therefore, Scripture names them all individually, because they are equally [culpable].<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Ruth, <i>Remez</i> 599.</i>
Some sages say that Elimelech and Machlon and Chilion were the <i>greatest people of their generation</i> and supposedly left the land of Israel as soon as they had to eat bread made of bran. Why did God, blessed be He, punish them? They should have prayed for their <i>generation</i> and they did not do it and that is why they were punished.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Ruth, <i>Remez</i> 599.</i>
Scripture says that they were respectable people and the sages said that Ruth was the daughter of the <i>king of Moab</i><sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanhuma</i>, <i>Va-Yehi</i> 14.</i> and took Machlon as a husband, so the two of them must have been respectable people if the king intermarried with them. Our sages say: what sin did they commit by taking daughters of <i>Moabites?</i> The explanation is, because the children took on the attribute of the <i>Moabites</i> that they did not want to give bread and water to the Israelites when they left Egypt.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy, 23:5.</i> Therefore, the children must also take such wives.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Ruth, <i>Remez</i> 600.</i>
“<i>And Elimelech died</i>” [1:3]. <i>Elimelech</i> the husband of <i>Naomi</i> died and left her and two sons. One may ask: why does it have to tell us that <i>Elimelech</i> was the husband of <i>Naomi?</i> It is written above that he was the husband of <i>Naomi.</i> However, it shows that when the husband is taken, to the sorrow of the wife. Therefore, it says that <i>Elimelech</i>, the husband of <i>Naomi</i>, died to the sorrow of his wife. It is the same when the wife dies, to the sorrow of her husband. We learn this from the Patriarch Jacob who said, “<i>Rachel died, to my sorrow</i>” [Genesis, 48:7]. This means that Rachel died, that is to say that she was taken and died.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Ruth, <i>Remez</i> 600.</i>
“<i>They married Moabite women</i>” [1:4]. They took <i>Moabite women</i> as wives. One took <i>Orpah</i> and the other took <i>Ruth</i> and they lived there for ten years.
Our sages say that the children married the <i>Moabites</i> and they did not convert nor did they have immersion.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ruth Rabbah,</i> 2.9.</i> It was also not yet <i>interpreted</i> in the <i>house of study</i> that a female Moabite or Ammonite may become an Israelite, but a male Moabite or Ammonite may not enter the community of Israel, This law was not yet interpreted, so why did these two children, <i>Machlon and Chilion</i>, marry <i>Moabite women?</i> The considered the Torah as not significant. When <i>Boaz married Ruth</i>, the <i>halakhah</i> was immediately decided that an Israelite might marry a woman from <i>Ammon and Moab.</i> However, an <i>Israelite woman</i> may not marry an <i>Ammonite or Moabite</i> man. Some sages say that they did convert, but not completely and they demonstrate this from the verse where <i>Naomi</i> says to her daughters-in-law, dear daughters-in-law go back to your mother’s house. It would have been different if they had considered themselves as proper <i>Israelites.</i> How could <i>Naomi</i> have said to them, go back and become gentiles and cause good women to sin? Our <i>sages</i> also show from <i>scriptural verses</i> that they observed some Jewish practices, as the verse says, “<i>your sister-in-law has returned to her people and her gods</i>” [1:5]. This means that <i>Naomi said to Ruth</i>, your sisterin- law <i>Orpah</i> is returning to her people and to her god. You also return to your god. We hear from this that she had become somewhat <i>Israelitish.</i> She was called <i>Orpah</i> because she turned her back<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. neck.</i> to her mother-in-law, since <i>Oprah</i> means back.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Ruth, <i>Remez</i> 600.</i>
What kind of merit did the <i>king of Moab</i> have that his daughter <i>Ruth</i> married an Israelite and the <i>Davidic dynasty</i> issued from her? The story occurred in the days of the Judges, when the king of Moab ruled over Israel and caused them great troubles. They served the <i>king of Moab</i> for 18 years, until they screamed to God. God sent a helper called <i>Ehud the son of Gera</i>, from the tribe of <i>Benjamin</i>, and he was left-handed. Israel sent a nice present to the <i>king of Moab</i> through the hands of <i>Ehud.</i> Ehud made for himself a double-edged sword, a cubit long. He was able to wear it under his garment, so that it could not be seen. He girded it on his right side, since he was left-handed. He had it close to hand and he brought the present to the king. The king was a stout man and fat. When he finished his speech, he dismissed his colleagues who brought the present. He thought that one person could run away more easily. When the king was sitting on his throne, <i>Ehud said to the king</i>, I have a secret to tell you. The king told everyone to leave. <i>Ehud</i> said to him: <i>My lord King</i>, I have a message from God, which is God’s command. The king stood up from his throne, <i>out of respect for God</i>, and <i>Ehud</i> stabbed him with the sword in his belly and his innards spilled out and the sword remained stuck in his body. <i>Ehud</i> ran up and locked the king in the room and left. He helped all of Israel get out of its troubles.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Judges, 3:14–28.</i> Because he stood up from his throne <i>out of respect for God</i>, blessed be He, God, blessed be He, said: because you rose out of respect for me, I will also establish a son for you who will sit on God’s throne.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ruth Rabbah,</i> 2.9.</i> They lived there for ten years. This teaches us that the decree lasts for ten years.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Ruth, <i>Remez</i> 600.</i>
“<i>The two of them also died</i>” [1:5]. This means that both <i>Machlon and Chilion</i> also died and their wives and their father’s wife remained. One can ask, why does it say “<i>the two of them also</i>”? This means that the word “<i>also</i>” is superfluous. However, this teaches us that their camels, horses, and donkeys died first. Therefore, it tells us that they also died, just like their animals. Our sages say that God, blessed be He, is compassionate. He does not punish a person immediately with his life, but first punishes him through his money and clothing. Afterwards, with his field, that he has to sell it. If he reflects on it [and repents], it is good. If not, he is punished in that he must sell his house. If he does not reflect on it, he must sell himself, and not that he will sell himself to a Jew, but to a <i>gentile, heaven forbid.</i> God is compassionate and gladly wants that the person should reflect and punishes him slowly. <i>God</i> gives the person a <i>warning</i> that he should reflect.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ruth Rabbah,</i> 2.10; <i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Ruth, <i>Remez</i> 601.</i>
Some sages say that Scripture shows that “<i>and they died</i>” means that she was pregnant with a child and even that child was miscarried. “<i>I went away full and the Lord has brought me back empty</i>” [1:21]. This means, I went full and returned empty.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ruth Rabbah,</i> 3.7; <i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Ruth, <i>Remez</i> 601.</i>
Some ask, who does Scripture say “<i>va-yamutu</i>” with a <i>vav</i> after the <i>mem?</i> However, it wants to show us that when someone dies and leaves no children, like <i>Machlon and Chilion</i>, this is a true death and a great and complete death. That is why “<i>va-yamutu</i>” is written with a superfluous <i>vav.</i> It shows that the sons therefore died from the world that was created in six days. Therefore, they did not want to give charity, which is distributed in six forms. The first is a commandment to give charity to a gentile. The next one is better, to a Jew, even if he lives in another city. The third is better, to give to a pauper who lives in his city rather than a Jewish stranger from another city. The fourth is better, to give his friends and relatives rather than strangers. The fifth is better, to give his children before other relatives, as Scripture says, “<i>Happy are those who act justly, who do right at all times</i>” [Psalms, 106:3]. This means, he who acts justly and is charitable at all times. Where is it possible to be charitable all the time? He means, whoever feeds his sons and daughters when they are small, he is charitable all the time. The sixth, he who feeds his father and mother, this is the true charity and highest attribute, since he <i>fulfills two commandments</i> at one time, that is, the commandment of charity and the commandment of honoring father and mother. The one who gives charity is blessed with six blessings. This also shows the superfluous <i>vav</i> of <i>va-yamutu.</i>
“<i>She left the place</i>” [1:7]. She left the city where she had been and her two daughters-in-law with her and they went on they way to return to the land of Judah. Our sages ask: why does it have to say that they left the city? It says previously that they returned from the plains of Moab and when they returned, they must have departed? The answer is that it shows that when a righteous person [<i>zaddiq</i>] leaves a city, the beauty and praise of the city leaves with him.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Genesis Rabbah,</i> 68.6; <i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Ruth, <i>Remez</i> 601.</i> Therefore it says, “<i>she left the place.</i>” This means, and she left the city, that is to say, her departure made an impression in the city.
“<i>May the Lord deal kindly with you</i>” [1:8]. This means that God should act with lovingkindness with you as you have done with me. This means, like an act of lovingkindness that you did with me when you fed me and absolved me from the <i>ketubah</i> of your husbands,<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>ketubah</i> guarantees the wife a certain sum of money in the event of the death of the husband or divorce.</i> since <i>Machlon and Chilion</i> had no fields and they also did not go to assign their <i>ketubot</i>, since they were in a foreign land at the time, so <i>Naomi</i> would have to <i>be the guarantor</i> for their <i>ketubot.</i> Now, after her sons’ deaths, they absolved her of the <i>ketubot</i> and that was the act of lovingkindness.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ruth Rabbah,</i> 2.14.</i>
“<i>May the Lord give you</i>” [1:9]. God should give you and you should find security as a wife in your husband’s house. One can ask, why does it write “<i>umzena</i>,” meaning she, that one, that she should find? Why does it not write “<i>umazenah</i>”? This translates as: they should find, that is to say, both daughters-inlaw. However, the sages say that <i>Naomi saw prophetically</i> that only one daughter- in-law would find security, that is to say, <i>Ruth</i> and not Orpah. The same night that Orpah left Naomi, one hundred gentiles slept with her and <i>Goliath the Philistine</i>, who was a king, was born from her. From the merit that Orpah was worthy because of the forty steps that she took with Naomi, she had the merit that Goliath remained standing for forty days before Israel and <i>King Saul</i>, before he was killed.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, I Samuel, <i>Remez</i> 126.</i> However, his kingdom did not last long and soon fell into the hands of <i>King David</i>, who was a descendant of <i>Ruth.</i> They ask further: why does it have to promise that a woman should find security in the house of her husband? Why doesn’t it say, God should give you security wherever He wants? However, <i>Rabbi Johanan</i> says that we learn from this that a woman has no security except in the house of her husband.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Ruth, <i>Remez</i> 601.</i> Some sages also say that <i>Orpah</i> slept that night with one hundred gentiles and a dog.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ruth Rabbah,</i> 2.20.</i>
“<i>Turn back, my daughters, for</i>” [1:12]. Turn back my daughters for I am too old to be married. Even if I thought there was hope for me to have a husband and if I would become pregnant tonight. Or if I had children, would you wait so long. One can ask of Scripture: what does it mean when it says if I had children and you would marry them? How are they allowed to marry the children of Naomi, since they will be their brothers’ wives and one is not allowed to marry his brother’s wife, if he is not able to impregnate her?<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ruth Rabbah,</i> 2.16.</i> However, our sages say that the <i>marriages of Machlon and Chilion were not religiously valid</i> since <i>Orpah and Ruth</i> were <i>gentiles</i> and <i>betrothal</i> does not apply to a gentile. However, now they wanted to convert and therefore they would not be the wives of the children’s brothers.
One asks about Scripture, why does it write the word <i>leikhna</i> without a <i>heh.</i> He writes <i>leikhna</i> without a <i>heh</i>, because this way the word adds up to one hundred. The <i>lamed</i> amounts to thirty, the <i>khaf</i> amounts to twenty, and the <i>nun</i> amounts to fifty. All together, this is one hundred. This showed that one of them would go away and one hundred uncircumcised men would sleep with her. From the other one, <i>King David</i> would come, who would marry the daughter <i>of King Saul</i>, whose <i>name was Michal</i> and her name also amounts to one hundred. He would betroth her with one hundred <i>Philistine foreskins.</i> That is to say, Saul did not want to give his daughter <i>Michal</i> to David unless he would kill a hundred Philistines. He had also promised his daughter because he had killed <i>Goliath the Philistine.</i> Afterwards, Saul said, if you won’t kill another hundred <i>Philistines</i>, I won’t give her to you.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">I Samuel, 18:17–27.</i>
Our sages ask: when Scripture writes, if I also took a man this night,<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Ruth, 1:12.</i> this teaches us <i>proper behavior.</i> One should only have sexual relations with his <i>wife</i> at night. That is why the verse says, if I slept with a man this night, when it should have said, if I slept with a man immediately.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Ruth, <i>Remez</i> 601.</i>
Our sages say that she was called <i>Ruth</i> because her name amounts to six hundred and six and the number of God’s commandments is six hundred and thirteen. <i>Ruth</i> now accepted six hundred and six commandments, since when she was a gentile she already observed the seven commandments that had been given to Noah.
“<i>And Ruth said</i>” [1:16]. And Ruth said, do not ask me to leave you and to turn back from you. Rather, where you go, I will also go and where you spend the night, I will also lodge, and your God is my God. Our sages learn from the example of Ruth how one should behave toward a convert. Therefore, the word “<i>return</i>” is written three times. When a person wishes to convert, one should dissuade them three times and one should test them to see if they wish to be a proper convert, for the sake of God or for the sake of money. Ruth said: if you do not want to have me as a convert, then I will go to another Jew and become <i>Jewish.</i> I would rather become a <i>convert</i> by your hand. When <i>Naomi</i> heard this, she turned to <i>Ruth</i> and told her about several <i>commandments</i> that she should observe. She began, my dear daughter, it is not appropriate for Jewish daughters to go alone into a gentile house, as gentile women do. Ruth responded, where you go, I will also go. <i>Naomi</i> said, my dear daughter, a <i>daughter of Israel</i> is not allowed to live in a house where there is no <i>mezuzah. Ruth</i> responded, where you will spend the night; there I will also spend the night.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Ruth, <i>Remez</i> 601.</i>
Some sages say that she said to <i>Ruth:</i> we have been commanded that one is not allowed to walk outside the <i>boundary</i> on the Sabbath. She responded: where you will go there I will also go. Naomi said to her: we have been commanded that a woman cannot be in a room with a strange man. <i>Ruth</i> responded: where you will spend the night there I will spend the night. <i>Naomi</i> said, Israel is separated from the nations of the world by six hundred and thirteen commandments. Ruth answered; your people are my people with commandments. <i>Naomi</i> said: we have been forbidden to worship <i>foreign gods.</i> Ruth responded: your God is my God.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Ruth, <i>Remez</i> 601.</i>
“<i>Where you die, I will die</i>” [1:17]. Where you will die, there will I also die and be buried. So He should do good for me and so should He continue to do, and only death will separate me from you. <i>Naomi said to Ruth:</i> Four deaths have been commanded to Israel. One is that one is stoned if they transgress God’s commandments. The second is that one is burned. The third is that one is killed with the sword. The fourth is that one is hanged and strangled. Ruth responded: the way you die, so will I also die. Naomi said: there are two <i>graves.</i> One is where those who are stoned and those who are burned are buried, and a <i>cemetery</i> where those who are killed by the sword and are strangled are brought. Ruth responded: where you will be buried, there will I also be buried. <i>Naomi said to Ruth:</i> my dear daughter, fulfill as many commandments as you can in this world, since one cannot fulfill any commandments in the other world.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Ruth, <i>Remez</i> 601.</i>
This is the meaning of the verse “<i>if anything but death parts me from you</i>” [1:17]. That is to say, fulfill commandments in this world, since death will separate between you and me. Do not think that the righteous person stands near the evil one. Every righteous person has a <i>canopy</i> of his or her own, as we find in the story of <i>Rabbi Simeon ben Halaftah.</i> One Friday he did not have what to eat for the Sabbath. He went outside the city and prayed to God. A hand came and handed him a <i>precious stone.</i> He immediately went to the storekeeper, sold it, and bought fine food <i>in honor of the Sabbath.</i> His wife said to him: where did you get the money with which you purchased the goods for the Sabbath? She said to him: if you do not tell me, I will not eat it. He told his wife the story of what occurred. His wife said: swear that you will return the <i>precious stone on Saturday night</i>, if not, I won’t eat. <i>Rabbi Simeon</i> asked why? His wife said, do you want that your <i>canopy</i> and chair in the other world should be lesser than those of your <i>colleagues?</i> What you have in this stone is a piece of the other world. You will have less in the other world. Then <i>Rabbi Simeon</i> went to <i>Rabbi</i> [Judah the Prince] and told him the story of his wife’s request. Rabbi [Judah] said to him. Tell your wife that if your chair or canopy in the other world will need anything, I will rectify it with my share. <i>Rabbi Simeon</i> went and told his wife what Rabbi [Judah] had said. His wife responded, show me your teacher who taught you Torah. They both came before <i>Rabbi</i> [Judah] and Rabbi Simeon’s wife said to Rabbi [Judah]. In the other world, will one righteous person be able to see into the canopy of his neighbor, since each righteous person has his own separate canopy. Why do you, Rabbi [Judah], want to give of your canopy to Rabbi Simeon? Then Rabbi Simeon went to return it and a hand came and took the precious stone. The latter miracle was greater than the first one, because heaven gives, but it does not take things back up. When he took the precious stone from the hand, the hand of Rabbi Simeon was underneath and the hand of the angel was over the hand of Rabbi Simeon. Now, when he returned the precious stone, the hand of the angel was underneath and the hand of Rabbi Simeon was above, over the hand of the angel, just like when a person <i>lends</i> something to his friend.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Exodus Rabbah,</i> 52.3.</i>
Concerning this the verse says, “<i>if anything but death parts me from you</i>” [1:17]. This means that Naomi said to Ruth, do not think that you will become rich from this and have the world because you <i>converted.</i> In this world there is no difference between one and another. For the person who is pious, after their death, in the other world, there is a difference between the righteous who are separate and the evildoers who are separate. This is the meaning of the verse “<i>if anything but death parts me from you</i>” [1:17]. This means, death separates us. That is to say, in the other world.
“<i>When she saw that she was determined</i>” [1:18]. She saw that she was determined to go with her and she avoided talking to her.
“<i>And the two went on</i>” [1:19]. The two of them went on until they came to <i>Bethlehem.</i> When they came to <i>Bethlehem</i>, the whole city was amazed that this was Naomi. Our sages say how <i>beloved by God</i> is the <i>convert</i>, that as soon as Ruth had the determination to <i>convert</i>, Scripture says, “<i>And the two went on.</i>” This means that the two of them went. Scripture compares Ruth to Naomi.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ruth Rabbah,</i> 3.5.</i> It should have read, “<i>and Ruth went with her.</i>” This means that Ruth went with her.
Our sages say that on the same day that Ruth came to Bethlehem, the wife of <i>Boaz</i> was carried out to the cemetery. The whole world came to perform an <i>act of lovingkindness</i> for the wife of <i>Boaz</i> and accompanied her to the cemetery. She was carried out of <i>Boaz</i>’<i>s</i> house when Ruth wandered into the city. Everyone was there, great and small, and they saw Naomi coming. The whole city was amazed and said, is this Naomi who used to ride in a decorated carriage and now she walks barefoot and in torn clothes? They said: is this Naomi whose face shined with beauty from good food and drink? Now it is different and her face is green and yellow. Naomi said: don’t call me Naomi, which means lovely with <i>good deeds</i>, and my deeds are not lovely. My deeds are seldom lovely. Has not God punished me and done bad things to me? It is a parable. Someone sells an ox to plow at the market and he praises the ox that plows well and it is very strong for the work. The people answered. If the ox is so good, why does it have welts and wounds? Naomi spoke similarly. If my deeds were so good, why did God punish me?<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ruth Rabbah,</i> 3.6.</i>
<i>Rabbi Hiyya</i> said: All sufferings are difficult for the person, but the suffering of poverty is more difficult than other sufferings. With all the other forms of suf- fering, they come and when they depart the person was as before. However, the sufferings of poverty make a person gloomy, as Scripture says, “<i>my eyes pine away from affliction</i>” [Psalms, 88:10]. This means that my eyes have been darkened because of poverty. A story occurred to a pious person who did not want to take anything from any person. He did not have more than a garment, and a sheet and he cried the whole night and prayed to God. Finally, he was so poor that he lay on the garbage heap with torn clothes. Elijah the prophet encountered him and stood opposite him and asked him, would you like me to lend you two pennies, so that you might engage in commerce with it and you should feed yourself with it. He said, yes, took them, and engaged in business with them. That same year he became very rich from this and forgot to pray and to fulfill other commandments, because of his great fortune. The Holy One said to Elijah. I had a pious person in the world who prayed with concentration. Now, you have chased him away. Elijah went to him again and found him working in a big business and said to him. I am the man who lent you the two pennies. Give them back to me. He gave them back and not long thereafter the pious man was again very poor, as before. He again sat on the garbage heap in torn clothes. <i>Elijah the Prophet</i> again came to him and asked him, how are things going for you? He responded, very difficult. Elijah said to him: will you swear to me that you will be pious if you will become rich again and pray with concentration. He said, yes. He took the two pennies and became rich, as before.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Ruth, <i>Remez</i> 601.</i>

Chapter 2

“<i>Naomi had a kinsman on her husband</i>’<i>s side</i>” [2:1]. One can ask about this verse, why does it say, “<i>and his name was Boaz</i>” [2:1]. Normally we find “<i>Goliath was his name</i>” [I Samuel, 17:4] or “<i>Naval was his name</i>” [I Samuel, 25:25]. However, we find concerning evildoers that their name always comes first, when we find “<i>Goliath was his name</i>” or “<i>Naval was his name.</i>” We find concerning the righteous that the name is written last. We find concerning <i>Mordecai</i> “<i>his name was Mordecai</i>” [Esther, 2:5], “<i>his name was Elkanah</i>” [I Samuel, 1:1] and “<i>his name was Boaz.</i>” This because he compares the righteous to the Creator of the world, as it says concerning God, blessed be He, “<i>And my name YHVH, I did not make known</i>” [Exodus, 6:3]. Here also, the name is written last. First the word “<i>and his name</i>” is written and afterwards YHVH.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ruth Rabbah,</i> 4.3.</i>
“<i>And Ruth said</i>” [2:2]. <i>Ruth the Moabite</i> said to <i>Naomi:</i> I will go into the field and I will collect after someone who will show me kindness. <i>Naomi</i> spoke to her, go my daughter. Our sages say that Scripture shows us that a person should not be lazy when he knows that somewhere precious things can be obtained, as we find with Ruth. Since she was not lazy or idle, she did not tarry to sit in the house for very long and quickly hurried to find food for herself and her mother-in-law. Our sages also learn from this verse that a person should not have anything to do with someone who has an evil eye or is stingy, even though the householder has no share in the gift of the gleanings [<i>leket</i>], that which is forgotten [<i>shikhah</i>], and the corners of the field [<i>peah</i>]. The Torah has commanded that he should leave this for the <i>poor.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus, 19:9–10.</i> Similarly, it is good that the <i>poor person</i> should see not to collect in the field of a person who has an evil eye. Thus, <i>Ruth</i> said, I will also collect in a field where they will gladly have me, even though the Torah has allowed the poor person to collect wherever he wants.
“<i>Presently Boaz arrived from Bethlehem</i>” [2:4] Presently Boaz arrived from <i>Bethlehem</i> and he said to the reapers, God be with you, and they responded, and may you be blessed by God. Some ask about this verse, why does it say about Boaz that he said to the reapers, “<i>God be with you</i>” [2:4], with the <i>name</i> [of God] first, and they responded, “<i>may you be blessed by God</i>” [2:4], with the <i>name</i> [of God] last? This is the reason for the custom that when someone greets someone, he says, peace unto you [<i>shalom aleikhem</i>] and the other one responds, unto you peace [<i>aleikhem shalom</i>]. The word <i>peace</i> last and the word <i>peace</i> first. Our sages say that we learn from this verse that one should not be arrogant, even if he is very rich. He should even greet his servants and maids. Not like many communal leaders, who do not greet their servants and maids, out of great arrogance. Therefore, the verse describes how Boaz, who was both a Judge and a communal leader, greeted his servants and maids and blessed them.
“<i>And Boaz said</i>” [2:5]. And Boaz said to the servant who was supervising the reapers, to whom does the young woman belong? Our sages ask about the verse, was it customary for Boaz, a Judge over Israel, to ask about every young woman? However, our sages say that the good Boaz saw in the young woman great modesty and good deeds. Therefore, he asked who was she? The first thing that he saw was that all the women bent down to collect the wheat and one could see their bare legs from behind, which is a sin. However, Ruth, the modest one, squatted down and when she collected an ear that lay on the ground, she sat down. For standing ears, she stood up. The other women rolled up their skirts and tucked them under their belts. She did not roll up her skirt and let it hang, out of great modesty, so that one should not see her bare legs. He also saw how all the women played with the reapers and Ruth did none of this. Therefore, <i>Boaz</i> asked, the young woman is very <i>modest</i>, who is she?<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Ruth, <i>Remez</i> 601.</i>
“<i>The servant replied</i>” [2:6]. And the servant who was supervising the reapers responded that she is a young woman from <i>Moab.</i> She had returned with <i>Naomi</i> from the plains of Moab. Our sages say, the servant answered, what do you mean Boaz that you consider the young woman so valuable? She has recently come from Moab. <i>Boaz</i> responded: she has a good teacher.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ruth Rabbah,</i> 4.9</i> That is to say, her mother- in-law Naomi who is very pious taught her much and she moved away from the ways of the Moabites. Therefore, it says in the verse, “<i>she came back with Naomi from the country of Moab</i>” [2:6]. That is to say, she removed herself from the deeds that were done in the land of Moab. She returned with Naomi who taught her.
“<i>She prostrated herself</i>” [2:10]. She fell on her knees, bowed to the ground and she said to him. Why have I found grace in your eyes that you recognize me, for I am a stranger? Our sages say that she <i>spoke prophetically to Boaz</i> that he would take her as a wife.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ruth Rabbah,</i> 5.2.</i> Therefore she said, “<i>to recognize me.</i>” This means to recognize me and this is used in regard to sleeping with one’s wife and the verse says to recognize and to know, as we find concerning Adam it is written, “<i>and Adam knew Eve</i>” [Genesis, 4:1]. This means, Adam slept with Eve. I hear from this that he calls sleeping with a woman, <i>and he knew</i>, which is a <i>term denoting wisdom and intelligence.</i> Another reason that it is called this is because every pious man and woman should recognize and know and have a sign between them when they have sexual relations, so that, <i>heaven forbid</i>, he or she should not make a mistake with someone else, as we find concerning <i>Shelomit the daughter of Davri.</i> The Egyptian woke her husband for work and then lay with her. She thought that he was her husband and when she woke up she found who he was.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Exodus Rabbah,</i> 28.1.</i> There is much to write about this. That is why sleeping is to know through a sign that this is his wife or that it is husband. The verse also alluded to this, “<i>why are you so kind to recognize me?</i>” [2:10]. This means, I have found grace in your eyes that you recognize me. This is to say, you will take me as a wife and you will have sexual relations, to know with intelligence.
Why is the meaning of “<i>recognize me</i>” so much like the meaning of “<i>And Adam knew Eve</i>” [Genesis, 4:1]? From this verse we learn that every pious woman who needs to go among men, there should be other women with her in order that she should not be <i>suspected</i> of sleeping with someone. She might cause people to sin, because a person is not believed in these matters, <i>particularly in matters relating to sexual issues.</i> However, someone who is involved in these matters and people <i>suspect</i> them, the Holy One removes the <i>suspicion</i>, as we find concerning Jesse, David’s father, who suspected his wife. <i>God, blessed be He</i>, allowed the matter to be revealed and he knew that David was piously born.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">Ginzberg, <i>Legends</i>, VI, 246, n. 11, suggests the source is an unknown midrash quoted in <i>Midrash Makhiri</i> on Psalms 118.</i>
A story<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">The story as it is presented here is found in Nissim ben Jacob ibn Shahin, <i>An Elegant Composition concerning Relief after Adversity</i>, ed. and trans. By William Brinner. Yale University Press: New Haven, 1977, pp. 127–131. The story is also found in Adolph Jellinek<i>, Bet Ha-Midrash</i>, “<i>Ma</i>’<i>asiyot.</i>” Jerusalem: Bamberger and Wahrmann, 1938, 5: 142–144.</i> occurred that an important Jewish communal leader whose name was <i>Nathan of Zizutah</i> very much wanted to sleep with a woman whose name was Hannah. Her husband was very poor and [Nathan] grew sick [desiring] the woman. The <i>physicians</i> said that they could do nothing to help him until he sleeps with her. The <i>rabbis</i> said: he should rather die than even speak with her. <i>Hannah</i>’<i>s</i> husband had many <i>creditors</i> after him and he was taken away to jail because of his debts. <i>Hannah</i> sat at her spinning wheel day and night and from this [income] she brought her husband food and drink. Finally, the husband spoke to Hannah. My life in prison is miserable. Go now to <i>Nathan of Zizutah</i> and let him lend me money to redeem me from prison. The pious Hannah spoke to him. You know very well that this Nathan is sick because of me and every day he sends messengers to me that I should go to him. I think you must be crazy and she was angry when she left him. Finally, he asked her one more time that she should go to him to borrow money. She responded: give me a <i>divorce</i> and I will go to him so that I will not commit a sin. He said to her. I know for a long time that you would gladly want to see me die in prison, so that you could marry Nathan. In the meantime, you see that I am not dying so you want me to <i>divorce</i> you. Finally, she went and prayed to God and said; I ask you God, protect me from sinning and went to Nathan in his house. The servants and maids said, Nathan’s tasty morsel, when Hannah came into the house. He greeted her with great joy and gave all the servants and maids the day off. Nathan said to Hannah, whatever you want will be given to you. She spoke to him. I desire that you lend me money to redeem my poor husband. He immediately gave her as much money as she needed. Finally, the good Nathan said to Hannah. I have done what you want, now do what I want. She said, I am in your hands. However, I want to inform you that in a brief moment, you can acquire your <i>share in the world to come</i> or lose both <i>this world</i> and the <i>world to come</i> through me, since I have a husband and I am forbidden to you. Imagine that you have fulfilled your desire. Afterwards, you will regret the great sin and scream at the Evil Inclination that misled you. When the man heard her words, he fell on his face to the ground and swore to God and broke his Evil Inclination. The woman went and freed her husband. However, her husband did not believe her and said that she must have slept with Nathan and she said that she was innocent. What did Nathan do? He rode through the streets and God, blessed be He, caused a light to illuminate him and it was very bright. <i>Rabbi Akiva</i> saw someone riding and he called his students and asked them, who is riding? His students said that this was <i>Nathan of Zizutah the pimp.</i> Rabbi Akiva said to his students, do you see anything over him. The students said: we see nothing. Then Rabbi Akiva quickly asked to call him and said to him. My dear son, you are one who will have a <i>share in the world to come.</i> I have seen a light over you. Now tell me what you did. He told him the story of what occurred with Hannah. Rabbi Akiva was very amazed at how he overcame his Evil Inclination and said, you have done a great thing. Therefore, God has shown that you are one who has a <i>share in the world to come</i>, and also in this world. You will certainly have light in the other world, and now study Torah with me. He did so and became a <i>great scholar</i> and sat at the side of Rabbi Akiva.
It once happened that Hannah’s husband came before Rabbi Akiva in the <i>study house.</i> A student asked his teacher. My dear teacher, how is it that <i>Nathan of Zizutah</i> became a great scholar so quickly. Rabbi Akiva told him the story of Hannah and how he overcame it. Hannah’s husband also heard the story and now believed that his wife was right and loved her even more. In the meantime, God removed the <i>suspicion</i> from her. However, not everyone should rely on this. Rabbi Akiva was very amazed that he was able to overcome his Evil Inclination. Therefore, God gave him a great reward, that he was able to subdue his Evil Inclination.
This is also why Boaz also said: “<i>stay close to my girls</i>” [2:8]. This means, just as you have stayed close to my girls, continue to do so. This shows us that Ruth, of her own volition, kept herself above suspicion. We further learn from the verse that when a person sees that someone wants to do something good for him, they should first ask. Why are you doing me a favor, since I have not done you any favors? It is very possible that the other person was mistaken and meant to do a favor for someone else. <i>If so</i>, he accepts a favor that he did not deserve. That is why the verse says, why have I found favor in your eyes, since I am a stranger? Boaz answered, I know well who you are and it is correct to do you a favor.
“<i>And Boaz replied</i>” [2:11]. Boaz replied and said: it has been told to me everything that you have done with your mother-in-law after the death of you hus- band. You left your father and mother, the land of your birth, and you joined a people that you did not previously know, as the verse says. You left your father and mother, means the foreign gods that are called mother and father by the <i>nations of the world.</i> The verse says, you joined a people that you did not know yesterday or before yesterday. This means, had you come yesterday or before yesterday, you would not have been accepted, since only today was the <i>halakhah</i> studied in the <i>house of study</i> that a woman from <i>Moab and Ammon</i> might join Israel, but a man cannot join Israel.<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ruth Rabbah,</i> 5.6; <i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Ruth, <i>Remez</i> 601.</i> The reason that a man from Ammon or Moab cannot join Israel is because they did not want to give bread and water to Israel when they left Egypt.<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy, 23:4–5.</i> The custom was that it was a man used to hand out the bread and not a woman who would bring bread to a wayfarer.
“<i>And he said to her</i>” [2:11]. And Boaz said to her, during the mealtime, come here. You should eat of the bread and dip your bread in vinegar. She sat down near the reapers and he handed her roasted grain and she ate, was satiated, and left some. Our sages say that when a person does a mitzvah, they should do it with their whole heart. Why should Reuben know that the Torah would write about him, “<i>When Reuben heard it, he tried to save him from them</i>” [Genesis, 37:21]? This means, when <i>Reuben</i> heard what his brothers wanted to do to their brother, Joseph, he protected him. However, if Reuben had known that the Holy One would write this about him, he would have brought Joseph to his father on his shoulders. If Boaz had known that the Holy On would write about him, “<i>He handed her roasted grain and she ate her fill and had some left over</i>” [2:14]. If Boaz had known this, he would have given her roasted calves. Our sages say that in previous times when a person did a <i>mitzvah</i>, the prophet wrote it down, but now when a person performs a <i>mitzvah</i>, who writes it down? <i>Elijah the prophet</i> writes it down and the <i>king Messiah</i> and the Holy One sign it.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Ruth, <i>Remez</i> 604.</i>
“<i>She rose to glean</i>” [2:15]. And Boaz said to his servants: let her gather between the rows and don’t embarrass her. We learn from this verse how one should give charity and not embarrass. This is the greatest charity that the poor person does not know from where he receives it. We find that our sages tied money in the back of their garments and let it fall, so that the poor would find it. Boaz also spoke to his servants; you should forget and not embarrass her.
“<i>You should also pull some [stalks]</i>” [2:16]. You should also forget some stalks and let her gather and you should not scream at her.
“<i>Her mother-in-law said to her</i>” [2:19]. Her mother-in-law said to her: where did you gather and where did you work today? May the person who recognized you be blessed. She told her mother-in-law what she had done and the name of the man for whom she worked was Boaz. Our sages learn from this verse much more than, Ruth said to her mother-in-law, the name of the man where I worked was Boaz. The truth is that she did not work for <i>Boaz.</i> However, the verse teaches us that when the householder does something good for the poor person, the poor person does much more good for the householder. His house becomes blessed many times over through the <i>poor person.</i> Therefore, Ruth said: “<i>the man with whom I worked today was Boaz</i>” [2:19]. This means that I worked with Boaz and he did much good for me. He gave me a chunk of bread from his table. When the householder does not do good for the poor person, then he is punished through the poor person. The sages say that when the Holy One wants to take revenge on the nations of the world, He gives Israel into their hands. When He wants to take revenge on Israel, He does it through the hands of the <i>poor</i>, as the verse says, “<i>he will cry out to the Lord against you, and you will incur guilt</i>” [Deuteronomy, 15:9]. This means, as soon as you won’t give to the poor person, and he will call to God and it will be a sin for you. When the poor person stands at your door, the Holy One stands at the right side of the poor person. If the <i>householder</i> does good for the poor person, the Holy One blesses him immediately. If it is the opposite, the Holy One will be well recompensed by him.<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ruth Rabbah,</i> 5.9.</i>
“<i>And Naomi said</i>” [2:20]. And Naomi said to her daughter-in-law: blessed be God who has not failed in his grace to the living and the dead. Naomi said to her, he is a friend, the man who is our savior. Our sages say that it says here that he did an act of grace for the <i>dead.</i> This means that he provided <i>shrouds for the dead.</i> Some ask that the verse says, “<i>the man is related to us</i>” [2:20]. This means that he is our friend. It should have said that we are his friends. The custom is that when one is rich, people would say, I am his relative. Here Naomi makes herself important and said, Boaz is our friend.<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ruth Rabbah,</i> 5.10.</i> However, the plain meaning is that the poor person who eats with the <i>householder</i> does him much good. His household is blessed through the poor person and that is why Naomi said he is our friend and made herself important.
“<i>And Ruth said</i>” [2:21]. Ruth said: he said to me, stay close to my youths until the completion of the harvest. One can ask about this verse, why did Ruth lie, that <i>Boaz</i> told her to stay near his youths? Why would she attribute to Boaz that he would tell a woman to stay with his male servants? Scripture states ex- plicitly that Boaz said, “<i>stay close to my girls</i>” [2:8]. This means, stay with my maidservants. However, our sages say that <i>Ruth</i> learned to lie because she was a Moabite. Therefore, the verse says, “<i>Ruth the Moabite</i>,” that is to say, because she came from <i>Moabites</i>, and that is how she spoke.<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ruth Rabbah,</i> 5.11.</i>
“<i>And Naomi answered her</i>” [2:22]. <i>Naomi</i>, her mother-in-law, said to her. My daughter, I desire for you a rest that will make you happy. Now, our friend <i>Boaz</i>, whose maidservants you were with, is going to thresh the grain in his barn this evening. We learn many <i>customs</i> about how a person should behave from the <i>Scroll of Ruth.</i> He should always personally supervise workers that he hires to be sure that the workers do their work properly and do not slack off. We see, as is written concerning Boaz, he put a servant over the reapers and also came himself to see that the reapers did not flatter the servant, even though he was a very rich man and was a Judge over Israel, and the righteous should also behave this way. They should be <i>careful</i> not to spend money improperly. We find concerning the <i>Patriarch Jacob, of blessed memory</i>, that he forgot a small jug across the river and he returned, no matter how little it was worth.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Hullin,</i> 91a.</i> The same is written concerning Boaz, who slept in the barn himself, to guard the grain. Similarly, Ruth who collected during the day and immediately threshed it the same evening and brought it home.
We also learn from the <i>Scroll of Ruth</i> that when a person does something good, one should repay him with good. However, if he cannot repay it himself, then his relatives should repay it. Boaz did good because Ruth did an act of lovingkindness with Naomi. She was the wife of Elimelech and this same Elimelech was a <i>relative of Boaz.</i> Thus, Boaz did an <i>act of lovingkindness</i> for Ruth and told the reapers to forget stalks for Ruth, expecting that Ruth would notice them. Boaz did all this because Ruth had done an <i>act of lovingkindness for Naomi</i>, his relative’s wife, and also because she converted. In the meantime, Naomi saw that she had much good through Ruth. Naomi wanted to find her security, and that Boaz should marry her and she should be able to repay her acts of lovingkindness.

Chapter 3

“<i>Bathe and anoint yourself</i>” [3:3]. You should bathe and anoint yourself with good oil and herbs. You should dress yourself with good clothes and go down to the barn, but do not disclose yourself to the man until he has eaten and drank. Our sages learn from this verse that even a person which not rich should have two types of clothes, one for the weekdays and the other for the Sabbath.<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ruth Rabbah,</i> 5.12.</i> Therefore, it is written, you should put on your clothes. Obviously, she wouldn’t go naked, but this shows us that she should put on her other clothes and where did she have other clothes? However, this means her Sabbath clothes, even though she was poor, as we see from the above-cited verses, that she collected the ears of grain, yet she had Sabbath clothes.
Why does the verse say “<i>ve-yaradeti</i>,” which means, I will go down? It should have said “<i>ve-yaradet</i>,” which means, you should go down. However, it wants to show that Naomi said to Ruth, my merit should also go with you, just as if I went along with you. That is why “<i>ve-yaradeti</i>” is written, which means, I will go down.<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Ruth, <i>Remez</i> 604.</i>
“<i>When he lies down</i>” [3:4]. There will be a time when he will lie down and you should know the place where he will lie down and you should come and uncover his feet. You should lie down next to him and he will tell you what to do. She said to her: I will do everything you tell me. She went down to the barn and did everything that her mother-in-law had asked her. Some ask about this verse, why is the word “<i>elay</i>” not written, but it says, “<i>I will do everything you tell me</i>” [3:4]. The verse contains the vowels of “<i>elay</i>,” but not the word itself. However, the verse shows us that Ruth spoke to Naomi, why do you teach me to dress beautifully? Perhaps people will encounter me and think I am a prostitute. Therefore, she said, I will go to the barn and I will dress there in the barn.<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ruth, 3:4.</i> That is why the verse says, “<i>she went down to the barn and did as her mother-in-law commanded her</i>” [3:6]. That is to say, she first went down to the barn, and then she did what her mother-in-law told her to do. Therefore, the word “<i>elay</i>” is not mentioned. That is to say, I will do everything you told me. From these verses we learn that if a person can accomplish a good thing, but it requires a bit of impudence at the same time, that is, one has to be somewhat impudent, because one can accomplish it, therefore, he should not let the impudence stop him. Thus, Ruth went to Boaz at night in the barn, to his bed. This seems to be an act of impudence, but she thought to herself, I will do it since good may come of it. However, as far as she could cover up the matter, she did and she went to Boaz in a way that nobody learned of it.
“<i>And Boaz ate</i>” [3:7]. And Boaz ate and drank and he was in a good mood, in the Torah and with prayer and he went to lie down at the side of the grain pile. She came and slowly uncovered his feet and lay down. Our sages write, “<i>in a good mood</i>” means, that after eating he thought about a wife, who is called “good,” as Scripture says, “<i>He who find a wife, finds good</i>” [Proverbs, 18:22]. Our sages also say that Boaz was a communal leader and a Judge and was correct that he should lie in the barn near the grain pile. However, the sages say that he did it, when at the same time, that generation was very promiscuous and used the barns for their activities. For the righteous who did not want to sin before God, it is correct that each righteous person should look to God and should not covet strangers.<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ruth Rabbah,</i> 5.15.</i>
“<i>And it was in the middle of the night</i>” [3:8]. It was in the middle of the night and the man awoke and was startled. A woman was lying at his feet. He said to her: who are you my daughter? She responded: I am Ruth your maidservant and you should put the corner of your cloak over your maidservant, since you are a savior. Our sages write that Boaz saw a woman at his feet. He grabbed her by the head to see if she had hair. He said: this is no <i>demon</i>, because <i>demons</i> don’t have any hair. He said to her, who are you and she replied, a woman. Do you have a husband? She said, no. Are you ritually clean?<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">A reference to the ritual cleanness associated with the menstrual cycle.</i> She answered: I am clean.<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Ruth, <i>Remez</i> 605.</i> Our sages say that there are three whom the Evil Inclination wanted to entrap, but they vanquished the Evil Inclination. One was <i>Joseph</i>, the second was <i>Paltiel</i>, and the third was <i>Boaz</i>, who is mentioned here. I do not want to write about Joseph, since it is found in the Humash.<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">The story of Joseph and Potiphar’s wife. Genesis, 39:1–20.</i> The story of <i>Paltiel</i> is that <i>King Saul</i> had a daughter named <i>Michal</i> and he gave her to David as a wife. <i>Saul became angry with David</i> and took Michal away from him and gave her to someone named <i>Paltiel</i>, who was very righteous. He had to take her even though David had not given Michal a <i>divorce.</i> However, the righteous man lay every night with a sword between him and Michal and did not touch her, since he had sworn to God that he would conquer his Evil Inclination.<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Sanhedrin,</i> 19b.</i> The evil inclination came to Boaz the whole night and said to him, you have no wife and she has no husband. She desires a husband and came to the barn piously and you will commit no sin. Boaz immediately swore by God that he would not touch her. With this, he vanquished the Evil Inclination. Therefore, every person should learn that when the Evil Inclination wants to convince someone to commit a sin, he should immediately swear to God that he does not want to commit the sin and the Evil Inclination cannot do anything to him. However, the person who transgresses the oath, the God punishes him with great pain. Therefore, the Torah in the Ten Commandments does not write concerning any of them that one will be punished if they transgress any of the commandments, but concerning <i>worship of foreign gods</i> and <i>swearing falsely</i>, God did explicitly write the punishments. He compared these two sins, <i>worship of foreign gods</i> and <i>swearing falsely</i>, to each other. However, to perform a commandment, a person may swear and also to vanquish the Evil Inclination.
“<i>He said: Blessed are you to God</i>” [3:10]. Boaz said: blessed are you to God, my daughter. Your act of grace is greater than the first one, in not following the young men, whether rich or poor. Now my daughter, do not be afraid. Whatever you will say, I will do it for you. All the elders of this city know that you are a virtuous woman. Our sages say: a woman would rather have a bachelor who is young, even if he is poor, rather than an old one with a lot of money.<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Ruth, <i>Remez</i> 606.</i> Therefore, Boaz said to Ruth, your latter grace is that you followed an old man, which I am. The first acts of grace were when you converted and you also did lovingkindness with your mother-in-law and with the <i>dead, who had shrouds.</i> We learn from Scripture that one should have a good attribute if a poor person comes to the rich one and is ashamed before him that he has to borrow money from him. Even if the rich person has no money to lend him, the rich person should still have only good words with the poor person.
“<i>And now indeed</i>” [3:12]. While it is true that I am the redeemer, there is another redeemer closer than I. Stay the night and in the morning, if he wants to redeem you, it is good. If he does not want to redeem you, I will, as God lives. Lie down until morning. Our sages say: “someone” was called by his proper name, <i>Good</i> [Tov]. The same person was the brother of <i>Elimelech.</i> This is the meaning of the verse “<i>if Tov will redeem.</i>” That is to say, if the man whose name is <i>Tov</i> will redeem you, it is good. Boaz was the son of <i>Salmon</i> and <i>Salmon</i> was the brother of Elimelech. Thus, Boaz was the cousin of Machlon, Ruth’s husband. It was more correct for the man called <i>Tov</i> to be the redeemer, since he was the uncle of Machlon.<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ruth Rabbah,</i> 6.3.</i>
“<i>And he said, hold out the shawl</i>” [3:15]. He said to her, grab onto the shawl that you are wearing. She grabbed onto it and he measured six measures of barley and he placed it on her and she came to the city. Some ask, how could a woman carry six measures of barley? Some sages write that God, blessed be He, made a miracle for her that she should be able to carry it. Why specifically six? He showed her that six <i>righteous men</i> would be descended from her: <i>David, Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, Azariah and the Messiah.</i> They will receive six good blessings – <i>spirit, wisdom, understanding, counsel, spirit of wisdom and fear of God.</i> The question is asked, why does it say, “<i>and he came to the city</i>”? This means, and he came to the city, as if it was speaking about a man when it should have said, “<i>and she came</i>”? However, the verse wants to show us that Boaz went with her and accompanied her so that nobody would accost her on the way. Therefore, it is written, “<i>And he came.</i>” This refers to Boaz.<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ruth Rabbah,</i> 7.2.</i>
“<i>And she came to her mother-in-law</i>” [3:16]. She came to her mother-in-law and she [Naomi] said: who are you my daughter? She told her what the man did for her and she said, he gave me these six measures of barley and he said to me that I should not come empty-handed to my mother-in-law. Some ask about this verse. Why does her mother-in-law ask Ruth, who are you? Did she not know her own daughter-in-law, since it was already daylight? However, the sages say that she asked, are you still a widow or not? Did you spend the night with a man? Who are you?<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ruth Rabbah,</i> 7.4.</i>

Chapter 4

“<i>And Boaz went up</i>” [4:1]. Boaz went up to the gate where the court sat and he sat down there. The redeemer passed by and Boaz said to him: come over and sit down. So and so came over and sat down. Our sages ask, how is it that he met the <i>redeemer</i> so quickly? Was he sitting behind the door? However, they say, had he been at the end of the world, God, blessed be He, would have made him come there, so that the <i>righteous Boaz</i> should not be worried that he could not accomplish this thing. The sages also say that so and so [<i>ploni almoni</i>] means that he was “<i>almoni</i>”; this means that he was dumb regarding the Torah. The <i>redeemer</i> said: why did Machlon and Chilion die, because they married <i>Moabite women, heaven forbid.</i> How can I marry them and make my children unacceptable as Jews? However, he was dumb and he did not hear that according to the <i>halakhah in the house of study</i> it was taught that a male Moabite couldn’t be admitted, but one can marry a female Moabite.<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ruth Rabbah,</i> 7.7.</i>
“<i>He said to the redeemer, the piece of field</i>” [4:3]. Boaz spoke to the redeemer. The piece of field that belongs to our brother <i>Elimelech</i>, has <i>Naomi</i>, who has returned from the plains of Moab, sold it? I thought that I would uncover your ears to say, buy it before those sitting here and before the elders of our people. If you wish to redeem it, then redeem it. Boaz said to the elders: if he does not want to redeem, let him tell me and I know well that if there is nobody, then it is correct to redeem and I am next in line. He said: I will redeem. Some asked, why did the verse say, “<i>I know that there is nobody else to redeem</i>” [4:4]. This means, I know that there is nobody else to redeem. He meant, that if he does not redeem, let him tell me, “<i>and I will know</i>” and I will marry her and sleep with her. Not as he means, to bring her into the house to be a cook. I will gladly do this but you are the next in line. “<i>And I will know</i>” means to sleep with, as we find, “<i>and Adam knew</i>” [Genesis, 4:25]. This means to sleep with.
“<i>And Boaz said</i>” [4:5]. Boaz said on the day that he bought the field from Naomi and from Ruth the Moabite, the wife of the deceased. You buy this to establish the name of the deceased on his inheritance. The man who was called <i>Tov</i> said: I couldn’t redeem since I have a wife and many children. Perhaps I will destroy my own estate. You redeem in my place since I cannot redeem. I will destroy my family because she is a Moabite. Our sages say: the redeemer understood that he wanted to buy the field and wanted to keep Ruth in his house and would give her food and drink, but did not want to marry her. Boaz said, you must also marry her. The redeemer responded: I couldn’t do this because of my children and because of my family. That is why Scripture says “<i>acquire</i>” is written with a “<i>yud.</i>” That is to say, Boaz said, if you don’t want to do it because she is a <i>Moabite</i>, then I will acquire her and that is why acquire is written with the “<i>yud.</i>” This means, in my opinion I have acquired her.<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ruth Rabbah,</i> 7.9.</i>
“<i>This was formerly done in Israel</i>” [4:7]. It was the custom in previous times in Israel in cases of redemption and exchange to validate the transaction, one man would take off the glove of his right hand and give his hand to his friend and this is the sign in Israel to confirm the sale from one to the other. Our sages say that the verse means that in previous times the custom was that if someone sold something to someone else and wanted the sale to be permanent, one of them pulled off his glove and gave his hand to his friend and with this the sale was validated. In the present day, the witnesses take their coat and put it on it to <i>affirm the sale.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">Targum, Ruth, 4:7.</i>
“<i>The redeemer said</i>” [4:8]. The redeemer said to Boaz, buy it. Boaz took off his glove and bought Ruth for himself.
“<i>Boaz said</i>” [4:9]. Boaz said to the elders and the people, you are witnesses today that I have bought everything that belonged to <i>Elimelech</i> and everything belonging to <i>Machlon and Chilion</i>, from the hand of Naomi. I have also acquired <i>Ruth the Moabite</i>, the wife of <i>Machlon</i>, as a wife and to establish the inheritance of the deceased in order that the name of the deceased should not be cut off among his brothers. You are witnesses today at the door of the Sanhedrin of his city. The plain meaning is that because Boaz purchased the field from Ruth and when Ruth will be seen coming and going in and out from the field of <i>Machlon</i>, people will say about the field of Machlon, this is the field of Ma- chlon her husband, and it will be as if Machlon were still alive and he will be remembered often.
“<i>All the people answered</i>” [4:11]. All the people who were sitting in the gate responded. The elders witnessed it and said: God should make the woman who is coming into your house like <i>Rachel and Leah</i> who built the house of Israel with twelve tribes. Prosper in <i>Ephrat</i> and may his name be perpetuated in <i>Bethlehem.</i> The sages say, even though the people were descended from Judah, who was the son of Leah, so why does the verse mention Rachel first? She was younger than Leah. The verse should have said, <i>like Leah and Rachel</i>, with Leah first. Don’t think that the children themselves did not recognize that Rachel was primary for Jacob. Jacob’s intention was for Rachel when he served Laban. Therefore, Rachel is mentioned first in the verse. Our sages say about the verse, the generations were redeemed only through the pious women who were in that generation, as the verse says, “<i>He remembered His steadfast love and faithfulness to the house of Israel</i>” [Psalms, 98:3]. This means that He remembered His grace and His truth to the house of Israel. The verse means the women of Israel, because it does not say the children of Israel.<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Midrash Zuta,</i> Ruth 4.8.</i> Why do we find that the sage calls his wife house, because she is the primary one in the house and that is what the verse means by <i>house of Israel.</i>
We find the story of a pious man who became very poor and he had a pious and kosher wife. He was finally so poor that he rented himself out to someone to plow the field. Elijah the prophet disguised himself and said to him. You have seven good years. When do you want them, immediately or at the end of your days? The pious man said, go away you sorcerer. You have nothing yourself and what do you want to give me. He went to him three times. The third time he said, I’ll go and ask my wife. He went to his wife and told her the story. The wife said to the pious man. Go there and let the seven years begin immediately. He came back to the field and spoke to Elijah the prophet that the seven years should begin immediately. Elijah said, go home and when you come home you will become rich. The children searched in the ashes and found only gold and brought it to their mother. The mother ran toward the pious man and said: God has made us rejoice from all of our troubles. They praised God and did many <i>acts of lovingkindness and charity</i> the whole seven years. Every day they said to their son, write down the charitable acts we are doing. Finally, after the seven years Elijah came again and he said to the pious man. Listen my dear friend, the seven years have ended and you must return the money. Just as when you first gave me the money, I first asked my wife, I will also now ask my wife. If she will tell me to return it, then it is good. He went to his pious wife and told him the news. Listen my dear wife; the old man has come again to take back the money. The wife said, go my dear husband and ask the old man that if he can find better people to hold the money? The Holy One agreed with her correct words and <i>acts of lovingkindness and charity</i> and gave them more and they remained rich for the rest of their lives. When women are pious there is none like them, but when they are evil, there is also none like them.<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Ruth, <i>Remez</i> 607.</i>
The Sanhedrin asked <i>King Solomon</i>, why did you say that you did not find a woman who was completely good.<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">Ecclesiastes, 7:28.</i> We have found many pious and virtuous women. The king responded: I would show you. Go out and find me somewhere a pious man who has a wife who is <i>pious</i>, beautiful and virtuous. The members of the Sanhedrin said: there is someone who is pious and has a pious wife and is extremely beautiful. He said, call him here. They ran and called him and he came quickly and he was brought into a locked room with the king, who said to him. My servants have told me that you are a very smart person and very pious. I would very much like to give you my daughter and I will appoint you over all the nobles. He responded, what am I that you want to give me your daughter or what is my lineage that I should marry the king’s daughter. The king responded: this is your wisdom that you make yourself humble and therefore my daughter is correct for you. However, go this night and bring me your wife’s head. The whole way home he thought about how he would kill his wife. He considered that she is very smart and pious and I also have children from her. His wife said to him, why are you so sad and depressed? He said that my heart aches. She prepared food and good drink, but he could not eat or drink. She ate and went to sleep with the small children. He carefully considered and said to himself. How can I commit such a great sin, to kill such a smart and pious person and what are the presents that the king wants to give me? However, a little while later he thought about the great honor from the king. He stood up and went to get his sword. He came to the bed to chop off her head. He uncovered her and saw her sleeping with a small child at her breast and another one near her arm. He went behind them. The third time he thought about the great honor from all the great nobles. He came over to the bed with a broad sword and he saw her lying there and her hair hanging down to the ground. He had pity on her, stepped back and said, if the king would give me all of his money I would not do this and he lay down and went to sleep. The next morning the servants of the king called him to the king. The king asked him, where is the head? He said: I couldn’t do it. The king said, go away, you are not worthy of honor.
Not long afterwards, the king sent for his wife and said to her. I have been told about your beauty and wisdom and I have called you because I want you for a concubine. However, you are forbidden because you have a husband. Therefore, kill him immediately so that I will be able to take you as soon as possible. She said, this is very good and I will bring you his head tomorrow. The <i>king</i> knew well that she would do it and would kill him. He said to her: I would give you a sharp sword so that you will be able to chop off his head in one blow. The king commanded that a sword should be made for her out of tin and lead, so that it would shine and have weight. They made one immediately and gave it to her. She did not know about it and put the sword under her clothes and came home in the evening. Her husband came home and she ran up to him and kissed him on the neck. She prepared good food and they ate and drank. She said: my dear husband, we will rejoice with one another and drink. He allowed himself to be convinced until he fell asleep from too much drink. She stood over him and pulled out the sword and chopped at his throat and she thought that she had chopped off his head, thinking that the sword was certainly good. He looked up and saw her standing with a bare sword and groaning from her great exertion. He said to her: what do you want to do with the sword? It fell to the ground, she cried and told him how the king had told her to chop off his head. They were both led before the king and the Sanhedrin and they were laughing with each other. The king began to speak. Tell me truthfully how it went with you. They gave a complete report. The king said, I knew well that you would chop off your husband’s head. That is why I gave you a sword made of tin, so that you should not kill him. Then the Sanhedrin announced to everyone that indeed it is impossible to find a completely pious woman. They are always wrathful and anger their husbands, even if their husbands are very pious and are more important and consider themselves much higher than him.<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">“<i>Mashalim shel Shelomo Ha-Melekh</i>” in A.

We find a story about <i>Rabbi Jose the Galilean.</i> He had a very angry and wrathful wife who was his niece. The important students who sat before him said, dear rabbi give her a <i>divorce.</i> He responded: dear <i>students, the ketubah</i> is very large and I don’t have the money to give her. It happened one time that they were sitting with other important <i>rabbis and Rabbi Eliezer</i> was among them. They were in the <i>house of study</i> and they finished their studies. <i>Rabbi Jose the Galilean</i> said to them, come and eat with me. They went with him to his house. His wife looked very displeased, said something to herself and walked outside. <i>Rabbi Jose the Galilean</i> saw a pot and asked her what there was to eat. She said to him that there was cabbage to eat. <i>Rabbi Jose the Galilean</i> went and looked into the pot and saw capons. <i>Rabbi Eliezer</i> heard this and understood that they were angry at each other and remained silent. <i>Rabbi Jose</i> said to his wife. You told me that we will eat cabbage, but instead we are eating good capons. She said that a miracle occurred and out of the cabbage came capons. After the meal, Rabbi Eliezer said: my dear Rabbi why don’t you give your wife a <i>divorce?</i> I want a more respectful person for you. He said: I don’t have the ketubah to give her. The students spoke with each other and said, it is not <i>befitting your dignity</i> that she does not respect you. It is a shame for us and we will give you the money for the ketubah, but give her a <i>divorce.</i> He let himself be persuaded and he gave her a <i>divorce</i> and the <i>ketubah.</i> He married a pious kosher woman who was worthy of him. In the end, God sent her [the first wife] a husband she married who was a guard at the city gate. Not long afterwards, God caused the watchman to go blind and caused her to be in great poverty. She had to lead him from house to house to beg for bread. She led him from street to street and when they came to the street where <i>Rabbi Jose the Galilean</i> lived, she stood still and did not lead her blind husband into this street. The blind man recognized each street and he was quite expert and knew all the streets. He asked his wife: why don’t you lead me in the street of <i>Rabbi Jose the Galilean?</i> I have heard it said for a long time that he is very charitable. She said: I am ashamed to go since I was his wife and he divorced me. It happened one time that they came to the street of <i>Rabbi Jose the Galilean</i> and begged at the doors of the houses that they should be given bread. They screamed at each other and hit each other. <i>Rabbi Jose</i> heard the screaming and the blows. <i>Rabbi Jose the Galilean</i> asked: why are you hitting your wife? He said: Every day she makes me lose the bread from the street. She does not want to lead me in the street. <i>Rabbi Jose the Galilean</i> went and gave each of them their own house and fed them from his own money for the rest of their lives. He said: this is because Scripture says, “<i>do not ignore your own flesh</i>” [Isaiah, 58:7]. This means, do not refrain from doing good for your wife who is one flesh with her husband. My dear gentlemen: see how good, pious and noble a husband she had and did not want to treat him properly and what came of it. So should it happen to every woman who does not treat her husband properly. However, when the wives are pious, then Scripture compares them to the Torah, when a good wife makes her husband more pious.<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Leviticus Rabbah,</i> 34.14.</i>
We have a story about a pious man who had a pious wife and they did not have any children with one another. They said to each other, if we don’t have any children, then let us <i>divorce</i> each other. The <i>pious man</i> took an evil wife and she made him a sinner. She married an evil man and a sinner and made him very pious. We learn how much depends on the pious woman. Therefore, Scripture says, “<i>May God make the woman like Rachel and Leah who built the House of Israel</i>” [4:11]. The verse makes the family of Israel dependent on the women Rachel and Leah.
“<i>May your house be like the house of Peretz</i>” [4:12]. Like <i>Tamar who won Judah</i> and may God give you the same from this young woman. <i>Boaz took Ruth</i> and she became his wife. They had relations and God gave her that she became pregnant and she had a son. Our sages say that the verses in the <i>Book of Ruth</i> always begin with “<i>vavs</i>,” but eight verses do not begin with “<i>vavs.</i>” This teaches us that Ruth was a <i>gentile</i> who joined Israel, those who observe <i>circumcision</i> on the eighth day. The <i>vav</i> means <i>woe.</i> He meant to say, <i>woe</i> to the generation in which the judges are judged. The sages say that he slept with her the same night and she became pregnant and <i>Boaz</i> died the same night. The verse also shows us that a woman has a child in two hundred and sixty-one days, equal to the numerical value of the word “<i>herayon</i>” [pregnancy].<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Ruth, <i>Remez,</i> 608.</i>
“<i>And the women said</i>” [4:14]. And the women said to Naomi, praised be God that he did not withhold a redeemer from you today. May his name be called in Israel and may he renew your life and feed you in your old age. Your daughter-inlaw, who loves you very much, is better to you than seven sons. Our sages say: the women said to her, your son should be blessed and should rule like the light rules the day. This is the meaning of the verse “<i>who has not withheld a redeemer from you today</i>” [4:14]. This means, who has not withheld a redeemer from you today. One can ask: why does it have to say today? One day is like another day, but he wants to show us that just as the day strengthens, so too your name should be strengthened.
“<i>And Naomi took the child</i>” [4:16]. She put it in her lap and she raised it. The neighbors gave it a name and called it, a son is born to Naomi. She called his name “<i>Obed</i>,” who was the father of <i>Jesse</i>, who was the father of David.
“<i>These are the generations of Peretz</i>” [4:18]. Our sages say that this verse gives us his lineage from <i>Peretz</i> because the people associated him [David] with <i>Ruth the Moabite.</i> Therefore, the verse associates him with <i>Peretz</i> who was descended from Judah. The people argued with David and said to him, you are descended from <i>Ruth the Moabite. David</i> responded: are you not descended from someone who was married to two sisters? This was <i>Jacob the Patriarch.</i> Look who is your leader. Also, <i>Tamar</i> who married <i>Judah</i>, your ancestor, was he not from a <i>family</i> that was <i>unfit?</i> Our sages say that Boaz was very righteous and <i>abrogated the famine with his prayers</i>, and he had a son called <i>Obed.</i> This <i>Obed</i> had a son called <i>Jesse</i> who was very righteous and the <i>angel of death</i> could do nothing to him because of his great <i>righteousness.</i> He would not have died except for the sin caused by the snake and <i>Adam and Eve</i> who ate from the apple.<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Shabbat,</i> 55b.</i>
Our sages say that the word <i>Toldot</i> is not written with two “<i>vavs.</i>” However, when God created heaven and earth it is written, “<i>These are the generations of heaven and earth</i>” [Gen. 2:4], with two “<i>vavs.</i>” Concerning <i>Peretz</i>, it is also written, “<i>These are the generations of Peretz</i>” [4:18] with two “<i>vavs.</i>” On the sixth day, <i>Adam</i> sinned and six things were taken away from him. His life was shortened, his shining disappeared, his height was lowered, the earth was diminished and these six things will come again through <i>Peretz</i>, from whom will come the <i>Messiah</i>, through whom all of this will come again.

Lamentations





Chapter 1

“<i>How lonely sits the city</i>” [1:1]. How did the city of <i>Jerusalem</i> sit alone and without people, where her inhabitants had been numerous? She has become like a woman whose husband traveled very far across the sea. However, his intent is to return to his wife. Therefore, the verse says, “<i>like a widow</i>” [1:1]. That is to say, like a <i>widow</i>, but not a real <i>widow</i>, since the Holy One will redeem us from the exile.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Lamentations, 1:1.</i>
“<i>Great among the nations</i>” [1:1]. The city was a master among the nations and rulers in all the lands. Now she must pay <i>taxes</i> to the nations.
“<i>Weeps</i>” [1:2]. She must cry at night because the <i>Temple</i> was burned at night. Another reason is because Israel wept at night during the incident of the spies. This was the night of the ninth of <i>Ab.</i> Therefore, Israel must weep on that night every year on the ninth of <i>Ab</i> for <i>the destruction of the Temple.</i> Another explanation, when one cries at night the voice is heard for a great distance and those who hear it cry along with him. Another explanation is because he compared the city of <i>Jerusalem</i> to a <i>widow</i> and writes about her that she should cry at night. A widow who has no husband can forget her troubles during the day when she talks with her friends, when the women talk about what is news. However, at night she cries when she should be sleeping, since she must sleep alone and her friends are not with her, to speak about the news with her.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Sanhedrin,</i> 104a-b.</i>
“<i>Her tears</i>” [1:2]. As the result of much crying, her cheeks are wet and there is nobody to comfort her, since all of her associates have betrayed her.
“<i>Judah has gone into exile</i>” [1:3]. Israel was driven into exile because of pain and hard labor that strangers made them perform, and they had no rest among the strangers. They pursued them and found them in the limited places. That is to say, in the valley between two mountains, so that they could not easily escape. Another explanation is: “<i>in the narrow places</i>” is <i>from the seventeenth of Tammuz and the ninth of Ab.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Lamentations Rabbah,</i> 1.29.</i>
“<i>The roads of Zion</i>” [1:4]. The roads of Zion are overgrown with grass because people do not travel to the three <i>pilgrim festivals</i> of the year, that is to say, <i>Passover</i>, <i>Shavuot</i>, and <i>Sukkot.</i> All of the gates are desolate. The <i>priests</i> sigh because Dthey do not have any <i>worship or sacrifices.</i> The maidens mourn that they used to dance on the fifteenth<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The 1711 edition has “ninth” here, but that is a mistake. Both the 1622 edition and the original source have “fifteenth.”</i> of <i>Ab</i> and on <i>Yom Kippur.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Targum, Lamentations, 1:4.</i>
“<i>Her enemies have become the masters</i>” [1:5]. Her enemies have become the masters. That is to say, Israel cried woe over those who became masters and her enemy’s sit in peace. The Holy One has made Israel sad because of her many sins. Her children go into captivity before the enemy.
“<i>Gone from the fair Zion</i>” [1:6]. All the beauty has departed from the city of <i>Zion.</i> Her leaders are like stags that do not find pastures to feed and go without <i>strength</i> before their pursuers.
“<i>Recalled</i>” [1:7]. She thought about <i>Jerusalem</i> in <i>exile</i> about the days of her pain and her mourning. She also thought about the desires she had not long before. She has fallen into the hands of her enemies and Israel has no helper. They saw the enemy and rejoiced that Israel was being destroyed. Another interpretation, Israel rested on <i>Sabbaths</i>, <i>festivals</i>, and observed the <i>Sabbatical year</i> every seven years. The strangers mocked them saying, you were fools in the land of Israel in that you did not properly observe the Sabbath and also the Sabbatical year. Now in exile, you will properly observe them.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Lamentations Rabbah,</i> 1.34.</i>
“<i>Greatly sinned</i>” [1:8]. Jerusalem sinned and therefore was sent into exile. The strangers, who used to honor Israel, now saw Israel disgraced. They have seen the shame and Israel sighing and shrinking back.
“<i>Her uncleanness clings to her</i>” [1:9]. Her <i>menstrual blood</i> is on the hem of her garment. That is to say, her sins are openly known. When they committed their sins, they did not think what would be the end. Therefore, all the people were surprised at the astonishing thing that happened to Jerusalem and Israel, more than to the rest of the world and there is no comforter. The city of Jerusalem says, God, see my pain that you made the enemy boast.
“<i>His hand</i>” [1:10]. His hands have picked up. The unpleasant Moab and Ammon raised their hands to take the <i>Torah scrolls</i> and burn them. When other nations took silver and gold, Moab and Ammon took the <i>Torah scrolls</i> because the Torah said that a Moabite or Ammonite should not marry an Israelite forever. Therefore, they took their revenge on the Torah scrolls.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Lamentations Rabbah,</i> 1.38.</i>
“<i>All the inhabitants</i>” [1:11]. All the people of the city of Jerusalem sigh, they want bread. They give all of their treasures for food. Therefore, see God, I have become a glutton.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Glutton is a misinterpretation of the word “<i>zolailah.</i>” In this context it has the secondary meaning of worthless or despised.</i>
“<i>May it not befall you</i>” [1:12]. The city of Jerusalem says to all who pass by and travel through. A trouble like that which has befallen me should not happen to you. See what happened to me when God made me mournful on the day of his wrath.
“<i>From above He sent a fire</i>” [1:13]. He sent a fire from heaven into my bones and has broken them. He spread a net under my feet. He has left me devastated and my whole day is woe.
“<i>The yoke is bound fast</i>” [1:14]. His hands bind the yoke of my sins and they have gone to my neck. They have weakened my strength. God has delivered me into the hands of those I cannot withstand.
“<i>Rejected</i>” [1:15]. The Lord has trampled on the strong among us. God called upon me an assembly of my enemies to break my youths. God has allowed the <i>virginal blood</i> of his maidens to be spilled just like wine runs from the wine press.
“<i>For</i>” [1:16]. For this my eyes cry, pouring water. My comforter has distanced himself from me. My children have become devastated that He has strengthened the enemy.
“<i>Has spread</i>” [1:17]. The city of <i>Zion</i> spreads and wrings her hands and there is no comforter. The <i>Holy One</i> commanded that Jacob’s insulters should be near him. That is, wherever Jacob was dispersed, the Holy One also sent <i>Ammon and Moab</i> there, so that they should irritate and insult Israel. <i>Jerusalem</i> has become ashamed, like an <i>unclean woman among the nations.</i>
“<i>Righteous is the Lord</i>” [1:18]. When arrows were shot at <i>Josiah, the king of Israel</i>, he said: the Holy One is correct and God is righteous, since we have not kept His commandments. When he died, <i>Jeremiah</i> wrote a <i>book</i> about him and said: listen all the nations and see my pain as my <i>maidens</i> and my <i>youths</i> go into captivity.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Lamentations Rabbah,</i> 1.53.</i>
“<i>I have called out</i>” [1:19]. Jerusalem says, I have called out to my lovers. That is to say, to those who portrayed themselves as lovers. These were the children of <i>Ishmael</i>, who went toward us as if they loved us. They brought jugs with spoiled drinks. Israel thought that it was good wine and drank because of great thirst. As soon as they put down the jugs the spoilage went into their intestines and they became swollen and died from it. The <i>priests</i> and the <i>elders</i> perished in the city because they desired bread to eat.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Lamentations Rabbah,</i> 2.4</i>
“<i>See</i>” [1:20]. See God, how I am in pain and my innards are shrunken. My heart has overturned within me because I have rebelled. Outside, the sword of the enemy kills and inside is death.
“<i>When they heard</i>” [1:21]. The nations heard me sighing and nobody consoled me. All my enemies heard my anger and they rejoiced. You, God, have made all this, that they should hate me, since You, God, commanded us not to eat with <i>gentiles</i> and not to <i>marry gentiles.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Lamentations Rabbah,</i> 1.56.</i> Therefore, do not have pity on us and on our children. We would that You, God, bring on the <i>gentiles</i> one day, everything that has happened to us.
“<i>Let all their wrongdoings come</i>” [1:22]. May You, Holy One, remember all of their sins. You should do to them all that you have done to me, for my sins, for my sighs are many and my heart hurts.

Chapter 2

“<i>How he has shamed</i>” [2:1]. How He has darkened the city of <i>Zion</i> with His wrath. The Holy One made the city elevated and important. Later He threw her down, the beauty of Israel, as if He had thrown her down from heaven to the earth. The Holy One did not think that the Temple was a footstool for His feet.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Targum, Lamentations, 2:1.</i>
“<i>Laid waste</i>” [2:2]. God has laid waste and did not have pity on the houses of <i>Jacob.</i> He has dispersed, with His anger, the strongholds of <i>Judah.</i> He has brought them down to the earth. He has diminished the kings of Israel and their nobles. The Midrash writes about this verse that He exchanged the angels. That is to say, the angel who ruled over fire, the Holy One now placed him over water. The Holy One did this with every angel that was connected to Israel. Previously, they could adjure the angels who had been placed over them with [holy] <i>names.</i> Now however, if a Jew adjured the angel who ruled over fire, the same angel would answer, I am not the ruler of fire and then the Jew could do nothing to help himself.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Lamentations Rabbah,</i> 2.5.</i>
“<i>He cut down</i>” [2:3]. He cut down the rulers of Israel with wrath. He put his right hand behind his back, not to help Israel and he lit a fire over <i>Jacob</i> and burned everything around him.
“<i>He pulled</i>” [2:4]. He pulled his bow very strongly. The enemy placed his right hand, like an enemy, and he destroyed everything desirable to the eye in the city of Zion. He poured out his wrath like a fire.
“<i>He was</i>” [2:5]. God was like a wind. He devastated Israel and all of her citadels and stronghold cities. There was much lamenting in the cities of Judah.
“<i>And He cut down</i>” [2:6]. He cut down His hut like a garden and He destroyed the holy place in the Temple where the Shekhinah had always rested. God caused <i>Sabbath</i> and <i>Festivals</i> to be forgotten in Zion. He was angered and He allowed King Zedekiah, and Shariah, the high priest to be killed.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, 2:6.</i> <i>Rashi</i> writes that the Holy One did an act of kindness with Israel that he poured out His wrath on the stone and wood of the Temple and caused Israel to have a shorter exile.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, 2:6.</i>
“<i>Rejected</i>” [2:7]. The Holy One has left his altar. He has destroyed His Holiness. He had given the walls of his palace into the hands of the enemy. Enemies shouted and mocked in the Temple as loudly as they used to sing in the Temple on Sabbaths and Festivals.
“<i>He thought</i>” [2:8]. The Holy One had thought for many years about destroying the walls of the city of Zion, until the measure of her sins reached the length of the cord. He did not turn his hand from destroying. He made the small and great walls mournful and they were destroyed together.
“<i>Sunk</i>” [2:9]. The gates of the Temple have sunk into the ground. No enemy could touch them. The doors were worthy of this because they raised themselves when <i>King David</i> brought the <i>Tablets</i> into the Temple. Some sages say that because King David made the doors himself, the enemies could not vanquish the doors and they sank into the ground.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Lamentations Rabbah,</i> 2.13. See also, B. <i>Shabbat,</i> 30a.</i> He caused them to lose and broke her bolts, her king and her nobles under the nations and they did not have someone who could <i>decide the laws</i> of the Torah and they did not have a prophet among them.
“<i>They sat</i>” [2:10]. The elders sat on the ground and remained silent. They put ashes on their heads. They put sacks on the maidens of Jerusalem, and they lowered their heads to the ground. The Midrash writes about this verse that <i>King Zedekiah</i> swore that he wanted to serve <i>Nebuchadnezzar. Nebuchadnezzar</i> came and sent for the <i>Sanhedrin</i> that they should fully explain the Torah to him. When they reached the portion about abrogating vows and oaths, the king said, you have certainly permitted <i>King Zedekiah to abrogate the oath</i>, since the section on vows says that if one regrets his oath then the sage can abrogate it. Nebuchadnezzar immediately made them lower their heads to the ground and he tied their hair to the tails of the horses and in this manner dragged the <i>Sanhedrin.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Lamentations Rabbah,</i> 2.14.</i>
“<i>Spent</i>” [2:11]. My eyes are spent with the tears of my eyes. My innards have shrunk and my liver has been spilled on the ground, that I have seen the disaster of my people. The children and nursing children are faint and lying in the streets of the city.
“<i>Their mothers</i>” [2:12]. They say to their mothers in their faintness, where is wheat or wine? They are like one who has been beaten in the streets of the city. Their life is pouring out in the laps of their mothers.
“<i>What</i>” [2:13]. They say in their lamentation: to whom has occurred a pain like that which happened to us? Your destruction of the city of Jerusalem is as great as the sea. Who can comfort or heal you? The Midrash writes, “<i>your destruction is as vast as the sea</i>” [2:13]. That is to say, the Holy One promised the sea, when the sea was lowered from the heaven to the earth when the world was created. The waters said: why should we not remain above in heaven, like the other waters? The Holy One then promised the waters that no sacrifice would be brought without salt from the sea.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Cited by Rashi, Leviticus 2:13. Bahya and Ramban also cite it on the basis of Rashi, though there is no indication of the original source.</i> However, now that the Temple has been destroyed and the sacrifices have been abrogated and salt was no longer used, therefore the destruction of the sea is compared to the destruction of the Temple.
“<i>Your prophets</i>” [2:14]. Your <i>prophets</i> spoke false words and did not think about their sins, those for which they should repent. The prophets said false things to you to push you away from God.
“<i>Clapped</i>” [2:15]. The people who passed by the city clapped their hands before the city and hissed with their mouths and they shook their heads that they saw the city of <i>Jerusalem destroyed.</i> They said: is this the city of <i>Jerusalem</i> that was the beautiful crown and the joy of the whole land?
“<i>Jeered</i>” [2:16]. All of your enemies opened their mouths at you, Jerusalem, and they jeered. They gnashed their teeth and said: we hoped for this, we found it and we are seeing it. Rashi asks a question. <i>Lamentations</i> is based on the “<i>alphabet</i>,” so why did he write <i>Peh</i> before <i>Ayin?</i> The reason is that they said with their mouths what they did not see with their eyes. “<i>Peh</i>” means mouth and “<i>Ayin</i>” means eye. Therefore, the “<i>Peh</i>” is written before the “<i>Ayin.</i>”<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Lamentations, 2:16.</i>
“<i>He did</i>” [2:17]. Go did everything that He had intended and what he long ordered. He had no pity and the enemies rejoiced and He made the enemies important.
“Cried out” [2:18]. Their hearts cried out. The walls of the city of Jerusalem shed tears in a river. They did not cease day and night. The apple of your eye did not rest.
“<i>Arise</i>” [2:19]. Arise you Israelites who are in exile and study <i>Mishnah</i> at night, when the Holy One is with you and study before dawn when the morning star rises.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Tamid,</i> 32b.</i> Pour out your heart to God and pray to God for the lives of the young who lie faint from hunger in all the streets.
“<i>See</i>” [2:20]. See, God what you have done to me. Should women, particularly rich and important women, eat their children? The Midrash says about someone called Doeg the son of Joseph that his mother weighed and measured him every day and the amount that he grew she donated that amount of money to the Temple. When the famine came to Jerusalem, his mother cooked and ate him.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Lamentations Rabbah,</i> 2.23.</i> Thus, the Israelites lamented to the Holy One: See God, what has happened. The Holy One answered: why is this new? Your sins are great. You killed the <i>prophet Zechariah</i>, who wanted to punish you on <i>Yom Kippur.</i> He was a <i>prophet</i> and a <i>priest</i> and you killed him in the Temple.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Lamentations Rabbah, Petihtah</i> 23.</i>
“<i>They lie</i>” [2:21]. They lay on the ground in the streets, young and old, <i>maidens</i> and <i>young men</i>; they were all killed with the sword. You allowed them to be killed and slaughtered and had no pity.
“<i>You called</i>” [2:22]. You, God, called the enemies to gather, just like we used to gather on the festivals. There was no escapee or survivor. The enemy has destroyed all the children who used to wear velvet and silk.

Chapter 3

“<i>I the man</i>” [3:1]. I, the man Jeremiah, have seen more pain than all the other prophets, which the Holy One did with the rod of his great wrath.
“<i>Me</i>” [3:2]. He led me in the darkness and not in the light.
“<i>But</i>” [3:3]. But He turned his hand against me the whole day.

“<i>Bend</i>” [3:35]. God does not desire that an injustice should be done. He also does not desire that a war should be distorted so that people might say that it was a happenstance and God did not know about it. Concerning this, Scripture says, “<i>who said this</i>” [3:37]. That is to say, it only happened because the Holy One commanded it.
“<i>From the mouth</i>” [3:38]. No evil comes from God and no good, but what should the person lament? He should lament his sins and cry out and should repent. They should say, let us seek out our sins and repent to God.

Chapter 4

“<i>How dulled</i>” [4:1]. How has the gold become dulled? That is to say, the children whose faces shined like god and like fine gold. God, the children who were like <i>precious stones</i> with their shining faces are now forgotten and lie in the streets.
“<i>The children</i>” [4:2]. The precious children of <i>Zion</i>, whoever has seen them, has praised them, much more beautiful than precious gold. They say how they have become like broken potsherds.
“<i>Also</i>” [4:3]. Jeremiah says, even a snake whose breast is covered by its skin and is pitiless, yet when their children come, they take out their breast to nurse the children. However, the people of Israel are pitiless, like the ostriches in the wilderness. They do not give food to their children who are hungry. They say: we must feed ourselves first. Our lives come first and with that, the children must die.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Lamentations, 4:3.</i>
“<i>Cleaved</i>” [4:4]. The tongues of the nursing children cleaved to the palate from thirst. The children desire bread, but nobody responds to them.
“<i>Those who ate</i>” [4:5]. The children who used to eat delicacies wander in the streets. They used to wear silk and purple clothes, now they lie on the garbage.
“<i>Exceeded</i>” [4:6]. One can understand the great afflictions, since the sins are greater than the sin of Sodom. The Holy One overturned Sodom in a second. Thus, their anguish was not great. However, here the anguish was long lasting. The hand of the enemy did not desecrate, but angels did everything.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Lamentations, 4:6.</i>
“<i>They were purer</i>” [4:7]. The nobles were purer than snow and milk. Their limbs were redder than <i>ruby</i> and their figures like <i>sapphire.</i>
“<i>Dark</i>” [4:8]. Now their figures are blackened and one does not recognize them in the streets, their skin is shrunken on their bones, dry as wood.
“<i>Better</i>” [4:9]. Better were those killed by the sword than those who were killed by hunger. Their bellies split as they lie on the field where the enemy roasted meat on the grass. The same smell of meat went to the children of Israel who lay on the field from hunger. From this, their bellies split and their excrement poured out. This was disgusting for all the people.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Lamentations, 4:9.</i>
“<i>The hands</i>” [4:10]. The hands of women who were compassionate, now have cooked their children and eaten them.
“<i>Completed</i>” [4:11]. The Holy One has completed his anger that He contemplated for a long time. Now He has poured out His wrath and ignited the fire on Zion. This has burned the ground completely.
“<i>Did not</i>” [4:12]. The whole world did not want to believe that the enemy would enter the city of Jerusalem.
“<i>Because of the sins</i>” [4:13]. Because of the sins of the seers and the transgressions of the priests who shed the blood of the righteous.
“<i>Wander</i>” [4:14]. The blind ones wander the streets. They have smeared themselves in blood, so that one cannot touch their clothes.
“<i>Turn away</i>” [4:15]. People call to them: you are unclean. Turn away, do not touch us. You are filthy and smeared.
“<i>The face</i>” [4:16]. The anger of the Holy One caused them to be dispersed and separated so that they could live among the nations, because they did not want to listen to the priests and the elders who punished them for their sins.
“<i>Even now</i>” [4:17]. Our eyes still hope for our helpers. It is foolish and the hope that we had for a nation that does not help.
“<i>Our steps</i>” [4:18]. They did not let us walk in our streets. Our end is near and our days are full, our end has come.
“<i>Easy</i>” [4:19]. It was easy for our enemy to pursue us, more than eagles on the mountains did they hunt us and in the wilderness they located us.
“<i>The breath of our nostrils</i>” [4:20]. The spirit of our Messiah; this is <i>king Josiah</i> who was subdued in their pits. We said that because of his merit, we were protected from the hands of the enemy.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Lamentations, 4:20.</i>
“<i>Rejoice</i>” [4:21]. Rejoice you Edom for a short time. You will also drink a bitter drink and will slobber over yourself from great troubles.
“<i>Ended</i>” [4:22]. You Zion have taken in enough troubles for your sins. You will no longer be expelled. He has considered your sins. Edom, your sins have been uncovered.

“<i>Orphans</i>” [5:3]. We are without a father; our mothers are like widows.
“<i>Our water</i>” [5:4]. We are afraid of the nations to draw water. We must buy water for silver and the same for kindling wood.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Lamentations, 5:4.</i>
“<i>On</i>” [5:5]. They still chase us on our necks. We gathered money that we had to give as taxes to the enemies.
“<i>Egypt</i>” [5:6]. We extended our hand to Egypt that they should help us and Assyria should give us bread.
“<i>Our fathers</i>” [5:7]. Our parents committed sins and are no more. We must suffer for their sins.
“<i>Slaves</i>” [5:8]. Slaves ruled over us and there is no redeemer from their hands.
“With our souls” [5:9]. We risked our necks because of bread from the sword of the wilderness.
“<i>Our skin</i>” [5:10]. Our skin is heated like an oven and is swollen because of hunger.
“<i>Women</i>” [5:11]. They tormented the women in the city of Zion and the maidens in the cities of Judah.

“<i>Take us back</i>” [5:21]. Make us return to you and we will repent and renew our days as of old.
“For” [5:22]. For you have shamed us for the sake of our sins and why should you be angry with us forever.
“<i>Take us back.</i>” We recite this verse two times, waiting to be redeemed with good words.

The Destruction of the Temple

The Destruction of the Temple<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">This section was published anonymously in a pamphlet, in Cracow, before 1595. It was added here to the end of the commentary on the Book of Lamentations. On this pamphlet and its history see, Sara Zfatman, “The Destruction of the Temple, Cracow, before 1595 – An Additional Yiddish Text from the Sixteenth Century” [Hebrew]. <i>Kiryat Sefer</i> 54 (1979): 201–202. It is my belief that Rabbi Jacob ben Isaac was the author of this pamphlet, based on the reference to it in the title page of the second volume of the Basel/Hanau, 1622, edition of the <i>Ze</i>’<i>enah u-Re</i>’<i>enah</i>. See the Appendix.</i>
Rabbi Johanan said: what is the meaning of the verse “<i>Why does it say, happy is the man who is always anxious</i>” [Proverbs, 28:14]. Happy is the person who is always anxious so that when he wants to do something, he will always first think, what can happen from this, that nothing evil come from it. Since when a person does not do this, much evil, heaven forbid can result from it. As a result of our ancestors not thinking about this, the <i>Temple</i> was destroyed. Because of a man whose name was <i>Kamza</i> and someone named <i>Bar Kamza,</i> and because of these two, Jerusalem was destroyed. Because of a rooster and a hen, the important city called <i>Tur Malka</i> was destroyed. Because of someone’s wagon shaft, the city of <i>Betar</i> was <i>destroyed.</i>
There was once a man in <i>Jerusalem</i> who had a good friend named <i>Kamza</i> and an enemy who was called <i>Bar Kamza.</i> This man once made a banquet and sent his servant to invite his dear friend <i>Kamza.</i> The servant did not hear properly and invited his enemy <i>Bar Kamza.</i> The man came into the room and found his enemy sitting at the banquet. He said to him: you are my enemy, what are you doing at my banquet? Get up and leave. <i>Bar Kamza</i> said: I ask you, since I have already come, don’t embarrass me. I will pay you for everything I eat and drink. He responded: I do not want to have you here. He said: let me stay here and will give half the cost of the banquet. He responded: I do not want you here. He spoke again: I will give you the cost of the whole banquet. He responded that he did not want it and grabbed him by the arm and forcibly dragged him out. <i>Bar Kamza</i> said: because there were so many important rabbis who sat there and allowed me to be shamed and nobody protested, then I will go to the emperor and will inform on all of them.
He went to the emperor and said: <i>my lord emperor</i>, the Jews have rebelled against you. The emperor said: who says this? Perhaps it is not true. He said: send a sacrifice to Jerusalem and see if they will offer it on your behalf. The emperor took an expensive good calf and sent it with him. He went there and caused a <i>blemish</i> in the calf. An animal that has a blemish cannot be brought as a sacrifice. That is why he caused a blemish in the expectation that they would not offer it as a sacrifice. This would show the emperor that it was true that they did not want to do what he commanded. He made the blemish on the lips of the calf. This is called a corner blemish and such an animal cannot be brought as a sacrifice. However, the gentiles do not consider this to be a blemish and the calf could certainly be allowed to be brought as a sacrifice. He did this so that they would not be able to defend themselves before the emperor. If they would say that they could not offer it as a sacrifice because of the blemish, for the gentiles this is not considered a blemish.
When <i>Bar Kamza</i> came with the calf, the rabbis wanted to offer the calf so that the emperor would not be angered. One rabbi, by the name of <i>Rabbi Zechariah</i>, said: the people will say that an animal with a blemish has been sacrificed on the altar. They wanted to kill <i>Bar Kamza</i> so that he would not return and tell the emperor. <i>Rabbi Zechariah</i> spoke again. The people will say that because he caused a blemish in the calf that was supposed to have been sacrificed, he should be killed? He returned to the emperor with the calf and showed him that they had rebelled against him. <i>Rabbi Johanan</i> said: the piety and humility of <i>Rabbi Zechariah</i> who did not allow the calf to be sacrificed and did not want to allow <i>Bar Kamza</i> to be killed, caused that we were expelled from our city and driven from our land.
The emperor sent someone named <i>Niron Caesar</i> to Jerusalem. When he came close to Jerusalem, he wanted to test his luck. He shot an arrow to the <i>east</i> and the arrow turned toward Jerusalem. Then he shot an arrow to the <i>west</i> and the arrow fell in the direction of Jerusalem. Whichever direction he shot the arrow, it fell in the direction of Jerusalem. He saw that he would certainly make war against the city. Afterwards, he met a small child and said to him: tell me a verse. He wanted to test his luck. What verse would the child tell him? The child told him the verse: “<i>I will wreak my vengeance on Edom through my people Israel</i>” [Ezekiel, 25:14]. This means, so says our Lord God, I will take revenge on Edom because of my people Israel. That is to say, when Edom will <i>destroy the Temple</i> and will exile my people. Afterwards, I will avenge them. <i>Niron Caesar</i> said: the Holy One wants that his house should be destroyed and afterwards will take revenge on those who will destroy it. <i>Niron Caesar</i> ran away and converted. The important <i>Rabbi Meir</i> was descended from him.
The emperor then sent someone else who was called <i>Vespasian.</i> He came and besieged the city for three years, but could do nothing. There were three rich men in Jerusalem. One was called <i>Nakdimon ben Gurion</i>, the second was <i>Ben Kalba Savua</i>, and the third one was <i>Ben Zizit ha-Keset.</i> These were not their proper names. The first was called <i>Nakdimon</i>, because a miracle occurred to him. The sun shined longer than normal for his sake. One time <i>all Israel ascended to Jerusalem for the festival.</i> Every <i>Passover</i>, <i>Shavuot</i>, and <i>Sukkot</i> all Israel were obligated to ascend to Jerusalem. One time the Israelites ascended and did not have enough water to drink. <i>Buni ben Gurion</i> went to a <i>Hegemon</i> who lived there and had twelve wells with water. He said to the <i>Hegemon.</i> Lend me the wells with water and I will repay you with twelve wells with water. If I don’t repay you the wells with water, I will give you a hundredweight of silver for every well. He arranged a time that he should return either the wells or the money. The time was up and no rain had come that would enable him to refill the wells. On the morning of the last day, the <i>Hegemon</i> informed him that he must provide the silver or the water. He responded that the day is long enough and that it could still rain and the wells would be filled. The <i>Hegemon</i> laughed and mocked and said: It hasn’t rained all year and just today it will rain. He was very happy and thought that he would certainly collect the money and joyfully went to the bath. The <i>righteous Buni went to the Temple</i> and donned his <i>talit</i> and began to pray. He said: <i>Lord of the Universe</i>, it is known to You that I did not do this for my own honor, but for Your honor so that the Israelites who ascend to <i>Jerusalem for the festival</i> should have to drink. Immediately, a great rain came so that all the wells were filled and there was even a surplus. When the <i>Hegemon</i> came from the bath and <i>Buni Nakdimon ben Gurion</i> came out of the <i>Temple</i>, they encountered each other. The <i>righteous man</i> said to the <i>Hegemon:</i> give me the money back since I have given you the water that I owed you. The ruler said: I know for certain that God allowed the rain to come especially for your sake. Nonetheless, I have one more condition that you must return the money to me because the sun had long set when the rain came into my property. Thus, your time had expired. The righteous man again went to the Temple to pray. He began, Lord of the whole world. Show the world that we are the beloved in the world and just as You did a miracle for me with the rain, do a miracle for me with the sun. Immediately, a wind came and dispersed the clouds and the sun began to shine again. The <i>Hegemon</i> said: I cannot win because the sun is shining again. Because of this he was called <i>Nakdimon</i>, because it means, “to shine” since the sun shined for his sake. However, his proper name was <i>Buni.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The story of the miracle of the rain is found in B. <i>Ta</i>’<i>anit</i>, 19b-20a.</i>
The second one was called <i>Ben Kalba Savua</i>, because when someone came in to him and was hungry as a <i>dog</i>, he left completely sated. <i>Kalba</i> means dog and <i>Savua</i> means sated. The third one was called <i>Ben Zizit ha-Keset</i> because his zizit dragged along on the ground.
One of the three said that he would feed the whole city with enough wheat and barley. The second one said: I will provide wine and oil. The third said; I will provide wood. The sages praised the one who provided the wood, since for one measure of wheat one must have many measures of wood. <i>Rabbi Hisda</i> entrusted all of his keys to his servant, but not the key to the wood. The three wealthy men had to feed the city for twenty-one years. There were many rogues and scoundrels in the city.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The reference to rogues and scoundrels is to the Zealots who wished to fight the Romans rather than accommodate them.</i> The sages said to the scoundrels: let us leave the city and we will make peace. They did not want this and immediately said the opposite. The scoundrels said to the sages: we will go out and wage war against them. When the scoundrels saw that the sages did not want to wage war, they set fire to the treasuries where the wheat and barley were located and burned them. They expected that they would not have food to eat and would have to fight. A great famine began in the city.
<i>Abba Sikra</i> was the chief of the scoundrels that were in Jerusalem. He was the nephew of <i>Rabbi Johanan ben Zakkai. Rabbi Johanan</i> sent for him that he should come alone and nobody should know about it. Rabbi Johanan spoke to him. How long will you not allow peace to be made with the emperor? You are killing the whole world with hunger, since there is nothing to eat. Abba Sikra said: what should I do? If I would say anything to them, they would kill me. He said: give me some advice about how can I leave the city and come to the emperor? Perhaps I can arrange something. He said: do the following. Make yourself sick and let your <i>disciples</i> stand around you as if you are <i>dying.</i> Take a hunk of meat from a dead animal that stinks and put it near you. Thus, they will think that you died and they will let you be carried out for burial. Allow nobody else to carry you other than your disciples. Other people might notice that you are not dead, since a dead person is much heavier than a live one. He did this. Two disciples carried him until they came to the gate. The scoundrels ran over and wanted to stab him to see if he was alive. <i>Abba Sikra</i> said: the gentiles will say that they stabbed their own rabbi. This silenced them. They opened the gate and they carried him out.
When he was outside, he went to the emperor. He said: “<i>peace unto you, king, peace unto you, king.</i>”<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The phrase is in Aramaic.</i> This means, peace unto you, king, peace unto you, king. The <i>emperor</i> said to <i>Rabbi Johanan:</i> you are guilty of death twice. First, you call me king. I am no king, so you are mocking me. Second, if I am a king, why haven’t you come out to me previously? <i>Rabbi Johanan</i> said: When you said that you are not a king, you are certainly a king, since I know that <i>Jerusalem and the Temple</i> will be taken away by your hand. We learn from Scripture that the Temple will only be taken away by a king. Were you not a king, Jerusalem would not be taken away by your hand. When you say,why did I not come out to you earlier, the scoundrels in the city did not let me leave.
The emperor said: If there is a barrel of honey and a snake is wrapped around the barrel, and one cannot get to the honey because of the snake, does not one have to break the barrel because of the snake? You should have done the same. You should have breached the wall and thrown out the scoundrels, so you would have been able to come out. <i>Rabbi Johanan</i> was silent and did not know what to answer. <i>Rabbi Akiva</i> said: The verse “<i>who turns back sages and makes nonsense of their knowledge</i>” [Isaiah, 44:25] was fulfilled by <i>Rabbi Johanan.</i> This means, our Lord God turns the wise back, and He makes their smart ideas foolish. When He wants to send something to a person, then he cannot protect himself from it with all of his wisdom. This also happened to <i>Rabbi Johanan.</i> He could not answer the emperor what he should have answered him. When a snake lies on the honey, one takes a pair of tongs and one pulls the snake from the barrel and leaves the barrel whole. Therefore, I also waited to see if I could overcome the scoundrels and one would not have to break the city and afterwards I would make peace with you.
When he was speaking with the emperor, a <i>messenger came from Rome</i> and said to him, the <i>emperor in Rome</i> has died and you have been elected in his place. At the time he was putting on his shoes and when he wanted to put on his second one he could not put it on. When he wanted to take the first one off, he could not take it off. He said: what must this be? Rabbi Johanan said: <i>my lord emperor</i>, do not be upset, since this is nothing. It is that you have heard the good news that you have become emperor and you have become fat, as Scripture says, “<i>good news puts fat on the bones</i>” [Proverbs 15:30]. The emperor said: What should I do that my other shoe will fit? He said: Let somebody go before you that you hate, then your foot will become thinner since we learn from Scripture that when someone sees before him an enemy, his limbs become thin. He did so and was able to put the shoe on. The emperor said: if you are so smart, why did you not come to me long ago? He responded: I’ve already told you, because of the scoundrels. The emperor said: I’ve also already told you: you should have broken the walls. Now I have to leave, but I will send someone else in my place. However, I will do this for you. Whatever you desire, I will do for you. He said: give me the city of <i>Yavne</i> and the sages who live there, that you should not destroy it and allow the <i>family of Rabban Gamliel</i>, who is <i>descended from King David</i>, to live. Give me also <i>physicians</i> who will heal <i>Rabbi Zadok.</i> Rabbi Zadok’s intestines had shrunken from great fasting. He fasted that the <i>Temple</i> should not be destroyed. However, <i>Rabbi Akiva</i> said that our Lord God had also taken away his reason, since he should have rather prayed that Jerusalem should not be attacked. However, perhaps he thought that if I ask for such a great thing, He would not even do a small thing for me. He would get angry. I would rather ask for a small thing, since He would surely give it to me.
<i>Martha the daughter of Boethus</i>, who was the richest man in Jerusalem, said to her servant: go to the market and bring me fine flour. When he got to the market, it had been sold. He came back and said to her: there is no fine flour. However, there is white flour. She said: go and get it. In the time that he went, the white flour was also sold out. He came back and said: There is no white flour, but there is rye flour. She said: Go and get it. While he went back and forth, it was also sold out. She did not send him again but said: I will go myself and see what I can find to eat. She went and a bit of manure touched her foot and she died from it because she was so delicate. Some people said that she did not die from this. She ate a fig from <i>Rabbi Zadok</i> and she died from that fig. <i>Rabbi Zadok</i> knew that the Temple would be destroyed and he fasted every day for forty years so that the Temple should not be destroyed. Every night when he would eat something, he was brought a fig. He would suck it out and throw it away. She found it and ate it from great hunger. She died from it since she was such a delicate person that she died because it was disgusting to her. When she died she left all of her gold and silver and allowed it to be taken and thrown in the street and said, what use is this to me?
The <i>emperor went to Rome</i> and sent the <i>evil Titus to Jerusalem.</i> He came and captured the city and said: Where is the God of Israel to whom they look to for protection and hope? Why does he not come and help them? What did he do? He took a prostitute and went with her into the Temple, into the inner sanctum, the <i>Holy of Holies</i>, where nobody entered the whole year, except for the <i>High Priest</i> on <i>Yom Kippur.</i> He took a <i>scroll of the Torah</i> and spread it out on the ground and lay down with the prostitute and had sexual relations with her. Then he took a sword and stabbed the <i>curtain</i> [of the Temple]. Our Lord God caused blood to flow from it, so that the evil one should think that he killed him. Then he made the curtain into a container and put all of the vessels from the Temple into it and put it on a ship. He traveled to another city where he displayed and bragged about how strong he was and what he had destroyed. When he was traveling on the sea, a wind came up and caused the ship to be damaged and almost sink. He said: look, the God of the Jews has his strength only on the water. When he waged war with Pharaoh, he drowned him in the water. He drowned Sisera in the water. Now he has come and is only strong on the water. Let him come on the dry land and wage war with me. A voice went out from Heaven and said: you, <i>evildoer the son of an evildoer</i>, are a small, evil creature <i>descended from the evil Esau.</i> Among all the things I have created there is a gnat. Come up on the dry land and wage war with me. When he was on the dry land the gnat flew into his nose and up into his brain. For seven years it bored into his brain. One day he passed by a blacksmith. The gnat heard the hammering of the smith and it became frightened, stopped boring and remained still. He said to himself: this helps, and every day he hired a smith and let him hammer so that the gnat should remain silent. He gave a gentile smith, seven pennies a day. To a Jew he gave nothing. He said: you have enough that you see a revenge on your enemy. For thirty days the gnat heard the sound of the hammer and remained still. Afterwards, it became used to the sound of the hammer and did not remain still until he died an <i>unnatural death.</i> Our sages said that when he died, his head was chopped open. They wanted to see what was in there. The gnat was as big as a year old pigeon and weighed two pounds. Its mouth was made of copper and its feet, iron. When he was dying, he said to the people that he should be burned to ash and it should be spread in seven places, so that the God of the Jews should not be able to judge him in the next world.
Someone named <i>Onkelos</i> was the nephew of the evil Titus and he wanted to convert to Judaism. Through <i>magical means</i> he was able to speak with <i>Titus</i> and asked him who are the most important in the next world? Titus said, Israel. Then he said: should I convert and should I join them? He responded: they have too many commandments. You will not be able to observe them all. Do the following. Torment them greatly and you will become a <i>great person</i>, since Scripture says, “<i>her enemies are now masters</i>” [Lamentations, 1:5]. He said: how are you judged in the next world? He responded: just as I ruled concerning myself. I ordered that I should be burned and I should be spread in seven places, so is done to me. Every day my ashes are gathered and I am judged. Afterwards, I am burned and my ashes are spread in seven places.
<i>Rabbi Eliezer</i> said: how great a sin it was when someone embarrassed and denigrated someone else. Such a great embarrassment was caused to <i>Bar Kamza</i> that God helped him and the Temple was devastated and He burned his city. Therefore, a person should not embarrass and shame another person.
<i>Tur Malka</i> was destroyed because of a rooster and a hen. It was the custom that when a <i>bride and groom were led under the wedding canopy</i>, a rooster and hen were carried before them. This meant that the <i>bride and groom</i> should be as fruitful as the hen and rooster were with each other. Once it happened that people from <i>Rome</i> rode by and took the chickens. Then Jews overcame them and beat them. They went to the emperor and said to him that the <i>Jews had rebelled</i> against him. He then came against them. There was a man among the Jews whose name was <i>Bar Droma.</i> He could jump in one leap a whole mile and destroyed everything that was in that mile. In this way, he destroyed many of the emperor’s people. The emperor took the crown from his head and put it on the ground and said: Lord of the whole world. Do you desire that I should be killed? Answer my kingdom and me and do not put them in the hands of one man. Bar Droma began to boast and stumbled with his mouth and said: Truly God. You have abandoned us and do not help us in our war. He went to the toilet and a snake came and slithered into his intestines and he died. When the <i>emperor</i> heard that he had died, he said. Since God, may He be blessed, has performed such a <i>miracle</i> for me, I will not do anything to the city this time and traveled home. When they saw that the emperor departed, they began to be merry, with dancing, eating and drinking and lit many lights. There was so much light that one could see the <i>seal on a ring</i> from a whole mile away. The <i>emperor</i> said: they are mocking me and are so happy. He turned back. Our sages said: three hundred thousand swords attacked the city at one time and destroyed one side of the city in three days and three nights. In the other sides they did not know about the other side and they danced and jumped. Scripture says: “<i>The Lord has laid waste without pity all the habitations of Jacob</i>” [Lamentations, 2:2]. This means, God has devastated all the dwellings of Jacob. This means the six hundred thousand cities that <i>King Yannai</i> had. In each city there were as many Jews as had left Egypt. They were all destroyed.
Three sages were together. They said: who can say something about the city called <i>Kfar Sachnia?</i> The first one began. A story happened about a young man who betrothed a maiden. They were both captured by gentiles. The gentiles married them to each other. She said to him. I ask you, do not touch me since I do not have a ketubah from you. Therefore, I am forbidden to you. He subdued his evil inclination and did not touch her until he died.
The second one began. A story happened that one could get forty measures of wheat for one gulden. One day it happened that only thirty-nine were given and they did not know what happened that it had become one measure more expensive. They searched in the city if someone had secretly committed a sin. They found that a father and son had <i>sexual relations</i> with someone who had been <i>betrothed</i> and to add to it, they did it on <i>Yom Kippur.</i> The <i>court</i> stoned them and it was again forty measures for one gulden.
The third one began. A story about a man who hated his wife and wanted to divorce her, but she had a large ketubah and he did not want to give her the ketubah. What did he do? He went and made a party and invited many people. He got them all drunk and put them on the bed where his wife was lying. He took the white of an egg and threw it between them. He then ran and brought witnesses and showed them that they had <i>sexual relations</i> with his wife. He went to the <i>court</i> and showed this in the expectation that she would have to accept a <i>divorce</i> without the ketubah. There was an elder among them and he said. I have received a tradition from my teacher that if this is the white of an egg, it becomes hard in a fire and then falls off. They help up the sheet to the fire and the egg white fell off, like he had said. He was given lashes because he wanted to cause such shame for his wife and in addition had to give her the ketubah. One of them asked. If they were such important people, why were they destroyed? They responded, because they did not properly mourn the <i>destruction of Jerusalem.</i> As Scripture says, those who mourn Jerusalem will be happy. However, they did not mourn properly, since they would not have been happy in the joy that it will be rebuilt.
<i>Betar</i> was destroyed because of a wagon axle. It was the custom that when a son was born, a pine tree was planted, and when a daughter was born, a tree was also planted. When they married, both trees were taken and the wedding canopy was made from it. Once, the emperor’s daughter was traveling and the axle of the wagon broke. They chopped down a tree and made an axle out of it. Many Jews ran out after them and beat them. They informed the <i>emperor</i> about it and he marched against them, with eighty chieftains and each one had many soldiers under him. They slaughtered men, women, and children, until the blood ran into the great sea, which was a mile from the city.
Afterwards, the sages said, three large rivers were the same, two parts water and one part blood, all of it from the Jews of <i>Betar.</i> They did not have to put manure on their gardens for seven years, as long as the blood of the Jews lay there. <i>Rabbi Hiyya</i> said: an old man from Jerusalem told me that in one valley <i>Nebruzaden</i> slaughtered two hundred and ten thousand people and in Jerusalem he killed ninety-four times ten thousand on one stone until the blood ran to the blood of the <i>prophet Zechariah</i>, that Israel killed, in the holy <i>courtyard. Nebruzaden</i> found the blood of the prophet. He saw the blood moving on the ground and it was not still. He asked: what sort of blood is this that it does not remain still? They said: The blood of the sacrifices was spilled and it does not want to rest. He ordered that blood from the sacrifices should be brought and it was not the same. He said: if you will tell me correctly, it will be good. If you will not tell the truth, I will tear your flesh off with iron combs. Why should we lie to you? We had among us a prophet who punished us, when we did something evil.
We did not want to suffer him and we killed him. That is why the blood does not want to rest all year. He said: I will make the blood consent to rest. He took all the nobles of Israel, the great <i>Sanhedrin</i>, the small <i>Sanhedrin</i> and killed them all on the spot. The blood did not want to rest. Then he killed the youths and the maidens, but the blood still did not want to rest. Then he took the schoolchildren and he spoke to the <i>blood of Zechariah.</i> I <i>put to death</i> the nobles and your blood did not rest. If you like, I will kill them all. When he said this, the blood rested. <i>Nebruzaden</i> thought to himself. Israel only put to death one and how God punished them. Many thousands died at his hand. How much more so will I have to suffer? He went and wrote to his home what should be done with his estates and he went away, converted and became a <i>righteous convert.</i>
A story occurred with four hundred youths and four hundred maidens who were captured and they wanted to make them impure. They noticed how they were to be abused. They spoke among themselves and said: If we will drown ourselves in the sea, we will have <i>a share in the world to come.</i> The oldest one relied on the verse “<i>The Lord said, I will retrieve them from the depths of the sea</i>” [Psalms 68:23]. This means, I will return them from the deep sea, so says the Lord God, Blessed be He. When the maidens heard this, they all jumped into the sea. When the youth saw this, they said. Look, the maidens who were created for this, yet they did this for the sake of God. How much more so are we required to do this and they also jumped into the sea. Concerning this, it was said, “<i>it is for Your sake that we are slain all day long</i>” [Psalms 44:23]. Israel spoke to our Lord God, for Your sake we are killed every day.
A story occurred with a woman who had seven sons. They were captured and the oldest one was brought before the emperor. The <i>emperor</i> said to him: bow down to the foreign god. The child said: It is written in the Torah, God said, I am the Lord Your God.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus, 20:2.</i> I will not bow down to the wood. They dragged him out and killed him. Then they brought the second one. The <i>emperor</i> said: worship the foreign god. He said: it is written in the Torah that you shall not have any other god before you.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus, 20:3.</i> Therefore, I do not want to worship your god. Then they also dragged him out and killed him. Then they brought the third one. The <i>emperor</i> said to him: bow down to the image. He said: it says in the Torah you should not bow down to another god<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy, 11:16.</i> and he was immediately killed. They brought the fourth one and ordered him to bow down to the image. He said: it says in the Torah that one who slaughters to another god will be burned and destroyed.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus, 22:19.</i> He was also killed. Then they brought the fifth one and said to him: bow down to the image. He said: it says in the Torah, <i>Hear O Israel</i>, God our God alone is God.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy, 6:4.</i> He was also killed. Then they brought the sixth one and said to him: bow down to the image. He said: It says in the Torah, God your God is among you and is a strong God and mighty.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy, 7:21.</i> Therefore, I will not have your god and he was also killed. Then they brought the smallest one, the seventh. The emperor said: my child, bow down to the image. He said: <i>heaven forbid.</i> He said: why? He said: it is written that God is in heaven above and on the earth below and there is no other.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy, 4:39.</i> We have also sworn that we will not exchange Him for another god. In return, He swore that He would not exchange us for another people. The emperor said to him: look, your brothers lived long and enjoyed much good, so it is no novelty that they allowed themselves to be killed. However, you have not had any good things and are still quite young. Don’t allow yourself to be killed. Do my will and I will do much good for you. The child began, it is written: God will rule forever and always and will cause the gentiles to lose everything from His land. You and your kingdom will be destroyed. Today you are alive; tomorrow you will be dead. However, the Holy One remains living forever and always. Therefore, you emperor, what is your good? The emperor said: look, your brothers are lying dead before you. Consider, do this. I will take a ring and throw it on the ground and you can bend down for the ring and not to the image, in the expectation that the people should think that you have bowed down because of my command. The child said: curses and laments over you, emperor. Woe to you. You want this for the sake of people and are ashamed before the people. Should I not fear the <i>King of kings, the Holy One</i>, <i>who lives eternally</i> and is the creator of the whole world? The <i>emperor</i> said: is there a God in the world? The child said: you fool, if our God did not exist how did the world come into existence? Your god stands nicely. It has a mouth and cannot speak. It has eyes and cannot see. It has ears and cannot hear. It has feet and cannot walk. However, our God, <i>may His name be blessed</i>, it is the opposite.
The emperor said to him: since your God is strong, why does He not protect you from my hands? <i>Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah</i> were protected from <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i> when he had them thrown in to the furnace. <i>Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah</i> were pious and were innocent of the death penalty and <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i> was a proper king, so God caused a <i>miracle</i> to happen. However, you are not worthy and we are also guilty of the death penalty because of our sins. Had you not killed us, our God has many messengers who would have killed us. However, our God will avenge our blood. He immediately ordered him killed. His mother said: emperor, give me my child. Let me kiss him. They gave him to her. She said: let me die first. He said: I cannot. It says in the Torah, you shall not kill a mother and its child in the same day.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus, 22:28.</i> She said: you fool; you have committed no other sin? He ordered her also to be killed. Then the mother said: dear children, go to <i>Abraham our Father</i> and say to him. He built one <i>altar</i> and wanted to slaughter his son <i>Isaac.</i> I have built seven altars and sacrificed seven sons. He was tested and I did the deed. Our sages said that the youngest child was only two years and six <i>months</i> old. When the child was killed, the mother went up on the roof and fell down and was killed. A <i>voice from Heaven</i> came, the mother and her children will be happy.
<i>Rabbi Johanan said:</i> forty measures of phylacteries were found on the heads of those killed in Betar. Nine measures with brains from those killed in <i>Betar</i> were found on a stone. <i>Samuel said:</i> there were four hundred schools in <i>Betar</i> and in each school there were four hundred <i>teachers.</i> Each teacher had four hundred <i>students</i> to teach. If one of the enemies came, they slaughtered him with a pointer. When the enemies got stronger, they wrapped themselves in their books and burned themselves with their books.
A story happened that <i>Rabbi Joshua ben Hananiah</i> came to the land of Rome. The people came to him and said that a fine child was in prison. <i>R. Joshua</i> went to the door of the prison and quoted the verse “<i>who was it gave Jacob over to destruction and Israel to plunderers</i>” [Isaiah, 42:24]. This means, who has given the children of Jacob over to devastation and the children of Israel to scorn. The child answered from the prison, “<i>surely, the Lord against whom they sinned, in whose ways they would not walk</i>” [Isaiah, 42:24]. This means, the child said: God has done this to us because <i>Israel</i> did not want to walk in His ways, and did not want to hear His Torah. Rabbi Joshua said: I am assured that this child will teach Torah to Israel. I swear that I will not leave here until I will redeem him with all the money that they will want for him. He did not leave and redeemed him for much money. He became an important person and he taught Torah in Israel. His name was Rabbi <i>Ishmael ben Elisha.</i>
A story occurred that the son and daughter of <i>Rabbi Ishmael the High Priest</i> were captured. Once two nobles met in a certain place. One of them said; I have a servant whose like cannot be found in the whole world. The other one said: I have a maidservant whose like is not found in the whole world. They said: let us bring them together and we will divide the children. They brought them together and put them in a room at night and they did not know that they were related. He sat in a corner and said: O, I am a priest descended from only <i>high priests</i> and I should marry a maidservant? She sat in another corner and cried and said: I am the daughter of a high priest and am supposed to marry a gentile servant. They cried this way the whole night. When the day came, they saw each other and recognized each other and they began to cry and scream until their souls left them. Concerning them the prophet Jeremiah lamented, over these my eyes pour water.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Lamentations, 1:16.</i>
A story occurred about someone who became enamored of the wife of his teacher who had taught him a trade, and he did not know how he would acquire her. One time, his teacher needed money. He asked him that he should lend it to him. He said to him: send your wife to me and I will send it back to you with her. He sent his wife. He kept her for three days. The teacher came and asked him, where is my wife that I sent to you? He said: I sent her home, but I was told that she tarried with men along the way. He said: what should I do with her? He said to him: If you follow my advice, <i>divorce</i> her. He said: she has a very large <i>ketubah</i> and I don’t have it to give her. He said: I will lend it to you. He took the money and <i>divorced</i> her and gave her the <i>ketubah.</i> As soon as the teacher <i>divorced</i> her, he married her. Later, the time came to repay the money that he had lent him. He said to him: give me my money. He said: I do not have any. He said to him: Since you have no money, serve me and work until the money is repaid. He had to serve him in this way. He and his wife ate and drank and he had to stand at the table and feed him. His tears fell into the goblet and it was then sealed that Jerusalem would be destroyed. God, give us that we should be worthy to rebuild Jerusalem, <i>speedily in our days, amen.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">The material from the beginning of this section until here is taken from tractate B. <i>Gittin,</i> 55b-58a, with the exception of the story about Nakdimon ben Gurion and the rain, which is from B. <i>Ta</i>’<i>anit</i>, 19b-20a.</i>
Scripture says, “<i>When I think of this, I pour out my soul</i>” [Psalms 42:5].<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">From here until the end is a combination of <i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Lamentations, Remez 995 and 996, and selections from <i>Lamentations Rabbah</i>, <i>Petihtah</i> 24.</i> What does this verse mean? It means that Israel is speaking before the Holy One. Lord of the Universe, I remember the good and peace that I had. Now, You have distanced Yourself from me. Therefore, I cry and say who will restore me as I was. Previously, the Temple stood among us and Your Shekhinah was among us. All the nations praised me and when I prayed about my sins, You always answered me. Now, I am only in embarrassment and shame. Furthermore, <i>Lord of the Universe</i>, a great trouble and devastation has come upon me. When I go before Your house, where Israel, the seed of <i>Abraham our Patriarch</i>, offered You sacrifices and the <i>priests and levites</i> praised You with song, organs and harps. Now it is destroyed and foxes and wild animals run around in it. What should I do? My sins caused this and the false prophets among us were the ones who led me from the good path. Scripture says, “<i>God called on this day for weeping and lamenting</i>” [Isaiah 22:12]. This means, God called on this day for weeping and lamenting. On the same day that the Holy One desired to <i>destroy</i> his House, he said: since I dwell in it, the enemy can do nothing. I will avert my eyes and I will swear that I will not watch over it until it will be <i>destroyed.</i> Therefore, he swore with His right hand. The same time, the enemies went into the <i>Temple</i> and burned it. The Holy One said: I have no seat on the earth. I will remove my <i>Shekhinah</i> and will return to my first home in heaven. In the same hour, the Holy One said: what have I done? I had allowed my <i>Shekhinah</i> to rest below because of Israel. Now they have sinned and I had to return to my original place. <i>Heaven forbid</i>, I should not become a mockery in the eyes of the nations. In the same hour, the <i>angel Metatron</i>, <i>the senior angel</i>, came and fell before the Holy One and said: <i>Lord of the Universe</i>, let me weep and you will not weep. The Holy One responded: you don’t want me to weep? I will go to a place where you won’t have to go there and I will weep there. Afterwards, the Holy One said to the angels. Come, we will go to my house and will see what the enemies did there. They went and the <i>prophet Jeremiah</i> accompanied them. The Holy One saw the Temple. He said: <i>it is certain</i> that this is my house and my resting place and the enemies did what they wanted in there. Where are my priests and where are my friends? However, what should I do to you? I warned you enough and you did not want to repent.
Then the Holy One spoke to Jeremiah. I am like someone who had a son and made a wedding for him and he died at the wedding. There is no greater pain than this. I am in the same situation with my son Israel. The Holy One spoke to Jeremiah. Go and call, <i>Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Moses</i>, for me. Let them arise from their graves and let them cry, since they know well how to cry over their children. <i>Jeremiah</i> said: <i>Lord of the Universe</i>, I do not know where Moses is buried. The Holy One said: go stand at the Jordan and shout, <i>Ben Amram</i>, arise and herd your sheep, since the enemies have swallowed them. Jeremiah immediately went to the cave where the Patriarchs lay dead and said. You Patriarchs, arise, the Holy One desires that you should come. They asked him. Why at this time and not another time? He said: I do not know why. He did not want to tell them. He feared they would ask him: you were their prophet. Why did you not punish them properly so they would not sin?
He left them and stood on the shore of the Jordan and shouted. <i>Moses ben Amram</i>, it is the time that the Holy One desires you to come before Him. <i>Moses our Teacher, peace unto him</i>, said: why today more than another time? What must be the problem? He said: I do not know. He did not want to tell him. Moses then left him and went to the angels that he knew from the time of the <i>giving of the Torah.</i> He said to them. You servants of the Lord, do you know why the Holy One desires me today? They responded: Moses, don’t you know that the Temple was destroyed and Israel was exiled? He began to shout and cry until they came to the Patriarchs. They also began to shout until they came to the Temple.
When they saw the Holy One, He also began to shout and cry, just like someone who has a <i>deceased relative</i> before him. The Holy One shouted and lamented, woe to the king who was fortunate in his youth and unfortunate in his old age. At that time, <i>Abraham our Patriarch</i>, <i>of blessed memory</i>, came before the Holy One, cried and tore his hair out and poured ashes on his head. He shouted and lamented and said to the Holy One. <i>Lord of the Universe</i>, why was I different from all the nations that I have become shamed and embarrassed. When the angels saw this, they began to lament in rows, and spoke to the Holy One. You have destroyed the stairs that you made for Israel to ascend to Jerusalem during the festivals. You have dishonored the assurances that You assured <i>Abraham our Patriarch</i>, who made You to be recognized as the Creator in the whole world. How You have desecrated Your holy city, Jerusalem. The Holy One said to the angels. Why do you lament in rows? They said: <i>Lord of the Universe</i>, for the sake of your friend Abraham, who came to Your house and lamented and cried. The Holy One said: from the day he died, my dear friend has not been in my house and now what does my friend want to have in my house?
Abraham said before the Holy One. Why have you exiled my children and put them in the hands of the evil nations who killed them with all the <i>unnatural deaths?</i> You have destroyed the same place where I brought my son as a sacrifice. The Holy One said: your children sinned and transgressed the <i>whole Torah</i> and the whole <i>alphabet.</i> Abraham said: <i>Lord of the Universe,</i> who will testify about Israel that they transgressed? The Holy One said: let the Torah come and testify. The Torah came and wanted to testify. Abraham said to her: my daughter, you want to testify about Israel that they have transgressed your commandments? Are you not ashamed before my children? Remember the day that you were given. The Holy One offered you to all the nations and nobody wanted to accept you, until my children came to Mount Sinai and accepted you and honored you. Now, you want to testify against them, in their troubles? The Torah immediately stood aside and did not want to testify.
The Holy One said to Abraham: let the twenty-two <i>letters</i> of the <i>alphabet</i> come and testify. The <i>letters</i> came immediately and wanted to <i>testify.</i> First, the <i>aleph</i> came and wanted to testify. Abraham said to her: you, <i>aleph</i>, <i>you are the first of all letters</i> and you want to testify against Israel, in their troubles? Remember the day that God gave the Torah on Mount Sinai and began with the <i>aleph</i>, <i>anokhi.</i> Nobody wanted to accept you other than Israel and you want to testify? The <i>aleph</i> stood aside and did not want to testify. Then the <i>bet</i> came and wanted to testify. Abraham said to her: my daughter, you want to testify against Israel? Remember the Torah that begins with <i>Bereshit.</i> Nobody wanted to accept it except for Israel and you want to testify? The bet immediately stood aside and did not want to testify. Then the <i>gimmel</i> came and wanted to tes- tify. Abraham said to her. You want to testify against Israel? Where is there a nation that observes the commandment of <i>zizit</i>, which begins with a <i>gimmel</i>, as the verse says, “<i>tassels [gedilim] shall you make</i>” [Deuteronomy, 22:12]. This means, you should make <i>zizit.</i> The <i>gimmel</i> stood aside. When the other letters saw that Abraham silenced them, they were ashamed and did not want to testify.
Abraham began to speak before the Holy One. <i>Lord of the Universe,</i> You gave me a son at the age of one hundred years and when he became a young man of thirty-seven years. You said that I should slaughter him as a sacrifice. I did not have pity on my son and bound him myself. Will You not remember this and not have pity on my children?
Then Isaac began: <i>Lord of the Universe</i>, my father wanted to sacrifice me for Your sake and I went willingly and allowed myself to be bound on the altar. I stretched out my neck for slaughter and You don’t want to remember this for me and don’t want to have pity on Your children?
Then <i>Jacob</i> began: <i>Lord of the Universe</i>, for twenty years I served Laban for the sake of my children. When I left him, I encountered my brother, the evil Esau, who wanted to kill me and my children. I risked my life for my children and now they have fallen into the hands of the enemies, just like sheep to the slaughter. Afterwards, when I had raised them, I suffered much pain while raising them. Will You not remember this for me and not have pity on my children?
Then <i>Moses our teacher, of blessed memory</i>, began: <i>Lord of the Universe</i>, was I not a faithful shepherd over Israel for forty years? Did I not run before them like a horse in the wilderness and when the time came that they should come into the Holy Land, You commanded me that I should not enter there, but should die in the wilderness? Now that You have exiled them, You sent for me to lament and cry. At the same time, Moses said to Jeremiah. Come along, I will go and take them out of the exile and will see who will touch them with their hand. Jeremiah said: we couldn’t go because of those who were killed. Moses said: follow me. We will go and Moses and Jeremiah went to the rivers of <i>Babylon.</i> When they saw Moses, they said to each other: Moses rose from his grave and he wants to redeem us from those who caused us grief. A <i>voice from Heaven</i> came and said: it is a decree before Me that it cannot be otherwise.
Moses spoke to them: my dear children, I cannot take you out of this since it has been decreed before the Holy One, our Lord. God should redeem you soon. All of the shepherds began to cry and shout, as Scripture says, “<i>By the waters of Babylon, there we sat and wept, as we thought of Zion</i>” [Psalms, 137:1]. By the waters of Babylon, there we sat and wept, as we thought of Zion. Then Moses went to the Patriarchs and spoke to them. What have the enemies done to the children? They said: Some of them beat them and some of them bound their hands behind their backs. Some were put in irons, some lie dead, naked in the streets, and the birds and animals eat their flesh. They all began to shout together, woe to us, what has happened to our children. You are like orphans without a father. How you sleep out in the cold, summer and winter in these clothes. You had to climb mountains and rocks barefoot, without shoes. How your hands are tied behind your backs. Then Moses began, cursed be the sun. Why did you not darken when the enemies entered the Temple? The sun responded: Moses, you faithful shepherd, how could I darken? I was lashed with sixty lashes with a fiery whip and I was told: go out and illumine with your light. Then Moses said: O woe over the purity of the Temple, how it has become so darkened. O woe, how has come the time that you have been destroyed and the sanctuary has been burned and the fathers go into exile and captivity? Then Moses said: you captors, I order you by your lives, you should not kill them all and you should be merciful and should not destroy them completely. They should not kill a son before the father and mother and the time will come again when our Lord will again take account of them. They did not do this, but they quickly brought a child and said to the father. Come and slaughter, you must slaughter him yourself. <i>Moses</i> said: <i>Lord of the Universe</i>, it is written in your Torah that one should not slaughter someone and his father in the same day.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus, 22:28.</i> The evildoers have slaughtered many fathers and mothers and their children in the same day and you are silent about this.
Then <i>Rachel</i> our Matriarch came before the Holy One and said: <i>Lord of the Universe</i>, you know that <i>Jacob</i> your servant loved me very much and served my father seven years for me. When the time for the <i>wedding</i> came, my father came to the <i>conclusion</i> that he did not want to give me to him, but wanted to give him my older sister Leah and I listened to this advice. This hurt me very much and said so to my husband Jacob and made a sign with him so that he will know whom he will be given, so that my father will not be able to exchange us. Later I reconsidered and endured everything and I took pity on my sister that she should not be embarrassed and at night my sister lay down next to him in my stead. I taught my sister the sign word that I made with Jacob, so that he should not notice that it is she. I lay under the bed and spoke for her, so that he should not recognize my sister by her voice. I did this and was not jealous of her. <i>Lord of the Universe</i>, I am a person, flesh and blood, earth and ashes, and I did not envy my sister. You are a merciful king. Why were you jealous of the foreign gods that Israel served? Why did Your holy name concern itself with the image that has no reality? Because of this, you exiled Your children and the enemies did what they wanted with them. God immediately had mercy and said to <i>Rachel.</i> For your sake, I will return <i>Israel</i> to their holy land.
<i>Amen, selah.</i>

Ecclesiastes



Chapter 1

“<i>The Words of Kohelet</i>” [1:1]. The words of rebuke spoken by <i>King Solomon</i> whose name was <i>Kohelet</i>, because he gathered many forms of wisdom. Another explanation, he was called <i>Kohelet</i> because he spoke his wisdom before many people who gathered to hear his wisdom.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Ecclesiastes, <i>Remez</i>, 565.</i>
“<i>King in Jerusalem</i>” [1:1]. Solomon was king in Jerusalem, which was a city of wisdom.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 1:1.</i>
“<i>Utter futility</i>” [1:2]. Solomon said that all the creatures of the world and everything that is in the world is only foolishness.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 1:2.</i>
“<i>What value</i>” [1:3]. Solomon said: what is the profit from work and commerce in the world if one does not study Torah and fulfill commandments.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 1:3.</i>
“<i>A generation goes</i>” [1:4]. Why should the person not study Torah and want to do many thefts to gather strangers’ money. He will certainly not be able to spend it. When he has accumulated much, another generation comes after him and takes it away. However, the righteous who study Torah and fulfill commandments, they keep theirs eternally. That is, they take their good deeds with them in the next world.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 1:4.</i>
“<i>The sun rises</i>” [1:5]. Everything that the person does, gathering strangers’ money through theft, he does not hide it. A stranger comes after his death and takes it. Just like the sun that rises in the morning and sets in the evening, so is the evildoer with his unjust money.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 1:1.</i>
“<i>All streams</i>” [1:7]. Solomon said: why should the person not study Torah, but want to pursue worldly commerce and want to pursue <i>worthless things?</i> The person becomes exhausted and the mouth cannot say everything and the eyes do not become sated with seeing everything. The ears cannot hear everything. Therefore, the person should not pursue <i>worthless things.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 1:1.</i>
“<i>That which was</i>” [1:9]. When the person engages in nothing but commerce, he finds nothing new. All the things that are in the world, already existed <i>from the six days of creation.</i> Sometimes, a person tells himself that this is new. However, in truth, it already existed many years previously, but people don’t remember it. Therefore, they think it is something new. However, the one who studies Torah finds new things all the time and new reasons for the Torah that cheers him and makes him happy.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 1:9.</i>
“<i>I Kohelet</i>” [1:12]. <i>Solomon</i> says: I, <i>Kohelet</i>, was king over the whole world and afterwards over Israel alone, and afterwards over Jerusalem alone. Then <i>Ashmodai</i> threw me four hundred miles from my throne. I had nothing but a staff.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 1:12.</i>
The <i>Targum</i> writes about this verse that when Solomon sat on his throne, he was overcome with great arrogance. His wealth was great. He transgressed the commandments that God had forbidden. The first was that he should not collect many horses and should also not collect much silver and should not have many wives.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy, 17:16–17.</i> However, Solomon relied on his wisdom and took gentile wives who incited him to very much evil, until the Holy One sent <i>Ashmodai</i>, the king of the demons, who threw Solomon very far and took his ring from his hand. God punished him for his great arrogance that he was exiled. He cried and shouted in all the cities and in all the synagogues that he was Solomon, but nobody listened to him.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Targum, Ecclesiastes, 1:12.</i>
“<i>I gave my heart</i>” [1:13]. Solomon said: I have given my heart to the study of Torah and to search for wisdom and I have found and understood that the Holy One gave humanity one thing with which to conduct themselves. That is to say, the Holy One placed worldly commerce before the people. He can come to eternal life and can also come to much punishment from God when he does not engage in commerce properly and leaves the Torah.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 1:13.</i>
The Targum writes that Solomon said: In <i>Gibeon</i>, God let ask for what I desired from Him. I desired from Him that He should give me great wisdom to know all the things that I have seen, all the deeds of God with which He torments people when they do not behave properly.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Targum, Ecclesiastes, 1:13.</i>
“<i>A twisted thing cannot be made straight</i>” [1:15]. The person who committed transgressions and does not repent and dies cannot repair it in the next world. The person who did not study Torah and did not fulfill the commandments is not counted among the righteous in the next world, in the Garden of Eden.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Targum, Ecclesiastes, 1:15.</i>
“<i>I said</i>” [1:16]. Solomon said: Now that I have come into my greatness, I thought to myself in my heart. Who could say that I would attain such a thing? I became very humble when I was very important and had much wisdom. All these things were for me in Jerusalem. I gave my heart to knowing wisdom and commerce. Now I know that it is nauseating and a pain for people to have excessive wisdom.
“<i>From much wisdom</i>” [1:18]. The person who has much wisdom relies on his wisdom. The Holy One became very angry when I Solomon collected many horses. I thought my wisdom would help me that I would not go to Egypt. However, my wisdom did not help. I did come to Egypt with the many horses and transgressed the commandment of God, <i>blessed be His name.</i> Also regarding the taking of many wives, I relied on my wisdom and they caused me to sin. All of this was caused by my great wisdom.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 1:17.</i>
The <i>Targum</i> writes: “<i>From much wisdom</i>” means that one who has much wisdom from Torah and commandments, if he commits a sin, he will have great troubles from the Holy One. The Holy One punishes the righteous greatly, even for a small sin.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Targum, Ecclesiastes, 1:18.</i>
“<i>To increase learning</i>” [1:18]. A young man who has much understanding and wisdom in the Torah and dies young, he brings much sorrow to the hearts of his relatives.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Targum, Ecclesiastes, 1:18.</i>

Chapter 2

“<i>I said</i>” [2:1]. Solomon said: Because it is so, excessive wisdom brings the person to evil. I thought in my heart, I would eat and drink everything. Afterwards, I saw that <i>Belshazzar</i> was a king who made large banquets all the time and died as a result of it. With <i>Noah</i> and <i>Lot</i> there was much evil and much drinking.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 2:1.</i>
“<i>I multiplied</i>” [2:4]. I was in an <i>important kingdom.</i> I did many important things. I built beautiful houses and planted vineyards.
“<i>I made</i>” [2:5]. I made gardens with all sorts of fruit trees. <i>King Solomon</i> knew with his wisdom which earth and city was good for pepper or carobs. The same with other good spices that he also planted there.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 2:5.</i>
“<i>I made pools</i>” [2:6]. I made pools to water the gardens so that they should grow.
“<i>I bought</i>” [2:7]. I bought many slaves and female slaves and I had twelve ministers, each of whom fed me and all of my people for a month. I had more cattle than all those who came before me in Jerusalem.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Targum, Ecclesiastes, 2:7.</i>
“<i>I amassed</i>” [2:8]. I amassed much silver and gold and <i>treasures</i> from <i>kings</i> and <i>merchants.</i> All kinds of <i>musicians</i> played for my table and I had trumpets, organs, violins and all sorts of musical instruments. I had chariots and wagons made. I did many wise things and did not forget the Torah.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 2:8.</i>
“<i>And everything</i>” [2:10]. Everything that the Sanhedrin asked me, <i>laws, forbidden and permitted</i>, I explained all of this to them. I had all the joy from the Torah, and I had the time to study. The same good reward in the <i>world to come.</i> This is my portion from all my work.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Targum, Ecclesiastes, 2:10.</i>
“<i>And I turned</i>” [2:11]. I turned and saw all of my deeds and I was disappointed with all of them, but the reward from the Torah and commandments remain in the <i>world to come.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Targum, Ecclesiastes, 2:11.</i>
“<i>And I turned</i>” [2:12]. I will turn away from all these deeds and will study Torah and the <i>punishments</i> for the transgressions so that the Holy One should not issue an evil decree against me. When the decree goes forth from the Holy One, no pleading helps. Therefore, I want to see ahead so that it should not come to a decree from the Holy One.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 2:12.</i>
“<i>The wise man</i>” [2:14]. The wise man thinks ahead to what will be the conclusion of a matter. However, the evil person goes like someone in the dark and does not think about the conclusion and what it will be. Even though I praise the wise man more than the evil one, I know well that both of them will die.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 2:14.</i>
“<i>I said</i>” [2:15]. I said: because the righteous person and the evil person both die, why do I want to be righteous? I reflected again that I did not speak correctly. Yes, both will die, but when one is dead the righteous one is remembered for good and leaves a good memory for his children who receive respect because of their father, the righteous person. However, when the evildoer dies, then all of his evil deeds are remembered and it gives his children a <i>bad reputation</i> and they have no respect because of their father. If he has success and wealth, it is soon lost and forgotten.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 2:15–16.</i>
“<i>I hated</i>” [2:18]. I hated all of my deeds that I had done. I must leave them for a person after me and who knows if the one who is my inheritor will be righteous or evil.
“<i>I came to view</i>” [2:20]. I <i>despaired</i> that I will not exert myself to work.
“<i>Because</i>” [2:21]. One finds a <i>righteous person</i> who accumulated money justly and when he dies, the same money comes to someone who did not exert himself for it.
“<i>Because</i>” [2:22]. What profit does a person have when he accumulates much money with much worry and later he must give it to a stranger?<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 2:22.</i>
“<i>Because</i>” [2:23]. All the days that the person lives, he only has pain and trouble and at night he does not rest.
“<i>It is not good</i>” [2:24]. It is not good for the person to eat and drink. He should accustom his body to do justice and charity with his eating and drinking.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 2:24.</i>
“<i>Since who eats</i>” [2:25]. Who is more justified to eat and drink with my money other than myself, that which I have exerted myself to accumulate?<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 2:25.</i>
“<i>To the man</i>” [2:26]. The Holy One who is his God and he studies Torah, then the Holy One gives him a heart, that he should have wisdom and joy in eating and drinking and beautiful clothes. To an evil person, the Holy One gives him a heart that he should accumulate much money, and the Holy One gives it to a righteous person, as we find regarding the treasure of Haman that came to <i>Mordecai and Esther.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 2:26.</i>

Chapter 3

“<i>For every time</i>” [3:1]. He should not <i>rejoice</i> that he has accumulated a lot of money. What is in his hand at this moment can quickly disappear. However, the time has not yet come. For all things there is a specified time when it should happen.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 3:1.</i>
“<i>A time to be born</i>” [3:2]. It is a time to have children, which is at nine months. It is a time to die, how long each generation and family should live. A time that a nation should be established and a time that each nation should be destroyed and defeated. And again, a time that the nation should be healed of its destruction. A time when the walls of Jerusalem should be destroyed and again, a time when they will be rebuilt. A time to cry on Tisha B’Av. A time to laugh when the Messiah will come. A time to mourn for the mourner. A time to dance before the bride and groom. A time when the young men of Jerusalem will be thrown into the streets in the <i>destruction of Jerusalem.</i> And again, when the young men will be ingathered in the days of the Messiah. It is a time that the Holy One will relate to Israel like a husband who is affectionate with his wife. It is also a time that the Holy One is angry at Israel and divorces himself from Is- rael. It is a time that the Holy One will gather in those dispersed in the exile, and also a time that the Holy One will destroy Israel in the exile. It is a time that the Holy One will watch over Israel when Israel will be pious. It is a time when the Holy One disperses Israel in foreign lands. It is a time when the Holy One will again gather them. It is a time when the <i>kingdom of David</i> will be torn asunder. Again, it is a time when the Holy One will sew and join the kingdom together and it will not be divided into two kingdoms. It is a time to remain silent, like Aaron who remained silent when the Holy One killed his two children.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus, 10:1–3.</i> Therefore, Aaron was worthy that a section of the Torah was written with his name. It is a time to speak, like Moses who spoke songs of praise to the Holy One.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus, 15:1–21.</i> It is a time that the Holy One loves you. It is a time when the Holy One hates you. Therefore, because there is a time for all things and therefore, the person should gather all the false things and throw them away, in order to study Torah. The time is coming soon when everything will be destroyed.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 3:2–10.</i>
“<i>He does everything well</i>” [3:11]. In the time when a person is pious, it is just that he receives good wages, and in the time when the person commits sins, it is just to be paid for his sins. The Holy One also did not give the wisdom of the world to one person alone, but gave wisdom to many people. He gave different forms of wisdom to different people so that one person should not know all the deeds of the Holy One and should not know when he will die, in the expectation that if he will worry every day, perhaps he will die today or tomorrow, he will repent every day. If a person would know when he would die, then the person would not build a house and might not plant a garden. Therefore, it is very good that the Holy One does not inform him of the time when he will die. Perhaps, the person would say, I will still live for a long time and will build beautiful houses and will plant good vineyards.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 3:11.</i>
“<i>I knew</i>” [3:12]. Indeed, because the person does not know when he dies, therefore it is none better but that he the person should be <i>happy with his portion</i> and should live well and should act charitably as long as he lives.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 3:12.</i>
“<i>And also</i>” [3:13]. Whoever the Holy One gives good sense into his heart that he should drink and eat well and gives charity in addition, this is a gift from the Holy One.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Targum, Ecclesiastes, 3:13.</i>
“<i>I knew</i>” [3:14]. I know well that everything that the Holy One created during the <i>act of Creation</i> remains eternal and does not become transformed. When, on occasion, something in the world is transformed, the Holy One does this himself to scare people so that they should fear Him, as we find in the <i>generation of Enosh.</i> They served foreign gods and the Holy One raised the level of the ocean and a third of the world’s people and animals were drowned. During the <i>generation of the Flood</i> they engaged in illicit sexual relations. The Holy One made the sun rise in the west and set in the east for seven consecutive days. This frightened the whole world. In the days of <i>Ahaz</i>, the father of <i>King Hezekiah</i>, on the day that he died, the Holy One made the day short, in the expectation that he would not be honored through being mourned. Therefore, the person should study Torah and fear Him.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 3:14.</i>
“<i>What was</i>” [3:15]. That which has occurred among us in the present, has also occurred long ago. We have seen it ourselves, but we hear it from other people. We see that the Holy One desires the one who is pursued, as we find when <i>Jacob</i> was pursued by <i>Esau</i>, the Holy One loved <i>Jacob</i> because he allowed himself to be pursued. The Holy One hated Esau because he pursued Jacob. Similarly, the Egyptians pursued the Israelites and this is why they were drowned in the sea. Israel went through the sea with joy because they allowed themselves to be pursued. Therefore, when a person commits sins, the Holy One will repay him for his transgressions.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 3:15.</i>
“<i>Further</i>” [3:16]. And I further saw <i>prophetically</i> that in the <i>Temple</i> there were only proper <i>laws and rules.</i> Afterwards, there was nothing but false <i>laws</i> and false <i>rules</i> and only bribery. I saw their <i>punishment and troubles</i> that they must suffer from <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i> and his nation, with great travails.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 3:16.</i>
“<i>I said</i>” [3:17]. Therefore, I thought to myself, because the Holy One does everything with judgment, He sometimes waits and does not repay the evildoer immediately for his transgressions. However, all things must come to pass. There is a time for everything, when it should happen. When the time comes, then the Holy One settles accounts with that person and repays everything at one time.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 3:17.</i>
“<i>I said</i>” [3:18]. I thought that I see young men who pursue <i>arrogance</i> and <i>power.</i> The Holy One lets them know that their <i>joy</i> and <i>power</i> are nothing and shows them that they are the same as other domestic and wild animals.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 3:18.</i>
“<i>It happens</i>” [3:19]. Why should the person pursue pride when he is like the animal? It happens that the person dies, just like the animal. Similarly, when he has great luck and becomes wealthy he is still not different from the animal. As soon as he dies, one does not see his greatness and his wealth. It all goes into the ground.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 3:19.</i>
“<i>Who knows</i>” [3:21]? Where does one find a person who thinks and understands that the soul of the person ascends to Heaven to be judged for his deeds? The soul of the animal remains below, on the earth, and does not come to be judged before God. Why should the person be arrogant and behave like an animal that does not give an account before the Holy One?<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 3:21.</i>
“<i>I saw</i>” [3:22]. Therefore, there is nothing better the person can do, but to eat and drink and he should be <i>happy with his portion</i> and should not accumulate extra money. He does not know to which of his children he will leave his money, and if they will have luck with it or not.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 3:22.</i>

Chapter 4

“<i>I observed</i>” [4:1]. I saw <i>prophetically</i> the evildoers who do not observe the Torah would come into the hands of the <i>angels of destruction</i> in <i>Gehenna</i>, who will twist and tear them apart. They will cry many tears and nobody will have compassion and console them.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 4:1.</i>
“<i>Praise</i>” [4:2]. I praise the dead who died long ago and who remained pious in their service of the Holy One.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 4:2.</i>
“<i>Good</i>” [4:3]. It is better for everyone that they would not have been born, that they should not have seen the evil deeds of the world.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">Targum, Ecclesiastes, 4:3.</i>
“<i>And I saw</i>” [4:4]. And I saw that perhaps some commit sins and some fulfill commandments, but not for the <i>sake of Heaven.</i> They are jealous and they do it because of arguments and both of them are nothing but pain and foolishness.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 4:4.</i>
“<i>The fool</i>” [4:5]. The evil person folds his hands together and does not want to work, eats only from stealing. When he will come to the next world, he will see the righteous sitting with great honor and he will eat his own flesh.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 4:5.</i>
“<i>Good</i>” [4:6]. It is better to have gathered a small amount of money with justice, since the Holy One wants that one should not steal. It is much better that the evil person gathers much money through sins. This is not beloved by the Holy One.<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 4:6.</i>
“<i>There is one</i>” [4:8]. It is not good to be alone. One sometimes finds a <i>scholar</i> who is careful not to have a colleague who will discuss the Torah with him, who is like a good brother. Similarly, he is careful not to have <i>students</i>, who are like a son. Also, a <i>widower</i> is not correct in being alone without a wife. She is like a brother to help him and to have children. It is also not good for a merchant to sit alone. He should have a partner who will travel with him. A person alone soon becomes tired when he studies alone and does not become sated with explanations from the Torah. One receives much Torah from students. The merchant does well when he has a partner. There are many tasks in trade and a person alone does not easily begin, but with his partner, he soon begins.<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 4:8.</i>
“<i>Better</i>” [4:9]. Two are better than one for everything. If one falls, then the other one, his friend, helps him up. Similarly, a scholar and his colleague; if he forgets something from his teacher, his colleague reminds him of that teaching.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 4:9–10.</i>
“<i>Also</i>” [4:11]. Also, when two sleep next to each other, they keep each other warm, but one cannot warm himself.
“<i>And if</i>” [4:12]. If robbers come upon him, if he has a friend he can defend himself. It is even better if three are together. Another explanation, if one is a scholar and his son is also a scholar and his grandson is also a scholar, then the Torah does not soon cease in this family, as Scripture says, “<i>they shall not be absent from your mouth, nor from the mouth of your children, nor from the mouth of your children</i>’<i>s children</i> – <i>said the Lord</i> – <i>from now on, for all time</i>” [Isaiah 59:21].<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 4:12.</i>
“<i>Better a youth</i>” [4:13]. The <i>good inclination</i> is better, and is called a child because it comes to a person when he is thirteen years old. The <i>good inclination</i> is called <i>miskan</i>, which means poor. The <i>good inclination</i> is like a poor person whose words are not heard. All the limbs of the person do not listen to the words of the <i>good inclination</i>, to fulfill <i>commandments.</i> The <i>good inclination</i> is called <i>wise</i> because it makes the person wise. The <i>good inclination</i> is better than the <i>evil inclination</i>, which is called an <i>old and foolish king.</i> It is like a <i>king</i> who rules over all the limbs of the person. Why is it called old? This is because he comes as soon as the person is born. The <i>evil inclination</i> is called <i>evil</i> because it makes the person <i>evil.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 4:13.</i>
“<i>Since</i>” [4:14]. When the <i>evil inclination</i> comes to the person, when the person is born, at the same time the woman who bore the child is still impure from the blood and very <i>loathsome.</i> The <i>evil inclination</i> also became <i>loathsome</i> from the same blood of the woman and shows his dominion and rule in the same person. Afterwards, the <i>rule and dominion</i> of the <i>evil inclination</i> is strong. When the poor <i>good inclination</i> comes, at the age of thirteen, to the person when he is pure from the blood of his mother.<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 4:14.</i>
“<i>I saw</i>” [4:15]. I saw <i>Noah</i> and his children, from whom the whole world is derived. There is no end to the great nation that came from them. They became pregnant from their husbands and had children on the third day of their pregnancy. There is no limit to the good that they had and everything was soon lost when after a tragedy the evil inclination followed.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 4:15–16.</i>
“<i>Be careful</i>” [4:17]. Be careful with the steps of your feet when you should go to the Temple. You should bring <i>sacrifices and offerings</i> out of good will. However, do not commit transgressions that you should bring sacrifices for your sins. The Holy One says, it is much more desirable that you should listen to my commandments and Torah than the sacrifices that one brings for transgressions. The evildoer does not understand and does not fear that he commits transgressions and brings evil on himself.<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 4:17.</i>

Chapter 5

“<i>Do not be rash</i>” [5:1]. Do not be rash or say something against God, since God is stronger because He is above. Even if a weaker one is above, he rules, and even a stronger one than him is under him.<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 5:1.</i>
“<i>Because</i>” [5:2]. The dream comes to the person only from his <i>thoughts</i> and ideas that the person thinks during the day. The fool is recognized that he is a fool when he speaks much. He also speaks much foolishness and must speak foolishness. Therefore, do not speak much, as I told you previously.<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 5:2.</i>
“<i>When</i>” [5:3]. When you make a vow to God, pay it immediately. The Holy One does not desire that evildoers make <i>vows</i> and do not pay them.<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 5:3.</i>
“<i>Do not give</i>” [5:5]. Do not make a vow with your mouth, since if you do not fulfill the vow, then you and your children will be punished. Do not say to the <i>treasurer</i> who asks you to pay the vow, I do not have it. I thought I would have money, but now I do not have it. Why should you cause that the Holy One should be angry with you and cause yourself to lose all the positive commandments you have in your hands as a result of the sin that you did not pay the vow to the treasurer.<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 5:5.</i>
“<i>Since</i>” [5:6]. Everything the <i>dreams</i> tell you and <i>false prophets</i> try to dissuade you from God, do not turn to them and fear God.<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 5:6.</i>
“<i>If</i>” [5:7]. When you see in the land that they rob the poor people and do not do <i>justice and charity</i>, do not wonder when the Holy One brings much evil on them. The Holy One sees everything and has many messengers to pay them. Another explanation is, when you see a land where they rob the poor people and do injustice and you see things are going well for that city and God does not pay them, do not wonder that God does it this way. God is slow to anger. The Holy One becomes angry when the measure becomes full and the Holy One has enough messengers, when the time will come.<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 5:7.</i>
“<i>The advantage</i>” [5:8]. Those people who pursue arrogance and anger the Holy One. The Holy One pays them with all of his creatures, even with a gnat or flea, as we find concerning the <i>evil Titus.</i> The Holy One sent a gnat into his brain and it killed him. The Holy One will pay the nations with much anger for making Jerusalem like a field.<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 5:8.</i>
“<i>A lover of money</i>” [5:9]. The one who loves the commandments does not become sated from them. The one who has fulfilled many commandments and does not include among them an <i>important commandment</i> like building the <i>Temple</i> or building a synagogue, or if he does not purchase a <i>Torah scroll</i>, then all the <i>commandments</i> he has fulfilled are not very good. Another explanation is, the wages from the land that one works are the best form of work and even a king needs the land, since if the grain does not grow then he will also die. When someone has much silver, he does not become sated from the silver and must eat wheat. Another explanation is, the <i>reward for Israel</i> is in everything they study. A person may study <i>Scripture</i> or <i>Mishnah</i> or <i>Gemara.</i> God pays him good wages for everything. The person who knows <i>Scripture</i> and <i>Mishnah</i> well must then study <i>Talmud.</i> He must explain the Mishnah and how one should <i>decide</i> [halakhic questions].<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 5:9.</i>
“<i>Increases</i>” [5:10]. When Jews are pious in all of their deeds, they have many good rewards. What profit does the Holy One have when people fulfill the commandments? The explanation is that it is pleasure for the Holy One that people do His will.<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 5:10.</i>
“<i>Sweet</i>” [5:11]. The sleep of those who work the land and sow the fields with more or less wheat is very sweet. He is used to work and sleeps very sweetly. However, the wealthy person who has much merchandise cannot sleep. He worries day and night about his merchandise. Another explanation, the sleep of the person who serves God, more or less, is sweet. The one who served little receives a reward like the one who serves much. We find that <i>Moses our Teacher</i> led Israel for forty years. <i>Samuel the Prophet</i> led Israel for ten years and Scripture compares the two. <i>Samuel</i> was as good as <i>Moses our Teacher.</i> He had many disciples who learned Torah from him. He cannot sleep in his grave. His lips move in the grave because his disciples in this world quote his teachings.<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 5:11.</i>
“<i>There is evil</i>” [5:12]. I saw an evil that wealth is bad for the person and he can be destroyed through his evil. <i>Korah</i> was very wealthy and had a high opinion of himself. He came to his grave along with his wealth because of his arrogance.<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 5:12.</i>
“<i>And lost</i>” [5:13]. The same wealth becomes lost and he has a son. The son does not have money or <i>ancestral merit</i> in his hands because his father was an evildoer.<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 5:13.</i>
“<i>When</i>” [5:14]. He came out naked from his mother’s womb and so must he return to the earth. He has no <i>merit from charity</i> to take with him to the next world.<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 5:14.</i>
“<i>Behold</i>” [5:17]. Now I see that it is good for the person that he should eat and drink and do charitable things with his money and study Torah. He should not accumulate excessive money, but he should be <i>happy with his portion.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 5:17.</i>
“<i>Also</i>” [5:18]. Also, let each person to whom God has given wealth and much good, eat from it and be worthy through it to study Torah so that he will have <i>reward in the world to come</i>, which is a present from God.<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 5:18.</i>
“<i>For</i>” [5:19]. The life of the person is short. He remembers his days on this world that are not many. Why should he accumulate money? It is better he should study Torah. Thus, he will take a good reward to the world to come and the Holy One will be his witness that he was happy and did good during his life.<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 5:19.</i>

Chapter 6

“<i>There is evil</i>” [6:1]. There is an evil I have seen and it is among many people.
“<i>A man</i>” [6:2]. A person to whom the Holy One has given wealth and honor and the Holy One does not allow him to eat from it, that he should enjoy it. However, day and night he accumulates money and gives no charity from his money that he should take with him as a <i>reward to the world to come</i>, but a stranger comes and eats and enjoys his wealth.<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 6:2.</i>
“<i>If he should beget</i>” [6:3]. If a person would have a hundred children and he would live for many years and did not enjoy his wealth, eventually the time comes and he does not have a grave, but the dogs eat him. I have said that a <i>stillbirth</i> from its mother’s womb that has not seen any good is better and has not grieved over the world.<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 6:3.</i>
“<i>If he lived</i>” [6:6]. If a person were to live a thousand years twice over and when he has not done good with his money, what kind of profit does he have? In the end, he must come into the earth like other paupers.<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 6:6.</i>
“<i>All of his work</i>” [6:7]. All of the person’s work is so that he should eat from it in this world and his <i>soul in the next world.</i> However, the person who has no pleasure from his goods will not sate his soul in the world to come. Another explanation is, all the work of the person is that he should eat and drink. Is it not right that he should occasionally enjoy some pleasure?<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 6:7.</i>
“<i>Since what</i>” [6:8]. When there is someone who denies himself pleasures, in what way is the wise person with his wisdom better, in comparison to the fool? Does one honor the pauper more than the wealthy man who has no pleasure from his money? The pauper lives as well as the wealthy man.<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 6:8.</i>
“<i>Appearance is good</i>” [6:9]. It is better for the stingy man that he should always see his wealth before him than that he should eat. Therefore, he can have no pleasure from his wealth. Another explanation is, it is good for the evil person that he follows his eyes that desire robbery, to accumulate money and does not think where his soul will end up when he dies.<sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 6:9.</i>
“<i>What was</i>” [6:10]. The wealthy man has an important reputation, but the important reputation is lost when he must die. He cannot oppose the <i>angel of death</i> who is stronger than the wealthy man.<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 6:10.</i>
“<i>There are</i>” [6:11]. There are many wealthy people who desire to play with apes and elephants, but what profit does he have when he dies?<sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 6:11.</i>
“<i>Since who</i>” [6:12]. The one who knows to do good deeds will have it good in the world to come; whoever thinks that life is short and should quickly fulfill commandments in the short time that he has here. Who tells the person how much money that he has robbed to leave behind for his children after his death?<sup class="footnote-marker">83</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 6:12.</i>

Chapter 7

“<i>A good name</i>” [7:1]. A good name is more beautiful for a person than is oil. The day that he was born. When <i>Miriam</i> was born, nobody knew what she was. When she died, the well of water removed itself from Israel in the wilderness. She received a <i>good name</i> in that because of her merit, there was enough water for Israel. Similarly, the clouds disappeared when Aaron died. The same happened to Israel when Moses died, the <i>manna</i> ended. Why does he compare a good name to oil and not to other beverages? The explanation is that in whatever beverage one pours oil, it always floats to the top. A <i>good name</i> is similar; it ascends to the top. However, when one pours other beverages into other beverages, they become mixed up and are not recognized.<sup class="footnote-marker">84</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 7:1.</i>
“<i>It is better to go</i>” [7:2]. It is better to go to the house of mourning to comfort the <i>mourner.</i> With that he does good to the dead and is an honor for the mourner whom he comforts. This is better than to go to a house where people drink at a wedding. He does no greater honor to the living. Also, one goes to a <i>mourner</i>’<i>s</i> house, because every person must die. He will think about death and he will repent for his sins. He will also remember in his heart that I am doing an <i>act of lovingkindness</i> with the dead that I will need when I die. Another explanation, it is better to go to a <i>mourner</i>’<i>s</i> house, because this is the end of man. That is to say, the deceased still lies before us and I can do an <i>act of lovingkindness.</i> Later, after he is buried one can no longer perform an act of lovingkindness for him. Therefore, he should not go to the wedding house, since he will not be able to do the act of lovingkindness for the deceased. However, with regards to the wedding, he can respond that he could not come to the wedding, but he will come to the <i>circumcision feast</i> that will be made or to his son’s wedding.<sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 7:2.</i>
“<i>Anger is better</i>” [7:3]. When the Holy One on occasion punishes a person, he should not despair. Had the Holy One gotten angry with the <i>generation of the Flood</i>, they would have become pious and repented. However, because he made them quite rich and everything went well for them, they committed their sins and they were all lost. Concerning this, he says here that the anger of the Holy One is better than laughter, than that the Holy One show a beautiful <i>face</i> to the people. When the Holy One punishes the person, it causes the good heart of the person to repent.<sup class="footnote-marker">86</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 7:3.</i>
“<i>The heart of the wise</i>” [7:4]. The wise only think about death and fulfill commandments. Evildoers only think about drinking and forget about death.<sup class="footnote-marker">87</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 7:4.</i>
“<i>It is better to listen</i>” [7:5]. It is better to hear the reproof of a sage than the singing of the evildoers.
“<i>Since the voice</i>” [7:6]. The evildoer boasts and says he is as important as other important people and he argues with these people. When one puts the thorns on a fire, they scream and make noise. The thorns jump very high. That is to say, they show that they are also good, as the other good wood. They let themselves be heard, since they are considered unimportant. This evildoer is similar. He argues with the sages and says that he is also important.<sup class="footnote-marker">88</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 7:6.</i>
“<i>For cheating</i>” [7:7]. The evildoer, who argues with the righteous person, <i>confuses his thoughts</i> and thereby he comes to commit a sin, as <i>Dathan and Abiram</i> did with Moses. They started screaming at him that he went to Pharaoh, and Pharaoh was making the work of the Israelites more difficult. Dathan and Abiram were screaming and arguing with Moses and caused that Moses was angry because of them and spoke to the Holy One with anger. Why did You not help Israel, Holy One? You have made Pharaoh a worse enemy and caused the work of the Israelites to be harder. Moses was punished because of this, that he had to die in the wilderness and was not worthy to lead Israel into the land of <i>Canaan.</i> All of this was caused by the evildoers, <i>Dathan and Abiram</i> and caused Moses the sage to lose heart.<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 7:7.</i>
“<i>The end is better</i>” [7:8]. The end of a thing is better than it’s beginning. When the end comes, one sees if the thing is good and becomes aware what the thing is. It is better than one does not immediately become angry, like an arrogant person who quickly becomes angry and quickly begins to quarrel.<sup class="footnote-marker">90</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 7:8.</i>
“<i>Do not say</i>” [7:10]. Do not be amazed at all the good that came to the righteous. Your ancestors, the Israelites in the wilderness, had all the good things. It was also so in the time of Joshua and also in the time of <i>King David.</i> It should not be surprising to you. They had much merit, and therefore it should not amaze you.<sup class="footnote-marker">91</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 7:10.</i>
“<i>Wisdom is better</i>” [7:11]. The wisdom of the Torah is better than merchandise. Wisdom is a positive attribute and is good for all people.<sup class="footnote-marker">92</sup><i class="footnote">Targum, Ecclesiastes, 7:11.</i>
“<i>It is good</i>” [7:12]. With wisdom one can acquire wealth. Wisdom is better than wealth, which makes fools its masters.<sup class="footnote-marker">93</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 7:12.</i>
“<i>See the</i>” [7:13]. See what the Holy One has created, the <i>Garden of Eden for the righteous</i> and <i>Gehenna for the evildoers.</i> Therefore, repent in time, before you die. In the next world, you cannot repair your sins.<sup class="footnote-marker">94</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 7:13.</i>
“<i>In a day of good</i>” [7:14]. In the time that you are well off, do good and give charity, awaiting a time when troubles will come to the evildoers. You will see their troubles that the Holy One justly caused. At the same time, He gave the charitable their good reward and the transgressors await their reward, so the person should not be able to talk against the Holy One.<sup class="footnote-marker">95</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 7:14.</i>
“<i>There is a righteous person</i>” [7:15]. I have seen a righteous person who was completely lost and was in great trouble. Yet, he remained steadfast in his righteousness. I have seen the evildoers who long remain with their evil.
“<i>Do not be</i>” [7:16]. Don’t be overly <i>righteous</i>, like <i>King Saul.</i> He had compassion on the Amalekites and did not allow them to be killed. Do not be overly clever, like <i>King Saul.</i> He said that it is written in the Torah that if one finds a corpse in the field who was killed, one should bring a calf and measure which city is closest. How much more so, it is not right when many people are killed, but he was mistaken in what God had commanded regarding the killing of Cuthites.<sup class="footnote-marker">96</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ecclesiastes Rabbah,</i> 7.16.</i>
“<i>Good that you should grasp</i>” [7:18]. It is good that you should hold on to justice and you should also hold on to <i>injustice.</i> That is to say, when the righteous one and prophet commands you to do something and you think it is an <i>injustice</i> against God, you should still hold on to it. The one who fears God holds on to <i>justice and injustice</i>, no matter what it is.
“<i>Wisdom is a stronghold</i>” [7:19]. Wisdom protects the wise person as we find regarding <i>King Josiah.</i> Scripture says about him that there was not before him such a pious king who had his wisdom and he was better than the ten <i>evil kings</i> who were before him in Jerusalem.<sup class="footnote-marker">97</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 7:19.</i>
“<i>For the person</i>” [7:20]. It is correct that each person should search and think about his deeds in order to repent, since there is no righteous person in the land who does not have sins.<sup class="footnote-marker">98</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 7:20.</i>
Another explanation is: “<i>Wisdom is a stronghold</i>” [7:19]. This means that wisdom protects the wise person from ten organs of the person. They are the two eyes that see all the sins, the two ears that hear all the idle talk, the two hands that steal and rob, the two feet that take the person to his sins, and the mouth speaks and the heart desires.<sup class="footnote-marker">99</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 7:21.</i>
“<i>Also everything</i>” [7:21]. You should not listen to gossip. If you listen to it, it may come that you will also be cursed.<sup class="footnote-marker">100</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 7:21.</i>
“<i>Every</i>” [7:23]. I attempted everything with wisdom from the Torah. I thought that I would understand it, but it is too difficult for me.<sup class="footnote-marker">101</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 7:23.</i>
“<i>Far</i>” [7:24]. It is too difficult to understand the things relating to the <i>six days of creation.</i> It is too deep to understand and one should not think about creation, what is below the earth and what is above the heaven.<sup class="footnote-marker">102</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 7:24.</i>
“<i>I turned</i>” [7:25]. I turned to understanding the <i>reason</i> for the <i>red heifer</i> and the calculation when the Messiah will come. I wanted to know the reasons for the commandments and I could not understand them.<sup class="footnote-marker">103</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 7:25.</i>
“<i>I found</i>” [7:26]. I found something that is bitterer than the bitterness of death, a wife. The man is similarly captured and bound to her. A righteous man is one who is worthy to give her a divorce and a sinner is one who takes her and is bound to her.<sup class="footnote-marker">104</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 7:26.</i>
“<i>See</i>” [7:27]. Solomon said: see what I have found. All the commandments that the righteous fulfill and all the sins that the evildoers commit are all brought before the Holy One. One and another until it becomes a great account.<sup class="footnote-marker">105</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 7:27.</i>
“<i>One man</i>” [7:28]. A thousand people go to study the verses of the Torah. There are barely a hundred who can study <i>Mishnah.</i> From that hundred that study <i>Mishnah</i>, there are barely ten that can study Gemara. From those ten we can find barely one who is <i>worthy</i> to <i>decide matters</i> [of Jewish law]. However, one cannot even find one woman out of a thousand, therefore be warned about women.<sup class="footnote-marker">106</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 7:28.</i>
“<i>Only</i>” [7:29]. However, I have found that evil comes from women. The Holy One created <i>Adam</i> properly complete and pious and when <i>Eve</i>, his wife, came to <i>Adam</i>, she caused him to commit transgressions.<sup class="footnote-marker">107</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 7:29.</i>

Chapter 8

“<i>Who</i>” [8:1]. Who is more important in the world than a wise man and who can explain things more than <i>Daniel</i>, who was a sage? The Holy One informed him how to interpret everything for Israel. Another explanation is: Who is like Moses who <i>mediated</i> between Israel and the Holy One? His <i>face</i> was changed and other people who saw him feared to come close to <i>Moses</i> because of the great light that was on Moses’ face.<sup class="footnote-marker">108</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 8:1.</i>
“<i>I</i>” [8:2]. Therefore I want to uphold the words of the Holy One and His <i>oath</i> that He swore on Mount <i>Sinai.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">109</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 8:2.</i>
“<i>Don</i>’<i>t be hasty</i>” [8:3]. Do not think you will run away from the Holy One, so that He should not find you. God rules over the whole world, therefore, do not attempt to do evil things. God can pay you for your sins any way that he wants. God is the ruler of all worlds and who wants to say to Him, what are you doing?<sup class="footnote-marker">110</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 8:3.</i>
“<i>Keep the commandments</i>” [8:5]. If you keep the commandments, then no evil will happen to you. The wise person thinks that there is a time to pay their misfortune to the evildoers.<sup class="footnote-marker">111</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 8:5.</i>
“<i>For every thing</i>” [8:6]. All the time that the person commits sins is a time when the Holy One should pay him for his sins. When the Holy One waits, it is so that the measure of sins should be filled.<sup class="footnote-marker">112</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 8:6.</i>
“<i>He does not</i>” [8:7]. When the evildoer commits sins, he does not think about his end, that the Holy One will punish him. Who can advise him how to protect himself when and how the misfortune comes? When it comes, it happens in a moment.<sup class="footnote-marker">113</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 8:7.</i>
“<i>No man</i>” [8:8]. No person can protect himself from the angel of death, that he should not take his <i>soul.</i> The <i>importance</i> of a person is removed on the day that he dies. Scripture always calls <i>David, king.</i> This means that he is always called king in Scripture, but on the day that he died, Scripture only called him David, and not king. When the time comes that he should die, he cannot send his son or his servants in his stead. He must go himself with the <i>angel of death</i> and his evil deeds do not let him escape.<sup class="footnote-marker">114</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 8:8.</i>
“<i>All this</i>” [8:9]. I have seen everything and gave my heart to all the deeds that people lord over others. Later, the opposite happens that the other one becomes stronger and repays his evil. Amalek first caused Israel much pain and later Amalek was destroyed at the hands of Israel. The same with Pharaoh, Nebuchadnezzar, and Sennacherib.<sup class="footnote-marker">115</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 8:9.</i>
“<i>Then I saw</i>” [8:10]. Prophetically, I saw evildoers and ordinary people of the nations. They were correct that they should bury themselves in the earth, because they were lowly and they came to the <i>Temple</i> and destroyed it. The same evildoers went home and boasted in their cities that they had done it. The Holy One did not repay them immediately. They thought that there was no <i>law</i> and no <i>judge</i> who would repay them for their evil deeds, that they have destroyed the Temple.<sup class="footnote-marker">116</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 8:10.</i>
“<i>Because their sentence</i>” [8:11]. Therefore, because the Holy One did not immediately repay the evildoers for their terrible deeds, they think that He will pardon them. Thus, they feel able to do evil in their hearts.<sup class="footnote-marker">117</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 8:11.</i>
“<i>Who sinned</i>” [8:12]. Therefore, since the evildoer sees that the Holy One waits a hundred years for the sinner, he continues to do evil. Similarly, I know that the Holy One will pay a just reward to the righteous for their deeds and to the evildoers for their deeds. No good will come to the evildoer, because he did not fear God.<sup class="footnote-marker">118</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 8:12.</i>
“<i>There is vanity</i>” [8:14]. There is a thing that frightens people, that things are very difficult for the righteous. It would be just if it would be the same for the evildoer. However, when things go well for the evildoer, with wealth. I thought that this is also a foolishness that is in the world.<sup class="footnote-marker">119</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 8:14.</i>
“<i>And I praised</i>” [8:15]. I praise enjoyment. There is nothing better in his whole life that God has given him, but to eat and drink. This will accompany him to the <i>world to come.</i> That is to say, he should be <i>happy with his portion</i> and should study Torah and fulfill commandments. He should not accumulate much money from <i>interest and robbery.</i> He should be happy with his wife and should not go after strange women.<sup class="footnote-marker">120</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 8:15.</i>
“<i>When I gave</i>” [8:16]. I have given my heart to know wisdom and saw all deeds on the earth. The evildoer goes to accumulate much money or go after illicit sex and he cannot sleep.<sup class="footnote-marker">121</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 8:16.</i>
“<i>And I saw</i>” [8:17]. I saw all the deeds that God gave to people. He cannot understand what the Holy One did that the evildoers have luck and the righteous ones are humbled. I have also seen many people endeavoring to know why things go well for evildoers and the righteous have trouble and nobody has understood this. If the wise man wants to say that he knows this could not have happened, even <i>Moses out Teacher</i> said to God, “<i>let me know your ways</i>” [Exodus, 33:13], let me know your ways.<sup class="footnote-marker">122</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 8:17.</i>

Chapter 9

“<i>For all this</i>” [9:1]. Everything that I have give my heart to understand, that everything I understood that if things go poorly now for the righteous and wise, it is in the hands of the Holy One, who will increase their reward in the <i>world to come.</i> Also, the person does not know and does not give his heart to think about what will cause the Holy One to love or hate him. This is all for the righteous and wise.<sup class="footnote-marker">123</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 9:1.</i>
“<i>Everything</i>” [9:2]. All people know that one thing happens to all people. The end of the righteous and the evil is that they must equally die. The righteous person only fulfills commandments and knows well that in the world to come he will receive a good reward. We find that the Holy One made the <i>righteous Noah</i> and the <i>evil Pharaoh</i> limp on their feet. Similarly, Moses was called <i>good</i>, and <i>Aaron pure.</i> The <i>spies</i> were called <i>impure</i>, and Moses, Aaron and the <i>spies</i> were not <i>worthy</i> to enter the <i>land of Israel.</i> The same thing happened to all of them. Similarly, <i>King Josiah</i> offered sacrifices to God and <i>Ahab, the king</i> who abrogated the sacrifices and both of them died in middle age. Similarly, <i>King David was called good</i> and <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i> was <i>called a sinner.</i> David built the <i>Temple</i> and <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i> destroyed it, yet each one reigned for forty years. The same with <i>Zedekiah</i> who swore falsely and <i>Samson</i> who swore truthfully and they were both blinded. Their eyes were poked out and they died because of it.<sup class="footnote-marker">124</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 9:2.</i>
“<i>This evil</i>” [9:3]. I think that it is bad that God should have the same fate for the righteous and the evildoers. The heart of the person is full of anger. They say that there is no <i>justice</i>, <i>heaven forbid</i>, concerning their life in this world. However, in the next world they will go to Gehenna.<sup class="footnote-marker">125</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 9:3.</i>
“<i>Since who</i>” [9:4]. Since when a person is still alive, if he is an evildoer, it is still possible that he will reconsider and will repent. There is still hope for him. It is better to be a live dog than a dead lion. Though they were both evildoers, <i>Nebuzaradan</i> was the servant of <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i>, who destroyed the Temple. He converted before he died and went to paradise. His master, Nebuchadnezzar, went to Gehenna.<sup class="footnote-marker">126</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 9:4.</i>
“<i>Since the living</i>” [9:5]. When the person is still alive, he knows that he must die and he is afraid and repents. However, the dead do not know. That is to say, in the next world it does not help, because he did not repent while he was alive.<sup class="footnote-marker">127</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 9:5.</i>
“<i>Their love also</i>” [9:6]. Because they loved foolishness, playing, hated the Torah, and angered the Holy One, all of it is lost. The merits of their sons and daughters do not help these evildoers.<sup class="footnote-marker">128</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 9:6.</i>
“<i>Go and eat</i>” [9:7]. However, you righteous person, you do the will of the Holy One and will be worthy of the world to come. Therefore, go and eat your bread with joy and drink good wine.<sup class="footnote-marker">129</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 9:7.</i>
“<i>Always</i>” [9:8]. Do good deeds every day since perhaps you will die today. You should have good deeds with you. King Solomon compared this to nice clothes. A parable, a king invited nobles to a feast. The wise one among them is always prepared with fine clothes, so he will not tarry when the king will send for him. However, the foolish one among these nobles does not prepare himself. When the king sends for him, he must remain outside and the king is angry with him. It is the same with the person. He should prepare himself with good deeds that are the white garments and the good oil that the verse mentions.<sup class="footnote-marker">130</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 9:8.</i>
“<i>See life</i>” [9:9]. See and think that you should have pleasure from your Torah study, awaiting that you will have to eat in this world and you will have a <i>good reward in the world to come.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">131</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 9:9.</i>
“<i>Everything that</i>” [9:10]. Do the will of the Holy One while you are still strong, since in the grave after your death you won’t be able to do anything. If you will do that, you won’t have to give an account in the grave before the Holy One.<sup class="footnote-marker">132</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 9:10.</i>
“<i>I returned and saw</i>” [9:11]. I returned and saw that it does not help the person that he can run fast. When his time comes, as happened to <i>Eshael</i>, the bravery of Abner did not help when his time came, and my wisdom did not help me. There were so many people at my table that sixty measures of bread were needed every day. Now I don’t have more than my own staff. It also did not help the intelligent people that <i>Job</i> first had great wealth and soon he lost everything. Moses’ great wisdom and prophecy did not help him to be successful with his prayers to enter the <i>land of Israel.</i> This was all because of one incident and one time, in contrast to all the other things in the world.<sup class="footnote-marker">133</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 9:11.</i>
“<i>Since also</i>” [9:12]. The person also does not know the time, like when one catches a big fish with a hook or one catches a bird in a net. In the same way, it happens many times that a person is punished without warning.<sup class="footnote-marker">134</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 9:12.</i>
“<i>This also</i>” [9:14]. I also saw a small city and a great and strong king came and besieged the city. There were few people in the city and a poor <i>wise</i> man came and protected the whole city with his wisdom. The wise man was as nothing because he was poor. I thought to myself that <i>wisdom is better than strength.</i> All the people of this city considered the poor man as insignificant and now he protected them. The Midrash says that he compared the body of the person to a city that is small and has few people in it. These are the organs of the body and a great <i>king</i> wants to conquer the city. This is the evil inclination. All of the organs follow him and a poor wise man in the body, is the <i>good inclination.</i> He is compared to a poor man in that nobody listens to what he has to say, though he is very wise. The same poor wise man protects the body for the <i>world to come.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">135</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ecclesiastes Rabbah,</i> 9.14.</i>
“<i>The words of the wise</i>” [9:17]. The people accept the words of the wise even if they are spoken quietly. These are the commandments of <i>Moses our Teacher.</i> It has been thousands of years since he commanded the commandments and punishments and they are still strictly observed until the present day. However, the decrees and rules that the nations of the world screamed and commanded were not accepted. They were soon abrogated.<sup class="footnote-marker">136</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 9:17.</i>
“<i>Wisdom is better</i>” [9:18]. The wisdom of a woman named <i>Serah</i> was better. She protected the whole city with her wisdom. <i>Joab</i> had besieged the whole city and wanted to kill all the people because of <i>Sheva ben Bikhri</i> who had rebelled against David, for which he was <i>guilty of the death penalty.</i> The smart woman Serah came and handed over <i>Sheva ben Bikhri. Joab</i> took him and killed him and allowed the whole city to live. Her wisdom was better than their desire to fight a war. If one person sinned, why should many good people lose their lives?<sup class="footnote-marker">137</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 9:18.</i>

Chapter 10

“<i>Dead flies</i>” [10:1]. A dead fly causes the good oil to stink. A small thing causes the loss of a costly thing. Similarly, a small sin causes the loss of <i>much merit</i> from the world. If the whole world were to be half full of positive commandments and half full with sins and one evil person comes and commits one small sin, he tips the scale with his small sin. The whole world is now a <i>majority of sins</i> and this negates all of the merits.<sup class="footnote-marker">138</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 10:1.</i>
“<i>The heart of the wise</i>” [10:2]. The heart of the wise man is incited to do good and the evildoer lusts after and is very pleased to do evil.<sup class="footnote-marker">139</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 10:2.</i>
“<i>And also</i>” [10:3]. Wherever the evildoer and the fool go, his heart fails him and he tells everyone that he is a fool. That is to say, he informs on himself that he is a fool by his excessive talk.<sup class="footnote-marker">140</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 10:3.</i>
“<i>If the spirit</i>” [10:4]. When the Holy One punishes you and you are pious, you should not say, what does my <i>righteousness</i> help me? The <i>travails</i> that the Holy One brings on you cause you to be absolved of many great sins.<sup class="footnote-marker">141</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 10:4.</i>
“<i>There is an evil</i>” [10:5]. There is an evil in the world that the Holy One commands and it must remain, just like the command of a <i>minister or king</i> who commands something and insists that it must remain.<sup class="footnote-marker">142</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 10:5.</i>
“<i>Folly was given</i>” [10:6]. What is it that is evil and must remain? The answer is, the Holy One made the evildoers who <i>destroyed the Temple</i> very important. I saw Jews who were just <i>rulers</i> and they sat on the ground degraded in the <i>ruins of the Temple.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">143</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 10:6.</i>
“<i>I saw slaves</i>” [10:7]. I have seen slaves who are from the most downtrodden of nations riding on horses and the nobles of Israel must walk on foot beside them.<sup class="footnote-marker">144</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 10:7.</i>
“<i>He who digs a pit</i>” [10:8]. Just like somebody who digs a pit and eventually he himself falls into it, in the same way, <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i> took the gold and silver vessels from the <i>Temple</i> and as a result of this, all of his children died. When a person transgresses <i>a decree that the sages made</i>, then the snakes will bite him.<sup class="footnote-marker">145</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 10:8.</i>
“<i>He who quarries stones</i>” [10:9]. The one who quarries stones from the mountain soon becomes tired and the one who chops wood soon becomes sweaty. In the same way, a person who fulfills commandments and studies Torah will receive his reward.<sup class="footnote-marker">146</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 10:9.</i>
“<i>If it is dull</i>” [10:10]. When the sword is sharp, even though it is its not clean and does not shine, yet it still wins the war and smites with the sharp sword. So too are the <i>scholars</i> when their faces are blackened because of Torah and are poor among <i>rich people.</i> Yet, he saves the whole world and <i>receives his reward in the world to come</i>, where his face will shine.<sup class="footnote-marker">147</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 10:10.</i>
“<i>The words of</i>” [10:12]. The words of the wise find <i>favor</i> among the people who listen and they will receive a good reward from God. However, the lips of the evildoer make him lose it, as Balaam did. The <i>nations of the world</i> did not engage in adultery from the <i>generation of the Flood</i> onward. Then <i>Balaam</i> came and convinced them to pursue adultery. As a result of this, <i>Balaam</i> was killed.<sup class="footnote-marker">148</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 10:12.</i>
“<i>The beginnings of his words</i>” [10:13]. The first words of Balaam to the Holy One were foolish. When the Holy One asked him, what type of people are with you? <i>Balaam</i> supposedly answered, You, God, know everything and who they are. He answered with arrogance. That is to say, when I, <i>Balaam, am humble</i> in your eyes, but the <i>king Balak considers me important</i> and he sent these <i>nobles</i> to me. At the end, he became <i>crazy and very confused</i> and did not know himself what he was talking.<sup class="footnote-marker">149</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 10:13.</i>
“<i>A fool multiplies words</i>” [10:14]. <i>Balaam</i> the fool boasted about himself. He said that he knows the opinion of the Holy One. The person, who did not know what it is, went and received a payment from Midian and he did not know that he would be killed. Another explanation is: “<i>A fool multiplies words</i>” [10:14]. The person says to other people that he will do this tomorrow and he does not know what will be tomorrow and does not even know what is behind his back. Someone must tell him. He cannot know it himself.<sup class="footnote-marker">150</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 10:14.</i>
“<i>The labor of fools</i>” [10:15]. The fool because he has not marked the streets and the route from the city becomes tired and wanders around, sometimes falling into the water and mud. The same is with someone who does not study the path of Torah. He will not find his way to Paradise. The Torah is like a light that leads the person on the right path.<sup class="footnote-marker">151</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 10:15.</i>
“<i>Woe to you, land</i>” [10:16]. Woe to the land whose king behaves like a youth without wisdom and whose nobles eat early in the day, which is not appropriate for proper nobles.<sup class="footnote-marker">152</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 10:16.</i>
“<i>Happy are you</i>” [10:17]. Happy is the land whose king is a wise man and the ministers behave with wisdom and not with drinking.<sup class="footnote-marker">153</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 10:17.</i>
“<i>With slothfulness</i>” [10:18]. When a person is lazy and slothful and does not want to repair a small damage in his house, a pillar will collapse. He will have to give double the money and when he does not cover his house in time, the rain will leak in. That is, when Israel will not study Torah and will be lazy regarding the commandments, then their <i>rule</i> will soon end.<sup class="footnote-marker">154</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 10:18.</i>
“<i>They make a banquet for revelry</i>” [10:19]. For every joyous occasion one makes banquets, like for a wedding or when one receives a king. However, one must have gold and silver for the banquet. Therefore, a person should not be lazy and should work and he will have money for banquets.<sup class="footnote-marker">155</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 10:19.</i>
“<i>Also</i>” [10:20]. You should not curse a king, not even in your thoughts. Do not curse, since the soul of the body carries the voice. The angel who accompanies the person tells everything. The Targum writes that the <i>angel Raziel</i> call out every day on Mount <i>Horeb</i> and his voice goes through the whole world and the <i>prophet Elijah</i> flies through the air under heaven, like an eagle, and tells all the secrets that happen in the world.<sup class="footnote-marker">156</sup><i class="footnote">Targum, Ecclesiastes, 10:20.</i>

Chapter 11

“<i>Cast your bread</i>” [11:1]. Do acts of lovingkindness with your bread for a person, even if you know well that you will not see him again. Just like when a person throws his food on the water, a day can still come that you will be repaid. See what happened with Jethro. He said, call him and let him eat bread. He thought that Moses was an Egyptian and he would not see him again. Therefore, Jethro was worthy that he should become his father-in-law and was a king. As a result he converted and his descendants became members of the <i>Sanhedrin.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">157</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 11:1.</i>
“<i>Give a portion</i>” [11:2]. Give a portion of bread to seven poor people and also to the eighth one. That is, do not say, I have given enough charity. If you can give, then give. You do not know what sort of evil will come into the world and you will be protected through the charity. Therefore, do not put it off.<sup class="footnote-marker">158</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 11:2.</i>
“<i>If the clouds are filled with rain</i>” [11:3]. When the clouds are full of water, you know well that the clouds will pour water on the earth where it will be good for growth. A scholar in a city is similar. His name is recognized and his good deeds are also recognized.<sup class="footnote-marker">159</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 11:3.</i>
“<i>Watching the wind</i>” [11:4]. If one wants to sow grain and waits that the wind will come, he will often not sow, since no wind may come. When one wants to harvest the grain in the field and he sees clouds and remembers that it will rain and does not want to harvest, he will often tarry and will always be fearful.<sup class="footnote-marker">160</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 11:4.</i>
“<i>Just as</i>” [11:5]. Just as the person does not know when the wind will come and you also do not know what is in the belly; it is locked. That is to say, the person sometimes thinks the clouds bring the wind and the winds go somewhere else, and in the belly of the woman, he does not know if it is <i>male or female.</i> Similarly, he does not know the deeds of God, who should be rich and who should be poor. Therefore, do acts of lovingkindness and charity. Do not say: if I will give much charity, I will become poor, or I will not study Torah because I won’t be able to conduct business, or I do not want a wife, because I will have many children who will cost me much.
“<i>Sow your seed in the morning</i>” [11:6]. When you have taught Torah in your youth and raised up students, you should also raise up students in your old age. You do not know which students will be better. In addition, if you gave char- ity in your youth, also give charity in your old age. Similarly, if you had children in your youth, have them also in your old age. We find concerning <i>Rabbi Akiva</i> that he had twenty-four thousand students in his younger years and they all died between Passover and <i>Shavuot.</i> However, in his old age he taught Torah to his students who remained alive. It is the same with children. We find that Boaz had thirty sons and thirty daughters and they all died during his lifetime. Then he married Ruth in his old age and had one son who was called <i>Obed.</i> He lived and <i>King David</i> was descended from him.<sup class="footnote-marker">161</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 11:6.</i>
“<i>The light is sweet</i>” [11:7]. The light of the Torah is sweet and it is good that the eyes of the students see the halakhah clearly and know and understand it properly.<sup class="footnote-marker">162</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 11:7.</i>
“<i>Even if</i>” [11:8]. The person who lives a long time should <i>rejoice with his portion.</i> However, he should also remember the dark days, which are the days when he dies. He should repent and do good deeds so that he will be protected in the same way, since there are many more similar days in his life and days of trouble will also come.<sup class="footnote-marker">163</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 11:8.</i>
“<i>Rejoice youth</i>” [11:9]. He says, rejoice while you are still young and follow your hearts desires. However, be aware that you will give a reckoning before God for all your remaining days.<sup class="footnote-marker">164</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 11:9.</i>
“<i>Banish anger</i>” [11:10]. Put aside all the things that are contrary to the Holy One so that you will not anger the Holy One. Cause the Evil Inclination to be removed from your flesh, so that you will reflect on the deeds of your youth, while you still have black hair.<sup class="footnote-marker">165</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 11:10.</i>

Chapter 12

“<i>Remember your Creator</i>” [12:1]. Reflect on three things. That you came from a stinking drop. Remember that you will come to the grave and remember that you will have to give an account before the Holy One for your sins. Therefore, remember that the evil days are still coming. Those are the days when you will be old and weak.<sup class="footnote-marker">166</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 12:1.</i>
“<i>Before</i>” [12:2]. Reflect before your forehead becomes darkened and furrowed. Before the nose becomes pointed and long and your soul will depart, the light will fade and your cheeks will fall into your face and become pits in your face like holes.<sup class="footnote-marker">167</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 12:2.</i>
“<i>In the day they will tremble</i>” [12:3]. Reflect before your ribs and flanks change and fall in and before the cramps afflict your feet and before your teeth will fall out and you become blind. Your bowel movements will be difficult. That is to say, the excretion of the food. This will always be difficult in your old age; you will always have <i>diarrhea.</i> Your stomach will be dried up and you will not be able to digest food. When old age comes, you will not be able to sleep and even a small bird will wake you from your sleep. When old age comes, you will despise organs and violins.<sup class="footnote-marker">168</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 12:3–4.</i>
“<i>Also</i>” [12:5]. In his old age he is afraid of a small hill and to walk in the streets that he might soon fall. When he begins to get older, the great and difficult old age quickly comes, like a date palm that grows quickly. When old age comes, sitting becomes difficult and the desire to have relations with women is disturbed. In old age, the fluid will leak out of his <i>spine</i> and he will not be able to <i>urinate.</i> His stomach will collapse and will be broken, like a jug at the well.<sup class="footnote-marker">169</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 12:5.</i>
“<i>And the dust returns</i>” [12:7]. The person dies and comes to the earth and the soul goes to God, who gave it. Therefore, reflect in time.<sup class="footnote-marker">170</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 12:7.</i>
“<i>And more</i>” [12:9]. And more wisdom than Kohelet wrote in the <i>book of Ecclesiastes.</i> He was a very wise man who taught the people wisdom and he made ears for the Torah, just like one makes ears [handles] for a vessel. This means that <i>King Solomon</i> caused Israel to make an <i>eruv</i> for the Sabbath, in the expectation that they should properly observe the Sabbath. He also caused that Israel must wash their hands every time before eating and before praying.<sup class="footnote-marker">171</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 12:9.</i>
“<i>Wanted</i>” [12:10]. <i>King Solomon</i> gave his heart to know all things and understand everything. That is, he knew all the laws that <i>Moses our Teacher, of blessed memory</i>, taught on Mount <i>Sinai</i> and also understood the <i>written Torah.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">172</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 12:10.</i>
“<i>The words</i>” [12:11]. He knew what the rabbis in the Talmud made as a fence for the Torah. The same fence leads the person on the right path, just like a goad that leads the oxen in plowing the correct path in the fields. The same words are so just and strong like something that has been attached with large nails or like something that is rooted. They were all given by one shepherd, that is Moses, from the Holy One.<sup class="footnote-marker">173</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 12:11.</i>
“<i>And more</i>” [12:12]. Much more of the Lord’s words are written in books. Furthermore, be warned to observe what the rabbis say orally. If you want to ask if these same words of the rabbis are good to observe, why were they not written down? The explanation is that making books has no end, if one would write everything. When the person wants to give his heart to study larger chunks of Torah, more than the heart can attain, then the person will become tired. He will not attain it and will not be able to study much. If the person wants to say: because I cannot study everything I will not start to study. Therefore, the following verse says, “<i>The end of the matter, all has been heard</i>” [12:13]. This means that everything can be heard. That is, you should listen to the whole Torah, even if you won’t be able to understand everything, so that you hear it and fear God. Have your heart to God and observe his commandments. The Torah was created so that the person should study Torah.<sup class="footnote-marker">174</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 12:12–13.</i>
“<i>Since everything</i>” [12:14]. All the deeds that the person does come before the Holy One for judgment, even if a person does not sin willingly, even if he fulfills a commandment and stumbles because of it. When he gives charity to the pauper and gives it publicly in front of people, he will also be punished for this.<sup class="footnote-marker">175</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ecclesiastes, 12:14.</i>
“<i>The end of the matter, all having been heard, etc.</i>” [12:13].

Megillat Esther



Chapter 1

“<i>And it was in the days of Ahasuerus</i>” [1:1]. And it was in the days of Ahasuerus. The sages say that wherever it says “<i>and it was</i>” refers to a trouble that occurred in the world and it also affected Israel,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Megillah,</i> 10b.</i> since <i>Ahasuerus</i> was a great evildoer all his days.
“<i>Who ruled</i>” [1:1]. He made himself a king and killed many ministers. He was not born of a king.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Esther, 1:1.</i> He was the ruler of one hundred and twenty-seven lands, just like he was the king of <i>Hodu and Kush</i>, which were next to each other.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Megillah,</i> 11a.</i> Ahasuerus was worthy to be the king of one hundred and twenty-seven lands because he took Esther as his wife. She was a descendant of Sarah who lived one hundred and twenty-seven years.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Esther Rabbah,</i> 1.8.</i> Here one asks a question. They were supposed to suppress the book of Esther and not read it and they were supposed to make a memorial for the miracle that the Holy One saved us. However, at <i>Hanukkah</i> we do not read a scroll. The answer is that on <i>Hanukkah</i> we saw publicly that a few Jews killed many thousands of the enemy. Therefore, there is no need to read a scroll. However, concerning Ahasuerus, people would say that there was no miracle, but Ahasuerus loved Esther very much. Therefore, he killed many Amalekites because Esther asked him to do it. People would say that Ahasuerus was crazy and a fool and that is why he killed many Amalekites. Therefore, the sages ordained that the Scroll should be read. It is written that <i>Vashti</i> was descended from a great king, <i>king Nebuchadnezzar.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Megillah,</i> 10b.</i> Also, he was not flattering anyone when he allowed <i>Vashti</i> to be killed even though he loved her. Therefore, one can see that he did not do an injustice out of love for his wives. Rather, the Holy One made a miracle and caused him to kill many of the Amalekites.
“<i>In those days, when Ahasuerus ruled</i>” [1:2]. The verse teaches us that the Holy One did a favor and caused Ahasuerus to live in the city of Shushan where <i>Esther</i> and <i>Mordecai</i> lived. Previously, all the kings lived in <i>Babylon</i>, but now Ahasuerus and all of his ministers lived in the city of <i>Shushan</i>, awaiting that <i>Mordecai and Esther</i> should be near the king to protect [Israel] in their time of trouble.
“<i>For all of his ministers and servants</i>” [1:3]. Here one asks a question. Why does it say that he made a banquet for his servants and afterwards its says, “<i>and the ministers of the government</i>” to the ministers? Was it was correct that one should first write about the servants and then the ministers? The explanation is that the ordinary servants whom Ahasuerus had for a long time before he became a king, and he considered them more important than the ministers who had been ministers for a long time and had served other kings.
“<i>One hundred and eighty days</i>” [1:4]. He made banquets and displayed his great wealth for one hundred and eighty days. Here one asks a question. Why did he not simply say six months? He might have shown his treasures, but one hundred and eighty days is six months, as he later says concerning the clothing of the women was six months.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Esther, 2:12.</i> The reason is, that this teaches us that for one hundred and eighty days he showed different treasures and novelties every day.
“<i>Both great and small</i>” [1:5]. Here one asks a question. Why does it say that he made a banquet for the great and important people and later for the simple ordinary people? Concerning <i>Lot</i> it is written, “<i>both small and great</i>” [Genesis 19:11], the small first and then the great. The reason is, Ahasuerus wanted to do what was correct for each person and it is correct that the most senior and important should be honored first at the banquet.
The <i>Yalkut</i> writes, “<i>he displayed</i>” [1:4], that he donned the garments of the <i>High Priest</i> and sat at the banquet, allowing his treasures to be displayed.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Megillah,</i> 12a.</i> The Jews saw the vessels from the Temple and the Jews began to cry and wanted to leave. Ahasuerus said that a separate place should be prepared for them so that they would not see the vessels. <i>Ahasuerus found that Nebuchadnezzar</i> had hidden great treasures in the ground.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Esther, <i>Remez,</i> 1047.</i>
“<i>Fine white cotton hangings</i>” [1:6]. He placed the people in a garden where there were golden and silver couches and the ground was covered with <i>precious stones.</i> One asks, why were there no <i>musicians</i> at the banquet? The answer is that <i>Ahasuerus</i> provided each person with their desires. If one wanted trumpets, then another wanted violins, etc. Therefore, no musicians were brought.
“<i>And they gave them to drink in golden vessels and the vessels were diverse</i>” [1:7]. That is to say, the vessels of Ahasuerus were changed in comparison to the vessels of the Temple.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">According to <i>Targum Rishon</i> to Esther 1:7, the other vessels at the banquet changed their appearance to the likeness of lead in the presence of the vessels from the Temple.</i> Another explanation is that as soon as someone finished drinking, the vessel was lifted and he was given another vessel from the treas- ury.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni,</i> Esther, <i>Remez</i>, 1048.</i> This was done for everyone. Another explanation, the vessels were changed with all sorts of sweet and strong wine.
“<i>The drinking was according to the law</i>” [1:8]. The drink was what was proper from the Torah, more food than drink. Each person was given wine according to his age. He was given wine as old as he was. Each person was also given wine from the country of his birth and that he was accustomed to drink.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Megillah,</i> 12a.</i>
“<i>No compulsion</i>” [1:8]. Rabbi Levi says that the custom in the land of <i>Persia</i> was that when someone made a banquet, one was given a vessel containing forty measures. Each one must finish drinking it, even if he died. The vessel was called <i>suskah</i> and the ministers gave large bribes that they should not be given that vessel. However, at the <i>banquet of Ahasuerus</i> that vessel was not brought out. That is why it is written, “<i>no compulsion.</i>” No person was compelled. <sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Esther, <i>Remez,</i> 1048.</i> Another explanation is that <i>Ahasuerus</i> commanded that no Jew be given wine offered as a libation,<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Esther Rabbah,</i> 2.13.</i> since if he will be compelled then the Jew will have no alternative. Therefore, let him drink wine offered as a libation willingly and he will commit a sin and he will be punished for it. Another explanation is, since there were many vessels on the table, so nobody needed to be compelled to drink. That is to say, to continue drinking so that the other person will also drink.
“<i>According to each person</i>’<i>s wishes</i>” [1:8]. Ahasuerus wanted to fulfill the desires of <i>Mordecai</i> and <i>Haman.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Megillah,</i> 12a.</i> The Holy One said, you evildoer, one of them must be hanged and the other will become mighty and important. You will not be able to do the will of each one. However, the <i>Holy One</i> does His will for each person, his creature.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Esther, <i>Remez,</i> 1048.</i>
“<i>The royal house</i>” [1:9]. Queen,Vashti made a banquet for the women in decorated chambers. <i>Rabbi Abin</i> said: they much preferred the beautiful paintings and jewelry rather than good food and drink, since women desire only beautiful objects.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Esther Rabbah,</i> 3.10.</i>
“<i>On the seventh day</i>” [1:10]. When the seventh day came, the king was in good spirits and the ministers started boasting to one another. Each one said, I have a beautiful wife. The <i>fool Ahasuerus</i> came and said, your wives are nothing compared to my wife when it comes to beauty. You should not think that because she is wearing beautiful clothes and she is a queen, is why she is beautiful. The ministers said, let her come naked, without clothes, then we will see if she is beautiful. Immediately, Ahasuerus said that <i>Vashti</i> should be brought naked, but she should wear her crown.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Esther, <i>Remez,</i> 1049.</i> <i>Rabbi Abba</i> said: the seventh day was the Sabbath when Vashti was brought naked and she was killed on the Sabbath. This is because she took Jewish daughters on the Sabbath and they had to spin on the Sabbath, naked.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Megillah,</i> 12b.</i>
“<i>And the queen refused</i>” [1:12]. Vashti did not want to come. <i>Rabbi Yose</i> said: she became leprous and she was ashamed. Some sages say that the <i>angel Gabriel</i> came and gave her a tail on her forehead.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Megillah,</i> 12b.</i> One asks a question. Scripture says, “<i>to display her beauty to the people and the ministers</i>” [1:11]. Why did they first show the queen to the ordinary people and afterwards the ministers? The answer is that the ordinary people were at the end of the table and thus they would see the queen first, before the ministers. Another explanation is that one should show the ordinary people the crown, which is something they desired, but to see <i>precious stones</i> and gold that shines. Therefore, it is written, “<i>with the royal crown to show the people</i>” [1:11], and afterwards it is written “<i>and the ministers her beauty</i>” [1:11]. That is, the ministers were not interested in seeing the crown, but would rather see the beauty of the queen.
One asks a question. Why is it written, “<i>to bring Vashti the queen</i>” [1:11]? It says Vashti first and afterwards queen. In the next verse it says, “<i>and the queen Vashti refused</i>” [1:12]. The explanation is that the queen responded to the king, I am a queen without you. I am a queen because my father was a king.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Megillah,</i> 10b.</i> Thus, I was a queen even without you. Therefore, don’t command me too much. She also said, you fool, perhaps other wives are more beautiful than me and you will be a liar. If I am more beautiful, the ministers will kill you and take me as a wife.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Esther Rabbah,</i> 3.14.</i>
And the king laid the judgment before the ministers and said, “<i>what shall be done to the queen Vashti, according to the law?</i>” [1:15]. The king was ashamed that she should be killed. Therefore, he said, “<i>with queen Vashti</i>” [1:15]. That is to say, she was a queen before she became my wife.
“<i>Memucan said</i>” [1:16]. <i>Haman</i> said. This was <i>Memucan</i> who was prepared for all troubles.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Megillah,</i> 12b.</i> Haman said, not only did Vashti disgrace the king, but it is not right for the ministers. Their wives will also not do what their husbands will tell them to do, just like the queen did to the king. Therefore, it should be written in the annals of the <i>Persians and Medes</i> that the queen did not want to come and her throne should be given to another woman. That is to say, he said, “<i>to another who is better than her</i>” [1:19]. This means, a woman should be selected who is good in her own right, who is not noble and is not descended from a king. A woman who has a noble pedigree considers herself important and does not take care of her husband. Therefore, he says, “<i>better than her</i>” [1:19], she who is good in her own right.
“<i>So that every man will rule in his own house</i>” [1:22]. He wrote letters to all the lands that each man should rule in his house and the wife should not have dominion over her husband, so that what happened to Vashti should not happen to her.
“<i>And should speak the language of his own people</i>” [1:22]. The wife should speak the same language as the husband speaks.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Esther, <i>Remez</i> 1051.</i> 

Chapter 2

When the anger of the king subsided, he thought about his wife Vashti, and that she had been killed and he longed for her. “<i>Beautiful young virgins</i>” [2:2]. The youths who served the king said that he should choose beautiful maidens for a wife. Here one asks a question. It is obvious that he will choose beautiful ones. The explanation is that the servants said that he should choose a maiden who is beautiful, but who is not descended from a king. They are arrogant and therefore they said, only search for a beautiful maiden. One asks another question. It says, “<i>virgins</i>” [2:2], and then it says, “<i>they assembled all the virgins</i>” [2:3]. The explanation is that they appointed <i>officials</i> in all the lands. Each <i>official</i> chose all the beautiful maidens in his land and after he had chosen them, he took them from his land and brought them to <i>Shushan.</i> So it was done in the one hundred and twenty-seven lands.
One asks another question. Why did the servants have to say that they should be given clothes and put in the care of <i>Hege?</i> The explanation is that the servants said that none of the maidens should keep their own clothes. They often wear the wrong colors. Similarly, when a person is not pretty and thinks that they are pretty. Therefore, let <i>Hege</i> supervise which colors she will wear. Another question is asked. They say that the maiden that will be pleasing will become the queen. Everyone knows this. The explanation is that one should not look for <i>ancestry</i>, but the one whose beauty will please the king should become the queen. Here one asks another question. They say that the maiden should be instead of <i>Queen Vashti.</i> Everyone knows very well that she will be instead of Vashti. The explanation is, if the maiden will be acceptable to the king, yet she should not be crowned, but she should be in place of Vashti. That is to say, just as if Vashti was still alive and the maiden is queen in her place, expecting that she should not be arrogant when the crown is placed on her, since the greatest arrogance is among women. They don’t even respect the king.
“<i>He was foster-father to Hadassah, that is, Esther</i>” [2:7]. <i>Mordecai</i> raised <i>Esther.</i> She was an orphan; her father and mother had died. Mordecai was her uncle and Mordecai named her Esther. Her name was originally <i>Hadassah</i>, which is a Jewish name. Mordecai was afraid that <i>Ahasuerus</i> would discover that she was of Jewish descent. Therefore, he named her Esther, which was the same in their language as Hadassah. Here one asks a question. It says that she had no father and mother and immediately says that she was beautiful and afterwards again begins that her father and mother died and Mordecai took her as a daughter. The explanation is that Scripture tells us that Mordecai was a righteous man who did not touch the maiden Esther. Therefore, Scripture says that the maiden was very beautiful and that her father and mother died. Then Mordecai took her as a daughter. That is to say, the practice is that when a person raises an orphan in his house, it is very nice that later one has no Evil Inclination to have relations with her. When someone lives with one when they are young, then it is despicable and his Evil Inclination does not exist for that person. Therefore, Scripture says here that the maiden Esther was very beautiful before she came to Mordecai.
“<i>He was foster-father to Hadassah</i>” [2:7]. The <i>Yalkut in the portion on Noah</i> said: <i>Esther</i> was very young and <i>Mordecai</i> sought someone to nurse Esther, but he could not find any woman. Mordecai took his own breast and gave it to Esther to nurse and raised her with his milk.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Noah, <i>Remez,</i> 49.</i> The Evil Inclination used to be within the same person. When the maiden came into the house, he considered her a daughter. That is to say, Mordecai had no Evil Inclination to Esther.
“<i>Esther was taken to the royal palace</i>” [2:8]. One can ask about the verse. Why does it need to say that many maidens were taken to Shushan? Esther was taken under the supervision of <i>Hege.</i> We know very well that many maidens were taken. The explanation is that the Scroll shows us that Esther had hidden herself, so that she should not be taken to the king. However, they heard that all the beautiful maidens should be brought and none should be left out. Esther was afraid and therefore it says in Scripture, “<i>and Esther was taken</i>” [2:8]. She was forcibly taken to the house of Hege.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Esther, <i>Remez,</i> 1053.</i>
“<i>The girl pleased him</i>” [2:9]. The maid Esther pleased Hege. He said that she would certainly become a queen. Therefore, Hege immediately gave Esther clothes and gave her seven maidens as servants. These were all Jewish maidens. One was named Sunday, the next one Monday, through the whole week. The seventh one was called Sabbath. As was the name of the maiden was, so she served on that day. As a result, she would know when the Sabbath was, since she was among gentiles in the royal house.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Megillah,</i> 13a.</i>
“<i>Walked in front of the court of the women</i>” [2:11]. Mordecai walked in front of the house of the women every day to see that all was well with Esther. One asks a question here. Why should all not be well for Esther in the house of Hege? One asks another question. Why did Mordecai forbid Esther to divulge her people of origin? The explanation that Mordecai walked every day before the house of <i>Hege</i> is because he wanted to learn if <i>anyone had informed on Esther</i> that she had been in hiding. If the king would learn of this, he might become angry. That is why Mordecai forbade her to say from which people she came, so that the king should have no anger against Israel because she hid herself and that he should not say that the Jews taught her this. She was descended from King Saul and therefore she considered herself to be important.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Numbers Rabbah,</i> 14.8.</i>
“<i>When the maiden</i>’<i>s turn came</i>” [2:12]. One can ask about this verse. Why does it have to say that each maiden was taken to the king after twelve months? The explanation is that each maiden was prepared for twelve months and she was given good perfume and soap to wash so that her body would be pure for the king. However, the pious Esther did not allow herself to be persuaded in twelve months and she remained silent.
“<i>Whatever she asked for would be given to her</i>” [2:13]. The custom was that when a maiden was taken from the house of <i>Hege</i> to sleep with the king, the maiden asked that she should be given presents from the many expensive shops that were between the house of Hege and the house of the king, the maiden was given everything that she asked for. However, Esther did not ask for anything from these shops, but <i>Hege said to Esther</i>, whatever you want will be provided to you. Each maiden was brought that night to the <i>king</i> and early the next morning she was taken to the house of <i>Shaashgaz</i>, the guardian of the women. They never came to the king unless he called them. Scripture lets us know the miracle that as soon as the king had Esther with him for one night, he did not allow her to be taken from his house and kept her with him. Even though there were still many beautiful maidens with <i>Hege.</i> They were all <i>virgins</i> and perhaps there were maidens who were more beautiful than <i>Esther.</i> The <i>kings</i> used to take <i>virgins</i>, even if they already had wives. However, the <i>Holy One gave a grace to Ahasuerus</i> that he loved Esther so that he did not want any other wife, except for <i>Esther. Esther was taken to the king</i> in the month of Tevet, when it is so cold that two people warm each other in one bed and Ahasuerus would love Esther even this time.
“<i>And the king loved Esther</i>” [2:17]. Ahasuerus loved Esther more than all the wives who were not virgins and also loved her more than the virgins. Ahasuerus put the crown on Esther despite the advice that the crown should not be put on anyone. However, the king loved Esther so much that the king put the crown on her. The king made a great banquet for Esther so that she should tell him from which people she had descended. He suspended all the <i>taxes</i> from the people from the great joy and love he had for Esther and gave presents to the ministers. However, Ahasuerus did not suspend the taxes of the Jews and they had to pay <i>taxes.</i> The Holy One did this for the benefit of the Jews. Since the Jews paid <i>taxes</i> to the king, Haman had to tell the king that he would give ten thousand hundredweights of silver for the Jews. However, in order to destroy the Amalekites, Mordecai did not need to give the king taxes since the king had suspended them for all the nations.
“<i>When the virgins were assembled a second time</i>” [2:19]. One can ask about this verse, why did they assemble the maidens again? One can further ask, what is the relation between assembling the maidens and Mordecai sitting in the gate. The explanation is that Mordecai sat in the gate because there he would learn whether something disgraceful would happen to Esther because she had hidden herself and she had not wanted to reveal her family. All the maidens were assembled the second time and the king wanted to send the maidens to their homes. He did not desire anyone but Esther, whom he crowned and wanted to keep her as a wife.
“<i>Bigthan and Teresh became angry</i>” [2:21]. Two of the king’s ministers who were in his chamber became angry. They said: since the <i>king</i> took <i>Esther</i> we have no rest. He loves her and has much sex with her. The king becomes very thirsty from the sex, since this makes a person thirsty. They said that they wanted to <i>poison</i> the king. We cannot sleep at night; we must always give the king to drink.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Megillah,</i> 13b.</i> Another explanation is that these two ministers always stood at the threshold of the king’s door and Mordecai always sat in the gate. The two ministers said: the Jew Mordecai sits and we must always stand. Therefore, they wanted to <i>poison</i> the king. Mordecai understood their language and told Esther that the two ministers wanted to <i>poison</i> the king. Esther went and told the king how Mordecai had understood the language of the ministers and how they want- ed to poison the king. It was investigated and it was true. The two <i>ministers</i> were hanged and it was written in the king’s <i>chronicle</i> that Mordecai had protected the king from death.

Chapter 3

“<i>After these things</i>” [3:1]. The anger of the king subsided and Ahasuerus raised up and ennobled Haman above all of his ministers. The Holy One sends the cure before the malady.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Megillah,</i> 13b.</i> That is to say, it was first inscribed that Mordecai had protected the king from death and only afterwards did Haman become important. Mordecai would protect <i>all of Israel</i> with his informing about the ministers who wanted to <i>poison</i> the king. The Holy One first makes an evildoer important and then He kills him and he disappears from the world. It is a parable. A donkey, a horse and a pig belonged to one owner. The donkey said to the horse: we work day and night and get little to eat. The pig does not work at all and he gets fed much good food. The horse answered him: you are a fool. As soon as Christmas or Easter will come, the pig will be killed. That is why they give him much to eat. It was the same with Haman as with the pig. He was made important and he will soon be killed.
“<i>All the king</i>’<i>s servants who were in the king</i>’<i>s gate bowed down</i>” [3:2]. All the servants bowed down to Haman, but Mordecai did not want to bow down. He had an image over his heart.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Esther Rabbah,</i> 6.2.</i> Mordecai said that Haman was a servant in the war and Mordecai had lent him bread and money.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Megillah,</i> 15b.</i> He wrote a letter about himself and Mordecai showed the servants that letter. Therefore, Mordecai did not want to bow down to Haman and was angry with Haman. He thought: it is a disgrace that I should allow one Jew to be killed. I will kill all the Jews at one time. That is why Haman conspired against all the Jews.
“<i>And Haman saw that Mordecai did not bow down or kneel to him</i>” [3:5]. One asks a question here. Why does the verse have to say, “<i>bow down to him</i>”? The explanation is that Mordecai bowed slightly, but to the side and not directly to Haman, because he was afraid of all the other <i>ministers</i> who did bow. Haman noticed this, that he did not bow to him and that is why he was angry.
“<i>Pur, which means lot was cast</i>” [3:7]. He cast a <i>lot</i> for which <i>month</i> he should kill the Jews. The <i>lot fell on the month of Adar.</i> He said: in the month that <i>Moses our Teacher</i> died, the Jews will have no luck. However, he did not know that <i>Moses our Teacher</i> was also born in <i>Adar.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Megillah,</i> 13b.</i>
“<i>Haman said to King Ahasuerus: there is one nation scattered</i>” [3:8]. One asks a question about this verse. What is the meaning of dispersed and afterwards he again says that they are separated among the nations? The explanation is that Haman was afraid to speak to the king about destroying one of his nations, since it is an honor for the king when he rules many nations. Therefore, Haman says to the king, it is a dispersed nation and they are not considered a nation. If you want to think that because they are dispersed among other nations so that they would have intermarried with other nations and the other nations will not allow <i>Israel</i> to be destroyed. Therefore, Haman says that they have separated themselves from other nations. They do not <i>intermarry</i> with other nations and they do not even eat or drink with other nations.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Megillah,</i> 13b.</i> They have many more and different <i>holidays</i> than other nations. The Holy One said: you evildoer, you complain about their holidays, that they have too many and spend their money on food and drink for them. I will command another <i>holiday</i> for them that will be called <i>Purim</i>, when you will be hanged. They will be happy and will have to eat and drink for two consecutive days every day, forever. Also, when all other <i>holidays</i> will be <i>abrogated</i> in the days of the <i>Messiah</i>, <i>Purim</i> will remain forever.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Proverbs, <i>Remez,</i> 944.</i>
“<i>Be written for their destruction</i>” [3:9]. The king said that he would allow the people to be destroyed. One asks a question here. Why does he not say that they should be killed? The explanation is that Haman said that he did not want to speak directly about killing them, but he wanted to talk about destroying them. That is to say, as if they only wanted to expel them from the lands of the king, in the expectation that the king will say, you should destroy them. However, Haman thought that when they would write, to destroy, I would say that this means they should be killed.
“<i>To do with as you see fit</i>” [3:11]. The king said to Haman. The silver has been given to you; do what you would like with the people. That is to say, Ahasuerus answered Haman. You desired to destroy them. This can be understood in two ways, to kill and to destroy. You can do what you want.
“<i>And they summoned the king</i>’<i>s scribes</i>” [3:12]. They summoned the king’s scribes to write a letter for each minister, a letter with the king’s seal, to destroy the Jews. No minister should tell the others any more, since there were many Jews who had many ministers as customers. They would bribe the king. Therefore, the verse said, “<i>to the king</i>’<i>s satraps, to the governors and to the officials of every people</i>” [3:12]. The verse said “<i>to</i>” concerning each one. That is to say, separately, to each official. However, when the king himself wrote a letter, he wrote to all the officials publicly. When Mordecai did this, he wrote one letter to all the officials that they should destroy the Amalekites. Therefore, the word “<i>to</i>” was not written for each official.
“<i>To be ready for that day</i>” [3:14]. Haman wrote public letters to all the nations that they should be ready for one nation, but he did not let them know which nation. He also did not let them know if they should be ready to kill, but only that they should be ready for that day. He expected that the Jews would not promise any bribes, since they did not know of any evil against them.
“<i>And the city of Shushan was confused</i>” [3:15]. The city of <i>Shushan</i> was confused, full of rumors, since one did not know what the messengers meant. It was a complete secret.

Chapter 4

“<i>And Mordecai knew</i>” [4:1]. The <i>prophet Elijah</i> came to <i>Mordecai</i> and told him the secret that it was inscribed in Heaven to destroy all the Jews, <i>heaven forbid.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Targum Rishon,</i> Esther 4:1.</i> Mordecai asked if it was sealed with glue. <i>Elijah the prophet</i> responded that it was indeed sealed with glue. Therefore, do penance and the Holy One will tear up his signature.
“<i>And he cried out loudly and bitterly</i>” [4:1]. Mordecai tore his clothes and let out a great and bitter outcry. That is, two sorts of outcry, one of misfortune, to destroy, <i>heaven forbid, all of Israel</i>, and the second was that the misfortune had come because of him, that he did not bow down to Haman.
“<i>And he came to the front of the king</i>’<i>s gate</i>” [4:2]. Mordecai came in sackcloth until the gate of the king. One is not allowed to go further in the king’s gate. One asks a question. Why did he have to wear sackcloth to tell Esther? He knew very well that he was not allowed to come into the gate of the king in sackcloth. The explanation is that Mordecai did not want to take off his sackcloth in the expectation that he would repent beforehand and a person should know about it. Also, he did not want that Esther should give <i>bribes</i>, but it is correct to first repent and then one should bribe and give presents.
“<i>Where it reached, there was great mourning among the Jews</i>” [4:3]. The ministers told the secret to some Jews, that in the letter it was written to kill the Jews. The Jews became very mournful and started fasting and repenting. They lay on the earth and in ashes.
“<i>The queen was agitated</i>” [4:4]. Esther’s maidens saw that Mordecai was wearing sackcloth. They told this to Esther and Esther was very frightened. Esther sent clothes to Mordecai that he should don them. One asks a question. What did Esther think? If Mordecai wanted to don clothes, he had clothes without her clothes. Here one asks another question. Esther said: take off your sackcloth and put on clothes. It is obvious that if he would put on clothes, he would take off the sackcloth. The answer is that Esther said to Mordecai. Indeed, you have two sackcloth’s, one is on your body and the other is on the outside. Therefore, remove the outer sackcloth and keep the sackcloth next to your body. Put the clothes on over that sackcloth, in the expectation that you will be able to go in to the king’s gate to visit me. However, Mordecai did not want to do it. He thought: I must repent with the sackcloth on me. Therefore it says, “<i>to take off the sackcloth</i>” [4:4]. That is to say, to take off the outer sackcloth. Mordecai did not want to take off the sackcloth and did not explain why. She sent “<i>Hathach</i>” [4:5]. This is “<i>Daniel</i>” who served Esther.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Megillah,</i> 15a.</i> Esther said: this <i>Daniel</i> can be trusted with a secret. Therefore, go to Mordecai and let him tell you the secret.
“<i>To know the why and wherefore of this</i>” [4:5]. Esther was a queen and therefore she was ashamed that she had to learn the secret from Mordecai. Therefore, she said to <i>Daniel</i>, go and stand near Mordecai and become aware what he is saying and whether he is talking about the secret. That is why it says in Scripture, “<i>to know what this</i>” [4:5]. That is to say, to become aware what is the secret. “<i>To tell her</i>” is not written, that he should tell her and that is why it is written “<i>what is this and what is this</i>” twice. That is to say, he became aware of what the trouble was and from whom the troubles originated.
“<i>And Mordecai told him all that had happened to him</i>” [4:7]. Here one asks a question about the verse. Why does Mordecai say, what happened to him? What happened to him more than to all of Israel? The explanation is that Mordecai says that the troubles come from me, because I did not bow down to Haman. He let him tell Esther that Haman wrote the letter with the secret to destroy <i>all of Israel, heaven forbid.</i> That is why I also ask you to go to the king to plead for Israel.
Here one asks a question. How is it that such a <i>pious woman</i> should have to be asked and would not go of her own accord. The explanation is that Esther did not want to go on her own accord since it is a sin that she should go to a gentile because Ahasuerus would then sleep with her. Therefore, Mordecai said: I permit it, just like a rabbi that you should go to Ahasuerus and plead for Israel. Esther said: I have not been called in thirty days. That is to say, the king also observes that he does not sleep with a woman when she is <i>menstruating</i> [<i>niddah</i>] and it is thirty days from the time that the king would call me. Therefore, Esther wanted to wait. Esther said to Mordecai: it is written in the book of the king that, whoever comes to the king unbidden, will be killed. Mordecai said to Esther: do not think that you will escape death more than all the <i>Jews.</i> One asks a question here. Is it possible that <i>Esther</i> would let herself be <i>afraid</i> of going to the <i>king</i> and she did not go because of fear? The explanation is that <i>Esther said to Mordecai.</i> You say to me that I should go to the <i>king</i> and I should commit a <i>sin</i> for the sake of <i>Israel? Mordecai responded: you Esther</i> are mistaken. It is also a <i>danger</i> for you and therefore, you are allowed to commit a sin for your own sake, to go to the king. Mordecai said to Esther: who knows if you will be a queen in a year? Therefore, don’t delay and go to the king before you are called.
“<i>Go, assemble all the Jews</i>” [4:16]. Esther said: call together all the Jews in Shushan and they should fast for me. That is to say, for the sin that I will commit by going to the king and sleeping with him.
“<i>Do not eat and drink</i>” [4:16]. One asks a question here. When she said that they should fast, why did she have to say that they should not eat or drink? The explanation is that Esther said: I should not punish my body by walking barefoot, or not bathing or not anointing myself with oil,<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">These are activities normally forbidden on fast days, in addition to not eating and drinking.</i> because I am a queen. However, my maidens and I must fast and not eat or drink. Therefore, you should also fast in this way, in the expectation that all fasts should be equal. Therefore, Scripture says; “<i>I and my maidens will observe the same fast</i>” [4:16].
“<i>Though it is contrary to the law</i>” [4:16]. Esther said: I will come to the king even if I will immediately commit a sin against the Torah. Esther also said: I will go to the king even if it is not lawful. That is to say, how is it that a queen should go before the king and should fast and abuse her body? One used to adorn oneself beautifully for the king.
“<i>And Mordecai went about</i>” [4:17]. <i>Mordecai fasted on Passover</i>, since this incident occurred on Passover and though it was a <i>festival</i>, yet he still fasted, even if he transgressed the Torah.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Megillah,</i> 15a; <i>Esther Rabbah,</i> 8.6.</i>

Chapter 5

“<i>And Esther donned royal apparel</i>” [5:1]. Here one asks a question. Why does it have to say that she put on clothes? It is obvious that when she would go to the king, she would put on royal garments. The answer is that Esther did not put on makeup, as is customary for women. However, she had to put on royal garments for the sake of the king. Otherwise, Esther would have worn sackcloth. Esther first donned the royal garments when she came to the court of the king.
“<i>As soon as the king saw Queen Esther standing in the court, she won his favor</i>” [5:2]. One asks a question here. Why did the verse have to say that she stood in the court? One knows this very well that she stood in the court. Furthermore, why did it say that she found <i>favor</i> in the <i>king</i>’<i>s eyes?</i> It is obvious that she had <i>favor.</i> In addition, why did it have to say that the scepter was in the hand of the king? The explanation is that even though Esther did not put on makeup and had fasted; yet she still found favor in the <i>eyes of the king.</i> That she stood in the court, the Holy One caused that she should have <i>favor</i>, since when she came closer one could see that Esther was pale and yellow from fasting. The Holy One made another miracle. The custom was that the king never had the scepter in his hand except when he was going somewhere. However, here the Holy One made a miracle and caused that the scepter was in the king’s hand, waiting that the king should extend it to Esther. He said to Esther: what do you desire, I will give you even half the kingdom. That is to say, I cannot let you build the <i>Temple</i> that stands in half of my kingdom.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Megillah,</i> 15b.</i>
“<i>Let your Majesty and Haman come to the banquet</i>” [5:4]. Esther said to the king: I invite you and Haman to the banquet today. Our sages say: in the expectation that the other ministers would envy Haman and hate him. Another explanation is that Esther thought, since I will have only invited Haman with the king, the <i>king might suspect</i> that <i>Haman is having an adulterous affair</i> and will have both Haman and me killed. I desire that Haman should also be killed and perhaps Israel will have some rest from Haman.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Megillah,</i> 15b.</i> One asks a question. Why does it not say at the first invitation to the banquet that Esther should say to the king, if I have found favor in your eyes, come to the banquet? The second time that Esther invited them it is written, if I have found favor in your eyes, come to the banquet. The explanation is that Esther was alone with the king at the first invitation. Therefore, she did not say, if I have found favor in your eyes, since she did not want to arouse his inclination so that he should not sleep with her. At the second invitation, Esther was at the banquet and Haman and other ministers were also present. That is why Esther invited him with, if I have found favor in your eyes, come tomorrow to the banquet with Haman. She was not afraid that the king would become aroused, since there were other people at the banquet. One asks another question. Why did Esther not say about Haman at the banquet that he wanted to destroy Israel? The explanation is that Esther thought to herself. I must get the king drunk in the hope that he will become angry with Haman. When a person is drunk, his anger is greater. At the first banquet Esther was fasting and said to the king, tomorrow I will drink with you at the next banquet. At the same time, I want to increase my desire and when Esther will also drink she will be able to speak to the king so that he will drink more and become drunk.
“<i>And the king said, tell Haman to hurry</i>” [5:5]. One asks a question. Why was Esther in such a hurry and Ahasuerus was also in a hurry? The explanation is that Esther rushed with the banquet so that the king would not be able to sleep with her, because the banquet would be early. Ahasuerus was in a rush because he wanted to finish with the banquet in the hope that he would be able to sleep with her. The king said at the banquet to Esther, what is your desire? If it is possible, it will be given to you immediately. What is your request? It will be fulfilled as soon as possible.
“<i>Esther replied, my wish and my request</i>” [5:7]. Here one asks a question. It does not say what Esther requested. The explanation is that Esther said to the king. I desire two things that you allowed me to ask. One request concerns my body and one request is to protect my people. Esther invited the king and Haman to the banquet the next day. Haman left the banquet happy and he saw Mordecai sitting. His happiness left him and he became angry with Mordecai. Here one asks a question. Why did the verse have to say that he left that day happy, and that is why he became angry? The explanation is that Haman feared Mordecai because he had raised Esther. Perhaps he will protect all of Israel. Esther will help to plead for Israel to the king. However, the day that he saw Esther had invited Haman alone and did not invite Mordecai, so Esther did not love Mordecai. Therefore, he was now angry with Mordecai. Haman came to his house and called his whole household and all of his friends and told them about his great wealth. Here one asks a question. Why did Haman now brag to his friends? The explanation is that Haman saw Mordecai sitting and his bile overflowed and he consoled himself with his wealth and he was again happy.
“<i>Esther did not bring</i>” [5:12]. Haman said to his friends. She has invited nobody except for me to the banquet. Here one asks a question. Why does he have to say at length, she has invited nobody except for me? He could have said briefly, the queen invited me to the banquet. The explanation is, Haman said: because Esther invited nobody else except for me and not Mordecai. Therefore, I am not afraid that Mordecai raised Esther. Haman said: I have great anguish when I see Mordecai sitting in the king’s gate and my great wealth does not help me. My bile overflows when I see Mordecai. His wife said: make a gallows fifty cubits high and let Mordecai be hanged tomorrow morning. Here one asks a question. What does it help that it was fifty ells high? Furthermore, why did they not let him be hanged where other people were hanged? The answer is that they wanted to give him some advice that he should become healthy again, because his bile had overflowed. Therefore, they said: if Mordecai would be hanged from the gallows outside the city, Haman would not be cured. He would not see the gallows and he would not have any joy. One could not make a gallows in the city since it would not be approved. All the dead animals must be taken fifty cubits from the city. Therefore, his wife said: make a gallows of fifty cubits and you will be able to see Mordecai wherever you are in the city. Thus, go early in the morning, before the banquet will be ready and let him be hanged. You will see him when you will eat at the banquet and you will leave the banquet happy and you will remain happy when you will see Mordecai hanging.

Chapter 6

“<i>That night, the king could not sleep</i>” [6:1]. The king could not sleep that night. He thought about what was the news that Esther wanted to tell him. What does she need? It is certainly a large request about Mordecai who had raised her. The king remembered that Mordecai had protected the king from death. Therefore, the king ordered that night to search in the book if the king had done something to repay Mordecai for the favor he had done for the king. They found that Mordecai had not been repaid. The king became very frightened. He thought that Esther would ask for a large estate for <i>Mordecai</i>, <i>particularly</i> since he had protected the king from death. It was already dawn and the king asked, who is in the court? Haman was there because he wanted to ask the king that Mordecai should be hanged. His wife’s advice had been that he should go to the king very early, before the banquet, to have Mordecai hanged. The king said: let him come immediately and <i>Haman</i> was brought in. That is to say, they should rush before <i>Esther</i> comes and will want to ask about <i>Mordecai</i> and the favor that he did for the king. Here one asks a question. Did <i>Ahasuerus</i> hate <i>Haman</i> that he sent him out into the streets looking for Mordecai? The answer is that <i>Ahasuerus</i> said to <i>Haman:</i> I love you more than any of my ministers, but we have to pay <i>Mordecai for the favor he did before Esther</i> comes. This is how Ahasuerus thought. Therefore, he would ask Haman: what should be done for a person that the king desires to honor? Haman thought to himself: Whom does the king love more than myself? Haman said that he should ride a horse that the king had ridden. He should be crowned and have the clothes the king had worn at the same time. This should be done to that man. The king said: go immediately and accomplish everything that you said to Mordecai the <i>Jew.</i> Haman said: which Mordecai the Jew? There are many Jews named Mordecai. The king said: the Mordecai who sits in the gate.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Megillah,</i> 16a.</i> You Haman go before Mordecai in the royal clothes and the king’s horse in all the streets and call out: the king wants to honor this man. <i>Ahasuerus</i> said: I do not hate you, but I am afraid of Esther, that she will ask a very great favor for Mordecai. However, if you will go and lead Mordecai in all the streets then Esther will see that Mordecai has great honor done to him and the vizier himself honored him, then she won’t be able to ask any more for Mordecai.
<i>Haman</i> came to <i>Mordecai</i> who was sitting in the <i>house of study</i>, learning and repenting. <i>Haman</i> said to <i>Mordecai:</i> come and put on the king’s clothes. <i>Mordecai</i> said to <i>Haman:</i> I must first go to the <i>bathhouse</i>, to wash my body. It is not correct to wear the king’s clothes with an unclean body. Haman himself had to wash Mordecai in the bathhouse. When he was supposed to get on the horse, Mordecai couldn’t get on the horse. Haman had to bow down and Mordecai stepped on his back and seated himself on the horse, and Haman led the horse. <i>Haman</i> had a daughter who saw <i>Mordecai</i> being led. She thought that Haman was sitting on the horse and he threw a chamber pot with feces on Haman. She thought that she was throwing it on Mordecai’s head. After she saw that she had thrown it on Haman, and besmeared him with the feces. She fell down and broke her neck, out of disgrace. Thus, Haman was a <i>mourner</i> because his daughter was dead, and was embarrassed that he was besmeared.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Megillah,</i> 16a.</i> Esther had seen through the window how Mordecai was being led with great honor and she was happy and praised God.
“<i>And Haman told Zeresh his wife</i>” [6:13]. Haman soon came home and told what happened to him. Here one asks a question. Why did Haman have to tell them, they saw it themselves? The answer is that Haman wanted to comfort his wife and friends and did not say: remember the king has not yet forbidden me to hang Mordecai. I have not yet spoken with the king about it, and I have heard that the king hates Mordecai very much. Therefore, I had to give him a great <i>honor</i> myself to Mordecai, in the expectation that Esther should not ask for more for Mordecai for the favor that he informed the king about the <i>poison.</i> It is because the king loves me very much and values me highly that I had to give this honor myself. If the king had not paid Mordecai, then I might also have had to contribute. However, his sages said to Haman: you will not be able to withstand Mordecai when the Jews begin to have <i>glory</i>, and their <i>glory</i> will be both longer and greater. Haman did not want to return. The king’s <i>messengers</i> arrived and heard some of what they were screaming at each other, that Haman desired to have Mordecai hanged on the gallows. The same messengers went to Haman and told him that he should immediately come to the queen to eat. Thus, the king and Haman came to the <i>banquet</i> that Esther had prepared.
Here one asks a question. Why does it say in Scripture that they came to drink and at the first banquet it does not talk about drinking, but they came to the banquet. The answer is that Esther fasted at the first banquet and she promised the king that she would drink at the second banquet. Therefore, drinking is mentioned at the second <i>banquet.</i> The king said: what is your desire Esther and it will be given to you. One asks a question about this verse. The king said, <i>Queen Esther.</i> He calls her queen and at the first banquet she was not called queen. The answer is that the king was afraid that Esther would ask something great for Mordecai. Therefore, the king said to Esther: why do you find it so hard to ask for something? You are a queen, why be concerned? That is to say, he said: the name, <i>Queen Esther</i>, that you are called refers to you and nobody else. Ahasuerus was still afraid that Esther might still ask for something very great for Mordecai. Esther understood this and said: dear king, I am asking for myself, since when my people are in danger then I am not well and I might die from anguish.

Chapter 7

“<i>Let my life be granted as my wish, and my people as my request</i>” [7:3]. Here one asks a question. Why is it that Esther should plead for herself before she pleaded for all of Israel? One asks another question. Concerning herself she says, a wish, and for all of Israel she says, a request. The answer is that Esther spoke about herself first because the king said that she should only ask about herself, and Esther said, a request for the people. That is, she strongly pleaded for Israel, more than for herself. Therefore she says, I am only asking for myself, but I am requesting strongly for Israel.
“<i>Had we only been sold as bondsmen and bondswomen</i>” [7:4]. Esther said: this Haman told you lies. He has written to destroy Israel. That is to say, as if they should be expelled and not killed. However, his intention was that he wanted to kill <i>all of Israel, heaven forbid.</i> Esther said: had we only been sold as bondsmen and bondswomen, it would not have concerned me.
“<i>Then King Ahasuerus said to Queen Esther, who is he?</i>” [7:5]. One asks a question. Why does it say “<i>and he said</i>” twice in the verse? The answer is that when one says something new before the king, the king tells the vizier that he should tell him the news properly.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Megillah,</i> 16a.</i> Here too, <i>Ahasuerus</i> asked <i>Haman</i> who was the vizier. However, Haman was speechless and could not answer. Therefore, it says a second time “<i>and he said.</i>” That is, Ahasuerus saw that Haman could not respond. <i>Ahasuerus said to Esther:</i> tell me the news and who is it that wants to kill you and your people. Esther said: the evil Haman wants to kill my people and me. Here one asks a question. Why does the verse tell us that Haman was afraid? It is obvious that he would be afraid. The answer is that Haman was very smart. He did not want to defend himself at the table. He thought that the king was very drunk and very angry. Also, it is very difficult to defend oneself before two people, before the king and the queen. Therefore, he would wait until after the banquet and thought that he would defend himself before Esther alone. When he came to defend himself before Esther alone, the <i>king suspected</i> that <i>Haman</i> wanted to sleep with her and he was even angrier with Haman.
“<i>The king in is fury, left the wine feast</i>” [7:7]. Here one asks a question. Why does Scripture have to say, he stood up from the wine? It is obvious that he had drunk wine. The answer is that Scripture shows us that the Holy One protects a righteous person from sins. Esther made a banquet to drink wine offered to foreign gods and promised the king that she would drink wine offered to foreign gods. The Holy One caused that the king was angry and stood up from the banquet and Esther did not have to drink wine offered to <i>foreign gods.</i> One asks a question. With what did Haman want to defend himself? The answer is that Haman wanted to say to Esther: I did not know that you were of Israelite descent. I would not have done anything. Haman wanted to wait until the king left, since he had no answers for the king. Since Esther was Israelite, therefore he did not want to destroy Israel. Haman had prepared everything and he had no intention to allow Israel to live. He only said it to flatter Esther. He wanted to let her live and the king was very angry with Haman that he was flattering him. The king again returned from the garden and Haman had fallen on Esther’s bed. The angel had pushed him.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Megillah,</i> 16a.</i> The king said: you want to violently force yourself on my queen in my house. Haman was embarrassed before the king.
“<i>Harbonah said</i>” [7:9]. <i>Harbonah</i> said to the king: Haman made a gallows on which to hang Mordecai, the good man who protected the king from death. The gallows is standing there and it is fifty cubits high. This was Haman’s downfall that he made the gallows so high that the king could see how it was made. Here one asks a question. How did <i>Harbonah</i> know that the gallows was to hang Mordecai, since Haman and his friends kept it a secret? The answer is that <i>Harbonah</i> was the messenger to call Haman to the banquet. They were taking counsel whether to still hang Mordecai at that time. The friends counseled him not to hang Mordecai, since he had become important after the honor that was done to him with the clothes and the horse. Haman was shouting at his friends that he would immediately hang Mordecai. Harbonah heard this and that is how he could tell the king all of this.
“<i>And they hanged Haman</i>” [7:10]. They hanged Haman on the gallows that he had made for <i>Mordecai</i> and the king gave Haman’s house to Mordecai and to Esther. Mordecai came before the king and Esther told him that he was her relative. Here one asks a question: Why did Scripture have to say, “<i>on that day</i>” [8:1], that is it was given on the same day? The answer is that it teaches us that the Holy One pays each person with the measure of what he does. Haman had commanded that the <i>Jews</i> should be killed, <i>heaven forbid</i>, and their money should be stolen in one day. Thus, the Holy One caused the same to happen to Haman. He was hanged and his house was stolen in one day.

Chapter 8

“<i>The king slipped off his ring</i>” [8:2]. The king took off the ring that Haman had and gave it to Mordecai. That is to say, with that ring the king made Mordecai his vizier. <i>Esther gave Mordecai</i> Haman’s house after he became the vizier.
“<i>Esther spoke again</i>” [8:3]. Esther spoke again and she fell before the king and pleaded with him to prevent the evil <i>decrees of Haman.</i> Here one asks a question. Why did Esther fall and plead, since Haman had already been hanged? The answer is that Esther feared that Ahasuerus would not protect the Jews because he had already given Haman’s house and the ring to Mordecai. Therefore, Esther fell and pleaded before the king. One asks another question. Scripture says, to avert Haman’s evil and it says again, to avert his thoughts. The answer is that Haman wrote the first letter to the <i>ordinary judges and officials</i>, that they should be prepared for a war on the thirteenth day of Adar and did not write with whom the war will be. Haman wrote another letter informing the important ministers that they should be prepared to fight a war against the Jews.
“<i>And the king extended to Esther</i>” [8:4]. The king extended the golden scepter that she should stand up. She stood up from the earth and ceased crying. She asked to abrogate <i>Haman</i>’<i>s decrees.</i> She said: How can I see evil done to my people or eliminate my family? Here one asks a question. Why does she have to say twice, my people and my family? The answer is that <i>Esther</i> said: I am descended from <i>King Saul</i> and when the people are destroyed, then my family is also nothing. That is to say, a king without a people is nothing.
“<i>And the king said: I have given Haman</i>’<i>s house to Esther</i>” [8:7]. <i>Ahasuerus</i> said to <i>Mordecai: Esther</i> is in deep mourning. She thinks that I will not save the people. Therefore, I am telling you that I have given the house of <i>Haman</i> to <i>Esther</i> and Haman was hanged. Thus, all the nations will be afraid; since Mordecai has been become the vizier and the house of Haman had been given to Esther. So all the nations have been warned not to do any evil to Israel. The king said to her: you should write letters to all the ministers that you would like and seal it with the king’s seal. That is, write the chief ministers that it had been written to inform them to destroy the Jews. This was a fraud committed by Haman and that is why he was hanged. However, the other letters that were written to the ordinary people, that they should be ready for a people and did not say which people. One can well understand that it must be a forgery, since that which the king himself commands is public and makes no secret of it. Therefore, one should be prepared to kill the <i>Amalekites.</i> Esther desired that there should be no war. She feared that <i>Jews</i> would also be killed in the war, <i>heaven forbid.</i> However, Ahasuerus said that it couldn’t be otherwise. They must fight since there has been a public announcement that there will be a war, so there must be a war.
“<i>So the king</i>’<i>s scribes were summoned at that time</i>” [8:9]. They called the scribes at the same time, on the twenty-third day of <i>Sivan</i>, to write letters to the Jews and the ministers to kill the Amalekites. Here one asks a question. Why does Scripture have to say that it was at the same time? One asks another question. Why did <i>Mordecai and Esther</i> wait so long to write the letter, from <i>Passover until after Shavuot?</i> The king had told them to write it immediately after Passover. The answer is that it is written, therefore at the same time. That is to say, not the time that Ahasuerus told them to write. Mordecai thought: I must wait until the first messengers that have been sent will arrive. Mordecai sent the same messengers again to say: the first time we carried false letters from Haman, but now we have been sent again, that we should abrogate the first letters and that the Amalekites should be killed. That is why it is written concerning the <i>messengers of Mordecai</i>’<i>s letters</i> that they departed on their way with fright. That is, they were frightened that they were being sent again to abrogate the first letters.
Concerning Mordecai it is written that Mordecai wrote letters himself and sealed them himself. However, Haman did not have the time, since he had to go to the banquet. Therefore, he did not write them himself and in the letters it said to destroy this whole people. Here one asks a question. Why does he have to add people? He could only say to destroy all those who were enemies of the Jews? The answer is that Mordecai did not know who was hurting the Jews, <i>Amalekites or other nations?</i> Therefore, Mordecai wrote, all those people who have hurt the Jews should be killed. Mordecai said that all the Jews should gather together, since there were few Jews. Therefore, they must gather together and Mordecai asked that they should kill the Amalekites and rob their money in one day. However, Haman had asked that they should kill one day and rob the next day. If they would rob the money from the Jews in one day, then many Amalekites and other nations would only rob and would allow the Jews to run away. Therefore, Haman said that no money of the Jews should be touched on the same day that they will be killing them. However, Mordecai said that they should kill the <i>Amalekites</i> and rob their money in one day. However, no Jew should touch the money of the other nations in the expectation that the other nations will come running after the Amalekites in one day with the Jews and the nations should rob their money awaiting that the Jews should also be able to kill on the same day. There are not many Jews and perhaps the <i>Amalekites</i> will attack the Jews, <i>heaven forbid.</i> However, since all the nations ran after the Amalekites, they <i>confused</i> them and they did not know what was wrong.
“<i>Mordecai left the king</i>’<i>s presence</i>” [8:15]. Mordecai left in clothes that a king used to wear. One asks a question. Why did they make banquets in all the cities and in Shushan they made no banquet? The answer is that Mordecai feared that, heaven forbid, the Jews should not be killed by the Amalekites. Therefore, he did not make a banquet, but only afterwards when he saw that the Amalekites had killed no Jews, then he made banquets. There was great rejoicing in all the lands where the letters came. Many gentiles converted because they were afraid of Mordecai.
The Jews gathered in all the cities to kill the Amalekites and nobody opposed the Jews. They feared the Jews. All the high officials esteemed the Jews and bowed before the Jews, since Mordecai was important in the king’s house and his voice was heard in the whole world. The Jews killed the Amalekites as much as they wanted. In Shushan they killed five hundred men, in addition to all of Haman’s children. One asks a question here. Why is it not written that the Jews assembled in Shushan when they assembled in other cities? The answer is that because the king was in Shushan the Jews did not need to fear the Amalekites. That is why they did not assemble in Shushan. When a Jew encountered an Amalekite, he killed the Amalekite. One asks a question. Why does Scripture have to say that five hundred men were killed and were destroyed? It is obvious that when they are killed, they are also destroyed. The answer is that the five hundred men were all important officials. The custom is that when one kills an <i>important official</i> in the war, he is displayed to all the people. That is, they should see the revenge, that an important official has been killed. However, here they killed many officials and they were all destroyed. That is to say, they did not display which officials had been killed. However, they killed the children of Haman with the sword and before their <i>souls</i> departed, Haman’s children were hanged.

Chapter 9

“<i>The number of this killed on that day</i>” [9:11]. Mordecai was afraid of the king, that he should not be angry. Therefore, Mordecai stopped the killing in the early evening. They had to count the number of dead in the meantime.
“<i>What have they done in the other lands of the king</i>” [9:12]. Ahasuerus said to Esther: the Jews have killed five hundred men and Haman’s children. They stopped in the evening since they feared me. The Jews have certainly killed many more in other cities and they have even killed at night. Then Esther said: I ask you <i>my lord king</i>, because the Jews feared you and stopped early, therefore allow the Jews to kill the Amalekites for another day. The king ordered and gave them a letter that they should kill as they pleased. The Jews gathered on the fourteenth day of Adar and killed three hundred men and they did not touch the money of the Amalekites. In other cities, the Jews killed seventy thou- sand-five hundred Amalekites.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Esther 9:16 says, seventy-five thousand.</i> The Jews gathered on the thirteenth and the fourteenth and made a holiday to drink and feast.
“<i>And Mordecai wrote</i>” [9:20]. He wrote a letter to the Jews in all the lands that they should observe <i>Purim</i> on the fourteenth day and on the fifteenth day of Adar. They should send and give presents; one friend to another, and one should give presents to the poor on Purim. One should drink so long until the person should not know the difference between <i>cursed be Haman</i> and <i>blessed be Mordecai.</i> Here one asks a question. Why do we first say <i>cursed be Haman</i> and afterwards <i>blessed be Mordecai?</i><sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Megillah,</i> 7b.</i> The answer is that first came letters from the king that the Amalekites should be killed and Mordecai was not mentioned in these letters. Thus, the Jews in the foreign lands did not know who had brought the redemption. The Jews sang <i>cursed be Haman</i> and did not mention Mordecai. However, afterwards when Mordecai wrote his letter that they should observe Purim, they became aware that Mordecai brought the <i>redemption</i> and the Jews began to sing, <i>blessed be Mordecai.</i> In the meantime, the Jews had long sung, <i>cursed be Haman</i>, before they sang, <i>blessed be Mordecai.</i> Thus, the custom remained that one first sings, <i>cursed be Haman</i>, and afterwards, <i>blessed be Mordecai.</i>
“<i>They fulfilled and took upon themselves</i>” [9:27]. All of Israel observed Purim, even in distant lands where they did not know the story of the Megillah. Mordecai had written briefly that <i>Purim</i> should be observed and had not yet written the Megillah for them, but they still observed Purim.
“<i>And Esther wrote</i>” [9:29]. Esther and Mordecai wrote other letters and the whole <i>Megillah</i> to all the Jews to observe Purim with eating, drinking and fasting.

Chapter 10

“<i>Next to the king</i>” [10:3]. Mordecai was Ahasuerus’ vizier and was important in the Torah. He bequeathed everything good to the Jews. <i>Ibn Ezra</i> asks a question. Why did the righteous Mordecai and Esther not mention the name of the Holy One in the whole Megillah? The answer is that Mordecai and Esther were afraid of the Persians and Medes that they would write the names of their foreign gods in the places where the Holy One is mentioned. Therefore, they did not want to mention the name of the Holy One in the Megillah.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">Abraham ibn Ezra, Commentary on Esther, Introduction.</i>
It says in Scripture, “<i>oil to illumine</i>” [Ex. 35:14]. Why did the sages make it so severe regarding the reading of the <i>Megillah</i>, at night and again in the morning? Also, the Torah will be abrogated and the <i>Megillah</i> will be read?<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">J. <i>Megillah,</i> 1.7.</i> The answer is, because in that time Israel was far from the Holy One, as if the Holy One, heaven forbid, forgot them. Therefore, the Holy One showed Israel that when Israel are in great trouble and are humbled among the nations, the Holy One does not forget us and redeems us, in the expectation that Israel will not despair of redemption. When a trouble comes, heaven forbid, then one should call to God and He will answer us, like He answered Mordecai and Esther. Therefore, one should read the Megillah and read it twice, once for the miracle that happened to Mordecai at night, that it was found in the <i>Chronicle</i> that Mordecai had saved the king. One reads it in the day for the miracle that happened to Esther with the banquets, as a result of which Haman was hanged.
One asks a question. Why was Ahasuerus’ banquet named for the drinking? It is written, “<i>banquet [mishteh] for his servants</i>” [1:3]. This means a drink<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">The word for banquet used here – <i>mishteh</i> – is derived from the word for drinking –<i>lishtot.</i> This is the basis for this discussion.</i> for his servants and ministers. Why did he not call the banquet after the food? If someone wants to give an answer that the drinking was first and then the eating and that this is why it is called a meal [<i>seudah</i>] after the drinking? This cannot be, since Scripture says, “<i>the drinking was according to the law</i>” [1:8]. Our sages translate this as meaning that the drinking was according to the laws of the Torah that one should eat when drinking.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Megillah,</i> 12a.</i> Thus, it is not proper that the drinking was primary. Why does Scripture call the banquet after the drinking and not after the eating? The answer is because each official brought his own wine from his own land and this because this wine was older than the official.<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Megillah,</i> 12a.</i> This was a novelty and therefore the banquet was named after the drinking, since the food was the same in all the lands.
Another answer. The Talmud says that the Jews took kosher wine with them and not <i>wine poured out to foreign gods</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">The term “wine poured out to idols” is a translation of “<i>yayin nesekh.</i>” It refers to wine belonging to or produced by non-Jews.</i> as the verse says, “<i>the drinking was according to law</i>” [1:8].<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Megillah,</i> 12a.</i> This means, as the wine that was drunk was according to the Torah which ordained that no <i>wine poured out to foreign gods</i> be drunk. Even though this prohibition on <i>wine poured out to foreign gods</i> is a rabbinic prohibition and not from the Torah, yet they did not want to drink it, how much more so is it obvious that that they did not eat non-kosher meat, which is forbidden by the Torah. The Megillah teaches us that they did not even drink <i>wine poured out to foreign gods</i>, how much more so, eating. That is why the banquet is called after the drinking. He asks another question. It is written, “<i>the drinks were in golden vessels</i>” [1:7]. This means, the drinks were in golden vessels. The Talmud says that wine goes bad and becomes vinegar in golden vessels.<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Ta</i>’<i>anit,</i> 7a.</i> How did wine stay [and not become vinegar] in golden vessels by <i>Ahasuerus?</i> The answer is that the verse says, “<i>to drink.</i>” That is, the officials ordered that the wine should be drunk from golden vessels and the wine did not spend much time in the golden vessels.
“<i>And Mordecai knew all that happened</i>” [4:1]. This means, and Mordecai knew all that happened. Rashi asks a question here. Why did Mordecai alone know and no other person knew? Yet, it is written, “<i>and the city of Shushan was confounded</i>” [3:15]. This means, and the city of Shushan was confounded. It is also written, “<i>there was great mourning among the Jews</i>” [4:3]. This means that the Jews were very troubled that Haman wanted to destroy Israel. This shows that the Jews also knew what was done between <i>Ahasuerus</i> and <i>Haman.</i> Why does it say that Mordecai knew everything that had been done? Rashi gives an explanation: the <i>angel</i> who is appointed over <i>dreams</i> said to Mordecai that Israel will be destroyed and it has been <i>agreed</i> to in Heaven that Israel should be destroyed. Mordecai was the only one who knew this and the children of Israel did not know this, therefore it is written, “<i>and Mordecai knew.</i>”<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rashi</i>, Esther, 4:1.</i>
“<i>You will surely fall</i>” [6:13]. <i>Zeresh</i> said to <i>Haman:</i> you will surely fall. Here we ask a question. Why does it have to say twice “<i>fall will you fall</i>”? Furthermore, why does she say, “<i>fall</i>” twice and “<i>you will fall</i>” once? The explanation is that Scripture teaches two things when it says “<i>fall.</i>” Mordecai and Israel fell and were very lowly in the world. They were so low that if they were any lower, they would be at ground level. Soon afterwards, Israel rose again as high as the stars in the heavens.<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Esther, <i>Remez</i>, 1057.</i> Therefore, <i>Zeresh</i> said to <i>Haman:</i> because Mordecai is very lowly now and is in great trouble, therefore you, Haman, will have to fall. Afterwards, Mordecai who is now very lowly will become very important ascend very high, as high as the stars in the heavens. You will be eliminated and remain lowly.
“<i>Haman fell</i>” [7:8]. <i>Rashi</i> writes here that the angel pushed Haman so that he fell on Esther, on the bed.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Esther, 7:8.</i> Here one asks a question. Who said to Rashi that the angel pushed?<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Megillah,</i> 16a.</i> This is the meaning of “<i>Haman fell</i>” [7:8]. Perhaps it means “<i>Haman is falling.</i>” That is, Haman fell by himself without the angel. The explanation is that it should have said, “<i>and Haman fell</i>,” meaning, Haman fell by him- self. However, it says here, “<i>Haman is falling.</i>” That is to say, he did not want to fall and wanted to straighten himself up, but the angel did not allow him to straighten up and kept pushing him so he had to fall.
One asks a question. Why is the “<i>het</i>” large in the word “<i>hur</i>” in the beginning of the Megillah [1:6] and at the end of the Megillah, the letter “<i>tav</i>” is large in the phrase “<i>and Esther wrote</i>” [9:29]. The explanation is that the “<i>het</i>” looks like a gate and the “<i>tav</i>” also looks like a gate. This teaches us that on Purim one should open both the front door and the back door, to allow good people, both rich and poor to come visit him. This is the greatest commandment on Purim, as it is written, “<i>gifts to one another and presents to the poor</i>” [9:22]. This means to send good food to one’s friend and to give presents to the <i>poor people.</i> It is a greater commandment to allow rich and poor into your house on <i>Purim.</i> That is why the “<i>het</i>” is large in the word “<i>hur.</i>” This shows that the door should be open and one should not embarrass the one who comes uninvited. This is shown by the word “<i>hur.</i>”
The <i>Targum</i> calls it “<i>hiur</i>,” which means a white color.<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Targum Rishon</i>, Esther 1:6.</i> That is to say, it should not make the face of anyone who comes uninvited pale and embarrass him. In addition, they used to say that the “<i>het</i>” refers to the door. We learn this from [the commentary of] Hizkuni, who writes in <i>parshat Bo</i> that they smeared the blood of the <i>paschal sacrifice</i> on the upper lintels and on the two sides.<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus, 12:7.</i> This has the image of a “<i>het</i>,” which points to “life” [<i>Hayyim</i>], that the Holy One rescued Israel. He did not allow the first-born to die. So too, the large “<i>het</i>” shows us that the door should be open on <i>Purim</i> so that guests should come in. Through this, he will be worthy of “<i>life.</i>” The “<i>het</i>” points to long life. One is particularly worthy of long life from poor guests, as Scripture says, “<i>cast your bread upon the waters; for after many days you will find it</i>” [Ecclesiastes, 11:1]. Our sages interpreted this that the one who gives charity, particularly bread to the guest, he will receive a generous reward in the fullness of days. That is, he will be worthy of long life.<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Avot de-Rabbi Nathan</i> version A, chap. 3.</i> Amen, Selah.

Bereshit

<b>[Isaiah 42:5–43:10]</b>
“<i>Thus said God the Lord, who created the heavens and stretched them out, who spread out the earth and what it brings forth</i>” [42:5]. The <i>prophet</i> said that there were many people in his time who said that the world was created by itself and the Holy One did not create it. Therefore, the prophet let everyone know that God created the world Himself. He stretched out the heavens and spread them over the whole world like one stretches out a tent. Then, the Holy One brought forth all the fruits, trees and vegetation from the earth. Then, He gave a soul to the people who were on the earth and a spirit to those who walk on the earth.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Isaiah, 42:5. All the commentaries from the beginning until 43:10 are from the commentary of Radak on the appropriate verses.</i>
“<i>I am God the Lord, I have called you in righteousness, etc.</i>” [42:6]. The Holy One said to Israel: I, God, have created everything and I can certainly redeem you from the exile. I will call you with justice to leave the exile when the time for the <i>redemption</i> will come. You should not fear the nations. I will strengthen you and protect you from the nations. All the nations will stand for your sake. You will be like a light to the nations. This is the Torah that will go forth from the city of <i>Zion.</i>
“<i>To open the eyes</i>” [42:7]. The Holy One said: I will call you to open your eyes that were blind, because of great troubles in the exile and to extract you from the captivity, from the dark dwelling of exile.
“<i>I am the Lord, that is my name</i>” [42:8]. I am God and my name is that I am Lord over the whole world. I do not want to give My glory to a stranger. Until now I have not done justice with the evildoers. Therefore, they have not recognized Me and followed their false gods. However, when I will extract Israel from the exile and will do justice to the evildoers, the whole world will recognize that I alone am God, and they will not give praise to the images.
“<i>The former things have come</i>” [42:9]. The prophet said: the <i>prophecies</i> that I said about Sennacherib have come to pass. I want to tell you new <i>prophecies</i>, before they will sprout and show themselves, in days to come.
“<i>Sing to the Lord, a new song, His praise</i>” [42:10]. Israel will sing a new song in the days of the Messiah. On the earth and on the sea, the people in ships will give praise to God.
“<i>Let the desert and its towns lift up their voice</i>” [42:11]. They will lift up their voices with song, the desert and the cities and also the huts where the Tatars dwell. The high animals on the rocks and on the high mountains will also sing and praise God with shouts. They will give honor to God and they will tell His praises among all the nations.
“<i>The Lord goes forth like a soldier, like a warrior</i>” [42:13]. God will go out to help Israel like a warrior in the war. He is roused to <i>revenge</i> against the nations that have persecuted Israel in the exile. He will yell and cry out at the enemies of Israel and will vanquish them.
“<i>For a long time, I have kept my peace</i>” [42:14]. The Holy One said: I have been silent and have restrained myself for a long time and witnessed the troubles that Israel has suffered in the exile. However, now I will cry out at the enemies, like a woman who is in labor. So will I cry out at the enemies and devastate them and swallow them up.
“<i>I will lay waste to mountains and hills</i>” [42:15]. He compares the nations to high mountains, to grass and to great rivers. Therefore, he said here: I will lay waste to the nations, who are compared to mountains and to grass, and will dry up all the rivers, that is to say, the strong nations.
“<i>I will lead the blind by a road</i>” [42:16]. However, I will lead Israel, who are like the blind, in the exile. I will lead them on the right path to the <i>land of Israel</i> and where it is dark, I will make it light for them.
“<i>They will be turned back and put to shame</i>” [42:17]. The enemies will jump backwards. They will be ashamed that they assured themselves with their <i>false gods</i> and said to their <i>false gods</i>, you are my god.
“<i>Listen, you that are deaf; and you that are blind, look up and see</i>” [42:18]. The Holy One said to Israel: You make yourselves deaf and won’t listen, and make yourselves blind and don’t want to see. You say concerning my <i>prophets</i> who punish you, that they are deaf and blind.
“<i>Who is blind, but My servants, etc.</i>” [42:19]. You Israel say about My prophets, who are My servants, where is there one is as blind or deaf as the prophets? Or, where is there such a blind person who is completely pious? This is the meaning of the verse “<i>who is blind like my dedicated one?</i>” [42:19].
“<i>He who sees many things, but does not observe them</i>” [42:20]. You Israel have seen many troubles and will not think about why the troubles come to you. You have open ears and do not want to listen to the prophet. You make yourself deaf and blind.
“<i>The Lord desires His [servants] vindication</i>” [42:21]. When the Messiah will come, he will give great wisdom to the people so that they will know how to study the Torah. God does this because of His <i>righteousness</i> and not because of your merit.
“<i>But this is a people robbed and plundered, etc.</i>” [42:22]. The Holy One said that Israel are a people who are robbed and plundered by the nations. If you will hide yourselves in caves in the earth, the nations will soon find you. If you will be in houses hidden in prisons, you will be robbed and nobody will protect you. Nobody will say, why are you robbing him or why don’t you return what you have robbed from Israel?
“<i>Who among you will give heed to this, etc.</i>” [42:23]. There is nobody among you who will listen to this, and should hear what will happen in the future?
“<i>Who gave up Jacob to the spoilers, etc.</i>” [42:24]. Who among you will recognize what is the sin for which Israel was robbed? Truly, when he will understand, he might think that it is because of our sins that we did not listen to His commandments and His Torah.
“<i>So he poured out on him, the heat of his anger</i>” [42:25]. Therefore, the Holy One poured out His anger on Israel and strong war. He let the flames flare around him, and yet he did not understand why this was. The fire burns him and he does not take to heart that this is because of his sins.
“<i>But now thus says the Lord, who created you, O, Jacob</i>” [43:1]. The Holy One says: Thus said your God, your creator, Jacob. Do not fear Jacob, since I have redeemed you in the days of <i>Sennacherib</i> and I will redeem you in the days of the <i>Messiah.</i> I will call you to Me with your name. You will recognize that I am God.
“<i>When you pass through the waters, I will be with you</i>” [43:2]. The Holy One said: <i>Sennacherib</i>, who is compared to a great river that wants to flood. I was with you. Sennacherib, who was like a fire, and I rescued you. So too, in the days of the Messiah, you will go among evil nations who are compared to water and fire and they will not be able to do anything to you.
“<i>For I am the Lord your God, the Holy One of Israel</i>” [43:3]. The Holy One said: I am God, your Holy One, your helper. Sennacherib came against the city of <i>Jerusalem.</i> Sennacherib first had a <i>war</i> with the <i>king of Kush</i> and <i>Sheba</i> and the <i>king of Egypt.</i> He came from these <i>wars</i> to the city of Jerusalem, with the plunder that he had acquired from them. He thought that he would easily conquer Jerusalem. Israel was few in number and weak. The Holy One showed him that though he had conquered these strong <i>kings</i>, but he could not do anything against Israel and the city of Jerusalem. Also in the days of the Messiah, many kings will gather together and will war with each other and then they will come against Israel and the Holy One will help Israel. Therefore, He said that <i>Kush, Sheba and Egypt</i> became your <i>scapegoat.</i>
“<i>Because you are precious in my eyes, etc.</i>” [43:4]. The Holy One said: Because you are very just and honored, therefore I love you and give the nations to your city that they should be your scapegoat.
“<i>Do not fear for I am with you, etc.</i>” [43:5]. Just as I saved you in the days of Sennacherib, so too, I will save you in the days of the Messiah. Do not fear, for I am with you and I will gather you in with all your children. I will even lead your small children slowly to the <i>land of Israel.</i>
“<i>I will say to the north, give them, etc.</i>” [43:6]. The Holy One commanded all four sides of the world, to east and to west, north, south that they should help carry Israel to the <i>land of Israel.</i>
“<i>Everyone who is called by My name, etc.</i>” [43:7]. Israel recognized that the Holy One created the world and always recognizes this. Therefore, they give <i>honor to the Holy One</i>, because they recognize that God created the world and they also know that God also provides food to all His creatures.
“<i>Bring forth the people who are blind, yet have eyes</i>” [43:8]. The Holy One said: I want to take out a people that is blind and deaf because of troubles. They have eyes and do not see. They have ears and do not hear, because of their great troubles in the exile.
“<i>Let all the nations gather together</i>” [43:9]. All the nations and their kings will gather together. Where is there one of them that can say what will be in the days of the Messiah? Who can inform them of what happened in the days of Sennacherib, like I informed them before it happened to Sennacherib?
“<i>Let them bring their witnesses to justify them</i>” [43:9]. Let the nations show their witnesses that they <i>prophesied</i> about what would happen. Then we will say that they are righteous. In the meantime, they cannot prophesy. So let them listen to My <i>prophets</i> and let them recognize the <i>truth.</i>
“<i>You are my witnesses, says the Lord</i>” [43:10]. The Holy One said to Israel: you are my witnesses and the prophet is my servant. You did see that the <i>prophecy about Sennacherib</i> happened and that I paid him for what he did to Israel. I informed them of everything before the defeat that happened to Sennacherib. Now you can understand from the first prophesies what happened in the days of Sennacherib. Thus, the final prophecies will also come to pass in the days of the Messiah.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">All of the commentaries from the beginning of this <i>haftorah</i> until here are from the commentary of Radak on the appropriate verses.</i>
The Midrash writes: “<i>who gives a soul to the people on it</i>” [42:5]. <i>Rabbi Abahu</i> said: even <i>a maidservant in the land of Israel</i> certainly has <i>a share in the world to come.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Isaiah, <i>Remez</i> 451.</i> Therefore, the verse says here, “<i>a soul to the people on it.</i>” That is to say, all the people in the land of Israel have a proper soul in them.
The Midrash says about this haftorah in the <i>Yalkut</i>, “<i>all the nations will gather, etc.</i>” [42:9].<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Isaiah, <i>Remez</i> 452.</i> <i>Rabbi Haninah the son of Pappa</i> and some say, <i>Rabbi Simlai</i> said: When the Messiah will come, the Holy One will take a <i>Torah scroll</i> in his lap and will say: whoever has observed the Torah, let them come and receive their reward. All the nations came together in a mixed multitude. The Holy One said: let one nation come forward and the others after them. Edom came first.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Edom in this context refers to Rome.</i> The Holy One said: What has your nation done with the <i>Torah scroll?</i> They responded: Lord of the Universe, we have built many streets and markets, and we have made many bathhouses in which to bathe. We have accumulated much silver, all for the sake of Israel so that they should study Torah. The Holy One answered: you did everything for your own benefit. You made nice markets with beautiful houses and put whores and prostitutes in them. The nice baths were made for your own <i>pleasures</i>, and the gold and silver are mine. However, which of you can talk about the Torah? They soon left in <i>disgrace.</i>
The <i>Persians</i> came next with their king. The Holy One said: what have you done with the Torah? They responded: we built many bridges over the waters, so that Israel should cross them and not neglect their Torah study, and have built many cities so that Israel would study Torah. The Holy One answered: you make bridges so that you would collect tolls and you also built cities so that you could collect taxes. However, you did not observe the Torah. All the nations will want to give similar <i>excuses</i>, but they could not endure. They answered that You did not give us the Torah, but if You had given us the Torah we would have observed it. Here one asks a question. The Holy One did come to all the <i>nations of the world</i> when <i>the Torah was given</i> and wanted to give them the Torah and no nation wanted to take it. Why did the nations say that You should have given us the Torah? The answer is that the nations say: Why did You give the Torah to Israel and forced them [to accept it]? You took a large mountain and held it over Israel and said to Israel: if you will accept the Torah, it is good. If you will not accept the Torah, then I will throw this large mountain on top of you. Thus, the nations will say: why did You not force us to accept the Torah, as you did to Israel? The Holy One will say: I will absolve you from the Torah. Come here. Why did you not observe the seven commandments that the children of Noah were commanded? The nations will say: Israel also did not observe the Torah. The Holy One says: I will testify that Israel observed the Torah. The nations answered: it is correct that a father should testify on behalf of his children. Israel are called God’s children, as Scripture says, “<i>my firstborn son, Israel</i>” [Exodus 4:22].
The Holy One said: let heaven and earth testify. The nations answered: heaven and earth are not qualified witnesses, since as soon as Israel does not observe the Torah, heaven and earth must perish. Therefore, heaven and earth must say that Israel is observing the Torah properly. The Holy One said to the nations: let several gentiles from among you come and testify about Israel, if they observed the Torah. Let <i>Nimrod</i> come and testify about Abraham, who did not want to worship <i>false gods</i> and allowed himself to be thrown into the fire. Let <i>Laban</i> come and testify about <i>Jacob</i>, that he did not steal the sheep that he was guarding. Let the wife of <i>Potiphera</i><sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">He means Potiphar [Genesis, 39:1]. Potiphera was Joseph’s father-in-law [Genesis, 41:45].</i> come and testify that <i>Joseph</i> did not want to commit <i>adultery</i> and did not want to sleep with her. Let Nebuchadnezzar come and testify about <i>Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah</i>, that they did not want to serve <i>false gods</i> and allowed themselves to be thrown into the fire, because they did not want to worship false gods. Concerning this, Scripture says, “<i>let them bring their witnesses</i>” [43:9].
The nations said: <i>Lord of the Universe</i>, give us the Torah and we will observe it. The Holy One said: you fools, whoever cooks on the <i>eve of the Sabbath</i>, eats on the Sabbath. However, you did not want to observe the Torah before the Messiah came and now you will also not observe it. Nonetheless, I have a small commandment; that is the <i>sukkah.</i> I will give it to you; take it and observe it. Each one immediately made a <i>sukkah</i> on his roof. The Holy One then let the sun come out and made it very hot. All of them ran out of the <i>sukkah</i> and spoke ill about the <i>sukkah.</i> Here one asks a question. Why did the Holy One make <i>false accusations</i> against the nations and then brought a great heat so that they simply had to leave the <i>sukkah?</i> The answer is that sometimes there are great heat spells in the <i>land of Israel</i> during the month of <i>Tishrei</i>, as if it was <i>Tammuz</i>, and the Jews suffer the heat and remain in the <i>sukkah.</i> One asks another question. A Jew who suffers in the <i>sukkah</i> is not obligated to sit in the <i>sukkah.</i> If someone was extremely hot in the <i>sukkah</i>, then he is absolved from sitting in the <i>sukkah.</i> The answer is that a Jew, when it is very hot for him in the <i>sukkah</i>, he leaves it and does not speak ill of the <i>sukkah.</i> However, the nations of the world spoke ill of the <i>sukkah.</i> That is why the Holy One laughed and mocked them.
<i>Rabbi Isaac</i> said that the Holy One did not laugh, but only on that day did God laugh and mock the nations. The Talmud asks a question. Did not Rabbi Judah said that there are twelve hours in the day? The first three hours, the Holy One sits and studies Torah. The next three hours, the Holy One <i>judges</i> the whole world. As soon as the Holy One sees that the majority of the world has committed sins, the Holy One stands up from His throne that is the <i>seat of judgment</i> and seats Himself on the throne that is the <i>seat of mercy.</i> The third three hours, the Holy One feeds the whole world. The fourth three hours, the Holy One plays with Leviathan. We learn from this Midrash that the Holy One plays with <i>Leviathan</i> every day. Why does the Midrash above say that the Holy One will not play until the coming of the Messiah and the nations will say that we will not observe [the commandment of] the <i>sukkah.</i> This is the only time the Holy One will laugh. The explanation is that the Holy One does not laugh at these people, except for one time when the Messiah comes. However, the Holy One does play and laugh with His creatures, like with Leviathan.
<i>Rabbi Aha</i> said to <i>Rabbi Nachman:</i> Since the <i>Temple</i> was destroyed, there is no joy or laughter for the Holy One, as the verse in the haftorah says, “<i>I have kept silent for too long</i>” [42:14]. I have been silent for a long time, since the <i>Temple</i> was destroyed. What does the Holy One do in the fourth three hours of the day? The explanation is that the Holy One studies with small children the fourth three hours since the Temple was destroyed because he does not play with Leviathan. Here one asks a question. Who studied with the children before the Temple was destroyed? The explanation is that an angel by the name of <i>Metatron</i> studied with the children before the <i>Temple</i> was destroyed. However, the Holy One himself did two things. He studied Torah with the children and also played with Leviathan. “<i>Let them bring their witnesses</i>” [43:9]. <i>Rabbi Joshua ben Levi</i> says that all the commandments that Israel fulfills in this world come and testify in the next world.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The whole passage from the mention of the <i>Yalkut</i> (n. 4) until here is all from <i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Isaiah, <i>Remez</i> 452.</i>

Someone calls his friend to the prayers. He says to him: I can’t go because I’m not strong enough, but to have conversations in the market, he is strong enough.

Noach

<b>[Isaiah 54:1–55:5]</b>
“<i>Sing, O one who did not bear children, burst into song, etc.</i>” [54:1]. The prophet said: sing you woman who did not have children. The city of Jerusalem was also in exile, like a woman who was barren and had no children.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Isaiah, <i>Remez</i> 476, and in Rashi, Isaiah, 54:1.</i> She did not have morning sickness that comes from having a child. When she wants to have children, she cannot become pregnant. Now, the children will be many in the city that was devastated during the exile, many more children than the nations will have. She is like a woman who has a husband. <i>Jerusalem</i> was like an <i>abandoned wife</i> whose husband was still alive.
“<i>Enlarge the site of your tent</i>” [54:2]. The prophets said to the city of Jerusalem. Make your tent wide and long for your many children. The other cities, in addition to Jerusalem, should also extend the length and breadth of the curtains of your tent and the length of your rope, and strengthen the nails of your tent.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Isaiah, 54:2.</i>
“<i>For you will spread out to the right and the left</i>” [54:3]. You will strengthen yourself to the south and the north and also to the other sides. Your children will inherit many nations. The cities that were devastated will again be inhabited by Israel.
“<i>Do not fear, you will not be ashamed</i>” [54:4]. Do not fear that you will find troubles in the departure from the exile. You will never be embarrassed forever. Furthermore, you will have so much good that you will forget the <i>disgraces</i> that you suffered in the exile. Also, the <i>disgrace</i> that you were like a <i>widow</i> in the exile will not be remembered.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Isaiah, 54:4.</i>
“<i>For your maker is your husband</i>” [54:5]. The one who is your master is your Creator and He is your husband. However, in the exile the nations were your husband. Your master, God, <i>Lord of Hosts</i>, is your husband and your Redeemer. The Holy One of Israel is the God of the whole world.
“<i>For like a wife forsaken, etc.</i>” [54:6]. The prophet said: you are not like a wife whose husband has died, but you are like a wife whose husband was angry with her for a time and returned to her. The Holy One called you a forsaken woman. If you want to think that you will be eternally forsaken because he find you undesirable. It is common that when someone has an old wife, she is not so beloved. Therefore, God says, “<i>like the wife of a man</i>’<i>s youth who is cast off</i>” [54:6]. That is to say, one who despises his wife, who he married as a maiden, that is to say, a <i>virgin.</i> She is the same when she has gotten old and he remembers that she is the same one who came to him as a young woman. However, when one takes an old wife, then he may eventually come to despise her.
“<i>For a brief moment I abandoned you</i>” [54:7]. Since much good will be given to you in the days of the <i>Messiah</i>, you will think that the exile was but a blink of the eye. You will be redeemed with great <i>mercy.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Isaiah, 54:7.</i>
“<i>In overflowing wrath for a moment, I hid my face from you</i>” [54:8]. I was wrathful with you for the blink of an eye. I will always have compassion and <i>mercy</i> for you. So says God, your Redeemer.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Isaiah, 54:8.</i>
“<i>This is like the days of Noah for Me</i>” [54:9]. The Holy One said: Just like I swore after the Flood to never again bring it to the world. So too, the exile that has been, will not be forever. I have sworn that there should not be a Flood again. Similarly, I will not be angry and will not scold you.
“<i>For the mountains may depart and the hills be removed</i>” [54:10]. The mountains will be removed in time, but my <i>oath</i> will not depart and will remain forever. So says God, who has compassion for you. The <i>Talmud</i> writes in <i>Sanhedrin, Rabbi Judah said to his son Rabbi Isaac:</i> No person has a joyous heart, except with his first wife, but not with the other wife that he takes. Therefore it says, “<i>for your Maker is your husband</i>” [54:5]. <i>Rabbi Samuel</i> said in the name of Rav: a woman is not wholeheartedly happy, except with the man who married her when she was a <i>virgin.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Sanhedrin,</i> 22a-22b.</i>
“<i>O afflicted one, storm-tossed, and not comforted</i>” [54:11]. The Holy One said about the city of <i>Jerusalem.</i> You poor one who has been buffeted by storms and troubles of exile. You have not been consoled until now for the <i>redemption.</i> I will set small pearls in the foundations of your walls and I will set <i>precious stones</i>, <i>sapphires</i> and other semi-precious stones on them.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Isaiah, 54:11.</i>
“<i>I will make your pinnacles of rubies, etc.</i>” [54:12]. I will make your windows so that the sun will shine in and will illumine large pearls within, and your gate will shine brightly with precious stones, like a flame. All the stones that were found in your boundaries will now become <i>precious stones</i> and pearls.
“<i>All of your children will be disciples of the Lord, etc.</i>” [54:13]. Everyone, great and small, will be a <i>scholar</i> in the <i>Messianic</i> age.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Isaiah, 54:13.</i>
“<i>You will be established through righteousness, etc.</i>” [54:14]. When you will give charity<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">The word “<i>zedakah</i>” can mean either righteousness or charity. The biblical context uses it in the first sense, but the author chose to translate it in the second sense.</i> and act justly, then you will have <i>honor</i> and you will not be preyed upon. You will have no fear or anxiety. No anxiety will come to you.
“<i>Surely no harm can be done without my consent, etc.</i>” [54:15]. Many nations may gather, but I did not command it. This is <i>Gog and Magog</i> who will come against you. However, I did not order that he should do evil to Israel. Rather, he will do a favor for Israel. Israel will take goods and money from the nation of <i>Gog and Magog.</i> No nation will be able to win against you. They will be defeated.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Isaiah, 54:15.</i>
“<i>It is I who have created the smith, etc.</i>” [54:16]. The Holy One said: how good. Though <i>Gog and Magog</i> will come against you with swords, bows and arrows, and all the <i>weapons</i> of <i>war</i>, do not fear. I have created the people who make the weapons of war. Everything is in my hands and I can protect you from them. I have created the smith who blows on the coals to make them hot to make the iron from which swords are made. Whatever he wants to make, I can disrupt the same person from his craft, <i>even more so</i> I can destroy the swords, so that they cannot do anything to you. Concerning this, God says in the verse, “<i>it is I who created the ravager to destroy</i>” [54:16]. I have created a <i>ravager</i> who destroys what I want. Therefore, do not fear the weapons.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Isaiah, 54:16.</i>
“<i>No weapon created against you shall succeed, etc.</i>” [54:17]. All the swords that will come against you will have no luck to harm you. They will be broken. When they will <i>go to court</i> against you, they will be found at fault and you will be justified. This will be an <i>inheritance</i> to the divine servant, <i>David.</i> Their justice is from me, says God.
“<i>Ho, all who are thirsty, come to the waters, etc.</i>” [55:1]. You should study <i>Torah and wisdom</i> like a person is thirsty to drink water, and you should study Torah with desire. The world is impossible without Torah. If someone does not have money, he should not worry. He will have wisdom and Torah and silver without effort. The Torah is much better than wine and milk.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Isaiah, 55:1.</i>
“<i>Why do you spend money for what is not bread, etc.</i>” [55:2]. Why should you spend your money for a wisdom that is not Torah? This is not called bread. That is to say, the wisdom of the Torah is compared to bread. Just as one cannot live without bread, so one cannot live without the wisdom of the Torah. However, one can live very well without other wisdoms. One is not helped by them, not for the body and not for the soul. Therefore, we learn that the Torah is called <i>good.</i> It is good for the <i>body</i> and the <i>soul</i> and it makes your body fat and thick and the soul will live from this.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Isaiah, 55:2.</i>
“<i>Incline your ears and come to Me, listen and your soul will live, etc.</i>” [55:3]. Incline your ears to Me and you will cause your body and soul to live. I will make an everlasting <i>covenant</i> with you, not to abandon you and I will reward the <i>lovingkindness of David.</i>
“<i>As I made him a leader of peoples, etc.</i>” [55:4]. I have given over you a lord, to punish you and to show you the correct path, as a master shows his servants.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Isaiah, 55:4.</i>
“<i>So you shall summon a nation you did not know, etc.</i>” [55:5]. A nation that does not know you. That is to say, they will come from far from the <i>land of Israel</i>, when you call them to serve you. They will run to you because of the will of God, your God. They will hear about <i>miracles</i> that God will do for Israel and He is the one who gives you this beauty. The <i>Yalkut</i> writes about a <i>story</i> that happened. <i>Rabbi Johanan</i> preached in the <i>house of study</i> about when the Messiah will come. Then they will build the eastern gate of the <i>Temple</i>, with two chambers, out of one <i>precious stone</i> and in one piece. A <i>student</i> was sitting there who asked how was this possible? One does not even find a stone the size of a dove’s egg in the world of <i>precious stones</i>, which are called carbuncle. How can one build a gate in the <i>Temple</i> with two doors, out of one precious stone? The same <i>student</i> once traveled on the sea and his ship sank and he came to the depths of the sea. There he saw <i>angels</i> carving and straightening a very large <i>precious stone.</i> He asked, what is this? The angels said that this will be a gate with two chambers for the <i>Temple</i>, out of one piece. The <i>angels</i> said: if you had not seen this, you would not have believed that it was possible to make this gate with two chambers, out of one <i>precious stone</i> for the <i>Temple.</i> You did not believe what is said in the Torah about the Messiah. The same person immediately became a clod of earth and was destroyed, because he made fun of what had been preached.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni,</i> Isaiah, <i>Remez</i> 478; <i>Pesikta de-Rav Kahana</i>, 18.5.</i>
The <i>Pesikta</i> writes about the verse “<i>all your wall of precious stones</i>” [54:12]. <i>Rabbi Benjamin son of Levi</i> says that in the days of the Messiah, the Israelites will mark the boundaries of their fields with <i>precious stones.</i> Each person will take many precious stones and will place them around his field so that he should know how far his field extends. That is to say, he will make a wall out of <i>precious stones</i>, since there will be so many in <i>Jerusalem. Rabbi Levi</i> said that when a person owes his friend a thousand gulden, they both come to the <i>judges.</i> Sometimes the <i>judges</i> cannot do enough for both of them and one of them does not like the <i>judgment.</i> However, in the days of the Messiah if someone will grasp his friend and say to him, let us go to the <i>Messiah in Jerusalem</i> and let him judge us. When they approach <i>Jerusalem</i>, they will see many <i>precious stones</i> lying on the ground. One Jew will take two good stones and say to his friend. Do I owe you the value of these two precious stones? What do you want from me? Take these two <i>precious stones.</i> They soon make peace with each other and he will say, you don’t owe me so much. You owed me a thousand gulden and the <i>precious stones</i> you have given me are worth two thousand gulden. Concerning this the verse says, “<i>He grants peace within your borders</i>” [Psalms, 147:14]. Your borders will make peace. That is to say, the <i>precious stones</i> near Jerusalem make peace over Israel.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni,</i> Isaiah, <i>Remez</i> 478; <i>Pesikta de-Rav Kahana</i>, 18.6.</i>
The <i>Yelamdenu</i> writes: The Holy One says that Israel learns Torah from people; therefore they forget what they learned. Since Moses was a human being, who disappears, thus the Torah that derives from him also disappears and is soon forgotten. However, when the Messiah will come, Israel will learn Torah from the Holy One Himself, as the verse in the <i>haftorah</i> says, “<i>and your children will be disciples of the Lord</i>” [54:13]. That is to say, they will learn Torah from the Holy One Himself. Since the Holy One lives eternally, it will not be forgotten. <sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni,</i> Isaiah, <i>Remez</i> 479.</i>
We find in the <i>Talmud. Rabbi Hanina</i> said: Why is the Torah compared to water, as the verse says, “<i>all who are thirsty, come to the waters</i>” [55:1]. He shows us how a body of water behaves. It flows into a valley and not up a mountain. So too should the <i>scholar</i> be. He should be humble and not arrogant, just like the water runs away from the mountain, the Torah runs away from someone who is arrogant. <i>Rabbi Oshaiah</i> said: Why is the Torah compared to three drinks, to water, to wine, and to milk? He teaches us how these three drinks are similar. They can only be preserved in inexpensive earthen vessels. They cannot remain long in vessels of gold and silver. They spoil quickly in vessels of silver. The Torah is similar. It cannot remain where a person is arrogant and haughty. Like a body of water, from the first drop of rain until it becomes a great body of water or river, so too is the Torah. First one learns two <i>halakhot</i> and later others are added and the result is many <i>halakhot</i>, and just like water causes <i>grain and fruit</i> to grow, so too is Torah study. They raise a person to greatness, as the verse says, “<i>through me kings reign</i>” [Proverbs, 8:15].<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Ta</i>’<i>anit,</i> 7a.</i>

<b>[Isaiah 40:27–41:16]</b>
“<i>Why do you say O Jacob and why do you speak O Israel, etc.</i>” [40:27]. Why should the people of Jacob say that because they are long in exile that I, God, have forgotten them and I have not watched over Israel? The judgment that I was supposed to mete out to the nations who have greatly tormented Israel, that judgment is overdue and was not done, so speaks Israel in exile. The Holy One answers: Why should you say this?<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Isaiah, 40:27.</i>
“<i>Have you not known? Have you not heard, etc.</i>” [40:28]. Why should you Israel say that I have not watched over you and have not meted out judgment to the nations that tormented you greatly? You should know from your own understanding or if your understanding is inadequate, then you have heard it, in any event, from sages who told you that God created the world and He is the <i>judge</i> of the whole world. He created it with truth and He judges it properly. How can you say that I do not do justice? If you want to say that I am sometimes tired and cannot dispense justice, therefore the verse says here, “<i>He never grows tired or weary</i>” [40:28]. That is to say, He is not tired. He created the whole world with his strength. If you would say, since the Holy One has such great strength, why does He see that we are in exile for so long and He does not judge the nations? Concerning this the verse says here, “<i>His wisdom cannot be fathomed</i>” [40:28]. That is to say, we cannot understand His wisdom. However, the Holy One knows well why He does this.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Isaiah, 40:28.</i>
“<i>He gives strength to the weary</i>” [40:29]. When the Holy One wants to, He gives <i>strength to Israel</i> who are in exile to endure the difficult exile and, He strengthens those who are not strong.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Isaiah, 40:29.</i>
“<i>Your youths may grow faint and weary, etc.</i>” [40:30]. The Holy One causes the enemies of Israel to grow tired and empty of commandments. And the youths, that is to say, the nations who were strong like a young man. These same ones will have their strength taken away and they will stumble.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Isaiah, 40:30.</i>
“<i>Those who trust in the Lord will renew their strength, etc.</i>” [40:31]. Israel trusts in God that they will have good strength. They will exchange their strength, just like an eagle every ten years grows new feathers, until a hundred years. In the same way, Israel will be strong and they will not be tired.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Isaiah, 40:31.</i>
“<i>Stand silent before Me, coastlands, and let nations renew their strength, etc.</i>” [41:1].

“<i>Who has roused a victor from the east, etc.</i>” [41:2]. Who awakened Abraham to come from <i>Aram in the east</i>, from the house of false gods? Abraham called to the people to assemble and convert in all the cities that he visited. This is what Abraham did. Wherever he stepped with his feet, he called <i>justice.</i> That is to say, accept the true belief in the Holy One. Who awakened him, that Abraham did not fear kings? Surely I, God, did this. “<i>He delivers up nations to him and tramples kings underfoot, etc.</i>” [41:2]. Who gave that nations and <i>kings</i> should fall at the feet of Abraham. That is to say, Abraham conquered four kings and Abraham had few people with him. In truth, I, God, made him rule over kings. “<i>He rendered their swords like dust, their bows like wind driven straw</i>” [41:2]. The Holy One caused that the sword of Abraham made all the nations fall, like ash falls to the earth. With his bow, he made the nations fall like straw.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Genesis Rabbah,</i> 43.3; <i>Yalkut Shimoni,</i> Isaiah, <i>Remez</i> 447.</i>
“<i>He pursues them and he passes in peace, etc.</i>” [41:3]. He pursued the enemies and returned home in peace. The greatest <i>novelty</i> was that he took a road and path to the enemy that he had never taken before and he attained peace. This must be from God, Lord of all.
“<i>Who has wrought and achieved this, etc.</i>” [41:4]. Who did all of this? The same God created all the generations from Adam onward. He also did everything for Abraham. I, God, am the first, who did all this and am the God who will help you at the end, in the Messianic age and in all days.
“<i>The coastlands have seen and are afraid, etc.</i>” [41:5]. The nations who inhabit all the land will see the wonders that I will do for Israel. They will tremble, like the <i>king of Sodom</i> who came out to meet Abraham<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis, 14:17.</i> and the same king saw the wonders that I did for Abraham and Abraham told the same wonders to the other kings.

“<i>Each one helps the other, etc.</i>” [41:5]. Each one says to his friend, help, and to his brother says: strengthen yourself to make <i>false gods.</i> They did not think about Abraham that the Holy One helped him against four kings and that it would have been just to worship the Holy One.
“<i>The artisan encourages the smith, etc.</i>” [41:7]. The woodworker soon makes the wooden <i>false gods</i> and says with his good words to the goldsmith, make the silver metal soon and beat it with your hammer to make the metal so thin that it can cover the wooden idol with a silvery metal. “<i>Encourages the one who strikes the anvil and says of the soldering,</i> ‘<i>it is good</i>’, <i>etc.</i>” 41:7].

“<i>Do not fear, for I am with you, I am your God, etc.</i>” [41:10]. Do not be afraid, I am with you. Your heart should not dissolve like wax. I, God, will strengthen you and also help you, and will support you with My right hand, My justice.
“<i>All who are incensed with you shall be shamed and disgraced, etc.</i>” [41:11]. The nations will be shamed. Those that have harassed you in the exile because they thought that Israel should not leave the exile, and those who fought against you will be destroyed.
“<i>You will seek, but will not find those who contend with you, etc.</i>” [41:12]. They will be so destroyed that you will seek them and won’t find them. It is as if the people who waged <i>war</i> against you never existed.
“<i>I am the Lord your God, who grasped your right hand, etc.</i>” [41:13]. I, God, will strengthen you with my right hand. This says to you, do not be afraid for I help you.
“<i>Do not fear, you worm Jacob, you insect Israel, etc.</i>” [41:14]. You should not fear Israel; you are compared to a worm whose strength is his mouth. So too <i>Israel</i>’<i>s strength</i> is with the mouth, in the study of <i>Torah</i> and <i>prayer.</i> This is payment from Israel whom I help. So says Go, your Redeemer, holy Israel.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Isaiah, 41:14.</i>
“<i>I will make of you a threshing board, etc.</i>” [41:15]. I want to make you, Israel, like a thresher with which one threshes grain. Thus, you will destroy the nations. This is what the verse means. You will be a new thresher with indentations and many mouths that will make the grain thin. You will also defeat the strong nations, who are like strong mountains. They will become like chaff from straw.
“<i>You will winnow them and the wind will carry them away, etc.</i>” [41:16]. You Israel will scatter the nations like chaff that the wind carries away and the storm wind disperses the chaff. However, you Israel will rejoice and you will rejoice with God, and you will be loved by the Holy One of Israel.
The Talmud in [tractate] <i>Kiddushin</i> writes about the verse in the <i>haftorah</i>, “<i>those who trust in the Lord will renew their strength</i>” [40:31]. <i>Rabbi Nehorai</i> said: I would put aside every trade in the world and teach my son Torah, since all other trades help a person in his youth, when he is strong. However, in his old age he must die of hunger. The trade that he had in his youth, he cannot do in his old age. However, the trade of the Torah stands by the person in his youth and also in his old age. It makes much good for him. In his youth, the verse says, “<i>those who trust in the Lord will renew their strength</i>” [40:31]. In old age, the verse says, “<i>in old age, they still provide fruit</i>” [Psalms 92:15]. They will be fruitful and strengthened in their old age.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">M. <i>Kiddushin,</i> 4.14.</i>
The Talmud writes in [tractate] <i>Sanhedrin, chapter ten,</i> concerning the verse “<i>those who trust in the Lord will renew their strength</i>” [40:31]. <i>Elijah</i> said: The righteous ones that the Holy One will resurrect in the Messianic Age will live forever. If you will ask a question? The Holy One will remove heaven and earth during those thousand years. Where will the righteous ones who will be resurrected stay? The answer is that the Holy One will make eagle’s wings for each righteous person and they will fly over the waters. If you will say that they will be troubled by this, the verse says in the haftorah, “<i>those who trust in the Lord will renew their strength</i>” [40:31].

The Talmud writes in [tractate] <i>Shabbat</i> in the last chapter, concerning the verse “<i>He has roused a victor from the east</i>” [41:2]. Rav said: from where do we learn that Israel has no <i>mazal.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">The term <i>mazal</i> has several meanings. In popular usage, it means luck. However, its original meaning relates to constellations of the zodiac and astrology.</i> That is to say, the Holy One is the Lord and not the constellations of the zodiac [<i>mazal</i>], as the verse says, “<i>He took him outside</i>” [Genesis 15:5]. Abraham said to the <i>Holy One: Lord of the Universe</i>, I have seen in my horoscope [<i>mazal</i>] that I cannot have children. The Holy One answered him: do not turn to astrology [<i>mazal</i>]; there is no constellation [<i>mazal</i>] for Israel. That is to say, with <i>prayer</i> and <i>charity</i> Israel can change the <i>mazal</i> for good. The Holy One said to Abraham: you have seen that your <i>mazal</i> is called <i>Zedek</i> [Jupiter] in heaven, and this same <i>mazal Zedek</i> is found in the west, in a cold place. Therefore, it is not appropriate that you should have children, because the <i>mazal</i> is found in a cold place in the west. I will pull the <i>mazal</i> to the east where it is warm and then you will be able to have children, when Jupiter, your <i>mazal</i>, will be in the east. Concerning this, the verse in the haftorah says, “<i>who has illumined Zedek from the east and has called him to his foot</i>” [41:2].<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">This translation is a literal reading based on the Talmudic interpretation of this verse.</i> This means, who has awakened Abraham that he has children from the east.

The Talmud continues there. Samuel says: Israel can change the <i>mazal</i> with charity and prayer. A story occurred that Samuel was sitting with a gentile astrologer who was called Ablat. This <i>gentile</i> said to <i>Samuel:</i> here is a man who is going to the field. He will not return alive from the field. A snake will bite him and he will die. <i>Samuel</i> said: this is a Jew and he will remain alive. As they were sitting, the same man returned from the field with a load of wood that he had chopped into sticks. He found a snake had been inside the tree and he had chopped the snake in half while chopping the wood. He had not known that he had cut the snake in half. <i>Samuel</i> asked the man: what sort of commandment did you fulfill? The man answered: We have a group and every day we pool our bread from the six or seven <i>souls</i> of our group. One collects the bread from each member of the <i>group.</i> The person said: today, one member of our <i>group</i> did not have bread to donate, and was ashamed. So, I threw some bread into his basket. He did not know about this, since that day I was the one collecting bread from our group. I made myself as if I had taken bread from him. Samuel said: you have performed a very good deed. Then Samuel went and preached on “<i>charity saves from death</i>” [Proverbs 10:2]. Charity protects the person from death. <sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Shabbat</i>, 156b.</i>
The Talmud continues there. <i>Rabbi Akiva</i> said: there is no <i>mazal</i> for <i>Israel.</i> The same <i>Rabbi Akiva</i> had a daughter. The astrologers said to <i>Rabbi Akiva:</i> your daughter would go under the wedding canopy and a snake would kill her. <i>Rabbi Akiva</i> was very afraid about this. The same day she took the golden brooch from her head and stuck it into a beam. The brooch stuck the eye of a snake and the snake was killed. The next morning, she wanted to take the brooch out and the dead snake was dragged out with it. Her father said to her: What sort of commandment did you fulfill? She said that the previous night all the people were seated at the <i>banquet</i> and a pauper came to the door and asked for a piece of bread. There was nobody to give it to him, so I gave the pauper my portion that you had given to me to eat. Her father said: as a result of this merit, you were protected from the snake.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Shabbat</i>, 156b.</i>

His mother did not allow him to go about bareheaded. She said to her son: be careful to go with your head covered and <i>pray</i> that the <i>Evil Inclination</i> does not incite you and have the fear of God upon you. <i>Rabbi Nahman</i> did not know what his mother wanted from him that she told him this. Once <i>Rabbi Nahman</i> was sitting and studying Torah under a tree and the cloak fell off of his head. He lifted his eyes and saw a date tree and his <i>Evil Inclination</i> was aroused. He climbed the tree and bit off a bunch of dates with his teeth, and the dates did not belong to him. He committed a theft, as the astrologer had said.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Shabbat</i>, 156b.</i> From this we learn that we should not go frivolously without a hat, and he should cover his head, and should not be brazen so that the <i>Evil Inclination</i> should not strengthen itself in the person.
The person should not be afraid that if he is poor that he will always be poor, and think that his <i>mazal</i> in heaven would always to be poor. The person can change his <i>mazal</i> with his deeds. The person can change his mazal with his deeds. When a person is born on Tuesday, the third day of the week, then he will be a <i>communal leader</i>, since on the third day; all the <i>grains</i>, fruits and grasses were created.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis, 1:11–12.</i> Thus, the person will have enough of everything, as the Talmud writes in [tractate] <i>Shabbat</i>, <i>chapter, twenty-four.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Shabbat,</i> 156a.</i>
However, we find in the Talmud, in [tractate] <i>Hullin</i>, <i>chapter eight</i>, that mazal does not help one become a communal leader, since the Talmud writes: <i>Abbaye</i> said: the crumbs of bread that a person allows to fall on the ground are the cause of a person’s becoming poor. A <i>story</i> occurred with <i>Abbaye.</i> The angel appointed over poverty, to make people poor, always ran after one person and very much wanted to make him poor, but he was careful to pick up the breadcrumbs from the ground. Once, the same angel saw this person eating on the grass. The angel said: now crumbs will fall into the grass and he won’t be able to pick it up from the earth. Then I will be able to bring him to bring him to account and make him poor. When the person finished eating, he took shovel and dug out the grass with the crumbs and threw the whole thing into the river. The person heard the angel screaming: I thought that I would have rest and make the person and his household <i>poor</i>, since I rest where there is <i>poverty.</i> However, he is very careful with the crumbs and I can’t do anything to him.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Hullin,</i> 105b.</i>
From here we can learn that we should be careful with the crumbs and not to throw them on the ground. From this we can see that even if a person is born with the mazal to be a <i>communal leader</i> and with his evil <i>deeds</i> he <i>changes</i> the mazal to have poverty, when he is not careful with the crumbs. The same is true of a person who is born with the <i>mazal for poverty.</i> If he is pious and gives charity, he will become rich, as the verse says, “<i>you shall set aside a tenth</i>” [Deuteronomy 14:22]. The one who gives the tithe should expect that he will become wealthy and will be worthy to give the tithe forever. The Holy One wrote explicitly, give charity and you will become rich. Test me, says the Holy One, if I will not give you much wealth if you will give charity.
There are many <i>mazalot</i> that indicate something about a person. The Talmud says in [tractate] <i>Shabbat</i> that a person born in the <i>mazal</i> of <i>Mars</i> must be a slaughterer or a surgeon who bleeds the veins. He can also be a robber who attacks people and spills more blood. He can also be a <i>mohel</i> who circumcises children, since the <i>mazal</i> of <i>Mars</i> points to the shedding of blood. Therefore, he must be one of the above described, expecting that he should spill blood. <i>Rabbah</i> said: I was born under the <i>mazal</i> of <i>Mars. Abbaye</i> said to him: you also shed blood. When someone disagrees with you, you want to excommunicate him. He can easily die in that state.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Shabbat,</i> 156a.</i> We find many times that <i>rabbis</i> killed people by looking at them. We will make the remarks brief. However, the person should fulfill commandments and give charity and he will be able to <i>change</i> [his <i>mazal</i>] for good.
The Talmud writes in [tractate] <i>Sanhedrin</i> concerning the verse “<i>He has roused a victor from the east</i>” [41:2]. They said to Eliezer the servant of Abraham. With what did Abraham defeat all the nations and kings of the east and west? Eliezer answered: The Holy One brought Abraham to Himself and seated him near Himself, at his right hand. He threw earth and it became swords and he threw straw at them and they became arrows and all the enemies were killed.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Sanhedrin,</i> 108b.</i>
A <i>story</i> happened to <i>Nahum gam zu.</i> He was called <i>gam zu</i> [this too], because he always said <i>gam zu le-tovah</i> [this too is for good] about whatever happened to him, whether for good or evil. Once the Jews wanted to send the king a present. They said: let us send it with <i>Nahum gam zu.</i> He came to an inn to spend the night. Some people came to the same hostel and took the gold or silver out of his sack and put earth into it. He knew nothing about this. He came to the king and gave him the sack with earth. The king wanted to have him killed. When they were taking him out to be killed, Elijah the prophet, disguised as a nobleman, came and said to the king. This earth is from your ancestor Abraham who used it to defeat many strong kings. There was a strong city that the king wanted to conquer. He could not defeat it for many years. They tried this earth against this city and the walls collapsed as soon as they threw the earth on the walls of the city. The king immediately filled all the sacks of <i>Nahum gam zu</i> with gold. He came back to the hostel. They asked him how things went and he told them the story. They took the earth and brought it to the same king. They thought that the king would also give them gold and silver for this. When they arrived, the earth was tested and it would not destroy. The same people who brought the earth were put to death.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Sanhedrin</i>, 108b-109a.</i>
The <i>Tanhuma</i> writes about the verse in the portion, “<i>He who announced the generations from the start</i>” [41:4]. If people would be pious, then the Holy One would give each one a name. When the Holy One sees that a righteous person will be born, he gives that righteous person a name, as we find concerning <i>Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob</i>, that the Holy One gave each one a good name and so too for other righteous people.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanhuma</i> (Buber ed.), <i>Bereshit</i>, 30.</i>

The <i>students</i> went to <i>Rabbi Meir</i> and told him the story. Rabbi Meir said: I told you to beware of Kidur. The students said: how did you know? Rabbi Meir said: from his name.

This means, Abraham, who was thrown into the fiery oven, just like a goldsmith works with fire. “<i>He says, the joining is good</i>” [41:7].

The straw said: the field was sown for my sake. The wheat responded: the time will come when you will admit that I am better than you are. When the time comes to thresh, the wheat grain is taken and beautifully laid in a <i>treasury</i> and the straw is burned. In this way, the nations argue with Israel. Each one says they are better. <i>Israel</i> responds that a time will come when you will admit that I am better, as the verse says, “<i>You shall winnow and the wind shall carry them off, etc.</i>” [41:16].

<b>[II Kings 4:1–37]</b>
“A certain woman, the wife of one of the disciples of the prophets, etc.” [4:1]. A <i>righteous man</i>, named <i>Obadiah</i>, hid two hundred <i>prophets</i> in a cave when <i>the wife of king Ahab</i> wanted to kill all of them. This <i>Obadiah</i> did not have the money to feed the <i>prophets.</i> He borrowed money from <i>Yehoram</i>, the son of <i>Ahab</i>, and paid him much <i>interest</i> for the money. That is why <i>Yehoram</i> was shot in his hands, because he took interest with his hands.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Exodus Rabbah,</i> 31.4.</i> The sin of taking interest was very great, as we find with <i>the prophet Ezekiel.</i> He was able to resurrect many thousands of people, but Ezekiel could not resurrect one person. Ezekiel asked the Holy One, why does this one not want to resurrected? The Holy One responded that he had taken much interest from Jews in his day. Therefore, he must remain dead forever.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Pirke de Rabbi Eliezer</i>, chap. 33.</i> It will be the same in the days of the <i>Messiah.</i> When there will be the resurrection of the dead, those who charged interest will not be resurrected. In the <i>haftorah</i> also, <i>Yehoram</i> came and wanted to recover the money he had lent <i>Obadiah</i>, but <i>Obadiah</i> had died. <i>Yehoram</i> wanted to take away two of Obadiah’s children for his <i>debt.</i> Obadiah’s wife came to <i>Elisha</i> and said to him that Yehoram wanted to take away the two children to be servants.
“<i>Elisha said to her, what can I do for you, etc.</i>” [4:2]. Elisha said to the woman. What should I do for you? Tell me, what do you have in the house? She said: I have nothing in the house except for a small jug with a little bit of oil in it. Elisha said: go to your neighbors and borrow empty vessels from them, as many as you can.
“<i>Then go in and shut the door, etc.</i>” [4:4]. You should go into your house and you should close the door, out of respect for the miracle, so that people should not see it. The <i>miracle</i> cannot happen when people will see it. As soon as you have filled one <i>vessel</i> move the <i>vessel</i> away. However, the jug that had the oil in it, that is, the first jug that had a little oil in it, do not move it from its place. It will become a source well, and just like a well cannot be moved from its place, so too should not the first jug that had a little oil in it. The woman closed the door and she and her children were in the house alone and they filled all the vessels full of oil.
“<i>When the vessels were full, she said to her son, etc.</i>” [4:6]. The <i>Talmud</i><sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">This story is found in a Targum quoted by Radak in his commentary on II Kings 4:1–6. I did not find a Talmudic source.</i> writes that when all the vessels were filled with oil, the woman said. Gather all the broken vessels, the shards. The God who commanded that all the empty vessels should be full of oil, should command that all the shards should gather together and become whole so that one should be able to fill them. He picked up the shards and put them together and they became whole and they were filled with oil. The son then said that there were no more vessels and as soon as he spoke, the oil stopped flowing.
“<i>She came and told the man of God, etc.</i>” [4:7]. The woman came and wanted to ask the advice of Elisha. Should she wait until oil became more expensive? Elisha, the man of God, answered her. Sell the oil. There will be enough to pay your debts and to feed your children with the remaining oil.
“<i>One day Elisha visited Shunem, etc.</i>” [4:8]. One day, Elisha came to a city called <i>Shunem.</i> A wealthy woman lived there. She was the sister of <i>Abishag</i> the <i>Shunamite</i>, the maiden who had been with <i>King David.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Pirke de Rabbi Eliezer</i>, chap. 33; <i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, II Kings, <i>Remez</i>, 228.</i> This same woman asked Elisha that he should eat with her and he would always eat with her, whenever he passed through the city.
“<i>She said to her husband, I am sure it is a holy man of God, etc.</i>” [4:9]. The woman said to her husband. It is well known that this <i>Elisha</i> is a holy man, since no fly lands on his table when he eats and there are no traces of <i>seminal emission</i> on his bed. You know that he is a holy man and he comes often to us. It is appropriate to make a separate chamber for his private use when he comes to us.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Berakhot,</i> 10b.</i>
“<i>Let us make a small enclosed upper chamber, etc.</i>” [4:10]. We will make a separate chamber and we will place in it a bed, a table, a chair and a lamp stand, so he can stay there when he visits us. One day Elisha came and went into the chamber and lay down there. Elisha said to his servant, <i>Gehazi.</i> Call the <i>Shunamite</i> woman. He called her and she stood before him. Elisha said to her. You have exerted yourself on our behalf, to provide us with a separate chamber. How can we repay you for this? Do you have something to speak to the king or with the commander of the army? She responded, “<i>I live among my own people</i>” [4:13]. That is to say, I dwell among my own <i>family.</i> If I were to need someone to speak, they will speak for me. “<i>He said, what can be done for her? Gehazi said, etc.</i>” [4:14]. <i>Elisha</i> asked, how can we repay the <i>favor</i> that she has done for us? <i>Gehazi</i> responded, in truth she has no son. If you think she will still have children, her husband is very old and can die today or tomorrow. Elisha said: Call the woman in here and he called her. She stood in the door.
“<i>He said: at this season next year, etc.</i>” [4:16]. Elisha said to the woman. You will have a son, next year at this time. The woman said: dear sir, man of God, do not <i>make fun</i> of me by offering me a <i>present</i> that will not be fulfilled. That is to say, you tell me that I will have a son who will soon die. Do you want to ask God that He should give me a son who will remain alive? The woman became pregnant and had a son in the time that the <i>prophet</i> had said. He child grew and he went to his father, to the reapers in the field.
“<i>He said to his father, my head, my head, etc.</i>” [4:19]. The youth shouted to his father, father, my head hurts. The father said to the youths, carry him to his mother, and they carried him to his mother. He sat on his mother’s lap until noon and he died.
“<i>She took him and laid him on the bed, etc.</i>” [4:21]. The mother took her dead child and laid it on the bed in Elisha’s room. She called her husband and said: give me a youth and a donkey. I will run to the prophet and return soon. She did not tell him that the child had died. Her husband said to the woman. Why are you going to him? It is not the <i>Sabbath</i> or the <i>New Moon.</i> That is to say, from here we learn that people would go to the <i>rabbi</i> or the <i>prophet</i> on the <i>Sabbath</i> and <i>New Moon.</i> The woman said to her husband, it is <i>good.</i> That is, she did not want to tell about the child and that is why she was going to the prophet.
“<i>The donkey was saddled and she said to the youth, etc.</i>” [4:24]. She rode on the donkey and told the youth, lead the donkey quickly and don’t slow me down. She came to the <i>prophet</i> on Mount <i>Carmel</i> and as soon as the <i>prophet</i> saw her, he said to <i>Gehazi</i>, his servant. The <i>Shunamite</i> is coming. Run to her and ask if she, her husband, and her child are <i>well.</i> She said: we are <i>well.</i>
“<i>When she came up to the man of God on the mountain</i>” [4:27]. The <i>Shunamite</i> came to the man of God and fell on his feet. <i>Gehazi</i> came and wanted to lead her away. He thought that it was not <i>respectful</i> for her to fall on the feet of the <i>prophet.</i> The <i>prophet</i> said to his youth, <i>Gehazi.</i> Let her stay. She is bitterly distressed and God has hidden from me and did not tell me about it until now, when she fell on his feet.
“<i>She said: Did I ask for a son from my lord?</i>” [4:28]. The woman said to Elisha. Did I ask for a son from God? I had said at first, you should not <i>deceive</i> me.
“<i>He said to Gehazi: gird up your loins, etc.</i>” [4:29]. <i>Elisha</i> said to his servant <i>Gehazi.</i> Gird your loins and take my staff in your hand and when you will meet a person, do not greet them. Whoever will greet you, do not respond, and put my staff on the child’s face. He also commanded him that he should not tarry on the way. The <i>Midrash</i> writes that the staff was a joke in <i>Gehazi</i>’<i>s</i> eyes. He said: is it possible that the staff will make a dead person come to life. This is what <i>Gehazi</i> said to every person that he encountered and said: do you believe that the staff brings to life?<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Pirke de Rabbi Eliezer</i>, chap. 33.</i>
“<i>The boy</i>’<i>s mother said: as the Lord lives, and as you live, etc.</i>” [4:30]. The mother said to Elisha. As God lives and by your life, I will not leave you. You must go with me. <i>Elisha</i> went with her. <i>Gehazi</i> ran ahead and put the staff on the dead child, and he did not move. <i>Gehazi</i> ran toward <i>Elisha</i> and said: the child won’t get up or wake up. That is, he remains dead. <i>Elisha</i> came to the house and the child lay dead on his bed.
“<i>He went in and shut the door behind the two of them, etc.</i>” [4:33]. Elisha went and locked the door and he was alone with the child in the room. <i>Elisha</i> prayed to God, and he lay down on the child and placed his mouth on the child’s mouth and his eyes on his eyes, and his hands on his hands and spread his <i>body</i> on the child’s and he warmed the child. <i>Elisha</i> paced back and forth in the room.
“<i>He got on top of him and bent over him, etc.</i>” [4:35]. <i>Elisha</i> got on top of the child and spread himself over the child. The child sneezed seven times consecutively and opened its eyes. <i>Elisha</i> called his servant <i>Gehazi</i> and said to him, call the <i>Shunamite. Gehazi</i> called her and she came to <i>Elisha</i>, who said, take you son. She came and fell on his feet and bowed down to the ground. She took her son and left.
<i>Pirke Rabbi Eliezer</i> writes about this haftorah. “<i>One day Elisha visited Shunem</i>” [4:8]. <i>Rabbi Joshua the son of Korhah</i> said: the <i>dead</i> are revived in the days of the <i>Messiah</i>, because of the <i>merit of giving charity.</i> This happened here with <i>Elisha</i>, but no woman could see it. Whatever woman saw his face would die. Elisha hid himself from the women and went from mountain to mountain and from one cave to the other. He came to the city of <i>Shunem</i>, to an <i>important</i> woman, who <i>honored</i> him greatly. The woman said to her husband. No woman can look at the face of the holy man, since they would die. Therefore, let me build him a separate chamber in the attic and when he will come to the city, he can stay in the room alone. They built the chamber and he was always there when he came to the city. Afterwards, when he would call the <i>Shunamite</i>, she would stand in the door, since she was afraid that she would die, if she would see his face. Afterwards, when the child died, it was revived because of the merit of the charity with which she honored Elisha.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Pirke de Rabbi Eliezer</i>, chap. 33.</i>
The Talmud writes in [tractate] <i>Berakhot</i>, about the verse “<i>she said to her husband, I know that, etc.</i>” [4:9]. Rabbi <i>Yose the son of Hanina</i> said. We learn from this verse that a woman in her house recognizes whether guests are good or bad, much more than the <i>husband. Rabbi Yose the son of Hanina</i> further said in the name of <i>Rabbi Eliezer the son of Jacob.</i> A person who <i>honors</i> a <i>scholar</i> in his house and gives him food and drink and gives him a <i>present</i>, it is like he had brought the daily offering. We learn this from the verse “<i>he comes this way regularly</i>” [4:9].<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Berakhot,</i> 10b. The Hebrew for “daily offering” is “<i>tamid</i>” and the verse also uses the term “<i>tamid</i>” [regularly]. The homily is built on the two uses of the word “<i>tamid.</i>”</i>
In the <i>haftorah</i> it says that the <i>Shunamite</i> made a bed, a table, a chair, and a lamp for <i>Elisha.</i> This is, one who receives guests, his house is like the “<i>Mishkan</i>” [Tabernacle] in that the <i>Shekhinah</i> rests there. The word “<i>MiShKaN</i>” points to these four things. M is <i>mitah</i> [bed], Sh is <i>shulkhan</i> [table], K is <i>kisei</i> [chair], and N is <i>ner</i> [lamp].
<i>Genesis Rabbah</i> writes. Why does it say concerning Abraham that the <i>angel</i> said, “<i>I will return to you at the time</i>” [Genesis, 18:14]. This means, at this time in one year, I will come again and Sarah will have a son. Concerning <i>Elisha</i> it is written, “<i>at this season, those who will be alive at that time, you will be embracing a son</i>” [II Kings 4:16]. This means, at this time, those who will be alive at that time, you will be embracing a son who will live. Why does he say, who will be alive? The explanation is: concerning Abraham, the angels live forever. Therefore, they said, in that time, Sarah will have a son in one year. They did not need to say, “<i>who will be alive</i>,” since they live forever. However, Elisha was a person who would die. Therefore, he says, “<i>who will be alive</i>,” it will happen if he will live.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Genesis Rabbah,</i> 53.2.</i>

<b>[I Kings 1:1–31]</b>
“<i>King David was old and advanced in years</i>” [1:1]. <i>King David</i> was seventy years old. He became king when he was thirty and he was king for forty years. Here one asks a question. Why does Scripture call him old? Was seventy a great age? The answer is that he was weak as someone a hundred years old, because he had waged many wars with the nations. Therefore, he was weak. They covered him with clothes, but he did not feel warm. The Midrash writes that any person who shames the clothes and does not treat them properly, his own clothes do not keep him warm.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Berakhot,</i> 62b; <i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, I Kings, <i>Remez</i> 166.</i> <i>King David</i> cut off the garment of <i>King Saul.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">I Samuel, 24:5.</i> Therefore, his garments did not warm him and he was always cold.

“<i>His servants said to him: let a young virgin be brought, etc.</i>” [1:2]. His servants said to King David, let us to search for the most beautiful maiden, who is a virgin. Let her to stand before you and she will warm you. She will make you warm when you are cold, specifically, a beautiful maiden because she warms well. Only a virgin who has never slept with a man in her whole life, because this makes her warm in her body all the time, because of the virginity that is in her body. The same maiden can make you warm and you should warm yourself from her body. However, you should not sleep with her and remove her virginity, since she would not keep you as warm. Also, our sages said that he took a virgin and he would not sleep with her. He had eighteen wives and he was not supposed to take any more.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">M. <i>Sanhedrin,</i> 2.4. According to the <i>Mishnah</i>, this was the maximum number allowed.</i> From this we learn that a young woman does not make her husband warm, if she does not have her virginity. <i>Even more so</i>, how should an old woman make him warm? Therefore, the servants gave him good advice that he should take a young virgin. She is called a child until the age of twelve and she can be called a virgin until the age of thirty. That is why it says, “<i>a young virgin</i>” [1:2].
“<i>They searched for a beautiful girl throughout the territory of Israel, etc.</i>” [1:3]. They searched for a beautiful maiden and they found a maiden who was called <i>Abishag the Shunamite.</i> They brought her to King David and she served him, but the king did not want to sleep with her, expecting that she should keep him warm; she should keep her virginity.
“<i>Adonijah, the son of Haggith went about boasting, etc.</i>” [1:5]. One son was called Adonijah. King David was very disheartened about him, but never punished him, all his days. Therefore, he was prideful and wanted to be king. He took a chariot and horses and fifty men went before him. He cut out the spleens from these men and cut away the flesh from the bottoms of their feet so that they could run more swiftly.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Sanhedrin,</i> 21b.</i> Adonijah was a handsome man and prided himself on it.

“<i>He conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah, etc.</i>” [1:7]. Adonijah spoke with Joab the son of Zeruiah. He <i>agreed</i> with Adonijah and wanted to make him king. <i>Joab</i> was one of David’s chieftains and had killed <i>Abner</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">II Samuel, 3:27.</i> who was a <i>warrior</i> and a <i>scholar.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">J. <i>Peah,</i> 1.1.</i> David did not want to kill Joab during his lifetime, but he left in his will to his son who would become king after his death, that he should take revenge against Joab.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">I Kings, 2:5.</i> Therefore, Joab wanted to associate himself with Adonijah and wanted to help make him king, in the expectation that Adonijah would have mercy on Joab and would not kill him, even though King David had asked it to be done. Joab had killed three people, <i>Abner</i>, <i>Osias,</i> and <i>Absalom.</i> Therefore, he wanted to flatter Adonijah. <i>Abiathar</i> the <i>priest</i> also <i>agreed</i> with making <i>Adonijah</i> king, because David had refused to make him <i>high priest</i> and made <i>Zadok</i> the <i>high priest.</i> Adonijah did not speak to <i>Zadok</i> the high <i>priest</i> or to <i>Benaiah</i> or to <i>Nathan the prophet</i>, or to <i>Shimei</i>, <i>Rei</i>, and David’s other warriors. None of them were with Adonijah.
“<i>Adonijah sacrificed sheep, oxen, and fatlings, etc.</i>” [1:9]. Adonijah slaughtered fat sheep and cattle near a large stone called <i>Even Hazolahet.</i> Why was it called <i>Even Hazolahet?</i> That is because young men would attempt to move the stone.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, I Kings, 1:9.</i> The one who could move it, would be a hero.

“<i>Nathan said to Bathsheba, Solomon</i>’<i>s mother, etc.</i>” [1:11]. The prophet came to <i>Bathsheba</i>, <i>Solomon</i>’<i>s</i> mother, and said to her. Do you know that <i>Adonijah</i> wants to be king and <i>David</i> our lord does not know about it?
“<i>Now, take my advice, etc.</i>” [1:12]. Therefore, I am now giving you advice. You should escape, so that there should not be great quarrels after the death of <i>King David.</i> Your son, <i>Solomon</i>, will want to be king, as the Holy One promised him that he would be king. Now, when <i>Adonijah</i> will become king and will have <i>warriors</i>, <i>Solomon</i> will have to wage war with <i>Adonijah</i> for the <i>kingship.</i> It will also be a disgrace for you that you will have to serve <i>Adonijah.</i> Therefore, I am advising you, go immediately to <i>King David</i> and say to him. You swore to me that my son Solomon would be king after your death. Why has your son <i>Adonijah</i> become king? Here one asks a question. Why did <i>King David</i> swear that the son that she would have would become king and who forced David to take an oath? The answer is that the first child that <i>Bathsheba</i> had with David died. The whole world said that it died because of the sin that David committed, that he allowed <i>Uriah</i> to be killed and took his wife Bathsheba to be his wife. Therefore, <i>Bathsheba</i> said to David. If I will have children with you and they will live, then the people will shame these children and will humiliate them. Therefore, I do not want to sleep with you. David became frightened and swore to her that her first son who will live would become king after his death. Now, <i>Nathan</i> the prophet knew everything <i>prophetically</i>, that David had taken an oath that the firstborn son of <i>Bathsheba</i> would become king, and Solomon was the firstborn son of <i>Bathsheba.</i> Therefore, Nathan said, go to David and while you are speaking with David, I will come and support your words.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, I Kings, 1:13.</i>
“<i>And Bathsheba came to the king in his chamber, etc.</i>” [1:15]. Bathsheba came to the king in his chamber where Abishag the beautiful maiden was lying with David in one bed. The verse teaches us that nobody had permission to enter the room where David lay with <i>Abishag.</i> However, because <i>Bathsheba</i> was a queen, she went in without permission and did not fear to enter the chamber.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, I Kings, 1:15.</i> <i>Bathsheba</i> bowed to the king. The king said to her: what do you desire? She said: <i>my lord king</i>, you swore to me that Solomon your son should sit on the royal throne and now <i>Adonijah</i> has become king. You, <i>my lord king</i>, know nothing about this. He has slaughtered many sheep and cattle and has called all the children of the king and also called <i>Abiathar the priest</i> and he has also called <i>Joab</i> the chieftain, but your son, <i>Solomon</i>, he did not call. The reason Adonijah made this banquet is because he wants to be king. That is why he did not invite Solomon to the <i>banquet.</i> He invited all those people to the banquet who would help him become king. You, <i>my lord king</i>, know well that <i>all of Israel</i> is looking to you, whom will you say the king should be.
“<i>When my lord king lies down, etc.</i>” [1:21]. When you, <i>my lord King</i> David will die, like your ancestors, then I and my son Solomon will have misfortune. Some sages say: if Solomon will not become king, people will say that it was because of the sin of David, who took <i>Bathsheba</i> from <i>Uriah the Hittite</i> as a wife and that is why Solomon did not become king. Some sages say, “<i>sins</i>” means, Bathsheba said: when you, David, won’t make Solomon king, you will commit a sin. You swore that you would make Solomon king.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, I Kings, 1:21.</i>
As they were talking, <i>Nathan the prophet</i> arrived. They told the king that the prophet had arrived. He came in and bowed low to the floor, to the king. The <i>prophet Nathan</i> said: <i>my lord king</i>, did you say that <i>Adonijah</i> should be king after you and should sit on the throne? I have heard that he has slaughtered many sheep and cattle and is making a great banquet and has invited all the children of the king, also, the chieftain, and <i>Abiathar the priest.</i> They are now eating and drinking and they are saying, long live the <i>king Adonijah.</i> He did not invite me, <i>Zadok the priest</i>, <i>Benaiah</i>, and <i>Solomon</i> to the banquet. Is it your opinion, <i>my lord king</i>, that <i>Adonijah</i> should be the king? You did not notify me who should be king after you.
“<i>King David responded and said, call Bathsheba, etc.</i>” [1:28]. When <i>Nathan the prophet</i> came in to David, Bathsheba, as it were, left, so that people should not notice that she and <i>Nathan the prophet</i> had spoken about this previously. Therefore, the king responded to <i>Nathan the prophet</i> and said that <i>Bathsheba</i> should be called. <i>Bathsheba</i> came and stood before the king. The king took an oath and said: “<i>as God lives</i>,” the God who protected me from all my troubles, I swore to you by the God of Israel that Solomon should be king in my place. This should happen this very day. She bowed to the ground twice, to the king. She said: may my lord King David live forever.
The <i>Tanhuma</i> writes about the haftorah, “<i>King David was old and advanced in years</i>” [1:1]. Where do we find someone who is worthy to be old and hoary? Scripture answers, “<i>it is attained by the way of righteousness</i>” [Proverbs, 16:31].<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">The first part of this verse is, “<i>Gray hair is a crown of glory.</i>”</i> That is to say, one who gives charity lives long. Concerning this, we find that it says about <i>Abraham our Patriarch</i>, “<i>to keep the way of the Lord by doing what is just and right</i>” [Genesis, 18:19]. He gave charity and therefore he was worthy to be old, as the verse says, “<i>Abraham was old, advanced in years</i>” [Genesis, 24:1]. It is also written here, “<i>David administered justice and equity to all his people</i>” [II Samuel, 8:15]. Therefore, he was worthy to attain old age, as the verse says, “<i>King David was old and advanced in years</i>” [I Kings, 1:1]. King Solomon showed this in the Book of Ecclesiastes, “<i>cast your bread upon the waters, for after many days you will find it</i>” [Ecclesiastes, 11:1]. That is to say, give your bread to the poor, just like somebody who throws it in the water and he gives up on it. You should give charity in the same way and not for the reward. <i>Give up hope</i> and only give it out of goodness. “<i>For after many days, you will find it</i>” [Ecclesiastes, 11:1].<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanhuma</i>, <i>Hayyei Sarah</i>, 4.</i> That is, you will have the opportunity to give for many days. This means, you will find your reward from your giving of bread to the poor and you will have many good days. When a person gives charity in the expectation that he will be rich and have much wealth then God gives him much wealth. However, when a person gives charity out of goodness, he lives long.
The Talmud writes in [tractate] <i>Megillah: Rabbi Jacob</i> says in the name of <i>Rabbi Yohanan. Abishag</i> was permitted to King Solomon as a wife, because Solomon was a king. He was allowed to sleep with the queen of another king. If you wanted to say that <i>Abishag</i> was his father’s wife, the answer is that David did not sleep with her. She only warmed him in the bed. However, Adonijah should not have taken her as a wife, because he was a commoner, that is to say, not a king. He should not take a queen as a wife.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">It is found in B. <i>Sanhedrin,</i> 22a and <i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, I Kings, <i>Remez</i> 166. The previous footnote in the <i>Yalkut</i> refers to tractate <i>Megillah.</i></i>
The Talmud says in [tractate] <i>Yoma:</i> People asked David, why don’t you sleep with Abishag like with other wives? He responded: it is forbidden to me, as I have eighteen wives. I would have gladly taken her. The people responded with a parable. The thief who has nothing to steal makes himself very righteous. That is to say, he never stole anything in his whole life. Similarly with you, David, you do not have the strength to sleep with women, so you make yourself pious. David immediately wanted to show that he was right and that he did this because the Holy One had forbidden her to him. He told them to call <i>Bathsheba</i> to his chamber and he would show that he was capable of sleeping with his wives.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, I Kings, <i>Remez</i> 166.</i> The Talmud in [tractate] <i>Sanhedrin</i> says concerning “<i>and the maiden was exceedingly [ad meod] beautiful</i>” [1:4]. <i>Rabbi Haninah the son of Papa</i> says that Abishag was not half as beautiful as Sarah. That is why here it is written “<i>ad meod</i>,”<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, until exceedingly.</i> that is, until almost very beautiful, but not completely.

The <i>Jerusalem Talmud</i> writes in tractate <i>Peah.

The Talmud writes in [tractate] <i>Baba Kamma, chapter eight</i>, concerning the verse “<i>he did not invite me your servant or Zadok the priest</i>” [1:26]. From here we learn that sixty illnesses come to the wisdom teeth of one who sees eating and he does not eat. As a result, this tooth must be weak, as it is written, <i>Nathan the prophet</i> said to the king, all the servants of the king were invited to eat and I was not invited, said.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">I Kings, 1:25–26.</i> Other <i>sages</i> say there in the Talmud that we learn this from Abraham. It is written, “<i>Isaac brought her into the tent</i>” [Genesis, 24:67]. Abraham saw that his son had a wife. He became jealous and also wanted to take a wife. Therefore, it says immediately afterwards, “<i>Abraham took another wife</i>” [Genesis, 25:1]. That is, because Abraham saw Isaac take a wife, he also wanted to take a wife.

Toldot

<b>[Malachi, 1:1–2:7]</b>
“<i>The word of the Lord to Israel by Malachi</i>” [1:1]. From here, our sages learn that all the prophets that existed in the world stood on Mount Sinai. There on Mount Sinai, the Holy One gave the soul of each <i>prophet</i> its <i>prophecies</i> that they would <i>prophesy</i> when their time came to be born.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Exodus Rabbah,</i> 28.6.</i> Concerning this, it is written here, “<i>by Malachi.</i>” That is to say, a <i>prophecy</i> that I commanded to <i>Malachi, my prophet</i>, on Mount Sinai, how he should punish Israel. Now, he should prophesy these prophecies to Israel, to punish them.
“<i>I have loved you, says the Lord</i>” [1:2]. God says, I love you, and you will say: with what does He love us? Is not Esau a brother to Jacob, says God? I have loved Jacob and I hate Esau. I will expel Esau from the Holy Land. I will give the Holy Land to you, Jacob. With this it will be recognized that I love you.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Malachi, 1:2.</i> A parable. A person has two sons. He gives the older one the best land as an inheritance. In the same way, I will give the <i>land of Israel</i>, the good land, to Israel.
“<i>I will make his hills a desolation and his heritage, etc.</i>” [1:3]. The cities of Esau, that is Mount <i>Seir</i>, will also be desolate. They will never properly occupy their cities. Your land, the <i>land of Israel</i> that is now desolate and in exile, will again be rebuilt in the days of the <i>Messiah.</i> With this, it will be seen that I love you more than Esau.
“<i>If Esau says, we are shattered, etc.</i>” [1:4]. If Esau will say, we were poor before, but now we have become rich from plunder that we robbed from the city of Jerusalem, and with it we will build our city that was devastated. However, the Holy One said, they will build and I will tear down and devastate what they will build. They are called evildoers. I have commanded Israel that they should not harm Edom, as the verse says, “<i>you shall not abhor an Edomite</i>” [Deuteronomy 23:8]. You should not abhor an Edomite. Those Edomites who are just should also have compassion for Israel. However, they have done everything bad to Israel and rejoiced over the <i>destruction of Jerusalem.</i> They are called a nation that angers God forever.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Malachi, 1:4.</i>
“<i>Your own eyes will see this and you will say</i>” [1:5]. Your eyes will see and you will say that He is showing His <i>greatness</i> and His importance to our land. That is, He shows Israel that we are His beloved people.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Malachi, 1:5.</i>
“<i>A son honors his father and a servant his master, etc.</i>” [1:6]. The Holy One says, the custom is that a son honors his father and a servant honors his master. Israel are called children of the Holy One and servants of the Holy One. Now, when I am your Father and your Master, why do you not honor me? Where is my honor? The <i>priests</i> have shamed My honor and My name. I know well that you will say, with what have we have shamed Your name? I will show you with what you have shamed My name. You bring reprehensible <i>sacrifices</i> on my <i>altar.</i>
“<i>You offer defiled food on the altar, etc.</i>” [1:7]. You have offered unclean and unholy <i>sacrifices</i> on my <i>altar.</i> If you will say, how have we polluted the sacrifice? I will tell you, with your saying that this altar is like God’s table. How is it appropriate that we should offer blood and fat, which are disgusting, on the table of the Holy One? However, you <i>priests</i> should have thought about why the Holy One commanded to bring blood and fat on His table.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Malachi, 1:7.</i>
“<i>When you offer blind animals on the altar, is that not wrong, etc.?</i>” [1:8]. You priests, when a person brings you a blind sheep as a sacrifice, you do not say that it is wrong to bring it as a sacrifice. Similarly, you do not say that it is wrong to offer a lame sheep as a sacrifice. You priests are supposed to tell the people not to bring sheep that are forbidden, as the Torah expressly says, “<i>blind or lame</i>” [Leviticus 22:22]. That is to say, a blind sheep should not be brought as a sacrifice.
“<i>Try presenting that to your governor, will he be pleased with you?</i>” [1:8]. The Holy One said: if you would bring a sheep with a blind eye or a broken leg as a <i>present</i> to your king or your governor and you wanted to ask that same king or governor for a favor for this present? The present would certainly not be accepted and he would be angry with that person. How is it that you would bring a sacrifice to the <i>King of Kings?</i> Similarly, when somebody donates something to <i>charity</i>, he should also give the best item.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Malachi, 1:8.</i>
“<i>Now implore the favor of God, that He may be gracious to you, etc.</i>” [1:9]. The prophet said to the priests. How should your opinion continue that you would be the <i>representatives</i> to plead for Israel before the Holy One because you priests have done evil and brought impure sacrifices with defects? How should the Holy One have compassion for us? If the Holy One would ignore your transgressions and will accept your reprsentations from the priests and tolerate their prayers.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Malachi, 1:9.</i>
“<i>If only you would lock the Temple doors and not kindle fires on my altar for nothing</i>” [1:10]. The prophet said to the priests. Which one of you will be a good man and stand up to lock the doors of the <i>Temple</i> and <i>altar</i>, that you should not allow unworthy <i>sacrifices</i> with defects, to be brought.

“<i>From the rising of the sun to its setting, etc.</i>” [1:11]. The Holy One said: from the east where the sun rises until the setting of the sun, that is to say, in the whole world My name is respected among all the nations. Even though they worship <i>idols</i>, the moon, sun and the stars, yet they know that I am God over the whole world, over the moon, sun, and the stars of heaven, but they desire from the moon, sun or stars that through them the Holy One should fulfill their desires.

“<i>Cursed be the one who has a male in his flock and vows it, etc.</i>” [1:14]. Cursed be the person who is despicable. He has a good male sheep in his herd of many sheep that is worthy to be offered as a <i>burnt offering</i> [<i>olah</i>], and he conceals the good sheep. He makes a vow to bring a sacrifice with a defect, to God, even though I am a great King and my name is revered among many nations.
“<i>And now, this commandment is for you, the priests</i>” [2:1]. Now to you, I command you priests that you should not offer such sacrifices, with defects.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Malachi, 2:1.</i>
“<i>If you will not listen, and if you will not put it in your heart, etc.</i>” [2:2]. If you priests will not listen to my words to give honor to My holy name, thus says the Holy One. I will send my curse on you and I will curse your blessings. That is to say, in place of blessing your grain, I will curse it. Though I have long cursed your grain, I will increase the curse greatly, because you have brought blind and lame <i>sacrifices</i> and will no longer listen to Me and take these words to heart.
“<i>I will rebuke your seed, etc.</i>” [2:3]. I will spoil your grain that you have sown and will spread your animals’ dung on your faces. That is to say, the sacrifices that you bring so gladly; you shame Me with them. I will spread the dung of the animals that you bring as sacrifices on your faces. <i>Measure for measure.</i> You should receive no blessing from them.
“<i>You shall be carried out to it</i>” [2:3].

Therefore, the Holy One made a covenant with him. I also did a great favor for Phinehas and he lived long, for three hundred years.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Malachi, 2:5.</i>

The verse means and points to the ideas of the nations that they think up evil ideas against Israel, but the Holy One foils these ideas. This is the meaning of the verse. They will build and I, God, will tear down these same buildings. The gentile responded: it is so. Every year the nations sit down and suggest ideas to destroy Israel.

I did not want to give you a king of My own free will; that is <i>King Saul.</i> I took that king away with My wrath and he was killed at the hands of the <i>Philistines</i> in the <i>war.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Hosea, 13:11.</i>

“<i>Pangs of childbirth assail me</i>” [13:13]. A woman has many great pains during childbirth and many great troubles will come upon <i>Ephraim.</i>
“<i>He is a son who is not wise, at the proper time he will not stand at the birth stool</i>” [13:13]. He is not a smart son. He has seen that the fathers have committed sins and had troubles and did not return. If he were a smart son, he would not have sat on the stool where women sit when they have children and where they have great pains and anguish, on that same stool. Thus they should have been smart and pious, even for one moment.
“<i>I shall save them from Sheol, from death will I redeem them</i>” [13:14]. Though I redeemed them from the grave, but now I will speak words against you, words of death.
“<i>Sheol, where are your plagues?</i>” [13:14]. I will cause you to be destroyed in the grave of death.
“<i>Compassion is hidden from my eyes</i>” [13:14]. My consolation and reflection regarding doing evil to you is hidden. That is, I have thought for a while that I do not want to do evil. However, now the same thoughts are hidden for Me. I want to punish you with <i>travails.</i>
“<i>Though he may flourish among rushes</i>” [13:15]. Previously, before <i>Ephraim</i> made the <i>calf</i>, <i>Ephraim</i> was important and great among his brothers, as the verse says, “<i>his younger brother shall be greater than he</i>” [Gen. 48:19]. The younger brother <i>Ephraim</i> will be more respected than Manasseh.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Hosea, 13:15.</i>
“<i>The east wind will come; a blast from the Lord, etc.</i>” [13:15]. However, now because Ephraim has made the <i>calf</i> a wind will come from the <i>east.</i> This is the <i>king of Assyria</i>, who is compared to a strong wind from the <i>east.</i> The wind will be from God. That is to say, the Holy One will awaken the king of <i>Assyria</i> against <i>Israel.</i> Therefore, the verse says, the wind from the east, since the <i>king of Assyria</i> lived to the <i>east</i> of the <i>land of Israel.</i> It also says <i>from the wilderness</i>, since the wind is normally in the wilderness. The same king of Assyria will dry up all the springs of water.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Hosea, 13:15.</i>

“<i>The Vision of Obadiah. Thus says the Lord God to Edom</i>” [1:1]. The <i>prophet Obadiah prophesied.</i> He was born a <i>gentile</i> in <i>Edom</i> who <i>converted</i> and became a prophet. He <i>prophesied</i> how <i>Edom</i> would have a <i>downfall</i> in the days of the <i>Messiah.</i> That is why, someone from <i>Edom prophesied</i> about <i>Edom.</i> That is to say, let someone from <i>Edom</i> come and let him punish <i>Edom</i>, someone who lived among the two <i>evildoers</i>, <i>Ahab</i> and <i>Jezebel</i>, and did not learn from their evil deeds and remained <i>righteous.</i> Therefore, <i>Obadiah</i> should punish <i>Edom</i>, which is <i>Esau</i>, who lived among two <i>righteous people</i>, <i>Isaac</i> and <i>Rebecca</i>, and did not learn from their learn from their good deeds.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Sanhedrin,</i> 39b. Obadiah is also identified with the Obadiah who served Ahab and hid the prophets (I Kings, 18:4).</i>
It is a <i>parable.</i> The goldsmith makes a silver spoon. There comes a time when the goldsmith burns his mouth with the same silver spoon, when the goldsmith eats something very hot, straight from the fire. So too is <i>Obadiah.</i> He came from <i>Edom</i> and <i>Esau</i>, that he should punish <i>Esau</i> and <i>Edom.</i> That is, his own nation of Edom. The <i>prophecy</i> was that when <i>Edom</i> will be <i>destroyed</i>, <i>Israel</i> would be redeemed from the <i>exile.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Obadiah, 1:1.</i>
“<i>We have received tidings from the Lord, and an envoy has been sent out among the nations</i>” [1:1]. The nations will say about Edom. We have heard from God that a messenger has come from God. What are the tidings? All the nations will say, let us arise and we will wage war against Edom for his land.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Obadiah, 1:1.</i>
“<i>I will make you the smallest among nations; you will be most despised</i>” [1:2].

“<i>You who dwell in the clefts of the rocks, in your lofty abode</i>” [1:3]. You <i>Edom</i> dwelled in the hills of Esau atop the mountains. You sat in the heights and thought and said, who will bring me down from the top.
“<i>Should you nest as high as the eagle, and among the stars, etc.</i>” [1:4]. The prophet said: you Edom will not be able to hide even if you go as high as an eagle who flies higher than all the other birds. Should you make your nest among the stars of the heavens, from there will I bring you down, says God.
“<i>If thieves were to come to you, etc.</i>” [1:5]. The nations will be amazed when they see the <i>destruction</i> of Edom, that they are devastated. They will say to Edom, what happened to you? Did thieves come in the night and devastate you when you slept soundly and did not hear and did not oppose them. Even when thieves do come, they steal only until they have enough, but in any event they leave something behind.
“<i>If grape-gatherers came to you, etc.</i>” [1:5]. If the devastators came during the day, just like they would come to clean out a vineyard. They come several times and take away all the grapes in the vineyard. Yet, they forget some grapes under the leaves. However, with you, everything was cleaned out and nothing was forgotten.
“<i>How Edom has been pillaged, his treasures ransacked</i>” [1:6]. How you have been searched in all the hiding places of your <i>treasures.</i> They desired everything you had hidden and it was found.
“<i>All your allies turned you back at the border, etc.</i>” [1:7]. Your good friends who swore to you, have betrayed you and sent you to the ends of your land. You have fallen into the hands of your enemies. Your best friends have betrayed you and given you into the hands of your enemies.
“<i>Those who ate your bread have set a trap for you, there is no understanding, etc.</i>” [1:7]. The same ones, who always ate bread with you, out of great love, will cause you wounds. You will not understand. The counsels to kill you will be taken in secret.
“<i>On that day says the Lord, etc.</i>” [1:8]. The Lord said: in truth there are many sages among Edom, but when your <i>downfall</i> will come, their sages will be destroyed.
“<i>Your warriors will lose heart, Teman, and everyone from Mount Esau will be slaughtered</i>” [1:9]. There are many <i>warriors</i> with swords among Esau. Isaac had given him the blessing “<i>by your sword you shall live</i>” [Genesis, 27:40]. However, when the <i>downfall</i> will come upon Esau, the warriors will be anxious and their hearts will be broken, out of fear, in the expectation that all the people of Esau will be destroyed.
“<i>Cut off</i>” [1:9]. That is, there will be many <i>killings</i> in Edom and all the people of Edom will be cut off.
“<i>For the outrage to your brother Jacob, disgrace will cover you, etc.</i>” [1:10]. Because you Edom behaved unjustly to your brother Jacob, therefore you will be covered with shame and disgrace and will be cut off forever. Edom did much evil to Israel in the destruction of the second <i>Temple.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Obadiah, 1:10.</i>
“<i>On the day that you stood aside, on the day when foreigners carried off</i>” [1:11]. When the <i>evil Titus</i> came against Israel and <i>Jerusalem</i>, Edom rejoiced and also stood on the side to insult Israel and gave Israel into the hands of the people from the city of <i>Rome.</i> You Edom should have helped Israel, since they are your brothers. The Holy One had forbidden in the <i>desert, with Moses our Teacher</i>, that Israel should not do any evil acts to Edom because they are your brothers. During the <i>destruction of Jerusalem</i>, Edom did not think about this brotherhood.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Obadiah, 1:11.</i>
“<i>They cast lots for Jerusalem and you were as one of them</i>” [1:11]. When <i>Jerusalem was destroyed</i>, the <i>nations cast lots</i> to divide up the <i>treasures</i> of Israel and <i>shared</i> them among each other. You Edom, if you had not shared in the division, you would not have tormented us and rejoiced over our downfall. Therefore, you will be as good as those other nations, since you have done the same to Israel.
“<i>You should not have gloated over your brother, on the day of his misfortune</i>” [1:12]. You Edom should not have looked at the misfortune of your brother on the day that he was taken to a foreign land. You should not have rejoiced over the children of <i>Judah</i> on the day of their defeat.
“<i>You should not have boasted on the day of distress</i>” [1:12]. You Edom should not have opened your mouth so wide with laughter and mockery on the day of suffering.
“<i>You should not have come into the cities of my people, etc.</i>” [1:13]. You Edom should not have come into the gates of my people Israel, to see their <i>destruction.</i> It is nothing new that other nations came to see our destruction, since they are foreign nations. They are not our brothers. However, you Edom are a brother to <i>Israel</i> and should not have looked at the <i>destruction with joy</i> and should not have sent your hand to take money and goods from Israel on the day that Israel was in its brokenness.
“<i>How could you stand at the passes and cut down the refugees</i>” [1:14]. You Edom should not have stood at the crossroads, where two roads intersect, hoping that you would capture, when Israel will run away from Jerusalem. You wanted to cut down the refugees from Israel.
“<i>You should not have handed over the remnants, on the day of our distress</i>” [1:14]. You <i>Edom</i> should not have handed over the remnants of Israel into the hands of their enemies. You placed <i>guards</i> on all the roads that they should capture Israel.
“<i>For the day of the Lord is near against all the nations</i>” [1:15]. The prophet said: the <i>redemption</i> will come soon to Israel and all the gentiles will soon get their just rewards, that they have caused troubles to Israel. Even though it has been a long time and the <i>redemption</i> has not yet come, how does he say that the <i>redemption</i> will come soon? The answer is that the Holy One promised that it would certainly happen. Even if he delays for a long time, in any event the <i>redemption</i> will certainly come. This is as if it has already happened. Therefore he says, the redemption will come soon.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Obadiah, 1:15.</i>
“<i>As you did, so shall it be done to you; your conduct will be requited</i>” [1:15]. What you Edom did, so will it happen to you, your recompense will come down on your head.
“<i>For as you have drunk on my holy mountain, etc.</i>” [1:16]. The nations drank on Mount <i>Zion</i> and had a celebration over the <i>destruction of Jerusalem.</i> So too will it happen that the nations will drink a bitter drink.
“<i>They shall drink and gulp down and shall be as if they never were</i>” [1:16]. They will drink and swallow the bitter drink in their throats and will be destroyed, just as if they never were in the world.
“<i>And on Mount Zion a remnant will survive and they will be holy</i>” [1:17]. Even though many Israelites have been destroyed in the time of exile. Nonetheless, a time will come again that Israel will be redeemed on Mount Zion and Israel will be holy to God.
“<i>The House of Jacob will dispossess those who dispossessed them</i>” [1:17]. Jacob will inherit the land that the nations had inherited.
“<i>The House of Jacob will be a fire and the House of Joseph a flame, etc.</i>” [1:18]. Like the fire burns the straw, so will Jacob burn the nations. Therefore he says, a flame will come out of the house of Jacob and from the house of Joseph a fiery flame will come, when Joseph will overcome Esau.
“<i>There will be no survivor of the House of Esau, since the Lord has spoken</i>” [1:18]. No person from <i>Esau</i> will remain; when the <i>Holy One</i> says it, it will certainly happen.
“<i>They will inherit the Negev, Mount Esau, the Shefelah and Philistia</i>” [1:19]. Israel will inherit the land of the <i>Negev</i> from Esau and will inherit the valley from the <i>Philistines.</i> They will not need large mountains behind which to protect themselves from their enemies and to sow grain on them. The Holy One will give the blessing to Israel that they will have enough grain and they will inherit the fields of <i>Ephraim</i>, <i>Samaria</i>, and the fields of <i>Benjamin</i> and of <i>Gilead.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Obadiah, 1:19.</i>
“<i>The exiled army of Israel shall possess, etc.</i>” [1:20]. The <i>exile</i> of the people of Israel, those who are dispersed in exile from the land of the <i>Canaanites</i> until the land of France. The <i>exile</i> of <i>Jerusalem</i> in the land of <i>Sepharad</i>, who were exiled and dispersed, will inherit the cities of the <i>Negev</i> that is in the <i>south.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Obadiah, 1:20, identifies these names with the European lands of these names.

“<i>The redeemers will ascend Mount Zion to judge Mount Esau</i>” [1:21]. The <i>Messiah</i> and his <i>colleagues</i> will go up to Mount <i>Zion</i> to judge the mountain of <i>Esau</i> because they have done evil to <i>Israel.</i>
“<i>The kingdom will be the Lord</i>’<i>s</i>” [1:21]. When the Messiah will come, the kingdom will rightfully belong to God alone. Then all the <i>gentiles</i> will <i>acknowledge</i> to God that He is a <i>king.</i>
The <i>Tanhuma</i> writes: “<i>Thus says the Lord God, etc.</i>” [1:1]. The Holy One himself will repay the <i>kingdom of the Cuthians</i> their just recompense for the evil that they did to Israel. In <i>Egypt</i>, the <i>Holy One</i> repaid them through an <i>angel</i>, as the verse says, “<i>He sent an angel and He took us out</i>” [Numbers, 20:16]. Concerning the <i>king of Assyria</i>, it is written that an <i>angel</i> of God went out and killed the <i>king of Assyria.</i> In <i>Shushan</i>, Israel was saved by <i>Mordecai and Esther.</i> In the days of the kingdom of the Greeks, in the days of Hanukkah, through <i>Matithias the High Priest.</i> However, the Holy One himself will take revenge on the <i>Cuthians.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Midrash Tanhuma</i> ed.

<b>[Amos 2:6–3:8]</b>
“<i>Thus says the Lord for three transgressions of Israel</i>” [2:6]. Thus says the Lord about three transgressions of Israel and about the fourth, I will not respond.
“<i>Because they sold the righteous for silver and the needy for a pair of sandals</i>” [2:6]. When a poor person comes to them for judgment, they completely follow the rich person and the poor person must lose the judgment. If the poor person has his field among those of the <i>judges</i>, he must sell his field because he has lost the <i>judgment</i> and must pay the <i>rich person</i> his money that judged against him immediately. The <i>judge</i> comes to the poor person. I will give you money for the field. He must sell the field to the <i>judge</i> for a small sum of money. The <i>judge</i> had long coveted the field. He wanted to merge this field with his adjoining field and could not legally join the poor man’s field to his own. Therefore, he <i>ruled</i> falsely against the poor man so that he would have to sell his field. This is also the meaning of “<i>for sandals.</i>” That is to say, the <i>impoverished person</i> must sell his field, because the <i>judge</i> wanted to join his field to that of the poor man properly. The proper meaning of “<i>Sandals</i>” is that he should <i>properly purchase</i> the field from the poor person. Now the poor person has to <i>properly convey</i> the property.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Amos, 2:6.</i>
“<i>Those who trample the heads of the poor into the dust of the earth</i>” [2:7]. When the poor owe something to the <i>judge</i>, the <i>judge</i> places <i>guards</i> who drag the poor on the earth by the hair of their heads so that their heads will be smeared with dust. All of this happens because the wealthy person <i>bribes the judge.</i> Therefore, he inclines the path from the innocent people because of <i>bribery.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Amos, 2:7.</i>
“<i>Father and son go to the same girl, etc.</i>” [2:7]. The father goes with his son to the same young woman and the son is not embarrassed to sleep with the young woman before his father. This is the same if the father had also slept with the same young woman. This is, they desecrate My Holy Name, that I commanded you, “<i>you shall be holy</i>” [Leviticus, 19:2]. You should keep yourself holy and not engage in illicit sexual relations.
“<i>They recline by every altar on garments taken in pledge</i>” [2:8]. When a person does not give what the judge asked for, they take his clothes and eat and drink on them and go to their idolatrous temples, bow at their altars to eat and drink.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Amos, 2:8.</i>

“<i>I destroyed the Amorite before them, etc.</i>” [2:9].

“<i>I brought you up</i>” [2:10]. I brought you up from the land of <i>Egypt</i> and led you for forty years in the <i>wilderness</i> and gave you the <i>land of Israel.</i>
“<i>I raised up prophets from among your sons and nazirites from among your young men</i>” [2:11]. I did another favor for Israel; I made <i>prophets</i> out of your children. Even those <i>young men</i> who used to go after worldly pleasures, I gave the idea into their hearts that that each one of them should become a <i>nazirite</i> who drinks no wine.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Amos, 2:11.</i>
“<i>Is that not so, O people of Israel, says the Lord</i>” [2:11]. How can you deny this, Israel, and say that it is not so, says God.
“<i>You made the nazirites drink wine, etc.</i>” [2:12]. You evil people dissuaded these same nazirites who were not supposed to drink wine. Now you have convinced them that they should drink wine and I, God, commanded my <i>prophets</i> that they should no longer utter <i>prophecies.</i>
“<i>I will slow your movements</i>” [2:13]. I will hurt you in your cities; just like when a wagon is overloaded with grain that one takes from the field during the harvest. The wagon is very heavy and as much as one tries to move it, it is as if he would have lead or iron on himself. This is the meaning of the verse “<i>when it is full of cut grain</i>” [2:13], that it is full of grain from the field.
“<i>Flight will fail the swift, the strong will find no strength</i>” [2:14]. The same person, where people used to come to hide in his house because of his strength, will be destroyed. The strong one will not have any heart to be protected and the hero will not protect his body.
“<i>The bowman will not stand his ground, etc.</i>” [2:15]. The person who used to shoot arrows will not be able to stand and the one who used to run quickly will not be able to save himself. The one who rides a horse will also not run away.
“<i>The most stouthearted warrior, etc.</i>” [2:16]. Those who used to be stouthearted will now throw off their clothes from their body, so that it will be easier to run away from his enemies. Therefore, he must run away naked, says God.
“<i>Hear the word that God has spoken</i>” [3:1]. Listen to the words that God said about you, Israel, more than other peoples, since I have brought you out of <i>Egypt.</i>
“<i>You alone have I known of all the families of the earth, etc.</i>” [3:2]. God said: only you, Israel, have I loved more than all the nations of the earth. You have seen the signs that I have done for you. Therefore, I want to remember your transgressions to pay you for them.
“<i>Can two walk together without having met?</i>” [3:3]. Therefore, because you committed transgressions, nobody will be able to leave the city because of the enemy. Even two should not prepare together in the expectation that they will oppose the enemy if he should encounter them.
“<i>Does a lion roar in the forest when it has no prey?</i>” [3:4]. A parable. Just like a lion, when he roars in the forest, all the animals stand still from fear of the lion. The lion can come and take whatever prey it wants. So are the nations against you. They take whomever they want and nobody does anything.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Amos, 3:4.</i>

“<i>Is a ram</i>’<i>s horn blown in the city and the people are not afraid?</i> [3:6].

He prayed that the lion should come from its home to the <i>emperor.</i> When it was four hundred miles from the emperor, the lion roared. All the pregnant women miscarried and all the walls of the city fell down. When it came within three hundred miles from the city, the lion roared again. All the teeth fell out of the people’s mouths and the emperor fell off of his throne. The emperor said to <i>Rabbi Joshua:</i> pray that it stay outside. He prayed and the lion returned to its home. Later, the emperor said: you must show me your God. I want to see him. <i>Rabbi Joshua:</i> come outside and I will show him to you. He placed the emperor in the sun in the month of <i>Tammuz</i>, when it shines very strongly. R. Joshua said: look at the sun and you will see Him. The emperor said that one couldn’t look at the sun. <i>Rabbi Joshua</i> responded: you cannot look at the servant of the Holy One because of the strong light, so how do you want to see the Holy One Himself? Later, the emperor said: I want to make a banquet. Let your God come to the <i>banquet. Rabbi Joshua</i> responded: He has a large retinue. You will not be able to seat them all and feed them. Therefore, go to the ocean and prepare many tables and benches. He worked on it for a whole year. A great wind came and threw all the tables, benches and food into the <i>ocean.

On the third day after the birth of my child, this woman also gave birth to a child. We were alone in the house and no one else was there.
“<i>This woman</i>’<i>s son died, etc.</i>” [3:19]. Her son died in the night when she lay on him and crushed him to death. If her child had been sick, the women would have known which child died.

“<i>When I awoke in the morning to nurse my son, etc.</i>” [3:21]. When I woke up in the morning, I saw and understood from his face that this is not my son to whom I had given birth.
“<i>The other woman said, no, etc.</i>” [3:22]. The other woman said: the live one is my son and the dead son is hers. They spoke thusly before <i>King Solomon.</i>
“<i>The king said: One says, this is my son that is alive, etc.</i>” [3:23]. The king repeated what the two women said. That is to say, it is customary that when a <i>judge</i> wants to give a <i>ruling</i> that he <i>repeats</i> what they said. He wants to show that he understood what they said and wants to <i>judge</i> properly, according to their statements. From here we learn that every <i>judge</i> should <i>repeat</i> the <i>arguments</i> that each party had <i>argued.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, I Kings, 3:23.</i>
“<i>So the king said: bring me a sword, etc.</i>” [3:24]. The king ordered that a sword be brought and he said: cut the live child into two halves and give each of them half.
“<i>The woman whose son was the live one said to the king, etc.</i>” [3:26]. The woman whose son was the live one said: I ask you, <i>my lord king</i>, give her the live son and do not kill the child. She had compassion that her son should not be killed. The other woman said: let us not follow her, but cut the child apart. Here one asks a question. Why did the woman not take the live child when the other woman said, give her the live child? She had taken the child at night so that she should have a live child. The explanation is that she thought that the king would not give her the child. The other one said that the child should not be killed, out of <i>compassion</i>, and when it will grow up, it will return to its rightful mother.
“<i>The king responded: give her the live child, etc.</i>” [3:27]. The king said: give her the live child and the child should not be killed, since this is his mother. The Midrash writes that a <i>Heavenly voice</i> went forth and said: this is his mother. That is to say, that Solomon had judged correctly.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Genesis Rabbah,</i> 85.12.</i>
“<i>All of Israel heard the decision, etc.</i>” [3:28]. When <i>all of Israel</i> heard the judgment of Solomon; they were in awe of Solomon, that he had judged so justly, with great wisdom. They were afraid to do anything wrong. They thought that he would learn of it with his great wisdom even in hidden places, as had happened with the two women.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, I Kings, 3:28.</i>
“<i>Solomon was king over all of Israel</i>” [4:1]. Now Solomon was the proper king over all of Israel, through the judgment. The Holy One had given him great wisdom and he was able to converse with the birds and knew <i>seventy languages.</i> He ruled over demons and over the whole world. It is no surprise, since the Holy One had given him more wisdom than other people.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, I Kings, <i>Remez</i>, 178.</i>
We find even among our Talmudic sages those who ruled over demons, as the Talmud write in [tractate] <i>Hullin</i>, <i>chapter eight:</i> Abbaye said: I thought that one should not walk under or sit under a drainpipe where water drains from the roof. This is because unclean water runs off the roof and it is disgusting. However, I was told later that this was because demons have their dwellings under there. Therefore, it is dangerous to walk under it. A story happened that two men were carrying a barrel of wine. These two men rested with the barrel under a drainpipe where water used to run down from the roof. The <i>demon</i> broke the barrel with the wine. The two men came before <i>Mar, the son of Rav Ashi</i> and told him the story how the barrel was broken under the drainpipe. <i>Mar, the son of Rav Ashi</i> took a <i>shofar</i>, blew it and excommunicated that demon. That is to say, in past times, the shofar was blown when someone was excommunicated. The <i>demon</i> came to <i>Mar</i> and said: why have you excommunicated me? <i>Mar</i> said to the demon: why should you cause damage and break a barrel of wine? The demon responded: what should I have done? They placed the barrel on my ear while I was sleeping. <i>Mar</i> responded: What are you doing in a public place where people normally pass? Therefore, you are guilty and must pay damages. The demon responded: give me some time to pay, since I don’t have any money right now. <i>Mar</i> gave him some time. The time came and the demon did not bring the money. Later, the demon brought the money to pay. He asked him: why were you late with regard to the time you were given? The demon responded: we do not have the <i>power or the permission</i> to take something from a person that is sealed or measured with a measure or something that is bound. Therefore, I had to wait until I found something to take that was not sealed or measured and I have paid you with that. The Talmud further states that <i>Rav Papa</i> had a demon that was his servant. Once he went to fetch water for his master, <i>Rav Papa</i>, and the demon tarried with the water for a long time. When he returned with the water, <i>Rav Papa</i> asked him: why did you tarry so long? The demon responded: When I came to the river, I saw that the other demons were drinking water from the river, and I waited until the evil waters from which the demons drank, poured off and went away. Then I took the water. As they were speaking, Rav Papa poured off some water from the jug of water that he had brought, before they drank it. The <i>demon</i> said: if I had known that you are used to pouring of some water from the jug on the earth before you drink, I would not have had to tarry because the demons were drinking from the river.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Hullin,</i> 105b-106a.</i> The remedy is that one should pour off water that one brings from a well or a river.
The <i>Tosafists</i> ask a question. If the demon had known that the <i>remedy</i> is that one should pour off water before one drinks from it, then why did the demon tarry with the water? He should have poured off water from the jug and when he saw that the demons were drinking from it, it would not have hurt the people if he had poured off the water. The <i>Tosafists</i> give an answer. The remedy is none other than pouring off the water, but the person who wants to drink water must pour off the water by himself or herself. Therefore, the demon was not able to pour off the water himself. The <i>Tosafists</i> ask another question. Why did the demon not take the water immediately, while the other demons were still drinking? He could have told the people: don’t drink from it, first pour off some water yourself. Then he would not have had to tarry. The <i>Tosafists</i> give an answer. The demon was afraid of the other demons to teach a remedy. They would have been angry with him angry with him that he taught them a remedy.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Hullin,</i> 106a, <i>Tosafot</i>, s.v., “He saw them pouring.”</i> From here we learn that in the past the <i>scholars</i> had dominion and <i>power</i> over the demons, just like <i>King Solomon.</i>
From the <i>haftorah</i> we learn that women are <i>frivolous.</i> The woman said that the child should be chopped in half. Concerning this, King Solomon said: “<i>but a woman among all these I have never found</i>” [Ecclesiastes, 7:28]. A good woman is never found in the world.
<i>Midrash Shohar Tov</i> writes: <i>Rabbi Samuel the son of Nahmani</i> said in the name of <i>Rabbi Nehorai.</i> The mouth of King Solomon said wise things. He said that the Holy One knew very well that a <i>judgment</i> would come with two women and two children. Therefore, the Holy One created two eyes, two ears, two nostrils, two hands and two feet. That is why King Solomon said to chop the child in half, so that each woman could be given an even <i>half.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Midrash Shohar Tov (Tehillim),</i> 72.14; <i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, I Kings, <i>Remez</i>, 175.</i>

Vayigash

<b>[Ezekiel, 37:15:28]</b>
“<i>The word of the Lord came to me: And you mortal, take a stick</i>” [37:15]. The Holy One said to the <i>prophet Ezekiel.</i> Take a stick and write on it the name of Judah and his friends. Take another stick and write on it the name of Joseph and <i>Ephraim</i> and his other Israelite friends. This alludes to the <i>ten tribes</i> who were called part of <i>Ephraim.</i>
“<i>Join together in one stick, etc.</i>” [37:17]. First take two sticks and write a name on each one. This means that Israelites have been separated through the wars of their kings. Therefore, God said: take the two sticks and bring them together in one hand. This is a sign that the <i>kingdom of Israel</i> will have peace and will be united. When Israelites will say to you: tell us, what do these sticks show? You should tell them. Thus has God said: I take the stick on which Joseph is written, that is in the hand of Ephraim, and I will put it together with the stick of Judah. You should make them one stick and they will be united in my hand. You should hold the sticks on which you have written in your hand before their eyes.
“<i>Say to them: thus says the Lord God, etc.</i>” [37:21]. You should speak to them. Thus says God: I will take you Israel from among the nations, where you have gone. I will gather you and I will bring you to your land.
“<i>I will make them one nation, etc.</i>” [37:22]. I will make them one people in the land and hills of <i>Israel.</i> They will have one king over all of them, and they will no longer be two nations and will not be divided into two parts, in two kingdoms.
“<i>They shall never again defile themselves with their idols, etc.</i>” [37:23]. They will not be defiled and will not commit sins. I will help them with all the transgressions they have committed and I will purify them. They should be my people and I will be their God.
“<i>My servant David will be king over them and they shall have one shepherd over them, etc.</i>” [37:24]. My servant David should be a king over them. This is the <i>king Messiah</i> who is called <i>David.</i> That is, he will come from the descendants of David and will be a shepherd over Israel.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Ezekiel, 37:24.</i> They will keep my laws and observe my rules and will fulfill my commandments.
“<i>They will live in the land that I have given to my servant Jacob</i>” [37:25]. They will occupy the land that I gave to My servant Jacob, broad without measure or limit, that their ancestors occupied and which they and their children will occupy forever. My servant David will be their <i>prince</i> forever.
“<i>I will make a covenant of peace with them, etc.</i>” [37:26]. I will make a <i>covenant</i> with them that will last forever. I will multiply them and place My Sanctuary among them forever.
“<i>My Presence will rest over them and I will be their God, etc.</i>” [37:27]. My <i>Shekhinah</i> will rest over them.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Ezekiel, 37:27.</i> I will be a God to them and they will be my people.
“<i>The nations will know that I the Lord, etc.</i>” [37:28]. The nations will know that I, God, sanctify Israel because My <i>Sanctuary</i> is among them forever.

<b>[I Kings, 2:1–12]</b>
“<i>When David</i>’<i>s life was drawing to a close, he instructed his son Solomon, saying</i>” [2:1]. When the time for David to die drew close, he instructed his son <i>Solomon.</i>
“<i>I am going the way of the whole earth, etc.</i>” [2:2]. David said: I am going to die, as is the natural order of all people. You, Solomon, should strengthen yourself and be a man. That is to say, be strong and subdue the evil inclination and do not be childish, like a youth who goes after foolishness.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, I Kings, 2:2.</i>
“<i>Keep the charge of the Lord your God, etc.</i>” [2:3]. You should observe the commandments of your God and walk in His ways, to observe His laws and ordinances. Therefore, the verse says “<i>in His ways.</i>” This means, good attributes, to be compassionate to one’s fellows, just as is the Holy One. “<i>His laws.</i>” That is to say, commandments that we do not know the reasons why the Holy One commanded them, like agricultural mixtures, <i>mixtures of wool and linen</i> and <i>eating pork.</i> If the Holy One had not forbidden them, why should I not have eaten pork? Why should I not have worn a mixture of wool and linen? These commandments are all <i>rules and rites</i> [Numbers, 9:3]. “<i>His ordinances</i>,” means to give laws and proper judgment. “<i>His testimonies</i>,” means keeping the <i>Sabbath</i> and <i>festivals</i> properly. They are called a testimony that the Holy One created the world in six days and rested on the Sabbath. <i>Solomon</i> should observe all of these things, says David your father. You should be intelligent and successful in all the paths that you will follow.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, I Kings, 2:3, with interpolations.</i>
“<i>So that the Lord will fulfill His words, etc.</i>” [2:4]. You <i>Solomon</i>, when you will properly observe the words of God, the <i>Holy One</i> will also keep His words, and you will be a king forever. However, go with truth and with your whole heart to serve the Holy One. God will not cut off any of your descendants from the throne of kingship over Israel forever.
“<i>You know what was done, etc.</i>” [2:5]. Just as I have commanded you to properly observe the commandments of the Holy One, there is also a commandment to kill the evildoers of the world. There are evildoers, like <i>Joab the son of Zeruiah</i>, who did evil to me in that he killed two <i>heroes</i>, commanders of Israel. <i>Abner</i> was righteous and was a sage.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Numbers Rabbah,</i> 19.2; <i>Pesikta de-Rav Kahana,</i> 4.2.</i> The other one was <i>Amasa the son of Jether.</i> They faithfully served me in all the wars, and <i>Joab</i> killed them both. Some sages say that when David said, “<i>that was done to me</i>,” means that David sent a letter to <i>Joab</i> by the hand of <i>Uriah the Hittite</i>, that Joab should have Uriah killed. He always threw the letter up to David and showed it to him in order to embarrass him.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Numbers Rabbah,</i> 23.13; <i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, I Kings, <i>Remez</i> 170.</i>
“<i>He killed them, shedding blood of war in peacetime</i>” [2:5]. This Joab killed these two righteous men<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Sanhedrin,</i> 49a.</i> just like he would have killed foreigners in war. He killed them with his sword, with which he girded his loins, as if he had gone to war with foreigners.
“<i>On the sandals that were on his feet</i>” [2:5]. They lay dead at his feet, beneath his shoes. The Midrash says that <i>Joab</i> thought: if I will kill <i>Abner</i>, then I will become a great hero. Therefore, he thought up a stratagem how to kill him. He would come to Abner and ask him about a woman who needs to perform the ceremony of <i>halizah.</i> [As part of the ceremony] she must take off [her brother-inlaw’s] shoe. If the woman has no hands because they had been chopped off, how could she untie his shoe? Then Abner would bend over to show him, with his teeth. That is to say, the woman must remove the shoe with her teeth. When Abner will bend over, then Joab would stick his spear into <i>Abner</i> and kill him. Concerning this, the verse says here, “<i>On the sandals that were on his feet</i>” [2:5]. That is to say, through showing him the shoes on his feet, Joab was able to kill him.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, B. Sanhedrin, 49a, “<i>Sheheim Darshu</i>”; Radak, I Kings, 2:5.</i>
“<i>So act in accordance with your wisdom and do not let him descend, etc.</i>” [2:6]. That is, do not kill him until you will find some <i>accusation</i> against Joab. Even though he is <i>guilty of the death penalty</i>, yet nevertheless Joab helped greatly in Israel’s wars. However, he did kill these two. Therefore, kill him wisely through an accusation. In any event, do not let him die in his bed, but let him be killed as he killed.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, I Kings, 2:6.</i>
“<i>And the children of Barzilai the Gileadite</i>” [2:7]. You should act graciously with the children of <i>Barzilai the Gileadite.</i> They should eat at your table all the time.
“<i>For they befriended me</i>” [2:7]. When I ran away because of <i>Absalom</i> your brother, <i>Barzilai</i> gave me to eat and drink and consoled me. Therefore, repay him with food.
“<i>There is also with you Shimei the son of Gera, etc.</i>” [2:8]. There is also with you <i>Shimei the son of Gera</i>, of the tribe of Benjamin. He is now within your authority to kill him. He is now in <i>Jerusalem</i> with you. You can easily find an <i>accusation</i> against him, to kill him. The Midrash writes: he is your teacher and is always with you. Therefore, you can easily find an accusation to kill him. He shamed me greatly when I ran away from Absalom. He troubled me greatly and he also spoke much evil against me.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Midrash Shohar Tov</i> (<i>Tehillim</i>), 3.44.</i>
“<i>Terribly</i>” [2:8]. This means a terrible curse that he cursed me.
“<i>He came down to meet me at the Jordan, etc.</i>” [2:8]. That Shimei later came to me and wanted to apologize to me. I swore to him at the Jordan that I would not kill him with my sword.
“<i>And now do not let him go unpunished, etc.</i>” [2:9]. Even though I swore to him, nonetheless he is <i>deserving of the death penalty.</i> You should not kill him because of my oath, but you should find an accusation against him and do not let him go free. You are wise. You will be able to find an accusation against him and cause his blood to descend to the grave.
“<i>So David slept with his fathers and he was buried in the city of David</i>” [2:10]. And David died and was buried with his parents in the city of David.
“<i>The time that David reigned over Israel, etc.</i>” [2:11]. The days that David ruled over Israel were forty years. He was king in Hebron for seven years and in <i>Jerusalem</i> for thirty-three years.
“<i>And Solomon sat on the throne of David his father, etc.</i>” [2:12]. And Solomon sat on the throne of his father, David, and his kingdom was established.
“<i>When David</i>’<i>s time drew near</i>” [2:1]. The <i>Rabbati</i> writes that every righteous person about whom it is written “<i>drew near to die</i>” did not live as long as his parents, since his parents lived for a long time. <i>Boaz, Oved</i> and <i>Jesse</i><sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">David’s great-grandfather, grandfather and father.</i> lived for four hundred years and David only lived for seventy years.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Genesis Rabbah,</i> 96.4.</i>
The Talmud writes in <i>tractate Berakhot</i>, “<i>his days drew near to die.</i>” <i>Rabbi Samuel the son of Nachmani</i> said: The days that the righteous live are insignificant, since the righteous person lives forever in the next world.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, I Kings, <i>Remez</i> 169.</i>
The <i>Rabbati</i> writes and asks a question. Why is it written, “<i>And David</i>’<i>s days drew near</i>” [2:1]? That is, it should have said that David died. The answer is that when a person dies, his authority ends. Therefore, in the verse he is called David and not king, because it was the day of his death. Jacob, also, when he was about to die, made himself very humble and asked his son Joseph, with humble words, that he should take him to be buried in the <i>land of Israel</i>, since this was also the day of his death. <i>Rabbi Joshua</i> says in the name of <i>Rabbi Levi:</i> the trumpets that Moses made in the desert, the Holy One hid these trumpets on the day of Moses’ death, so that they should not show that <i>Moses had authority.</i> As the verse says, “<i>there is no authority over the day of death</i>” [Ecclesiastes, 8:8]. There is no authority on the day when a person should die.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Genesis Rabbah,</i> 96.2–4.</i>
The <i>Tanhuma</i> writes about the <i>haftorah</i> [verse] “<i>what Joab did to me</i>” [2:5]. David wrote a letter to Joab. You should put Uriah in the eye of the battle so that he should he killed. Joab did so and caused him to be killed. The chieftains of the war came to Joab and said to him: why did you do this? He showed them the letter that David had written, to kill Uriah. Scripture says concerning this, “<i>what Joab did to me.</i>” That is to say, he did this to me, to show the letter to people, and David commanded that Joab be killed. Joab was David’s nephew. He allowed him to be killed so that he would have atonement for the murder that he had committed, so that he would come to the <i>Garden of Eden</i> in the <i>World to Come.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Midrash Tanhuma</i> (ed. S. Buber), <i>Masa</i>’<i>ei</i>, 9. <i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, I Kings, <i>Remez</i> 169. The Rabbinic concept is that the execution of the murderer provides a form of atonement for his crime.</i>
The <i>Rabbati</i> writes about this <i>haftorah. Rabbi Yudan</i> said: “<i>Barzilai the Gileadite</i>” is written five times in the <i>haftorah.</i> This teaches us that whoever feeds a righteous person at his table; it is as if he has observed the Torah that consists of <i>five books.</i> That is why <i>Barzilai</i> is written five times, because he gave food to the righteous person.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Genesis Rabbah,</i> 58.8.</i>

“<i>By this, the sins of Jacob will be expiated</i>” [27:9]. With this, the sins of Jacob will be forgotten and they will be redeemed, just like they were redeemed from Egypt. So too, will they now be redeemed from this exile.
“<i>And this will be the fruit of his removal of his sin, etc.</i>” [27:9]. And what is the best fruit of all, to remove the <i>foreign gods</i> from everyone. He should take all the stones from the altar on which he has sinned and on which he worshiped foreign gods, and he should scatter the stones of that altar, like the chalkstones.
“<i>No sacred groves or incense altars will remain standing</i>” [27:9]. The linden trees and their foreign gods that they erected in the place where the sun is hot shall not remain standing.
“<i>For the fortified city is solitary, etc.</i>” [27:10]. When they will stop worshiping foreign gods, and even more so, other sins, then the cities of Esau, the fortified cities, will sit alone and without people.
“<i>A city deserted and forsaken, like in the wilderness</i>” [27:10]. The habitations of Esau will be forsaken and uninhabitable, deserted by people, like the wilderness.
“<i>The calves graze there, etc.</i>” [27:10]. There, in their cities, Ephraim, who is called a calf, will graze. They will be desolate and their branches of the nations will be destroyed.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Isaiah, 27:10.</i>
“<i>When its boughs are broken, women</i>” [27:11]. When the merit of Esau, because he honored his father, will end. This is the meaning of the verse “<i>When its boughs are broken.</i>” That is, the <i>merit from respecting his father</i> is compared to a small branch that is easily broken. Men who are weak as the women will come and will light a fire under Esau. Just like a dry branch is soon burned in the fire, so too will Esau.
“<i>They are a people without understanding</i>” [27:11]. They are a people who do not understand anything and therefore, God will have no compassion for them.
“<i>And on that day, God will beat out, etc.</i>” [27:12]. In the day that the Messiah will come, the Holy One will beat out, just like one beats out and threshes wheat from the straw. The Holy One will beat out Israel from the nations and ingather them from the flow of the river. Israel was exiled from the land of <i>Assyria</i> to the river of Egypt. Waiting by the river of Egypt, all of Israel will be ingathered and will go to Jerusalem.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Isaiah, 27:12.</i>
“<i>You will be gathered one by one, children of Israel</i>” [27:12]. You will be ingathered one by one, you children of Israel.

All of Israel will be ingathered quickly, like one would blow with a great shofar, so that the whole world will hear and those who were lost in the land of <i>Assyria</i>, behind the river <i>Sambatyon</i>, will come.

“<i>The proud crowns of the drunkards of Ephraim, etc.</i>” [28:1]. The prophet tells how they showed that they made themselves crowns of arrogance with their wealth, out of their arrogance. That is, just like the arrogance and haughtiness were a crown. Ephraim drank good wine, and was the greatest <i>kingdom of Israel</i>, and the wine caused them to sin. However, when their wealth was lost, it is like a beautiful flower or rose that grows well at first and then a wind comes or the sun grows very hot and the flower or rose is destroyed. So too will be the desirability and beauty of evil Israel.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Isaiah, 28:1.</i>
“<i>On the heads of those bloated, etc.</i>” [28:1]. The same crown of arrogance is on the heads of Israel who are haughty, who drink wine and go after other <i>pleasures.</i> They are overcome by wine when they drink. He falls on the ground and injures himself. This is the meaning of “<i>overcome by wine</i>,” injured by wine.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Isaiah, 28:1.</i>
“<i>Lo, the Lord has one who is strong and mighty, etc.</i>” [28:2]. It is a strong day of God that will come upon them, like a great rain with hail that shatters all the trees. So will it come on Israel, like a storm in which people are lost and killed, like a rain that floods many good fields.
“<i>With his hand He will hurl them down to the earth</i>” [28:2]. The Holy One will lay down their crown on the ground with violence.
“<i>Trampled underfoot will be the arrogant crown of the drunkards of Ephraim</i>” [28:3]. The prophet said: you will even see how the crown of the arrogance of the drunkards of Ephraim will be trampled underfoot. That is to say, after their crown will fall down from your heads, then they will trample on them with their feet.
“<i>Like a first ripe fig before the summer, etc.</i>” [28:4]. The wealth of Ephraim will be torn quickly, just like a fig that grows quickly, before other fruits. Every person comes running and desires to see it and eat it.
“<i>Devours it as soon as it comes to hand</i>” [28:4]. Every person has the desire to eat this fig even while it is still on the tree branch. Just as every person desires to eat it, so too will the hands of the enemies tear the wealth of Ephraim.
“<i>In that day, the Lord of Hosts will be, etc.</i>” [28:5].

“<i>And a spirit of judgment for him who sits in judgment, etc.</i>” [28:6]. The Holy One will be to him a spirit to him, that he will issue just <i>rulings</i> to the one who will sit in judgment. This is <i>King Hezekiah</i>, to whom the Holy One will give him a good <i>spirit of prophecy</i> and wisdom. The Holy One will also be a strength to them, so that they will be strong to study Torah. They will have great might to wage war with their enemies, to the gates of the enemy’s fortified cities.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Isaiah, 28:6.</i>
“<i>But those are also muddled by wine and dazed by strong drink, etc.</i>” [28:7]. Those who sit in judgment and study Torah in that time will also make mistakes as a result of drinking wine.
“<i>Priest and prophet are muddled by strong drink</i>” [28:7]. The priest and prophet who used to give judgments and rule regarding the Torah; they too will be drunk with old wine. They will be corrupted from drinking too much wine.
“<i>Their vision is blurred, they stumble in judgment</i>” [28:7]. They will err and make mistakes in things that any child would not mistake. They stumble in their judgment.
“<i>All the tables are covered with filth and vomit, there is no place</i>” [28:8]. When their tables are covered with sacrifices for foreign gods, full of filth and garbage, there is no place that is clean and beautiful.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Isaiah, 28:8.</i>
“<i>To whom would he teach knowledge, etc.</i>” [28:9]. Whom shall he teach Torah and explain the importance of learning Torah. “<i>You shall say.</i>” You should tell it to the young children.
“<i>To those newly weaned from milk, just taken away from the breast</i>” [28:9]. That is to say, they should teach wisdom to the small children that were weaned from milk and those that have been removed from the breast of their mother after two years. That is to say, the old men drink wine and have no sense, because of their wine drinking. Therefore, one cannot teach them.
“<i>That mutter upon mutter, murmur upon murmur, etc.</i>” [28:10]. The prophet commands them a commandment from the Holy One and the people respond: we have long had a commandment from the foreign gods. It is better than your commandment. When the prophet says to them to do justice according to the measures and weights. They answered: we have a better measure than yours for judging than you have. The prophet says to them: Reflect that it will tarry little and the evil will come from the Holy One. They answered: let Him do what He wants to the evildoers. Let him not delay his deeds.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Isaiah, 28:10.</i>
Another explanation is: “<i>mutter upon mutter</i>” [28:10]. That is to say, the prophet punished them by commanding them mitzvot. Today a small commandment, tomorrow, another small commandment, just like one commands children a small amount of Torah in the hope that they will begin. Similarly, the prophet taught them commandments and laws. Just like a carpenter works with a measure, and works very slowly until the building is properly built. In the same way, the prophet slowly taught a few commandments today and a few more tomorrow. However, it does not help and they do not accept it. <sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Isaiah, 28:10.</i>
“<i>With stammering tongue and with an alien language, he will speak to this people</i>” [28:11]. When the prophet tells them something about a commandment, they respond: what crooked thing is he saying and in a foreign language? That is to say, they do not want to understand him. Therefore, their rest will be exhaustion and troubles.
“<i>The word of the Lord will be to them: mutter upon mutter, murmur upon murmur</i>” [28:13]. The Holy One will repay them with the same measure that they measured God. God will repay them. He will impose a commandment from the nations, who will be commanded to work them in the exile. The nations will command troubles on them. Their hopes for relief from their troubles will be measured against the measure of their transgressions.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Isaiah, 28:13.</i>

“<i>Therefore, thus says the Lord to the House of Jacob, etc.</i>” [29:22]. Therefore, the Holy One said to the House of Jacob. The one who redeemed Abraham, will not be ashamed. Jacob and his face will not become pale from embarrassment. Jacob is much better with his children than his grandfather, Abraham, since Ishmael was Abraham’s evil son.
“<i>For when he sees his children, the work of My hands, in his midst, etc.</i>” [29:23]. When the children of Jacob will see My wonders, that I have done for Israel, then they will sanctify My name and they will sanctify the Holy One of Israel. They will strengthen the God of Israel, like <i>Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah sanctified the Name of God</i> and allowed themselves to be thrown into the fire, for the sake of God.

Concerning the <i>first day of Tishrei</i>, it is also written: “<i>blow the shofar on the new moon</i>” [Psalms, 81:4]. <i>Rabbi Joshua</i> said: they were redeemed from Egypt in Nisan, and in the days of the Messiah they will be redeemed in the <i>month of Nisan</i>, as the verse says: “<i>it is a night of vigil</i>” [Exodus, 12:42].

This is <i>Moses our Teacher.</i> Pharaoh’s daughter wanted to nurse him, but Moses did not want to be nursed by a gentile. He said: the mouth that will talk to the Holy One should not take milk from a gentile, who is impure.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Sotah,</i> 12b.</i> From this we learn that one should not give their child to be nursed by a gentile, particularly a son who might study Torah.
The Talmud in [tractate] <i>Sanhedrin</i>, <i>chapter two</i> writes concerning the verse in the <i>haftorah</i> “<i>who redeemed Abraham, concerning Jacob</i>” [29:22]. With what did Jacob redeem Abraham? <i>Rav Huna and Rabbi</i> [Judah the Prince] say in the name of <i>Rabbi Samuel the son of Isaac.</i> Abraham was protected from the fire of the oven through the <i>merit of Jacob.</i> A parable: a person has a <i>court case</i> before a <i>minister</i> and the judgment is that he should be burned. That <i>minister</i> saw that this person will have a daughter and the <i>king</i> will take her as a wife. Therefore, the <i>minister</i> says: because he has accrued merit from his daughter who will marry the king, I will save him from death. In this way, the <i>judgment</i> of <i>Nimrod</i> to burn Abraham was abrogated. The Holy One saw that Jacob would come out of Abraham.

Jeremiah came from a city of priests called <i>Anatot.</i>
“<i>The word of the Lord came to him, etc.</i>” [1:2]. The Holy One spoke to Jeremiah in the days of <i>Josiah the son of Amon the king of Judah.</i> This was also in the days of <i>Jehoiakim the son of Josiah the king of Judah.</i>
“<i>The word of the Lord came to me saying</i>” [1:4]. God said to me: “<i>before I created you in the womb, I knew you, etc.</i>” [1:4]. The Holy One said: before I created you in the womb, I knew you. Before you came out of your mother’s womb, I have prepared you to be a prophet. I will give you among the nations.
“<i>I said: Ah Lord God, etc.</i>” [1:6]. Jeremiah said: I shout, God You Lord, I do not know how to speak or how to punish a people, since I am a youth.

“<i>Do not fear them, for I am with you, etc.</i>” [1:8]. Jeremiah, you should not fear the nations, for I will protect you, so says God.
“<i>And the Lord put out His hand and touched, etc.</i>” [1:9]. God put His hand on my mouth and God said to me, I have put My words in your mouth.
“<i>See, today I appoint you over the nations</i>” [1:10]. I have made you an <i>overseer</i> over the nations and over Israel, for good and for evil. Everything that you will say will certainly happen to them. When you will say, they will be defeated, destroyed and dispersed, and to build and to plant. That is to say, what you will say, good and evil. It is shown in this verse that Jeremiah in his day prophesied much evil, but he proclaimed very few good things all of his days. That is why there are many terms of <i>defeat</i>, destruction and dispersion. However, when he proclaims good tidings, he only uses two terms, to build and to plant.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Jeremiah, 1:10.</i>

I said: I see a branch of an almond tree. The branch was without blossoms or leaves and it was difficult to recognize the wood, but he recognized the branch through prophecy.

“<i>And the word of the Lord came to me a second time, etc.</i>” [1:13]. God said to me a second time: what do you see? I said: a hot, steaming pot, and the face of the pot was to the north. That is, the rim of the pot on the side where one pours out from the pot, this is called its face. That is to say, from the north indicates that the evil and the steam from the pot comes from the north. This is the land of Babylon. They have committed transgressions and the pot is steaming because of their transgressions.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Jeremiah, 1:13.</i>
“<i>The Lord said to me: from the north shall disaster break loose upon all the inhabitants of the land</i>” [1:14]. The Holy One said: the troubles from the north will be opened on all the inhabitants of the earth.
“<i>For I am summoning all the peoples of the kingdoms of the north, declares the Lord</i>” [1:15]. I will implant a thought in all the families of the evil people, and to the kings that they should come to Jerusalem. Just as I might call them to come, so will I give into their hearts that each king should place his throne near the gates of Jerusalem, and near the walls and there will be kings over the cities of Judah.
“<i>And I will argue My case against them, for all of their wickedness, etc.</i>” [1:16]. I will argue my case with them about the evil that they committed by leaving Me. They have offered incense to foreign gods and have left Me.
“<i>So you, gird up your loins, etc.</i>” [1:17]. You <i>Jeremiah</i>, strongly gird up your loins, stand up and speak to them everything that I have commanded you. You should have no fear before them. That is to say, do not be afraid and you will believe that I can protect you. However, if you will be afraid, then I will make you fearful.
“<i>I will make you this day a city, etc.</i>” [1:18]. I will make you a strong city and an iron pillar and a bronze wall, for the whole land and the <i>kings of Judah</i>, to their princes, and the whole people. You should not be afraid of any person.
“<i>They will attack you, but they will not overcome you, etc.</i>” [1:19]. The nations will fight with you, but they will not be able to do anything to you, since I am with you, to protect you.

“<i>I remember the devotion of your youth, your love as a bride</i>” [2:2]. Say to Israel, just as I would bring <i>troubles</i> upon them because of their <i>evil deeds</i>, but I will in no way destroy them completely. I will also pay those nations who have troubled Israel and will bring troubles upon them. I remember the good deeds that Israel did for me in its youth, during the <i>giving of the Torah.</i> They are compared to a bride and the Holy One to a groom.

“<i>Israel was holy to the Lord, the first fruits of his harvest</i>” [2:3]. Israel is compared to <i>holiness.</i> Just like <i>terumah</i>, <i>which is holy</i> and an Israelite should not eat it, but only the <i>priests.</i> If an Israelite eats the <i>terumah</i>, he is strongly punished.

“<i>Therefore</i>” [29:10]. Therefore, I am against you and your pond, and I will cause your land of Egypt to be desolate.
“<i>No foot of man shall traverse it and no foot of beast shall traverse it</i>” [29:11]. It should become totally desolate and no foot of man or beast should traverse the land of Egypt.
“<i>It will be uninhabited for forty years</i>” [29:11]. It will not be inhabited for forty years. There should have been a famine for forty-two years in the days of Joseph. However, the famine lasted only two years. The famine ended when Jacob came.

“<i>Never again shall they be the trust of the house of Israel, recalling its guilt in having turned to them</i>” [29:16].

“<i>There they called Pharaoh the king of Egypt, etc.</i>” [46:17]. They shouted at Pharaoh in Egypt that he was a king over Egypt and over a large population. However, he has waited too long to go to war with <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i> and this is disgraceful. He was afraid to wage war and delayed too long.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Jeremiah, 46:17.</i>
“<i>As I live, says the King, whose name is Lord of Hosts, etc.</i>” [46:18].

“<i>Equip yourself for exile, daughter of Egypt, etc.</i>” [48:19]. You should prepare vessels for yourself that they used to prepare when a person would wander on the roads. This is a cup to drink out of and small bags in which to put bread and food. You, <i>Egypt</i>, must be exiled, wander eternally and be desolate. The city of <i>Nof</i> will have no inhabitants.
“<i>Egypt is a handsome heifer, etc.</i>” [46:20]. Egypt is compared to a fatted calf. Destruction will come to you from the north. This is <i>Babylon.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Jeremiah, 46:20.</i>
“<i>Even the mercenaries in her midst are like fatted calves</i>” [46:21]. The mercenaries among them are also fat, like the fatted calves. They sit and always gorge themselves and do not go to war. They have turned their backs and ran away together when the day came for their destruction. Their time had come.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Jeremiah, 46:21.</i>
“<i>She shall rustle away like a snake, as they come marching in force, etc.</i>” [46:22]. The people of Egypt will scream, like the snake screamed when its feet were chopped off. When the snake screamed, the scream was heard in the whole world.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Genesis Rabbah,</i> 20.5; Rashi, Jeremiah, 46:22.</i> Egypt will similarly scream when many people with axes will come. They come like woodchoppers.
“<i>They will cut down her forest, declares the Lord, though it cannot be measured</i>” [46:23]. He compares the people of Egypt to the wood of the forest. They will be cut off and chopped down like wood. The people of <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i> will not be examined and will not be counted because they are so numerous. They will be more numerous than locusts.
“<i>The daughter of Egypt will be shamed, she will be handed over to the people of the North</i>” [46:24]. Egypt will be greatly disgraced when they will fall into the hands of the <i>Chaldeans</i> who come from the north.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Jeremiah, 46:24.</i>
“<i>I will inflict punishment on Amon of No</i>” [46:25]. The Holy One said: I will command against the king of <i>Amon</i>, from the city of <i>No</i>, this is <i>Alexandria</i> from the land of Egypt, and against <i>Pharaoh, King of Egypt</i>, its foreign gods, and all those who rely on him.
“<i>I will deliver them into the hands who seek to kill them</i>” [46:26]. I will give them into the hands of their enemies who desire them, into the hands of <i>Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon.</i> Afterwards, they will rest where they previously peacefully rested. So said God.
“<i>But you, have no fear My servant Jacob, and do not be dismayed Israel</i>” [46:27]. You should not be afraid My servant Jacob and you should not be dismayed. That is, the Israelites, the righteous ones who are among the Egyptians. They should not be afraid when Nebuchadnezzar will attack Egypt.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Jeremiah, 46:27.</i>
“<i>I will deliver you from far away, etc.</i>” [46:27]. I will bring your helper from far away and your offspring from the land of their captivity. Jacob will be quiet and at ease. He will not be afraid.
“<i>But you have no fear, My servant Jacob, etc.</i>” [46:28]. You Israel have no fear. When I will destroy all the nations where you have been banished among the nations. I, God, am with you and I will not destroy you.
“<i>I will not leave you unpunished, but I will chastise you in measure</i>” [46:28]. Israel, I will punish, not with too little justice and not at one time, and will not diminish you and I do not want to completely exterminate you.
<i>Tanhuma</i> writes: There were four in the world who made themselves as God. Three were from the nations and the fourth from Israel. They are <i>Hiram, king of Tyre</i>, <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i>, <i>Pharaoh</i>, and <i>Joash</i> was the Israelite. The Holy One punished all of them, as we find concerning <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i>, who made himself as a god. The Holy One made him lowly. He had to run away from his kingdom in to the forest and the wilderness for seven years. He had to eat grass, like a wild beast or a domestic animal. Joash made himself for a god. He was concealed in the <i>Temple</i>, where the <i>High Priest</i> used to go on <i>Yom Kippur</i>, once a year.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">I.e. the Holy of Holies.</i> Joash was concealed in the same place for six years, from the time he was born until he was weaned from his mother’s breast. When he came out in peace, Israelites came to him and said: you must be a god, since nothing happened to you in that holy place. The High Priest only entered there on <i>Yom Kippur</i> and made a <i>joyous celebration</i> when he came out in peace. Therefore, you must be a god. He allowed himself to be convinced and made himself for a god and they bowed down to him.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Midrash Tanhuma</i> (ed. S.

The Talmud writes in <i>tractate Megillah</i>, <i>chapter four</i>, concerning the verse from the haftorah “<i>as Tabor is among the mountains</i>” [46:18]. <i>Rabbi Eliezer son of ha-Kappar</i> said: when the Messiah will come, the synagogues where people prayed and the <i>batei-midrash</i> where people studied will all come to the <i>land of Israel.</i> We learn this from the verse “<i>as Tabor is among the mountains.</i>” These were the two mountains that came to the Holy One on the day that the Torah was to be taught and given to Israel, that the Torah should be given on them. The Holy One gave them a good reward. They merited that they were placed in the <i>land of Israel.</i> Even more so the <i>synagogues</i> and <i>batei-midrash</i> where Torah is studied and prayers are offered. These same <i>synagogues</i> and <i>batei-midrash</i> will all come to the land of Israel, in the days of the Messiah.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Megillah,</i> 29a; <i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Jeremiah, <i>Remez</i> 331.</i>

Beshalach

<b>[Judges, 4:4–5:31]</b>
“<i>Deborah, the wife of Lapidoth was a prophetess, and she judged Israel at that time</i>” [4:4]. A woman whose name was <i>Deborah</i> was a <i>prophetess.</i> Her husband’s name was <i>Lapidoth</i>. He was the same as <i>Barak, son of Avinoam</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Judges 4:6.</i> The meaning of <i>Lapidoth</i> is fire and torch. Barak means lightning and fire. Our sages say that Deborah made wicks for the lights in the <i>Temple</i> and that is why she was called <i>Lapidoth</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Judges, <i>Remez</i> 42. According to this midrash, her wicks were distinguished by being extra thick, which made them burn longer and brighter.</i> This means, fire and torch. That is to say, she caused the light to burn in the <i>Temple</i>. From this we learn that it is a <i>mitzvah</i> to contribute to the lighting of the synagogue or to make wicks for the synagogue. Every synagogue is compared to the <i>Temple</i> and Deborah was a Judge and <i>sat over all of Israel to judge</i>, like a Judge of Israel.
The <i>haftorah</i> tells us that we should not hold women in low esteem and women themselves should not be despondent. <i>King Solomon, of blessed memory</i>, held women in low esteem and wrote many bad things about them, because he had many wives. Though King Solomon wrote many bad things about women, yet he never threw away any of them. He had a thousand wives. However, this <i>haftorah</i> shows many good things about women.
<i>Rabbenu Bahya</i>, in <i>parshat Beshallah</i><sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 15:20.</i> writes that one should not be surprised that a woman should be a <i>prophetess</i>, as Miriam was, and prophesied to her mother that she would have a son who would deliver Israel from the <i>Egyptian exile.</i> This is Moses who will be born. We find the same concerning Sarah. She was much more elevated and important in <i>prophecy</i> than Abraham, as the verse says, “<i>whatever Sarah tells you, do as she says</i>” [Genesis, 21:12].<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Exodus Rabbah,</i> 1.2.</i> Miriam recited the <i>Song</i> [at the Sea] separately from Moses and all the <i>righteous women</i> sang with Miriam. So too, <i>Abigail</i> was a prophetess and also <i>Hannah.</i> The Talmud in <i>tractate Megillah</i> says that seven women were <i>prophetesses</i> – <i>Sarah, Miriam, Hannah, Deborah, Huldah, Abigail, Esther.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Megillah,</i> 14a.</i>
This <i>haftorah</i> was chosen as equivalent to the <i>Song</i> that Moses recited at the <i>Sea.</i> This teaches us that <i>Deborah</i> was as <i>important</i> with her <i>Song</i> as Moses. In the past, there was a <i>decree</i> that people were not allowed to keep the Torah that Moses had written. It was also not allowed to read the Torah scroll on the Sabbath, since the reading of the Torah of Moses had been forbidden. Our sages thought that the Torah should not be forgotten and they searched in the <i>Twenty-Four</i> [books of the Bible] where something was found that was comparable to each Torah portion, so that this should be read in all synagogues instead of the Torah portion.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">This explanation is found in <i>Sefer Abudraham ha-Shalem.</i> Jerusalem, 1963, p. 172.</i> The sages caused that the <i>story of Deborah and her Song</i> should be read instead of the <i>Song of Moses.</i> This shows us that <i>Deborah</i> was as important as Moses.
“<i>She used to sit under the Palm</i>” [4:5]. <i>Deborah</i> sat under a date palm tree, teaching Torah to Israel and <i>judging Israel.</i> Why under a tree and not in the house? The reason is that it is not appropriate to go into a woman’s house, so that one should not <i>suspect</i> that she might be in a <i>room</i> alone with a man. Therefore, she sat in an open field under a tree.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Judges, <i>Remez</i> 42.</i> From this we learn that a woman should not go into a stranger’s house, without a <i>guardian</i>, so that she should not be suspected. Even if she is very pious, she should not rely on her piety. Deborah was a <i>prophetess</i> and she did not want that she should be <i>suspected.</i> The date palm was between <i>Ramah</i> and <i>Bet El</i> in the hills of <i>Ephraim. All of Israel</i> would come to <i>Deborah</i> for <i>judgment</i> and for <i>Torah.</i>
“<i>Deborah summoned</i>” [4:6]. Deborah called and sent for her husband, <i>Barak.</i> She had separated from her husband because she was a <i>prophetess.</i> That is why she sat under the tree.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Judges, 4:6.</i> Deborah said to Barak: gather together ten thousand men from the children of <i>Naphtali and Zebulun</i> that they should go to war with you.
“<i>And I will draw Sisera, the army commander, to you to the Wadi Kishon</i>” [4:7]. The astrologers said to the evil Sisera that he should not go to war, since he will be killed. However, the Holy One was the one who convinced Sisera that he should go to war, in the expectation that he would be killed and Israel would be saved.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Judges, 4:7.</i> This the meaning of the verse “<i>and I will draw.</i>” I will convince Sisera that he should come to the Kishon River with all of his people.
“<i>Barak said to her</i>” [4:8]. Barak said to Deborah. If you will go to war, then I will also go. However, if you won’t go, then I will also not go.
“<i>And she said, I will go with you</i>” [4:9]. Deborah said: I will go with you to the war, but it will not be for your <i>glory.</i> People will say that help came to Israel through a woman.
“<i>And Barak gathered</i>” [4:10]. Barak gathered ten thousand men from Naphtali and Zebulun at the city of <i>Kedesh</i>, and Deborah went with them.
“<i>And Sisera was informed</i>” [4:12]. And they told Sisera that the people had gathered on Mount <i>Tabor.</i> “<i>And Sisera gathered</i>” [4:13]. Sisera gathered all of his chariots, nine hundred chariots, and the horses had iron shoes. Our sages say that there were forty thousand chieftains and each one had one hundred thousand men. Sisera was thirty years old at the time. He was very strong and dominated the whole world. There was no city in the world that he could not make all of its walls collapse with his shout. All of the animals did not move from their cities when Sisera gave a shout because they were so afraid that they had to stay in the city since they could not run away.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Judges, <i>Remez</i> 43.</i>
“<i>And Deborah said to Barak</i>” [4:14]. Deborah said to Barak. Wake up, for this is the day that the Holy One has given Sisera and all of his people into your hands. The Holy One is going forth in the war to help Israel. Barak descended from Mount <i>Tabor</i> with ten thousand men.
“<i>And God caused panic</i>” [4:15]. The Holy One caused Sisera and all of his people to be confused. Barak killed them with the sword, and Sisera himself ran away from the chariots on foot.
“<i>And Barak pursued</i>” [4:16]. Barak pursued Sisera to the city of <i>Harosheth ha-goiim.</i> Sisera ran into the house of a woman called <i>Yael</i>, the wife of <i>Hever the Kenite</i>, since <i>Hever the Kenite had made peace</i> with the <i>king of Hazor</i>, the king over Sisera. That is why Sisera ran to the house of Yael. He thought that she would not betray him.
“<i>Yael went out</i>” [4:18]. And Yael went out to meet Sisera and she said to Sisera: come in my lord and do not be afraid. He went into her house and she covered him with a cloak. This is the meaning of the verse “<i>be-semichah</i>,” with a cloak. Some sages say that this means that Sisera did not touch Yael in order to sleep with her. This is the meaning of “<i>be-semichah.</i>” That is to say, my name should <i>testify</i> that <i>Yael</i> was just and did not sleep with Sisera. Thus says the Holy One “<i>shemi koh</i>,” My name testifies.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">The word “<i>shemi koh</i>” has the same letters as “<i>semichah.</i>” The word is split in half to create two new words with a new meaning. This interpretation is found in <i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Judges, <i>Remez,</i> 44.</i> From here we learn that every woman should be warned not to go into a <i>gentile</i> house alone. She will be <i>suspected</i> and they will not believe her that she is pure. Even though Sisera had run away and she had slit his throat, nonetheless it was <i>suspected</i> that he had slept with Yael, and the Holy One had to <i>testify</i> that she was pure.
Some sages say that Sisera slept with Yael seven times, one after another, but Yael’s intentions were <i>for the sake of Heaven.</i> <sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Nazir,</i> 23b; B. <i>Horayot,</i> 10b.</i> She wanted to bring <i>redemption</i> to Israel. Therefore, <i>Yael</i> was willing to do his will, expecting that he would sleep very soundly. She wanted to kill him easily while he was sleeping. Sisera thought that because he had slept with Yael, she was not a proper daughter of Israel, since the daughters of Israel were warned against illicit sexual relations. Concerning this, the verse says “<i>shemi koh.</i>” That is, My name shall testify that Yael had no intention to commit adultery, but she did it for the sake of Heaven.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Judges, <i>Remez,</i> 44.</i>
“<i>And he said to her</i>” [4:19]. Sisera said to Yael: give me a little water to drink, as I am very thirsty. She opened a small jug with milk in it. She gave him the milk to drink and she covered him. A midrash writes that Yael fed Sisera with her breast milk.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">This is based on the interpretation of this verse in B. <i>Niddah,</i> 55b.</i> One can ask a question. What was Sisera thinking? He had just barely escaped being killed and had run away. How did he lust after a woman? Sisera was very smart. He was afraid of Yael. He thought that perhaps Yael would give me over into the hands of the Israelites? Therefore <i>Sisera</i> said: I will test her to see if she is a proper <i>daughter of Israel.</i> If she will sleep with me, then she is no proper daughter of Israel, since God had forbidden illicit sexual relations. Therefore, I do not need to fear her. She would not betray me.
One can give another explanation. The Talmud says: “<i>A woman who sleeps with a gentile, it is difficult to separate them.</i>”<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Genesis Rabbah,</i> 80.11.</i> A <i>daughter of Israel</i> who sleeps with a <i>gentile</i>, it is very difficult to separate that <i>daughter of Israel</i> from that gentile. Therefore, Sisera thought that if I sleep with <i>Yael</i>, she would not betray me. She will hold on to me.
Another explanation. Sisera said: I know very well that the God of Israel hates it when Israelites engage in illicit sexual relations, as we find concerning <i>Balaam</i>, who advised the daughters of <i>Midian</i> that they should have sexual relations with the Israelites. They did so and caused twenty-four thousand Israelites to die in one hour, because of illicit sexual relations.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Sanhedrin,</i> 106a.</i> Sisera thought the same way and he wanted to have sexual relations with <i>Yael</i>, in the expectation that the Holy One would be angry at Israel. However, it did not work for him, since Yael’s intention was not about sexual relations, as the Holy One himself testified, that she was pure of sin.
“<i>And he said to her</i>” [4:20]. Sisera said to Yael: stand at the door and if someone will ask you if I am here, tell him that I was never here.
“<i>And Yael took</i>” [4:21]. And <i>Yael</i> took a nail from the house and came very quietly, with a hammer, to <i>Sisera</i> while he was sleeping, and hit the hammer into his <i>forehead</i>, while he slept. The nail went through his head into the ground. He was very tired and slept soundly. He was killed instantly.
“<i>Now</i>” [4:22]. <i>Barak</i> pursued <i>Sisera</i> and he came to the tent of <i>Yael.</i> Yael came out toward him and said: come, I will show you Sisera. Barak went and saw the nail sticking out of his head.
“<i>And God subdued</i>” [4:23]. The Holy One subdued the <i>king of Canaan</i> before Israel and cut them down completely and destroyed them.
“<i>And sang</i>” [5:1]. And <i>Deborah</i> and <i>Barak the son of Avinoam</i> sang.
“<i>When locks go untrimmed</i>” [5:2]. Israel always praises the Holy One, both when they are punished with <i>travails</i> and when all is well with them. <i>Deborah</i> sang: listen to me all the <i>kings</i> and all the princes. I will sing a song and praise to the Holy One, the God of Israel. When the Holy One gave the Torah, the earth trembled and the Heavens dripped water before the Holy One.
Deborah sang: I brought more help for Israel than the other Judges. There was before me a <i>Judge</i> by the name of <i>Shamgar.</i> Also, in the days of <i>Yael</i>, after she had already helped Israel, we were still not able to go freely, because of the nations. We could not go on the reads or into the cities that had no walls around them. Israel had to flee before the nations and fled to the cities that had walls, until I, Deborah, came and helped Israel out of their troubles. Israel was so deeply in exile that they chose to worship foreign gods. No sword and no bow helped Israel. Though they were forty thousand men and more, yet they fled from the enemy.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Judges, 5:6.</i>
Deborah said: I thank the chieftains of Israel that they were willing to go to war with me and I say to them that they should praise the Holy One who helped you. Praise God and sing to God, you <i>merchants</i> who used to be afraid to travel, because of the nations. Also, praise God, those who used to go to draw water at the river. The nations killed those people who drew the water and they had to go very quietly on the pebbles that would make noise whenever someone walked on those stones. The nations heard when Israel went and they killed Israel. Now praise the Holy One for the same city and the same stones.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Judges, 5:6.</i>
Deborah was somewhat haughty with her speech and as a result, the prophecy left her. She had to plead greatly with God that he should allow the prophecy to come upon her again. She sang to God: awake Deborah and sing to God that he has caused poor Israel to rule over great nobles, kings and mighty ones.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Pesahim,</i> 66b.</i> <i>Deborah</i> told and said: <i>Joshua</i> has killed many people of Amalek. Saul also killed many <i>Amalekites.</i> Many nobles of <i>Issachar</i> went with Deborah to the war. Barak went to war on foot, without a horse. However, I am angry with the children of Reuben. They sat at home herding their sheep and goats. They remained at home and watched their flocks. <i>Gilead</i>, also, who remained on the other side of the Jordan and were afraid of the war. <i>Dan</i>, also, ran away on the ships of other nations. These are not to be praised. However, <i>Zebulun</i> risked his neck in the war and also <i>Naphtali.</i>
Sisera gathered a large group of people. The Holy One came from heaven and helped Israel. The stars from Heaven fought against Sisera. The river Kishon drowned them all. The Holy One promised at the sea, when the Egyptians were drowned in the sea. The Holy One told the <i>prince</i> over the sea that he should throw out the Egyptians on the <i>dry land</i>, so that Israel should see their revenge on their enemies that they had drowned. The sea did not want to throw out the Egyptians. The sea said: you have given me a present, that my fish will have to eat, and you want to take them out. The Holy One said: I will repay you and give you other people to eat in the time of Sisera, and will give you more. The Egyptians had six hundred chariots and Sisera had nine hundred chariots. The stars made the iron horseshoes very hot with their fire and the horses ran into the river <i>Kishon</i> and their feet and nails fell off.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Pesahim,</i> 118b.</i>
There was a city near the war that was called <i>Meroz</i> and they did not come to help in the war. Therefore, Deborah cursed that city because the people did not come running to the battle. Some sages say that a star in the Heaven that was called <i>Meroz</i> which did not come to help. Therefore, Deborah cursed it because all the stars came to help and not the star <i>Meroz.</i> Some sages say that a certain <i>scholar</i> was called <i>Meroz.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Judges, <i>Remez</i> 54.</i>
“<i>I to God</i>” [5:3]. The <i>Yelamdenu</i> writes that when the Holy One wanted to give the Torah on Mount <i>Sinai</i>, two great mountains, <i>Tabor</i> and <i>Carmel</i>, came and said before the Holy One, give the Torah on us, since we are high. The Holy One said: I am giving the Torah on Mount Sinai. It is not very high, in the hope that Israel should not make themselves important and hold themselves aloof. The Holy One paid the two mountains as a good reward because they wanted that the Torah should be given on them. On Mount <i>Tabor</i>, help came to Israel that Sisera and his people were defeated. That is why <i>I, I</i> is written twice [in verse 5:3]. That is to say, Mount Tabor is also important, like Mount Sinai, on which the Torah was given, which begins with I and I is written two times. The Holy One paid Mount <i>Carmel</i> a good reward because on it was said, “<i>the Lord alone is God</i>” [I Kings 18:39]. The name of the Holy One was sanctified on Mount Carmel when the <i>prophet Elijah</i> slaughtered the false prophets.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Judges, <i>Remez</i> 47.</i>
“<i>When You came forth from Seir</i>” [5:4]. The Yalkut writes a midrash that when the Holy One gave the Torah, there was a great fire. The Holy One then gave good <i>dew</i> over Israel and also great rains, lightning and thunder. All the nations came to Balaam and said: will the Holy bring another Flood again over the world? Balaam responded: the Holy One is giving the Torah to Israel and that is why He is giving the Torah with fire and water, to frighten Israel, that they should be afraid. However, the nations did not want to turn to it, and receive the Torah. Therefore, the Holy One will severely punish and judge them when the Messiah comes.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Judges, <i>Remez</i> 48.</i>
The Talmud said in [tractate] <i>Pesahim: Rabbi Judah</i> said in the name of <i>Rav.</i> Whoever pursues arrogance, if he is wise, then the Holy One takes away his wisdom and makes him a fool. If he is a prophet, then the prophecy is removed from him. We find this with regard to <i>Deborah.</i> She was haughty and the Holy One took the <i>prophecy</i> away from her. She had to shout very loudly before the <i>prophecy</i> returned.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Pesahim,</i> 66b.</i>
The Talmud writes in [tractate] <i>Pesahim, chapter 10.</i> The river <i>Kishon</i> carried all the people to the <i>sea</i> that were drowned in it. The river <i>Kishon</i> was <i>responsible</i> to bring the <i>nations of the world</i> to the sea, rather than the Holy One who threw the Egyptians out of the sea.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Pesahim,</i> 118b.</i>
“<i>Because they did not come to the aid of the Lord</i>” [5:23]. Whoever helps Israel, it is as if they have helped the Holy One. Whoever injures Israel, it is as if they have tried to injure the Holy One.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mekhilta de Rabbi Yishmael, Shira</i>, 6.</i>
“<i>Most blessed of women be Yael</i>” [5:24]. The Talmud writes in [tractate] <i>Sotah. Rabbi Nahman</i> said: it is better when a person commits a sin for the <i>sake of Heaven</i>, it is much better than someone who fulfills a commandment, not for the <i>sake of Heaven.</i> We find this in the case of <i>Yael.</i> She slept with <i>Sisera</i> because she wanted to help Israel. Scripture praises <i>Yael</i> much more than <i>Sarah, Rebecca, Rachel, Leah</i>, even though <i>Sarah, Rebecca, Rachel, and Leah</i> also gave birth to and raised the children of Israel. However, if <i>Yael</i> had not existed, <i>heaven forbid</i>, all the children of Israel would have been killed by Sisera.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Horayot,</i> 10b.</i>
“<i>In the tents</i>” [5:24]. Scripture called Sarah, Rebecca, Rachel, Leah “<i>ohel.</i>” This means tent. That is to say, a pious woman who always sits in her tent and in her house. She does not run out when she does no have to go out.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Horayot,</i> 10b.</i>
“<i>Her hand reached</i>” [5:26]. The Yalkut writes a midrash that <i>Yael</i> took an iron nail and did not take a sword to kill Sisera. She was very <i>righteous</i> and she did not want to take a sword because a woman should not wear the same clothes as a man. Similarly, a woman should not put on the sword of a man.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Judges, <i>Remez</i> 56.</i>
“<i>Between her feet</i>” [5:27]. The Talmud in [tractate] <i>Yevamot</i> writes. <i>Rabbi Johanan</i> said: <i>Sisera</i> slept with <i>Yael</i> seven times in the same day.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Yevamot,</i> 103a.</i>
“<i>Through the window</i>” [5:28]. The mother of <i>Sisera</i> was looking through the window, to see why he was not coming, since Sisera always used to come home every day. She sought advice from her nobles. They said to her that Sisera was delayed because they were dividing up the beautiful daughters of Israel that Sisera had captured. They are also dividing up the other booty. However, a <i>Heavenly voice</i> went forth, “<i>so may all Your enemies perish</i>” [5:31]. That is, you are mistaken.

Yitro

<b>[Isaiah, 6:1–7:6]</b>
“<i>In the year that King Uzziah died</i>” [6:1]. Isaiah <i>prophesied</i> in the days when <i>King Uzziah</i> wanted to be a priest. He brought an <i>incense offering</i> into the <i>Temple</i> and the Holy One made <i>King Uzziah a leper.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Leviticus Rabbah,</i> 17.3.</i> That is why he is referred to as if he was dead, since a leper was treated as if he was dead. We find this in <i>Genesis Rabbah.</i> Four are considered as if they had died: a pauper, a leper, a blind person, and someone who has no children.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Genesis Rabbah,</i> 71.6.</i> <i>Uzziah</i> was the king over Israel and also wanted to be a priest. He thought that he was entitled to have it, even though he was not a descendant of <i>Aaron the priest.</i>
The order of things is that when the Holy One gives someone honor and wealth, then he wants to have even more honor. That is why the <i>Menorat haMaor</i> writes at the end of his book that Israel is compared to a grapevine. The more bunches of grapes it has, the more it bends until the bunches of grapes fall to the ground, out of heaviness. Israel should be the same way. When God gives someone wealth and kingship, he should hold himself very humble, in the hope that he should not pursue arrogance.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Aboab, Isaac. <i>Menorat ha-Maor</i>, Ner 7, Principle 1, Part 1, Chapter 1.</i> That is why we are commanded in our prayers where we should bow down in the <i>Shmoneh Esreh</i> and one should not bow more than four times. The first time he should bow is when he begins the <i>Shmoneh Esreh.</i> The next time he should bow is when he ends the blessing, <i>Magen Avraham.</i> The third time he should bow is at <i>Modim Anahnu Lach.</i> The fourth time he should bow is that the blessing, <i>ha-Tov Shimha u-Lecha Naeh le-Hodot</i>, and should not bow down during the whole <i>Shmoneh Esreh.</i> However, the High Priest who considered himself higher and because he was more important, therefore he had to bow at each blessing of the <i>Shmoneh Esreh</i>, when he began and when he ended the blessing, in the expectation that he will not consider himself arrogant. However, a king who began the <i>Shmoneh Esreh</i> and bowed does not need to stand until he had finished the whole <i>Shmoneh Esreh.</i> He was very important and therefore he had to bow. However, <i>King Uzziah</i> did not want to look at this. It was not enough for him that he was a king; he also wanted to be a priest. That is why God made him a leper. From here we should learn that one should not take too much honor or leadership that is not his.
“<i>And I saw</i>” [6:1]. Isaiah said: I saw the Holy One sitting on a high throne and his feet were placed on the <i>Temple</i>, and the edge of His garment filled the <i>Temple.</i> One asks a question. How did Isaiah say that he saw the Holy One and remained alive? The explanation is that he saw the Holy One like when one sees something through a glass, but he did not see Him directly.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Isaiah, 6:1.</i> Isaiah said: I saw burning angels standing near the Holy One. Each one had six wings; with two wings he flew, with two wings he covered his face, so that he should not see the Holy One, and with two wings he covered his feet, since each angel had feet like those of a calf. Therefore, each angel covered his feet that one should not be reminded of the <i>calf</i> that the Israelites made, the golden calf in the wilderness.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Leviticus Rabbah,</i> 27.3.</i> That is also why he saw that the angels had a fiery appearance. That is to say, Israel should have been punished by burning for their sin that time.
The <i>Yelamdenu</i> writes about “<i>the skirts of His robe filled the Temple</i>” [6:1]. These are the eighty priests who went into the <i>Temple</i> with King <i>Uzziah.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Isaiah, <i>Remez</i> 404.</i>
“<i>Seraphs stood</i>” [6:1]. Uzziah deserved to be <i>burned</i>, like <i>Korah</i> and his companions, who also wanted to take on the position of <i>High Priest</i> and they were burned.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Isaiah, <i>Remez</i> 404.</i> A midrash writes that <i>Michael</i> stood at the right side of the Holy One and was eighteen thousand times ten thousand miles wide. <i>Gabriel</i> stood on the left side of the Holy One and was equally wide. This is the meaning of the verse “<i>Seraphs stood above Him</i>” [6:2]. The word “<i>Him</i> [<i>lo</i>]” has the numerical value of thirty-six. This alludes to the two times was eighteen thousand times ten thousand miles, and together they are thirty-six. <i>Gabriel</i> flies the whole length of the world with two flaps of his wings.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The last sentence is found in B. <i>Berakhot,</i> 4b.

“<i>And one would call to the other</i>” [6:3]. The angels ask permission of one another and say, let us recite <i>Shirah</i> and <i>Kedushah</i> together. If one of them should recite the <i>Kedushah</i> ahead or another afterwards, they are to be punished by burning in fire.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Isaiah, 6:3.</i> That is why it is written in the prayerbook, “<i>they all answer as one.</i>” The angels recite the Kedushah all together. From this we learn, when we pray in the synagogue where there are many people, to recite the Kedushah together. The <i>Aggadat Shmuel</i> writes that the angels offered the honor to their colleagues, each saying to his friend; you begin, since you are more important than I am. This is the meaning of “<i>And one would call to the other.</i>”<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Isaiah, <i>Remez</i> 404.</i>
The Talmud writes in [tractate] <i>Hullin</i>, <i>chapter seven.</i> Three groups recite <i>Shirah</i> every day. The first <i>group</i> says, “<i>Holy</i>”; the second <i>group</i> says “<i>Holy Holy</i>”; the third <i>group</i> says “<i>Holy Holy Holy, the Lord of Hosts</i>” [6:3]. Israel are much more beloved than the angels, because Israel recite <i>Shirah</i> at all hours, but the angels only recite <i>Shirah</i> once a day. Some sages say that the angels recite <i>Shirah</i> once in forty years and some sages say that the angels recite <i>Shirah</i> once every day. Israel are much better than the angels, since the angels do not recite <i>Shirah</i>, but Israel must first recite <i>Shirah</i> on the earth and afterwards the angels recite <i>Shirah</i> in Heaven.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Hullin,</i> 91b.</i>
“<i>The doorposts would shake</i>” [6:4]. The doorposts of the <i>Temple</i> would shake from the great shouts of the angels, one to another. From here we learn to jump at <i>Holy</i>, <i>Holy</i>, <i>Holy</i> in memory of the doorposts of the <i>Temple</i> that would jump when the angels invited one another to say <i>Holy.</i>
“<i>Smoke</i>” [6:4]. Isaiah said: I saw that the <i>Temple</i> was full of smoke. This showed me that Israel was full of sins and the Holy One was angry with them.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Isaiah, 6:4.</i>
“<i>I am lost</i>” [6:5]. <i>Isaiah</i> said that he must die because he was not worthy to see the Shekhinah, because his lips were <i>unclean.</i> I am also among a people whose lips are unclean. Therefore, I am not <i>worthy</i> to see the <i>Shekhinah.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Isaiah, 6:5.</i>
“<i>And an angel flew</i>” [6:6]. <i>Isaiah</i> said: I became afraid because of the great noise and I thought that I would die. An angel flew over to me and he had a fiery coal that he had taken from the fire on the <i>altar</i> with tongs. He placed that coal on my lips. The angel said: I will remove your sins on your mouth, with the burning coal. The Midrash says that the sin was that you spoke ill of Israel. You called them “<i>of unclean lips</i>” [6:5].<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Song of Songs Rabbah,</i> 1.6.</i>
The <i>Pesikta Rabbah</i> writes: <i>Isaiah</i> said: the angels praised God and I was silent. I did not praise with the angels. It must be that I am “<i>of unclean lips</i>” and the people among whom I live are also of <i>unclean lips.</i> The Holy One said: You Isaiah can say about yourself that you are of unclean lips. However, I will not tolerate your saying that the children of Israel are of <i>unclean lips.</i> Therefore, the Holy One quickly paid him his due and let him be burned with a coal on his mouth. Therefore, everyone should be warned not to speak ill of Israel, whether one is a <i>head of a yeshiva</i> or the <i>head of a community</i>, he will soon be punished by the Holy One since Israel are the children of the Holy One. He is their father and one should not speak ill of His children, as we find concerning three who were punished through Israel because they spoke ill of Israel.

“<i>With a pair of tongs</i>” [6:6]. This verse teaches us that the <i>power</i> of the righteous is much greater than that of angels. The Holy One commanded the angel to take a burning coal from he heavenly altar. He used a pair of tongs to take the coal, because he would singe his hands, so he used tongs and took a coal and laid it on Isaiah’s mouth and the coal did not singe him. This is because Isaiah was more righteous and therefore the coal did not hurt him.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Pesikta Rabbati</i>, <i>Piska</i> 33.</i>

If one does not recite the <i>va-yechulu</i>, he does not testify about God. If one does not testify, then Scripture says, “<i>if does not give information, he is subject to punishment</i>” [Leviticus, 5:1]. He commits a great sin when he can testify about his friend and he does not want to testify. <i>How much more</i> so when he can testify about the Holy One, how great a sin is it when he does not testify.

“<i>It was told to the house of David</i>” [7:2]. It was told to the <i>house of David</i> that the king of <i>Aram</i> came to wage war. They became very frightened and were very troubled. Their hearts shook like a tree in the forest on which no fruits grow. They shake greatly and their sound travels very far.
<i>Genesis Rabbah</i> writes: Why does Scripture say that their hearts shook like a tree in the forest that has no fruits, and not like a tree that has fruit. The answer is: they say to the river <i>Perath</i>, why do you your waters not make noise like the other waters that can be heard from a distance? The river <i>Perath</i> answered: I do not need to make noise. Everyone knows what I am. The trees that are planted near me grow in thirty days. The vegetables that one plants near my waters grow in three days. They came to the river <i>Hidekel</i> and asked it: why are you so noisy? The river <i>Hidekel</i> responded: I want to be heard, so my waters make noise. My waters are not as praised as other waters. Therefore, I have to shout, so I will show that I am also something in the world. They came to the trees that have good fruits and asked them: why don’t we hear you make noise like other trees that make very loud noise because of the wind? The trees responded: we are known through our fruits and we are praised even when we are quiet. However, the trees in the forest say that we must make much noise since we are not noticed. Therefore, we must make noise and let it be known that we also exist. That is why Scripture says, “<i>trembled like the trees of the forest.</i>” Their hearts trembled like a tree in the forest.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Genesis Rabbah,</i> 16.3.</i> From here we learn that whoever brags and praises himself, must not be.

Similarly, the trees in the forest boast with great noise, because they are insignificant.

Mishpatim

<b>[Jeremiah, 34:8–22]</b>
“<i>The word which came to Jeremiah</i>” [34:8]. God spoke to <i>Jeremiah</i> that <i>King Zedekiah</i> should make a covenant with the people of Israel, to proclaim freedom for all the people. Everyone should set free his or her Jewish male and female slaves, so that one Jew should not serve his brother.
“<i>And the officials heard</i>” [34:10]. And the officials and the people listened and joined the covenant that each person should set his male and female slaves free.
“<i>Afterwards, they turned around, etc.</i>” [34:11]. They soon turned around and each one took back his male and female slaves, that they had freed and forced them again to work.
“<i>And the word of the Lord</i>” [34:12]. The word came to Jeremiah saying, “<i>Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel</i>” [34:13]. Thus says the God of Israel: I made a covenant with your ancestors on the day that I took Israel out of Egypt, from the house of Pharaoh, where they were slaves.
“<i>In the seventh year</i>” [34:14]. When the seventh year comes, each person should set his male and female slaves free. Your ancestors did not observe this for very long and did not listen to Me. Afterwards, they listened to My words and observed them, and they again made a covenant that each one will free his slaves. Now they have profaned My holy name by taking back their slaves that they had set free. Therefore, God said: because you did not want to free your male and female slaves, I will set you free among the nations, to the sword, to pestilence, and hunger. You will be abandoned to the kings.
“<i>The officials of Judah</i>” [34:19]. I will give the officials of Judah, the officials of Jerusalem and all the priests into the hands of their enemies. Their corpses will be food for the birds of the sky and the animals of the earth.
“<i>And Zedekiah</i>” [34:21]. I will give <i>Zedekiah, king of Judah</i>, and all of his officials into the hands of their enemies, into the hands of the king of Babylon, who has withdrawn from you. I will bring them back to the city and they will vanquish it and burn it with fire. I will allow the cities of Judah to be devastated, so that nobody will inhabit them. One asks a question. What is the relationship between their not wanting to free their slaves and the Holy One’s severe punishment and the destruction of their holy city? The answer is as Bahya writes in <i>parshat Mishpatim.</i> The Torah tells us that the slave rests in the seventh year and goes free and leaves his master. It is a <i>remembrance of the Exodus from Egypt</i>, that the Holy One showed His <i>wonders</i> in Egypt. It is also a <i>remembrance</i> that the Holy One created the world and rested on the Sabbath, the seventh day. That is to say, the Holy One took <i>Israel</i>, who were slaves to <i>Pharaoh in Egypt</i>, to be servants to His holy name, as the verse says, “<i>For it is to Me that Israel are servants</i>” [Leviticus, 25:55]. <i>Israel</i> are My servants because I took them out of Egypt. Therefore, no slave should be with his master more than six years, and he should go free in the seventh year. This is shown by the verse that says, “<i>they are my servants, whom I freed from the land of Egypt</i>” [Leviticus, 25:55]. That is, because I took Israel out of Egypt, therefore Israel are My servants and not slaves of one Jew to another. If the slave does not want to go free in the seventh year, then he does not want to be the servant of the Holy One, and states, heaven forbid, that he has forgotten that God took him out of Egypt with miracles and wonders. Furthermore, it is a great <i>mitzvah</i> to free the slaves. One remembers that God created the world in six days and rested on the Sabbath. The seventh day is like the seventh year that the slave should also rest. Therefore, the slave also points to <i>Ma</i>’<i>ase Bereshit</i> [the act of Creation], that the Holy One rested on the seventh day when He created the world.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Bahya, Exodus, 21:2.</i> Therefore, the Holy One was very angry with Israel when they did not want to free their slaves. This is as if the Holy One did not create the world or take Israel out of Egypt. The Holy One commanded many commandments that we should remember that God created the world and took Israel out of Egypt to be servants to His holy name. Therefore, they were expelled from their land because of that sin.
“<i>Thus said the Lord: as surely as I have established My covenant with day and night</i>” [33:25]. Thus said God: Did I not make a covenant with heaven and earth and with day and night that they should always exist? If it were so, would I reject the <i>descendants of Jacob</i> and my servant <i>David</i> and not take his children to be rulers, kings over the <i>descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.</i> Therefore, I must preserve them and must make rulers from them as long as I have my <i>covenant</i> with heaven and earth.
The <i>Yelamdenu</i> writes: “<i>My covenant</i>” [33:25]. This means the covenant of circumcision. That is to say, the <i>merit of circumcision</i> helps Israel that they may have an existence in the world. The Sabbath and circumcision argued with each other. The Sabbath said: I am more important than you. The Holy One rested on me when He created the world. Circumcision responded to the Sabbath: I am more important than you. Was there not someone for whom the world was created, thus the world was created because of circumcision, as Scripture says, “<i>if not for My covenant day and night</i>” [33:25]. <i>Rabbi Judah the son of Shalom</i> said: It is a parable about two important <i>noblewomen</i> that stand together and no person can know which one is better. However, when one of them steps out of the road before the other noblewoman, then we can understand that the one who goes off the road before her friend, that one is less important because she has gone off the road. In the same way, no work should be <i>done</i> on the Sabbath. When a circumcision occurs on the Sabbath, one does an act of work and performs the circumcision of the child on the eighth day, even if it is the Sabbath. The Sabbath left the road before the circumcision.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Jeremiah, <i>Remez</i> 321.</i>
One asks a question. How is it that these two commandments come to argue with each other? What kind of <i>hatred or envy</i> do they have for each other? One can ask another question. How does all this depend on the dispute between the Sabbath and circumcision? The explanation is that when the slave goes free in the seventh year and rests, this is a <i>remembrance of</i> “<i>the act of Creation</i>,” that God created the world and rested on the seventh day. That is why we are commanded to rest on the seventh day, to remember that God rested on the seventh day. Circumcision was also commanded that the person should rest. He should not go to have sexual relations with women day and night. That is why circumcision was given so that the person should also rest. These are three commandments: one is to free the slave, the second is the Sabbath and the third is circumcision. They were all equally commanded for rest. Therefore, one depends on the other. That is why the two commandments, Sabbath and circumcision argued with each other. You were commanded concerning rest, just like me. Why should someone be circumcised on the Sabbath, on my day, when no work is supposed to be performed? Circumcision responded to the Sabbath, I am better. Were I not better, the world would perish. That is to say, the world perishes when the person engages in licentiousness, as we find with the Flood. The whole world was destroyed because of licentiousness. However, with the circumcision that one circumcises the person, the person is not so licentiousness and the world <i>exists</i> because of the circumcision. Therefore, the redemption will come through the <i>merit of circumcision. Amen.</i>

Terumah

<b>[I Kings, 5:26–6:13]</b>
“<i>The Lord had give Solomon great wisdom</i>” [5:26]. The Holy One had given great wisdom to <i>King Solomon.</i> He was very wise and all the people loved him because he was very wise. <i>King Hiram</i> made peace with him and gave Solomon enough wood to build the Temple.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, I Kings, 5:26.</i> King Hiram had great forests of fir trees and they were brought from King Hiram to the sea, to be taken to Jerusalem to build the Temple. From here we learn that great good deeds are possible for those who are at peace with all people. Scripture tells us that he made peace out of great wisdom. That is to say, wisdom influences someone to have peace with all people. There is no greater wisdom than to have peace. Our sages in the Talmud also said, when Israel are at peace with each other, if they would worship foreign gods, the Holy One would forgive their sins, because they were at peace with each other.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Genesis Rabbah,</i> 38.6.</i>
One can ask a question. What is the relationship between having peace and the Holy One forgiving their sin of worshiping foreign gods, since this is the greatest sin? <i>Rabbi Ephraim</i> gives an explanation in his book, <i>Olelot Ephraim.</i> This is because when Israel have peace with each other and always talk with each other. When they would worship foreign gods, they would come to talk with each other and dissuade each other from the worship of foreign gods, and they will become aware that the foreign gods are nothing. As a result of this, they will worship the Holy One, and cease worshiping foreign gods. This is the meaning of the <i>statement</i> that when Israel have peace, the Holy One forgives their sins. That is to say, they will soon leave the foreign god, when they talk with each other. However, when, <i>heaven forbid</i>, hatred and war occurs among Israel and they worship foreign gods, then one would not listen to the other one and would not agree with what they are saying. Even if a very wise man among them would say wise things, they would not understand him and consider him as nothing. The will remain with their sins. Therefore, peace is a very great attribute.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Olelot Ephraim</i>, Part 2, <i>Amud</i> 2, <i>Ma</i>’<i>amar</i> 23, (I: 53–54).</i> Our sages said: “<i>scholars increase peace.</i>”<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Berakhot,</i> 64a.</i> This means that the righteous ones and <i>scholars</i> desire to make peace and they will always gather together, even with evildoers, and desire to pray together, and desire to study Torah. Each person is obligated to rebuke his friend, since one is a guarantor for the other. That is, when the evildoer commits sins, then the righteous one is also punished.
Another explanation is that the righteous one who wants to have peace and wants to join together with the evildoer, expecting that the Holy One should see the deeds of the evildoer and should see in contrast the deeds of the righteous one and should weigh them in the scales. The righteous one will come out well since he has many good deeds and the evildoer has many evil deeds. Thus, the Holy One will give the righteous one a good reward. However, concerning the evil one Scripture says, “<i>there is no peace</i> – <i>said the Lord</i> – <i>for the evildoers</i>” [Isaiah, 48:22]. That is to say, the evildoer does not desire peace, that they will gather together with the righteous. They fear that the Holy One will recognize their evil deeds, in comparison to the good deeds of the righteous, and will punish them for their evil deeds. Peace is the greatest virtue that one should not argue and a person should forgive his fellow when he has said something evil. The Talmud in <i>tractate Rosh Hashanah,</i> chapter one: <i>Raba</i> said: “<i>He who forgoes his right [to exact punishment] is forgiven all of his sins.</i>”<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Rosh Hashanah,</i> 17a.</i> This means that whoever forgives his fellow for the evil that he said about him, then the Holy One also forgives him for his sins against the Holy One.
We will conclude writing about peace and write about what is written in <i>Genesis Rabbah.</i> Our sages say that Hiram who lived in the days of <i>King Solomon</i> also lived in the days of Judah. Hiram was called Hirah in the days of Judah. He was a <i>jester</i> and accompanied brides. He assisted in the <i>mitzvah</i> of Judah marrying Tamar, from which came <i>Peretz and Zerah. King David</i> was descended from them and his son Solomon, who built the <i>Temple.</i> Some sages say that <i>Hiram</i> was five hundred years old.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Genesis Rabbah,</i> 85.4.</i>
“<i>King Solomon imposed forced labor</i>” [5:27]. <i>King Solomon</i> took thirty thousand men and forced them to chop wood for the <i>Temple</i> from the forest of Hiram. He did not allow the Israelites to work excessively hard. Solomon sent ten thousand men from Israel to the forest and these ten thousand men were in the forest for a whole <i>month.</i> At the end of the month, they rested at home for two months with their wives.
The <i>Jerusalem Talmud</i> writes in [tractate] <i>Ketubot: Rabbi Abbahu</i> says that God loves the fulfillment of, <i>be fruitful and multiply</i> more than the building of the <i>Temple.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, I Kings, <i>Remez</i> 180.</i> The Israelites were in the forest for only one month and at home with their wives for two months in order to fulfill <i>be fruitful and multiply.</i>
The Talmud says in [tractate] <i>Ketubot:</i> A <i>scholar</i> who wants to leave his wife to study Torah should not leave for more than a month. If he wants to study for a longer period, he must first ask his wife. If she will tell him to go, then he is allowed to go study.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Ketubot,</i> 61b.</i> However, the wives who allow their husbands to study Torah have as great merit as if they had studied Torah themselves.
The Talmud in [tractate] <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> says that <i>King Solomon</i> began to build the Temple four years after he became king.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Rosh Hashanah,</i> 2b.</i>
“<i>Solomon had</i>” [5:29]. <i>King Solomon</i> had seventy thousand who carried heavy loads and eighty thousand who quarried stones in the great mountains. There were three thousand and three hundred officials appointed over the people who forced the people when they did not work seriously. They brought very large stones for the foundation of the Temple.
“<i>It was eighty</i>” [6:1]. It was four hundred and eighty years after Israel had left Egypt, in the fourth year of his kingship that Solomon began to build in the <i>month of Iyyar.</i>
“<i>The House that was built</i>” [6:2]. The House that <i>King Solomon</i> built was sixty cubits long and twenty cubits wide and thirty cubits high.
“<i>The portico</i>” [6:3]. A portico in front of the Temple was twenty cubits long and ten cubits wide.
“<i>He made windows for the House</i>” [6:4]. He made windows in the Temple, but the windows were not like other windows, like those of our houses. The Talmud says in [tractate] <i>Menahot: Rabbi Abin the Levite</i> said that the windows of other houses are made long and wide on the outside and smaller on the inside, so that light should come inside from the world. However, the windows of the Temple were the opposite. They were wide and long on the inside and smaller on the outside. The Temple gave light to the outside, to the world. That is to say, the Temple caused the whole world to have enough light. The Holy One says: I do not need light from the Temple, since the sun in heaven is in a case, but in the <i>month of Tammuz</i> it comes out of its case and causes great heat in the world, awaiting that the grain should ripen from the heat of the sun. The Holy One says that the person cannot look directly at the sun and when he cannot see the light of My creatures, then what do I need your light from the Temple?<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, I Kings, <i>Remez</i> 182.

Haninah said: once I also had to bring something to <i>Jerusalem.</i> He saw a large stone that was very beautiful. Five men came along and <i>Rabbi Haninah</i> said to them. Will you bring this stone for me to Jerusalem? They said: give us five gulden, but also put your hand on it and we will quickly bring the stone to Jerusalem. Rabbi Haninah put his fingers on it and they came to Jerusalem in an hour. Rabbi Haninah wanted to pay the men, but he could not find them. The sages say that they were <i>angels.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, I Kings, <i>Remez</i> 182.</i>
The Talmud writes in [tractate] <i>Sotah</i>, in <i>chapter nine.</i> They did not have any iron to build and to hew the stones of the Temple. However, at the mountains where the stones were quarried, they had iron axes to hew. However, at the Temple, they built the walls and no iron was heard, but the <i>shamir</i> split the stones. They marked the stone with black ink where they wanted it split and they placed the <i>shamir</i> on the mark and it split the stone. Our sages say that the <i>shamir</i> was a small worm that was as small as a barley seed and nothing in the world could withstand it. It split everything and it was wrapped in tufts of wool.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Sotah,</i> 48b; <i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, I Kings, <i>Remez</i> 182.</i>
The Midrash <i>Shohar Tov</i> writes that the <i>shamir</i> was brought from the <i>Garden of Eden</i> by an eagle. <i>King Solomon</i> could speak with all the birds and he asked the eagle to bring him the <i>shamir.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, I Kings, <i>Remez</i> 182.</i>
Alternatively, the Talmud says in [tractate] <i>Gittin</i>, in chapter <i>seven. King Solomon</i> asked the sages: with what should I split the stones? They said: with the <i>shamir</i> that <i>Moses Our Teacher</i> used to split the precious stones for the <i>High Priest</i>’<i>s</i> breastplate. He said: how should it be brought? The sages said that the demons would tell you. He asked the demons and they answered that <i>Ashmodai</i>, the king of the demons, knows where the <i>shamir</i> is found. King Solomon sent Benayahu to the city where Ashmodai was found. He had a well dug in a mountain, filled with water, and he sealed the well. Ashmodai went to the Heavenly Academy every day and after the session he came down from Heaven and drank from the well. Benayahu went and made a hole in the side of the well so that the water went out of the well and stopped up the hole where the water went out and he introduced strong wine into the well that previously had water.
Ashmodai came down from the Academy after the session and he wanted to drink. He found the wine and said, Scripture says, “<i>lechery, wine and new wine take away understanding</i>” [Hosea, 4:11]. That is to say, wine brings a person to lechery and much evil. He would not have drunk, but a great thirst came over him, as Scripture says, “<i>wine cheers the heart of man</i>” [Psalms, 104:15]. That is to say, wine makes the heart of the person happy. He drank and drank and fell asleep. Then Benayahu came and threw a chain over Ashmodai, captured him and brought him to King <i>Solomon.</i>
He asked Ashmodai: tell me where is the <i>shamir?</i> He said that it is found with the <i>Prince of the Sea</i> who gave it to the woodcock to hide it and he hid the <i>shamir</i> in a distant mountain. Benayahu searched the nest of a woodcock and they found it in the nest of a woodcock that had young chicks in it. They brought a large clear glass and covered the woodcock chicks in the nest with the glass. The woodcock came to the nest and saw its chicks under the glass in the nest and it could not reach them. It brought the <i>shamir</i> and laid it on the glass and the glass split. Benayahu came quickly and he chased the woodcock away and took the <i>shamir.</i> The woodcock hung itself out of anguish that it had lost the <i>shamir</i> that had been given to it for safekeeping.
Ashmodai remained with King Solomon for a long time, until he finished building the Temple. Solomon said to Ashmodai: what powers do you have that are more than other people? Ashmodai responded: take off my chain and give me your <i>seal</i> and I will show you what powers I have. He took off the chain and gave him the <i>seal</i> and Ashmodai threw him four hundred miles. Ashmodai made himself look like King Solomon and he slept with the wives of King Solomon. Solomon ran through the whole world and said: I am King Solomon from Jerusalem. The people laughed and made fun of him, saying what kind of fool is this? The <i>Sanhedrin</i> said: what kind of fool is this that he would <i>shout</i> that he is the king? They said that Solomon’s wives should be asked if King Solomon is with them. They said: we do not know him or recognize him. They said to the wives: you should look at his feet, since he has the feet of a chicken. The wives responded that he lies in bed in socks and we cannot see his feet. The wives said that he wants to sleep with us when we are menstruating and he also desires to sleep with his mother, <i>Bathsheba.</i> This is all a novelty for Solomon. The <i>Sanhedrin</i> did not hesitate and brought the real Solomon and gave him the Tetragrammaton and as soon as he saw the Name and Solomon, <i>Ashmodai</i> flew away. <sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Gittin,</i> 68a-b; <i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, I Kings, <i>Remez</i> 182.</i> Solomon was king again, but he feared <i>Ashmodai</i> every day. Therefore, no person should rely on his wealth, or wisdom, or ancestry, since this happened to King Solomon.
The <i>Mekhilta</i> writes that it was not correct to use iron [tools] in the Temple, since iron causes the life of a person to be shortened, while the altar and Temple cause life to be lengthened. Thus, it was not correct to pick up iron [tools] to build the Temple.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mekhilta de Rabbi Yishmael, Yitro</i>, 11; <i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, I Kings, <i>Remez</i> 182.</i>
“<i>This House that you are building</i>” [6:12]. The Holy One said to Solomon: the House you are building, if you will keep My commandments and My Torah, then I will keep My words that I said to your father and I will rest among you. The prophet <i>Ahijah the Shilonite</i> said this to Solomon in the name of the Holy One.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, I Kings, <i>Remez</i> 183.</i> That is to say, the Holy One had him say to Solomon; do not think that everything depends on this beautiful building, the quantities of gold and silver that you put in it, but you should also be pious.

<b>[Ezekiel, 43:10–27]</b>
“<i>You, mortal, describe to the House of Israel</i>” [43:10]. The Holy One said: go and tell the House of Israel that the <i>Temple</i> that will be built in the days of the Messiah will remain standing forever. Therefore, Israel should be ashamed of their sins that they committed and because of which the <i>Temple</i> was destroyed. Therefore, let them measure the dimensions of the Temple so that they will again be able to make a similar Temple when the Messiah will come.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Ezekiel, 43:10.</i>
“<i>When they will be ashamed of all that they have done</i>” [43:11]. When Israel will repent and will be ashamed of their sins; write down the measurements of the Temple before their eyes. They will certainly again have another Temple and will be worthy to see the same Temple. Every person who believes that the Messiah will come will be worthy to live to attain the coming of the Messiah. Concerning this, Scripture says, “<i>and they will keep and observe the whole plan</i>” [43:11]. That is to say, they should remember the measure and the plan in their hearts. Through the merit of their belief, they will have the merit to see the Temple and the Messiah. However, the one who will not believe and will not inscribe the measures and guard them. That is to say, he will not believe it, will not be worthy to see the Messiah and will not live to participate in the resurrection of the dead.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Ezekiel, 43:11.</i>
“<i>And the altar hearth, four cubits</i>” [43:15]. The altar was four cubits high.

“<i>And He said</i>” [43:18]. The Holy One said, listen. When the <i>Temple</i> will be built, bring a burnt offering and sprinkle blood on it.
“<i>You shall give</i>” [43:19]. You should give the priests the Levites who are from the “<i>seed of Zadok</i>” who was a <i>High Priest</i> in the first <i>Temple.</i> These same children should offer me an ox as a sin offering in the latter Temple.
“<i>And you should take</i>” [43:20]. You should take the blood of the ox and sprinkle it on the four corners of the House to purify the House. Burn the ox outside the House.
“<i>On the second day</i>” [43:22]. On the second day, bring a goat as a sin offering.
“<i>When you have finished</i>” [43:23]. When you have finished purifying the House, bring an ox and a ram sacrifices to God. The priests should put salt on the sacrifice for God and salt must be put on each one, because the Holy One created heaven and earth. All the waters were above the heavens and did not want to descend to earth. They said that it is better that we are above in heaven, near the Holy One.

<b>[I Kings, 18:1–39]</b>
“<i>After many days the word of God came to Elijah in the third year</i>” [18:1]. It was in the third year of the famine and scarcity. God spoke to <i>Elijah:</i> go and present yourself, so that you will be seen by <i>King Ahab</i> and tell him that I will give rain so that the grain will grow, since some have repented out of great hunger. There are times when the Holy One must punish Israel in the hope that they will repent. Our sages said that <i>Ahasuerus</i> gave his signet from his hand to Haman that he should do to Israel as Haman wished, and Israel immediately repented. When the prophets punished Israel, they did not repent. Thus, the signet of Ahasuerus was better than all the prophets who punished Israel.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Megillah,</i> 14a.</i>
<i>Leviticus Rabbah</i> writes that when a person, heaven forbid, is in pain, he thinks that a few days are many days. That is why it is written here, “<i>after many days.</i>” That is to say, just as there was hunger for many days, and in truth it was not so many years, but in troubles, a short time feels like a long time because of the troubles.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Leviticus Rabbah,</i> 19.5.</i>
“<i>Elijah went to appear before</i>” [18:2]. Elijah went and wanted to present himself to <i>King Ahab</i> and the famine was very severe in <i>Samaria.</i>
“<i>Ahab summoned</i>” [18:3]. <i>King Ahab</i> summoned <i>Obadiah</i> who was in charge of his house. Obadiah feared God even when he was in the house of an evildoer. What good did he do? When <i>Jezebel</i>, the wife of <i>Ahab</i>, was killing all the righteous prophets, Obadiah hid fifty in a cave and another fifty in another cave and gave them food and drink. Obadiah risked his life with this. If <i>Jezebel</i> had known this, she would have killed him.
The Talmud writes in [tractate] <i>Sanhedrin</i>, <i>chapter four. Rabbi Isaac</i> said: Ahab said to Obadiah. Why was there no good fortune and blessing in his house when you are so pious? The house should have been blessed for your sake, and I, Ahab, never had good fortune in my house. Ahab said: Laban said to Jacob, who had served Laban: God had blessed his house because of Jacob. Also Joseph, who served an Egyptian, the Holy One blessed the house of the Egyptian because of Joseph. A <i>Heavenly Voice</i> immediately went forth and said: Obadiah is righteous, but the house of Ahab is not worthy of any blessing because Ahab is an evildoer. Rabbi Abba said: it is because Obadiah was better in his <i>righteousness and good deeds</i> than Abraham Our Father. Why did he hide fifty [prophets] in one cave when he could have hidden all one hundred in one cave? <i>Rabbi Eliezer</i> said: Obadiah learned from <i>Jacob Our Father</i>, who divided his household and children into groups. He thought that if Esau would come to attack one group, then the other one would run away. Obadiah did the same in dividing the prophets into two caves.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Sanhedrin,</i> 39b; <i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, I Kings, <i>Remez,</i> 210.</i>
“<i>And Ahab said</i>” [18:5]. Ahab said to Obadiah. Go to all the wells of water and all the springs in the land where there was water to see if you can find water and grass so that our horses and donkeys might remain alive.
“<i>They divided the land</i>” [18:6]. Ahab divided the land. That is to say, he went to search half the land himself and Obadiah went to the other half of the land to search for water and grass.
“<i>And Obadiah was on the way</i>” [18:7]. Obadiah was on the way when <i>Elijah the Prophet</i> met him. Obadiah bowed to him and asked him, are you Elijah? Elijah said to him, I am Elijah. Go and say to Ahab that Elijah is here. Obadiah was very frightened and he said: what sins have I committed that you hand me over to be killed by Ahab?
“<i>As the Lord your God lives</i>” [18:10]. Obadiah said and swore. There is no <i>kingdom</i> in the world that Ahab did not send to seek you. They made all of them swear that nobody had hidden you. Now, if I were to go and tell Ahab that Elijah is here and in the meantime you will flee anywhere else, and Ahab will not find you, then he will kill me. You Elijah have always been righteous, so how can you allow me to be killed? You know well that I have endangered my life and have hidden a hundred prophets in the caves and fed them.
The <i>Pirke de Rabbi Eliezer</i> and the <i>Yalkut</i> write concerning the haftorah. Ten kings ruled over the whole world. The first king was the Holy One who was king over heaven and earth. The second one on earth who was king over the world was <i>Nimrod.</i> The third one who was king was <i>Joseph.</i> The fourth one was <i>King Solomon.</i> The fifth was <i>Ahab</i>, as Scripture says here, “<i>there is no nation or kingdom</i>” [18:10]. The sixth king was <i>Nebuchadnezzar.</i> The seventh was <i>Cyrus.</i> The eighth was <i>Ahasuerus.</i> The ninth is the <i>King Messiah.</i> The tenth is again the Holy One. After the Messiah, the Holy One will again have dominion over the whole world, as Scripture says, “<i>and God will be king over the whole earth</i>” [Zechariah, 14:9].<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Pirke de Rabbi Eliezer</i>, chap. 11; <i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, I Kings, <i>Remez,</i> 211.</i>
The Talmud says in <i>tractate Nedarim.</i> Scripture says here, “<i>your servant has served the Lord</i>” [18:12]. It says that Obadiah boasted that he was righteous. How appropriate is it that a righteous person should praise himself? It is written, “<i>let the mouth of another praise you, not yours</i>” [Proverbs, 27:2]. That is to say, let a stranger praise you and not your own mouth. The explanation is that in the city where a person is known, he should not praise himself. However, in the city where he is not known, he can make himself known, hoping to protect himself from death. This is what Obadiah did. He said before Elijah that he had done acts of lovingkindness for the prophets, in the expectation that he would be saved from death. One asks a question. <i>Rabbi Tarfon was very anguished.</i> Someone wanted to throw him in the water because he had eaten fruit from a garden. The <i>owner</i> came and did not recognize that this was <i>Rabbi Tarfon.</i> He put him in a sack in order to throw him into a large body of water. <i>Rabbi Tarfon</i> shouted, woe to <i>Rabbi Tarfon</i> that someone is trying to kill you. The <i>owner</i> immediately let him go. <i>Rabbi Tarfon was very anguished</i> all of his days that he had benefited from the Torah in this world. He was protected from death because he had said that he was <i>Tarfon.</i> Here one can ask. Did Obadiah boast that he had done acts of lovingkindness for the prophets and did he intend to protect himself on account of the acts of lovingkindness? Also, why was Rabbi Tarfon so troubled? The answer is that Rabbi Tarfon was a communal leader. He did not need to say that he was Tarfon. He could have given a large sum of money to save himself from death and did not need to say that he was Rabbi Tarfon. That is why Rabbi Tarfon was very anguished.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Nedarim,</i> 62a; <i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, I Kings, <i>Remez,</i> 212.</i>
The Tanhuma and the Yalkut write about the haftorah. Our sages say that all of Ahab’s people served foreign gods, but they had great fortune and blessing, and won all their wars. This was because they had no informers in Israel. Nobody spoke slander against the king. When Elijah stood at the top of Mount <i>Carmel</i> and shouted, I, Elijah am here, he was left alone and nobody informed on him to King Ahab. However, in the days of <i>King David</i>, all of Israel worshipped God properly and the small children were full of Torah, but Israel was full of informers. They wanted to inform on David and there were many among them who wanted to tell evil things about David to <i>King Saul.</i> That is why they fell into the hands of strangers and the Torah did not help them.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, I Kings, <i>Remez,</i> 213; <i>Pesikta de Rav Kahana</i>, <i>Piska</i> 4; <i>Leviticus Rabbah,</i> 26.2.</i> Therefore, one should be careful to guard oneself from evil talk, since much evil comes from it.
“<i>And Elijah said, as the Lord lives</i>” [18:15]. Elijah said to Obadiah: do not be afraid, I will present myself to Ahab. Obadiah went and told Ahab and Ahab went to meet Elijah. Ahab said to Elijah, you troubler of Israel. Elijah responded: I have not troubled Israel, but you and your father’s household have troubled Israel. You have not observed the commandments and have worshipped foreign gods. Therefore, assemble all of Israel at Mount Carmel, and your <i>prophets of Baal</i>, four hundred and fifty men, false prophets, and a further four hundred men who are prophets of falsehood who worship the linden tree, all those who ate at the table of Jezebel. Gather them together and we will show who is right.

“<i>Hiram made the lavers</i>” [7:40]. Hiram made a hand laver and shovels and four hundred pomegranates and ten hand lavers and the basin placed on twelve oxen. All the utensils were poured in earthen forms dug out of copper. There were so many of them that they could not be weighed. Solomon made a table out of gold on which the <i>showbread</i> was placed. He made five candelabrums on the right side and five on the left side, out of pure gold.
The Midrash writes: Why did <i>Moses Our Teacher</i> only make one table in the Temple? The answer is that the Temple and Tabernacle in the desert where there was manna and there was no need to grow grain, since the <i>manna</i> was given from heaven. However, with Solomon, the Temple was in the land of Israel and they needed great quantities of grain. Therefore, there were many tables. Thus said Solomon: Because of the merit of the five on the right side, the Holy One should send dew and good rain. Through the merit of the five that stand on the left side, on the north side, they should stop the evil that used to come into the world. There were ten golden candelabrums for the <i>Ten Statements.</i> On each candelabrum seven lights burned, for the seventy nations. As long as the lights burned in the Temple, the nations had no power over Israel. However, when the lights were extinguished, the nations had power over Israel. Solomon first put the <i>showbread</i> on the table that Moses had made in the wilderness, since Solomon had Moses’ table. Also, when the lights were lit, the candelabrum of Moses was the first one that was lit. Then all the other candelabrums were lit. The twelve oxen on which the basin stood symbolized the twelve constellations that are in the heavens and rule the whole world.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, I Kings, <i>Remez,</i> 185.</i>

“<i>When all the work was completed</i>” [7:51]. When the work of the Temple was completed and King Solomon brought all the gold, silver and vessels of his father David into the <i>Temple.</i> He did not use it for the Temple, but he placed it all in the treasury. Some sages say that he placed it in the treasury because he did not want to use it. Solomon knew that the Temple would be destroyed and the nations would say that it was destroyed because David had taken much of the silver and gold through force and robbery and allowed the Temple to be built from it. Some other sages say that <i>King Solomon</i> said that there was a great famine in the days of David and he had much silver and gold and he did not feed the poor. That is why Solomon did not want to have that silver and gold. He would rather let poor people live from that silver and gold.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, I Kings, <i>Remez,</i> 186; <i>Pesikta Rabbati</i>, <i>Piska</i> 6.</i> From here we learn that it is a greater mitzvah to give charity to the poor and to feed them when they are hungry rather than to have sacred objects in the synagogue. There are many people who give beautiful metal or silver [objects] in the synagogue and they do not know that it is more important to feed <i>poor people.</i>
It is written in <i>Midrash Pesikta Rabbati.</i> Scripture says here, “<i>from his work</i>” [Genesis, 2:2]. All the labors were completed. This teaches us that God created the world, but the work of creation was not completed until the Temple was finished. Another explanation of this verse teaches us that there was great peace when the Temple was built. All the <i>artisans</i> who built the Temple were healthy and fresh. None of them had headaches and none of them died. No ax broke nor did any tool that they used to work on the <i>Temple. Rabbi Eliezer</i> says that this was nothing new. The Holy One allowed each one to live while working on the Temple for the sake of His glory. I want to show you that even for the sake of Jacob’s honor; those Egyptians who accompanied him to his burial in the <i>land of Israel</i>, there were thousands of them, and nobody became sick, much less died.

“<i>Then Solomon assembled</i>” [8:1]. Solomon assembled the elders and the leaders to bring up the <i>Holy Ark</i> from the City of David. The <i>Seder Olam</i> writes that the Shekhinah only rests in the midst of a community, or where there is a synagogue.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Seder Olam Rabbah</i>, chap. 16.</i> Therefore, everyone should be warned to go to pray with a minyan.

“<i>In the month of Ethanim</i>” [8:2]. <i>King Solomon</i> assembled <i>Israel</i> in the month of <i>Tishrei.</i> It is called <i>Ethanim</i> because it is heavy with much grain. Another explanation of why it is called <i>Ethanim</i> is that the Patriarchs were born in Tishrei.

“<i>And King Solomon</i>” [8:5]. King Solomon and all of Israel brought so many sacrifices that they could not be counted.
“<i>And the priests brought</i>” [8:6]. And the priests brought the Ark into the innermost place in the <i>Temple</i>, under the wings of the birds that Solomon had made. Solomon made great birds from the ground until they reached over the Ark.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, I Kings, 8:6.</i>
“<i>The poles were so long</i>” [8:8]. The poles of the Ark with which the Ark was carried were very long and they always remained with the Ark.

“<i>There was nothing in the Ark</i>” [8:9]. There were only the two Tablets that Moses had received on Mount Sinai, when Israel left Egypt.
“<i>When the priests went out</i>” [8:10]. When the priests went out of the Temple, the cloud was full of smoke and the priests could not stand in the Temple because of the great amount of smoke.
“<i>Then Solomon said</i>” [8:12]. When Solomon saw in the Temple, he said that the Holy One has kept His word when He promised to let His Shekhinah rest in the Temple. Now, with the cloud, it was shown that the Shekhinah was resting in the Temple.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, I Kings, 8:12.</i>
“<i>I have built</i>” [8:13]. Solomon said: I have built a house for God to rest in, to sit in forever, unlike the other houses that the Holy One had, which were not eternal.
“<i>And the king turned</i>” [8:14]. King Solomon tuned around and blessed all of Israel while all of Israel stood.
“<i>He said, blessed</i>” [8:15]. He blessed and praised God. Praised be God who kept His word that he promised my father David.
“<i>From the day</i>” [8:16]. God said: from the day that I took Israel from Egypt, I have not chosen a city from all the tribes of Israel to build My house that My name should be on it. However, I have chosen David to be a king over Israel.
“<i>He had in mind</i>” [8:17]. Solomon said: my father David had the idea in his heart to build a house for the Holy One. God said to David: you did properly to have in your heart to build the Temple. However, I do not want to have you build the Temple, but your son Solomon should build the Temple. Now the Holy One has kept his word and I, Solomon the son of David, have sat on the throne of Israel and have built the house for the God of Israel.
“<i>And I placed there</i>” [8:21]. I have made a dwelling for the Ark in the Temple, to place there the Tablets of God. God made a covenant with Israel to take Israel out of Egypt.

<b>[Isaiah, 43:21–44:23]</b>
“<i>The people I formed for Myself</i>” [43:21]. The Holy One said: I have created a people to be My people, for Me alone. They should recount My <i>miracles and wonders</i> that I have shown them in taking them out of exile. Now the Holy One will punish them and says to them: I know very well that you do evil things. Your children who will come after you will not be worthy to be shown these miracles, but I must show miracles to redeem them from exile, for My sake.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Isaiah, 43:21.</i>
“<i>You did not call upon Me, O Jacob</i>” [43:22]. The Holy One said: Israel, you worship foreign gods and you do not call on Me. Jacob, you soon tire of serving Me. The Talmud writes in [tractate] <i>Yoma</i> concerning this verse. <i>Rabbi Eliezer the son of Hisma</i> said: whoever recites <i>God, King</i> and similar important prayers and winks with his eyes or twists his mouth or indicates with his finger to do something, because he does not want to speak, and he indicates with his eyes or his hand to do it, the Holy One says: you do not call Me.

Lamentations Rabbah</i> writes. The Holy One said: the Israelites who worship foreign gods should <i>at least</i> also worship Me along with the foreign gods, but they have forgotten Me and do not call on Me. The Holy One said: should they consider me a secondary food that one serves only at the end of the <i>meal?</i> It is a parable. A minister of the king makes a big meal and invites all the ministers to the meal and he leaves out the king and does not invite him to the meal. The king says: he should at least consider me as important as the other ministers and invited me to the meal. The Holy One said the same.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Lamentations Rabbah</i>, <i>Petikhtah</i> 10; <i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Isaiah, <i>Remez</i>, 457.</i>
“<i>You have not brought Me</i>” [43:23]. The Holy One said to Israel: you have not brought me sheep for burnt offerings and have not honored Me with meal offerings, or with your weariness of the incense.
“<i>You have not bought Me</i>” [43:24]. You have not bought Me ingredients for the incense had to be purchased from distant lands with silver. The Holy One said: I did not desire too much from Israel, to exhaust them; only a little flour for a meal offering, whatever offering his heart desired to give. Some sages say that there were plenty of spices in the <i>land of Israel</i>, yet the Israelites did not bring offerings of incense.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Isaiah, <i>Remez</i>, 457.</i> The Holy One said: you have made me tired with your sins.
“<i>I am He</i>” [43:25]. The Holy One said: I forgave your ancestors their transgressions that they committed in the wilderness, for My sake. I will also forgive your transgressions and not remember them, for if I were to destroy you from the world because of your sins, so that My holy name should not be desecrated.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Isaiah, 43:25.</i>
“<i>Help me remember</i>” [43:26]. The Holy One said: let us discuss our <i>accounts</i>, the good that I have done for you and the transgressions that you have committed. Let us have a judgment. It is customary that whoever comes to the <i>judge</i> or to the court first is always right. Therefore, the Holy One also said to Israel: you tell your <i>complaints first to the judge</i>, before I will speak. Yet, you will not be right, against Me. The same <i>judge</i> will agree with Me about the good that I have done for you.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Isaiah, 43:26.</i>
“<i>Your first ancestor sinned</i>” [43:27]. Your first ancestor, that is <i>Adam</i>, committed sins. Every person who is descended from Adam was created with the evil inclination, which causes each person to sin. How can you say that you have not sinned? The leaders and the rabbis, who should have punished you, themselves committed sins.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Isaiah, 43:27.</i>
“<i>And I profaned the princes</i>” [43:28]. I have profaned the princes who should have punished Israel, and Israel committed many sins. When some were pious, they were also lost among the nations because of their great sins, which were numerous.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Isaiah, 43:28.</i>
“<i>Now hear, O Jacob</i>” [44:1]. The Holy One said: you should not be despondent Israel, whom I have chosen to serve Me. Though I have profaned the princes, I love them. God said: I am your creator. I want to help you since I have made you holy when you emerged from the womb. As soon as a son is born, he will be circumcised when he is eight days old. From here we should learn that the commandment of circumcision is comparable to the sacrifices, since He punished them so that they brought no sacrifices. He says, because you have a commandment that is better than sacrifices, which is circumcision.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Isaiah, <i>Remez</i>, 459.</i>
“<i>For I will pour water</i>” [44:3]. The Holy One said: jut like I pour water, through rain, on a field and make it grow, so will I pour My spirit on your children. They will quickly grow like the grass and like a willow by the flowing waters.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Isaiah, 44:3.</i>
“<i>This one will say, I am the Lord</i>” [44:5]. The remnant of Israel will all be holy. Each one will say, I want to accept God, and they will all call on the name of God.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Isaiah, 44:5.</i>
“<i>Thus says the Lord</i>” [44:6]. Thus says God, the king of Israel and his redeemer. The Lord of hosts, said: I am the first and the last, I alone am God and there is no other God.
“<i>Who is like me?</i>” [44:7]. The Holy One said: where is there a God like me, who knows what happened and what will happen? I remember everything from the creation of the world. I created the whole world; I can say more than all the gods of the world.
“<i>Do not fear</i>” [44:8]. You Israel should not be afraid of the idols. They cannot do you any good or any evil. I told you long ago on Mount Sinai that you should not turn to the idols. I opened my seven heavens for you on Mount Sinai and showed you that I alone am God and there is no other creator.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Isaiah, 44:8.</i>
“<i>Creators of idols</i>” [44:9]. Come here Israel and see that the artisans who make the idols are all desolate and lost, and their treasured idols cannot help them. If you would say, who tells us that the idols are nothing? They themselves will testify that they are nothing since they cannot see or hear, much less speak. How then can they help? They do not hear and do not see the one who call on them. Therefore, shame them and leave them. Who is so foolish and <i>crazy</i> to spend silver to make an idol? The foolishness includes all those who bow to it. Many <i>artisans</i> make themselves foolish and embarrass themselves by making an idol.
First a smith must make a knife or an ax or a saw to make a <i>wooden idol</i> and the like. One must have coal for the smith to make a fire to work the iron and they must work with great <i>force</i> and injures himself because of it. He goes hungry because he does not eat because he desires to finish his <i>idols.</i> When he gets thirsty and wants to drink, yet he restrains himself and continues working. This is a great foolishness that he should exert himself so much for nothing, since they cannot help. The carpenter takes a long cord to measure how long he will make the idol, and takes a compass to make it even and takes a plane to make it smooth, so that the person should not hurt or injure his hand, if it would not be smooth. He paints the <i>form</i> of a handsome man or a beautiful woman, which is found in the world. He goes into the woods and selects a strong tree that should not split and should not be worm eaten. Some people plant a tree themselves and make an idol out of it. He selects wood from strong trees that grow from rainwater. When the rain comes from the Holy One and causes them to grow, what should the Holy One do? It would be correct that the Holy One should cause that tree not to grow because it becomes an idol. However, the Holy One allows the rain to fall that everything should grow. Sometimes, the person takes some of the same tree out of which he made an idol and heats the oven to warm himself and bakes bread to eat. From the rest of it he makes himself a god to bow down to.
“<i>Half of it he burns in a fire</i>” [44:16]. The person derives two benefits from the same tree. With half of it he roasts his meat and bakes his bread. With the other half of the wood he heats his oven to warm his body thereby and he rejoices in it. With what remains from the tree he makes a god to which he bows down and prays to it and says to it, protect me. That is why the Torah forbade the stones of the altar to be broken. This was so that pieces of the stone should not fall off and it might be put in the dirt on the street and the other half would be on the altar. That is why they had to take whole stones for the altar.
“<i>They did not know and did not comprehend</i>” [44:18]. They do not know enough to understand the idol. The eyes of the people are blind and their hearts stopped up to understanding. They should correctly say that with half of the wood I heated my oven, with half I roasted my meat and baked my bread, so how could I worship and pray to this.
“<i>Remember these things, O Jacob</i>” [44:21]. The Holy One says. When the nations do not understand what they are doing, but you, Jacob, be clever and understand the matter very well, that they are fools. You will be My servant, to serve Me. I have created you as a servant to Me and therefore do not forget Me.
“<i>I wipe away your sins</i>” [44:22]. The Holy One says. I erase your sins, like a cloud that passes with the rain, only return to Me and repent.
“<i>Sing, O heavens</i>” [44:23]. The heavens will sing when God will redeem Israel from the exile in the days of the Messiah. The earth will sing and praise God that the Holy One was very helpful in redeeming them and also the mountains will rejoice and the forest with its trees will sing that God has redeemed Jacob. The Holy One will receive honor from Israel and from the nations who will say that the Holy One performed miracles for Israel. Amen.

<b>[Jeremiah, 7:21–8:3]</b>
“<i>Thus says the Lord of Hosts</i>” [7:21]. Thus said God: the <i>sacrifices</i> that you offer, and your <i>burnt offerings</i>, add them to your other sacrifices. I did not command your ancestors when they left Egypt to offer sacrifices, but that you should hear and keep my words. I want to be your God and you should be My people. Go in my path and it will be well for you.
“<i>They did not listen</i>” [7:24]. However, you Israel did not obey Me and you went after your evil hearts and your own advice. They have gone backwards and for themselves. From the day that you and your ancestors left Egypt, I have sent you prophets to punish you daily. You did not turn to them and closed your eyes. You turned your backs and committed many more transgressions than your ancestors.
“<i>Say to them</i>” [7:28]. You prophet, say all this to Israel, that they have committed transgressions and I know well that they will not listen to you. You will call them and they will not listen. They will not respond to you properly, says the Holy One. I will do mine and will let them know that they should not commit the sins. Say to Israel, because you did not hear the word of God, your truth is lost and it has been cut off from your mouths. That is to say, they speak falsehoods with their mouths; even more so, they speak no truth with their hearts.
“<i>Cut your hair</i>” [7:29]. Tear out the hair of your head out of troubles and begin to mourn and recite <i>lamentations</i>, because you have shamed God. God has also shamed you and the Holy One has left this <i>generation.</i> He has poured out His wrath on this <i>generation</i>, because the children of Judah have done evil in the eyes of God. They have made My house impure.
“<i>They have built the high places of Topheth</i>” [7:31]. They have built a building in which they had a foreign god called Moloch. The father brought his child and gave it to the priest to be burned in the fire. They had drums and they drummed and all the priests made a loud noise so that the father should not hear the screams of the child. He might have <i>mercy</i> on the child if he would hear the screams of his child.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Jeremiah, <i>Remez</i>, 277.</i>
“<i>It did not come into my mind</i>” [7:31]. That is to say, I did not command that children should be slaughtered or killed. When I commanded Abraham to slaughter his son, it was not in my mind that he should be slaughtered. Rather, I wanted to make the righteousness of Abraham and Isaac public.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Jeremiah, 7:31.</i>
“<i>Therefore, days are coming, declares the Lord</i>” [7:32]. Therefore, tell Israel that the days will come that they will no longer say that this place used to be called <i>the Topheth and the valley of the son of Hinnom.</i> That is to say, where they drummed and boasted. Rather, it will be called a place of <i>slaughter</i>, where the evil Israelites will be killed. Their bodies will be food for the birds and the wild animals of the earth.
“<i>None to frighten</i>” [7:33]. There will be nobody to frighten away the birds and the animals.
“<i>And I will silence the cities of Judah, etc.</i>” [7:34]. I, God, will destroy all the cities of Israel so that the sound of joy and happiness, the <i>sound of bride and groom</i> will not be heard.
“<i>At that time, says the Lord</i>” [8:1]. At the same time, God said: I will cause that the bones of the dead will be taken out of their graves, the bones of princes, priests and prophets. The bones will be spread out before the sun and moon, to which they bowed down. Now they will be embarrassed and will never be buried. Their bones will be like dung on the fields.
“<i>Death shall be preferred to life</i>” [8:3]. When the people will see the disgrace, they will drag themselves over the fields and bury the dead. Those remaining alive will have great troubles and will plead with God that they should die. Thus will Israel ask when they will be driven away in all the lands. So says God.
“<i>Thus says the Lord, let not the wise man glory in his wisdom</i>” [9:22]. God said: no person should boast, even when he is very rich or wise. When the Holy One does not want to help, then his wisdom is nothing. Similarly, if he is a hero, he should not boast of his heroism. Similarly, when he is rich, he should not boast of his wealth, but he should rely on the Holy One.
“<i>In his devotion to Me</i>” [9:23]. He should know that I am God who acts with lovingkindness, equity and justice, for everything that is on the earth.
“<i>For in these I delight, says the Lord</i>” [9:23]. That is to say, these three that thought that they had wisdom, heroism and wealth, these I, God, desire, since I command who will be wise, and whose wisdom will help and similarly, when a hero should protect himself. Similarly, when someone will be rich. This, I command, as the verse says, “<i>the silver and gold are mine, says the Lord of Hosts</i>” [Haggai, 2:8].

<b>[II Samuel, 6:1–7:17]</b>
“<i>David again assembled all the picked men of Israel, thirty thousand</i>” [6:1]. Many people of Israel assembled and they made David king in the city of <i>Hebron.</i> Now, when David wanted to move the Ark from the house of <i>Avinadav</i> to God’s house, he assembled thirty thousand <i>young men.</i>
“<i>And they loaded the Ark of God</i>” [6:3]. They placed God’s Ark on a new wagon and they carried it from the house of Avinadav, from the city of <i>Gibah.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">He misunderstood the word.

“<i>David and all the House of Israel, etc.</i>” [6:5]. David and all of Israel sang with <i>musical instruments</i>, with harps, violins, drums and revels. When they came to the threshing floor of <i>Navon</i>, the Holy One caused the limbs of the oxen to fail, since it was not proper that oxen should carry the Holy Ark. The priests should have carried the <i>Holy Ark</i> on their shoulders.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, II Samuel, <i>Remez</i>, 142.</i> Therefore, the Holy One caused the oxen to break their feet and their limbs. When <i>Uzzah</i>, who was walking near the Ark saw that the oxen were falling down, he thought that they would fall on him with the Ark and Uzzah put his hand on the Ark to hold it, so that it should not fall.
“<i>The Lord was angry at Uzzah, etc.</i>” [6:7]. The Holy One killed <i>Uzzah</i> because he thought that the Ark would fall. He should have thought that the Ark was very holy and it would not fall, even if the oxen would fall. The Holy One said that the Ark carried the people who carried it. In any event, it would carry itself and would not fall. He punished Uzzah there, near the Ark.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, II Samuel, 6:7.</i>
“<i>David was angry about what had burst forth, etc.</i>” [6:8]. David was very saddened that Uzzah had been killed and their joy was disturbed. David was very afraid of God and said: how shall I bring the Ark to me, and he did not want to bring the Ark into his city, <i>Zion.</i> David left the Ark in the house of <i>Obed-Edom</i> the <i>Gittite.</i> The Ark sat in the house of Obed for three months and the Holy One blessed the house of <i>Obed</i> greatly.
“<i>It was told to the king</i>” [6:12]. It was told to <i>King David</i> that the house of Obed had been blessed because of the <i>Holy Ark.</i> David went and wanted to bring the Holy Ark into the city of David from the house of Obed with joy.
“<i>When the bearers of the Lord</i>” [6:13]. <i>King David</i> reasoned that Uzzah had walked only six steps and was killed. That is why David thought that when they would go another six steps he would bring sacrifices. This is what David did. As soon as they walked six steps with the Ark, David stood still with the Ark and put it down on the road and brought sacrifices. They rejoiced that nothing happened in the six steps. David did this the whole way. He brought sacrifices every six steps.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, II Samuel, <i>Remez</i>, 142.</i>
“<i>David danced with all his might</i>” [6:14]. David jumped and danced with all his might before the Ark. He put on the <i>ephod</i>, which was a beautiful garment in which they used to dress the priest. One asks a question. David was not a priest, so why did he put on the garment of the priest? The answer is that the ephod was made for the priest as an ornament and for his honor. Therefore, David was also allowed to wear the ephod for the honor of the Holy One. David and all of Israel went up, bringing God’s Ark with trumpets and ram’s horns.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, II Samuel, 6:14.</i>
“<i>As the Ark of the Lord came, etc.</i>” [6:17]. When they brought the Ark into the city of David, <i>Michal</i>, the daughter of <i>Saul</i>, who was the wife of David, saw through the window that David was jumping before God. Michal resented it. She thought that it was disgraceful that a king should jump around before all the people in the street. They brought the Ark and placed it in the tent and they brought sacrifices. David blessed the people in the name of God.
“<i>And he distributed to all the people</i>” [6:19]. And David distributed to all the people, to each man and woman, a baked cake and a piece of meat and a beaker of wine. Some sages say that “<i>eshpar</i>” [6:19] means, divided into six pieces. He divided an ox and gave each one a portion of six pieces.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, II Samuel, <i>Remez</i>, 142.</i>
“<i>How the king humbled himself today</i>” [6:20]. Michal, his wife, went toward him and said to David. Why is this day more honored than other days, that you so disgraced yourself before the maidens and maidservants, your servants? How much more so, it is disgraceful for your legitimate wives that you humble yourself, like a wretch.
“<i>David said to Michal</i>” [6:21]. David said to Michal. I jump for the Holy One who made me a ruler over Israel instead of your father <i>Saul.</i> I want to play much more than I have done until now and let me be humble. I do it for the sake of God.
“<i>Michal, the daughter of Saul had no children</i>” [6:23]. Michal did not have any children, but she would die if she had a child. There are three women who died in childbirth. The first was <i>Rachel</i>, the wife of <i>Jacob.</i> The second was the daughter-in-law of <i>Eli the priest.</i> The third was Michal, as is written about all three.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Sanhedrin,</i> 21a.</i>
“<i>When the king settled in his house</i>” [7:1]. When King David sat in his house at peace with all of his enemies, he said to Nathan the prophet. I sit in a house of fir wood and the Holy Ark sits in a tent. Nathan the prophet answered him. Do what you want; God is with you. That night, God came to Nathan the prophet and said to him. Go and say to David. Thus has God said: you want to build a house for me? Our sages learn from this that a prophet does not know everything in his prophecy. Here, Nathan the prophet had thought that David should build a house for God and the Holy One had intended that he should not build. It is similar with <i>Samuel the prophet.</i> He was a great prophet and he was supposed to make a son of <i>Jesse</i> the king. Samuel did not know which one he should anoint. Our sages say, and why did the Holy One come to Nathan the prophet during the night? The answer is that the Holy One thought that David was very quick to making vows and oaths. Perhaps David would make a vow that he wanted to build a house. The Holy One came to Nathan the prophet quickly before David could make a vow. Some sages say that the prophecy came to Nathan the prophet in a dream.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, II Samuel, <i>Remez</i>, 143.</i>
“<i>I have not dwelt in a house</i>” [7:6]. God said: I have not dwelt in a house since I brought Israel out of Egypt. I have moved in a tent and in the Tabernacle.
“<i>Now, say thus to My servant David</i>” [7:8]. Now say to David My servant. I took you from a barn in which there were sheep and made you a ruler over Israel. I want to be with you wherever you will go and will make a <i>name</i> for you in the land. I will make a city in Israel where I will dwell and My Shekhinah will be among them.
“<i>Will tremble no more</i>” [7:10]. They will no longer be driven into exile, with anger. The wretches will not torment you, as previously.
“<i>From the time that I appointed judges</i>” [7:11]. From the day that I appointed My judges over Israel, the nations used to torment Israel. However, they will have rest and I will build you a house in which you will place your son on the throne. Your days will be seventy years. He was thirty years old when he became king and he was king over Israel for forty years. I will give you a son and will make him a king and this son will build a house for Me.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, II Samuel, 7:11.</i>
“<i>When he does wrong, I will chastise him with the rod of men</i>” [7:14]. The Holy One said: I will be a father to your son and he will be like a son to Me. If he will commit sins, I will punish him like a father punishes his son, who hits him with the rod. I will do the same to him and I will not remove my lovingkindness from him. When I removed it from Saul, I removed him from the world for you. Our sages say that the verse “<i>the affliction of mortals</i>” [7:14] means that the Holy One will punish Solomon with the chastisement that <i>Ashmodai</i> will throw Solomon far from his kingdom into distant lands.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Gittin,</i> 68a-b.</i>
“<i>Your house is secure</i>” [7:16]. Your house and your kingdom will be secure forever. Everything you see today, so will it remain. All of these words were prophecies said by Nathan the prophet to David.
We will write midrashim about the <i>haftorah.</i> The <i>Jerusalem Talmud, Sanhedrin, chapter 10,</i> writes. David counted ninety thousand elders in one day and he left out <i>Ahitophel</i> and did not count him among the elders. When the Holy Ark was on the way with the oxen, the Ark lifted the priests into the air and threw them down again. <i>David sent for Ahitophel</i>, who was a great sage, and said to him: tell me what to do so that the priests should not suffer these <i>troubles. Ahitophel</i> answered, send for the ninety thousand elders. They will tell you. David said that whoever knows what it means that the priests are being punished and does not want to tell should choke to death. <i>Ahitophel</i> answered. You do not know what the children learn from their <i>teacher</i> in <i>school.</i> It is written, “<i>But to the children of Kohath did not give, etc.</i>” [Numbers, 7:9]. That is to say, the Levites should carry the Holy Ark on their shoulders and not in wagons with oxen. That is why the Holy Ark is throwing the priests.
Similarly, King David wanted to dig the foundation of the <i>Temple.</i> David dug down fifteen hundred cubits and did not find the <i>abyss</i> that is the foundation of the earth. Later, David found a large thick wooden plug lying deep in the ground. David wanted to take that plug away, out of the earth. The plug, that is to say, the wood began to speak to David. Leave me alone, you can’t do anything to me. David said to it: why? The thick wood answered: I have been placed here. I sit on the abyss, that is to say, the foundation of the earth. David said to the wood. How long have you been here? The wood responded, when “<i>I am the Lord your God</i>” [Exodus, 20:2] was said on Mount Sinai, the whole earth trembled and wanted to sink into the abyss. I was put there over the abyss so that the abyss should not drown the world. David did not want to listen and pulled the plug out of the earth. The abyss soon rose up and wanted to drown the whole world. <i>Ahitophel</i> was standing nearby and thought to himself, let David die now in the water and I will become king. David said: whoever is smart and understands this and remains silent should choke to death. <i>Ahitophel</i> immediately recited <i>sacred names</i> and the water ceased to flow. David went out of the foundation of the earth and recited the <i>fifteen</i> “<i>Songs of Ascents.</i>”<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">The opening words of Psalms, 120 to 134.</i> Ahitophel hung himself and choked to death.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">J. <i>Sanhedrin,</i> 10.2.</i> From here we learn that the curse of a sage is always fulfilled, even as it happened for someone like Ahitophel.
The Talmud writes in [tractate] <i>Berakhot</i>, <i>chapter nine. Rabbi Eliezer the son of Rabbi Yose the Gallilean</i> said that the Holy One gives a great reward to the person who honors a scholar in his house with food and drink. We can learn this from the <i>Holy Ark</i> that stood in the house of <i>Obed</i> and the Holy One blessed the house because of it, even though he did not feed the Ark. How much more so when a person honors a scholar with food and drink.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Berakhot,</i> 63b.</i>
The <i>Jerusalem Talmud</i> writes in [tractate] <i>Yevamot, chapter four.</i> What was the blessing that <i>Obed</i> was blessed with through the Ark. He had eight daughters-in-law for eight sons. Each one gave birth to two children every month. She was <i>ritually impure</i> for seven days and <i>ritually pure</i> for seven days. She had a child after fourteen days and again, fourteen days later she had another child. In this way, each one gave birth to two children every month. There were eight women and every month they had sixteen children. The Ark stood in the house of <i>Obed</i> for three months. In three months they had forty-eight children. Three times sixteen is forty-eight and their mother-in-law also had six children in three months. This is fifty-four. In addition, there were eight daughters-in-law. Thus, there were sixty-two <i>souls</i> in <i>Obed</i>’<i>s</i> household.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">J. <i>Yevamot,</i> 4.12.</i>
The <i>Yalkut</i> writes concerning the verse “<i>You will not build a house for My name, for you are a man of battles and have shed blood</i>” [I Chronicles, 28:3]. When David heard from the Holy One that he should not build the Temple because he had killed many gentiles and shed much blood, David was very frightened. The Holy One said, do not be afraid. The <i>gentiles</i> are considered by Me as if you had brought sacrifices. David said: why should I not build the Temple? The Holy One said: if you would build the Temple, then it would remain standing forever and would not be destroyed. David responded: let it remain standing forever. The Holy One responded: I know very well that Israel will commit sins and I will destroy the house. Israel is protected in that I will not destroy them completely. That is to say, the Temple is an expiation for Israel. They will see the great destruction and they will be very troubled, as if they themselves would be destroyed. The Holy One said to David: because you wanted to build the Temple, I will consider it as if you built it yourself and I will call the Temple after your name, as the verse says, “<i>A song for the dedication of the House of David</i>” [Psalms, 30:1].<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, II Samuel, <i>Remez,</i> 145.</i>

Tazria

<b>[II Kings, 4:42–5:19]</b>
“<i>A man came from Baal-shalishah</i>” [4:42]. A man came from a city called <i>Baalshalishah</i> and he brought the prophet bread from the first growth of barley that is harvested first in the field; barley that was harvested that time. The prophet was Elisha. He said to his servant, give it to the people and let them eat. The servant said: what is this to feed a hundred men? The prophet answered: God has said that it will be enough and they will leave some. He gave them; they ate and left some behind, as God had said. The hundred men were the disciples of the prophet and he used to feed them.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, II Kings, 4:42.</i>
The <i>Yalkut</i> writes. Was Elisha a priest that he was given the offering of the <i>first fruits</i> [<i>bikkurim</i>]? The explanation is that it teaches us that whoever gives a present to a scholar; it is like he would have given <i>bikkurim</i> to the priest. That is why the present that the man brought to Elisha was called <i>bikkurim.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, II Kings, <i>Remez,</i> 229.</i>
One asks another question. Why does Scripture compare the present to <i>bikkurim</i> and did not call it <i>terumah</i> or <i>ma</i>’<i>aser?</i> The reason is that the verse teaches us that the rabbi or scholar should take as good whatever is given to him. That is why it says <i>bikkurim</i>, which the person is allowed to bring the priest whatever he wanted. There was no specific amount involved. However, ma’aser must be a tenth and the terumah must also be a specific amount.
“<i>Naaman, commander of the army of the king of Aram</i>” [5:1]. A commander named <i>Naaman</i>, who was a commander for the <i>king of Aram</i>, became a leper. The people of the king of Aram waged war and they captured a young girl from Israel and she served <i>Naaman</i>’<i>s</i> wife. The Judean young girl said to her mistress. Let the lord <i>Naaman</i> go to the prophet Elisha in Samaria, and the prophet will heal his disease. <i>Naaman</i> went to the king of Aram and told him what the young girl from Israel advised him in order to be healed. The king responded: go to the prophet and I will give you positive letters to the king of Israel. He went and took with him ten talents of silver. He also took with him six thousand gulden and ten sets of clothing. When the king of Israel read the letter that the king of Aram had written, that they should heal <i>Naaman</i>, the king of Israel became frightened. He tore his clothes and skin, that is, he tore keriah. He said that he is looking for false accusations against Israel. Am I God that he is writing me that I should heal <i>Naaman</i> of his leprosy?
“<i>When Elisha, the man of God, heard</i>” [5:8]. When the prophet Elisha heard that the king had torn his garments, the prophet sent a message to the king of Israel. Why have you torn your clothes? Let <i>Naaman</i> come to me and let him know that there is a prophet in Israel.
“<i>And Naaman came</i>” [5:9]. <i>Naaman</i> came and stood before the door of Elisha with his horses and chariot.
“<i>Elisha sent him a message</i>” [5:10]. <i>Elisha</i> sent <i>Naaman</i> a message. Tell him that he should wash seven times and immerse himself in the river <i>Jordan</i> and he will be healed. <i>Naaman</i> was angry and said: I thought that the prophet would pray to God for me that I should be healed. There is much better water in the rivers of our land than in the land of Israel. Could I not wash in them and be healed? He went away angry. His servant went to <i>Naaman</i> and said: my lord, the prophet did not give you something difficult for a cure. That is, why do you care about it? Bathing is a small thing.
“<i>He went down and immersed himself seven times</i>” [5:14]. <i>Naaman</i> immersed himself seven times and he was healed. His skin was as smooth as that of a young child. <i>Naaman</i> came with all of his people to Elisha and said: I know very well that there is no God in the whole world except in Israel. Now take a present from me.
“<i>He said: as the Lord lives whom I serve</i>” [5:16]. Elisha swore a great oath that he did not want to take anything. <i>Naaman</i> pleaded with him to take it, but Elisha refused.
“<i>Naaman said: at least let your servant be given two mule loads of earth</i>” [5:17]. He asked that Elisha should allow him to take earth from the land of Israel that two mules could carry, to build an altar in his land. He said that he did not want to sacrifice to the idols, but only to the Holy One. Here one asks a question. Who was concerned that Naaman should not take the earth? Why did he have to ask if he could take it? The explanation is that <i>Naaman</i> did not want to steal earth from the <i>land of Israel.</i> He wanted permission from the king of Israel and from the prophet.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, II Kings, 5:17.</i>
“<i>May the Lord pardon your servant from this</i>” [5:18]. <i>Naaman</i> said: I want to be a proper convert and not worship foreign gods, but I must go with the king of Aram into the house of the idols. His hand is laid on my hand and when he bows down the foreign god, then I must also bow down with the king. My thought is not to bow down to the foreign god. Therefore, I now ask the Holy One to forgive me for this sin. Elisha said: go <i>in peace</i> and he went home.
We want to write some <i>midrashim</i> concerning this haftorah. The <i>Tanhuma</i> writes. What kind of sin did <i>Naaman</i> commit that he became a leper. The explanation is that he had captured an Israelite young girl. The Holy One will punish similar things with leprosy when the Messiah will come.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanhuma</i>, <i>Tazria</i> 11; <i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, II Kings, <i>Remez,</i> 229.</i>
The Talmud writes in [tractate] Sanhedrin. Naaman wanted to be a proper convert. Why did he not <i>sanctify the name</i> of God? He should have warned him to have himself to be killed rather than going into the house of foreign gods to bow down with his lord. The Talmud gives an explanation. When the <i>nations of the world</i> will convert, they will not have to <i>sanctify the name</i> of God. It is enough that they have converted and have the Holy One in their heart. Therefore, Elisha did not forbid <i>Naaman</i> when he said, God should forgive me the sin that I must bow down to the foreign god with my master. Elisha responded, go <i>in peace.</i> Should a gentile have to sanctify the Name of God, he would have forbidden him and said to <i>Naaman</i> not to bow down to the foreign god. However, a Jew does sanctify the name of God.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Sanhedrin,</i> 74a; <i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, II Kings, <i>Remez,</i> 229.</i>

Metzora

<b>[II Kings, 7:3–20]</b>
“<i>There were four men, lepers outside the gate</i>” [7:3]. Four men, who were lepers, were outside the city of <i>Samaria.</i> These men were <i>Gehazi</i> and his three sons and they were lepers.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, II Kings, <i>Remez,</i> 231.</i> This <i>incident</i> happened when <i>Gehazi</i> was the servant of <i>Elisha.</i> Elisha did not want to take anything from Naaman, who had been a leper and had been healed by Elisha, as written above in the <i>haftorah</i> for <i>Tazria. Gehazi</i> saw that <i>Naaman</i> had taken everything away and Elisha did not want to take anything from Naaman. <i>Gehazi</i> went and ran after <i>Naaman</i> and said to him. My master <i>Elisha</i> sent me to you. Two young men from the <i>prophets</i> came to my master <i>Elisha.</i> Therefore, he has asked you that you should send him a talent of silver and two sets of garments, to give to the two young men. <i>Naaman</i> responded: please take two talents of silver and two garments. <i>Gehazi</i> let himself be convinced and took them. He went home, hid everything, and presented himself to <i>Elisha. Elisha</i> asked <i>Gehazi:</i> where have you been? He responded: I haven’t been anywhere. Elisha said: I know very well what you have done. You have taken silver and clothes from <i>Naaman.</i> Therefore, you and your children will be afflicted with the leprosy that afflicted <i>Naaman.</i> Gehazi and his children immediately became lepers and at near the city of <i>Samaria.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">II Kings, 5:20–27.</i> They said to one another. Why should we sit here and die? If we will go into the city, there is great hunger there and they will also die. Therefore, the best advice is that we will go among the people of <i>Aram</i>, who had besieged the city of <i>Samaria.</i> Perhaps they will let us live. If not, they can do with us what they want. We will certainly die of hunger.
“<i>They set out at twilight for the Aramean camp</i>” [7:5]. The four men arose in the evening to go to the gate of Aram and they came to the tents of Aram and there was nobody in the tents.
“<i>The Lord had caused the Aramean camp to hear</i>” [7:6]. The Holy One caused the people to hear the sound of a great multitude of Israel coming against Aram, as if chariots and the sounds of horses and a great din were coming. The <i>Arameans</i> said to each other, the Israelites have hired many people from the nations against us. They all ran away and left their tents standing and their horses and donkeys. The four lepers went into one tent after another, ate and drank, and took silver, gold, and clothes and hid everything. They did this to two tents and then they considered and the four lepers said to one another. We are not doing the right thing that we remain silent and we do not tell the good news to Israel in the city. We will commit a sin. They came to the city and called to the guards and said to them. We came to the tents of Aram and there was nobody in their tents, but the horses and also the donkeys were tethered. The tents are standing without any people.
“<i>The gatekeepers called out</i>” [7:11]. The gatekeepers called to the king and told him the news. The king got up at night and told his ministers, come here and see what the people of Aram have prepared. They know very well that we are hungry. Therefore, they have left their tents as if they had run away and they have hidden themselves in the fields. When we will go out and go into their tents, they will capture us alive and capture the city.
“<i>One of his servants responded, etc.</i>” [7:13]. One of the <i>ministers</i> of the king of Israel responded that they should take five horses that remained with the Israelites that were skinny and had not eaten. The horses, like the people, had no food. If you will think that the five horses would be lost to the people of <i>Aram</i>, the <i>minister</i> responded that were they to remain here, the horses would die of starvation, like the rest of Israel. The king sent out two of his best horses among the five horses to see where the <i>king of Aram</i> had gone. The riders on the two horses went as far as the <i>Jordan.</i> They found many clothes that the Arameans had dropped, out of great fright. The Israelite messengers came back to the king of Israel and gave him the news.
“<i>The people went out and plundered the Aramean camp</i>” [7:16]. The Israelites went out and took all the food from the Aramean tents. One measure of fine flour sold for one silver shekel and two measure of barley for a silver shekel, as God had said. An <i>aide</i> to the king of Israel was present when he heard what the prophet had said to Israel the day before, when Aram was besieging the city of <i>Samaria</i> and before they ran away. The <i>prophet</i> said: the Holy One will cause tomorrow that a measure of fine flour will cost a silver shekel and two measures of barley will cost a silver shekel. That same <i>aide</i> said: will the Holy One make windows in heaven and the grain will rain down? The prophet answered the <i>aide.</i> You will see it with your own eyes and you will not eat of it. The same day the Israelites were rushing and pushing on the gate and crushed the aide to death. Thus, he saw with his own eyes that a measure of fine flour cost a silver shekel, where previously it cost a hundred silver shekels and the same for barley. There was a great amount of food in the Aramean tents.
This story occurred on the first night of Passover. Therefore, we read this <i>haftorah</i> on <i>Shabbat ha-Gadol</i> [the Sabbath before Passover]. In <i>leap years</i>, <i>Shabbat ha-Gadol</i> always also occurs on <i>Parshat Mezora.</i>

Achrei Mot

<b>[Amos, 9:7–15]</b>
“<i>To Me, O Israelites, you are just like the Ethiopians, declares the Lord</i>” [9:7]. The prophet says: Israel are compared to the black Moors and are sold as slaves.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Amos, 9:7.</i> It was just that they should be My servants because I took them out of <i>Egypt.</i> I have not done this for any other nation, to help them to be taken out of the exile in which they are found.

However, you were previously the children of one father, not like the <i>Philistines</i> and <i>Arameans</i> who are intermingled.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Ibn Ezra, Amos, 9:7.</i>
“<i>Behold, the Lord God has His eye on the sinful kingdom</i>” [9:8]. The Holy One will punish the <i>kingdom of Ephraim</i> for its evil <i>deeds</i> and he will wipe them off the earth. However, I will punish them, but I will not destroy all of Israel, even if they will sin.
“<i>For I will give the order, etc.</i>” [9:9]. The Holy One said; I do not want to completely destroy Israel, but I want to disperse them in exile among the nations, like a person who shakes and sifts flour through a sieve. The small clumps and pebbles remain in the sieve and do not fall out. They shake and are thrown around here and there in the sieve. In the same way, Israel will also be driven from one city to the other city.
“<i>Shall perish by the sword, etc.</i>” [9:10]. A sword will kill all of My sinners,who used to say that the evil would not happen to us. Similarly, when the evil will come upon us, it will not be because of our sins. They have denied the Holy One and said that the world goes along without a ruler. When something happens to someone, it is an accident, and not from the Holy One because of transgressions.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Amos, 9:10.</i>
“<i>On that day</i>” [9:11].

“<i>So that they will possess</i>” [9:12]. Awaiting that Israel, who are called by My name, will possess <i>Edom</i> and their land, so says God.
“<i>A time is coming</i>” [9:13]. A time will come, says God, that there will be much grain, that they will work on cutting the grain for so long that the time for plowing again will have come, and similarly with the vineyard. The high mountains will flow with milk and sweet wine and with sheep’s milk, so that the mountains will dissolve from an abundance of milk that the animals will give.
“<i>I will restore</i>” [9:14]. I will restore Israel to Me and build the cities that are ruined. They will sit and plant vineyards and will drink wine, till gardens, to eat good fruit.
“<i>And I will plant them on their soil, nevermore to be uprooted, etc.</i>” [9:15]. I will plant them on their land and they will never be expelled again, so says God, your God.
The Talmud writes in [tractate <i>Sanhedrin</i>] <i>chapter ten</i>, about the verse “<i>I will set up again the fallen booth of David</i>” [9:15]. <i>Rabbi Johanan</i> said that in the days when the Messiah will come, the number of scholars will shrink. The people will have great troubles. Before the first trouble ends, the next trouble will come behind it. Our sages said that in the time that the Messiah will come, the young will shame the old and the elders will stand up before youths. The daughter will quarrel with her mother, the son-in-law with his father-in-law, and the daughter-in-law with her mother-in-law. The son will not be ashamed before his father. The Messiah will come only when there are few sages in the world. There must be so little money in the wallet that a penny will not be found. The Messiah will only come when Israel will despair of the Messiah. That is, they will say that the Messiah will not come. <i>Rabbi Zeira</i>, when he found <i>rabbis</i> talking about the Messiah, he said to them, do not cause that the Messiah should not come soon, since we learned that three things come when one does not remember or think about them. One is the Messiah. The second is a found article.

<b>[Ezekiel, 22:1–9]</b>
“<i>The word of the Lord came to me, saying</i>” [22:1]. God said to <i>Ezekiel the prophet:</i> will you judge the city and do <i>justice</i> in the city? They have spilled much blood through <i>murder</i>, even in the city itself. The norm is that one commits murder in the field and in secret. However, you have done it publicly, before all the people. This blood still fills the whole city.
“<i>Say: Thus said the Lord God</i>” [22:3]. Say to Israel that their time has come that their cities and their people should be destroyed because of the murder and the worship of foreign gods in which they have engaged. You have made the city <i>impure</i> and the day of your destruction has come. You will be disgraced among the <i>nations.</i>
“<i>Both the near and the far will scorn you, besmirched of name</i>” [22:5]. You <i>Israel</i> will be embarrassed and humbled near and far. Your body will be humbled and your name will be humbled.
“<i>Each of the princes of Israel used his strength, etc.</i>” [22:6]. Whoever among the <i>kings and nobles</i> was strong, he won, and shed much blood.
“<i>Fathers and mothers have been humiliated</i>” [22:7]. They did not honor father and mother and these are the greatest sins. Even if the Torah did not command respect for father and mother, it would have been correct to respect father and mother. The stranger, the orphan and the widow, they have defrauded.
“<i>You have despised My holy things and profaned My Sabbaths</i>” [22:8]. You brought sacrifices that were lame and had other defects. The Torah forbade this and they have desecrated the Sabbath.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Ezekiel, 22:8.</i>
“<i>Base men in your midst were intent on shedding blood, and on the mountains</i>” [22:9]. They have pursued slander and have shed blood, worshiping false gods on the mountains and they pursued illicit sex.
“<i>They have ravished women in their impurity</i>” [22:10]. They slept with their wives and others when they were menstruating. Therefore he said, with this the women were tormented, since when one sleeps with a woman who is menstruating, the woman feels great pain.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Ezekiel, 22:10.</i>
“<i>They have taken bribes within you, etc.</i>” [22:12]. The <i>judge</i> has taken bribes, they charge <i>usurious interest</i> and you have forgotten Me, so said God.
“<i>I will strike My hands</i>” [22:13]. I clap My hands, just like someone who is in <i>distress</i> and claps his hands, because of the robbery and bloodshed that is among you.
“<i>Will your courage endure, will your hand remain firm</i>” [22:14]. Will your heart be able to endure against the troubles that I will do to you? I, God, say this and will do it.
“<i>I will scatter you among the nations</i>” [22:15]. I will disperse you among the nations and remove your <i>impurity</i> from you.
“<i>You shall be dishonored</i>” [22:16]. You were previously called My <i>guarantor</i>, but now you will be alone and I will disgrace you before all the nations, since I am God.

Emor

<b>[Ezekiel, 44:15–31]</b>
“<i>The levitical priests descended from Zadok, who maintained the service in My sanctuary</i>” [44:15]. The Holy One said: the priests, descendants of <i>Zadok</i>, who was the first priest in the days of Solomon. Therefore, all the priests who acted properly and guarded My Temple were named after him.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ezekiel, 44:15.</i> When Israel went astray from Me, these children of <i>Zadok</i> brought Israel back to Me, to My service.
“<i>They alone may enter My sanctuary and they alone may approach My table to serve Me</i>” [44:16]. These children of Zadok should bring the showbread to My table, to serve Me.
“<i>When they enter the gates of the inner court</i>” [44:17]. When the priests will do the <i>service on Yom Kippur</i> in the inner sanctum, they should not wear garments of wool from sheep, but they should make garments out of linen to perform the service within.
“<i>Linen turbans</i>” [44:18]. The hats on their heads should be out of linen and also pants on their loins out of linen.
“<i>When they go out</i>” [44:19]. When the priests will go out from the service, they should not undress inside, but they should go outside into the outer <i>courtyard</i> and take off their garments outside. They should put the garments in a chamber in the Temple, so that should their garments not touch the clothes of Israelites that are not holy.
“<i>They shall not shave their heads</i>” [44:20]. The hair of their head should not grow very long and they should not cut off their hair completely. However, they should cut their hair once a month and the haircut should be handsome. The Talmud says in [tractate <i>Sanhedrin</i>] <i>chapter 10.</i> A king cuts his hair every day, the high priest cuts his hair every Friday, and an ordinary priest cuts his hair once a month.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Sanhedrin,</i> 22b; <i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Ezekiel, <i>Remez,</i> 383.</i>
“<i>They should not drink wine</i>” [44:21]. The priests should not drink any wine when they are serving in the Temple.
“<i>They should not marry a widow or a divorced woman</i>” [44:22]. No priest should marry a widow. That is to say, the high priest should not marry her, but an ordinary priest is allowed to marry a widow. However, the ordinary priest also may not marry a divorced woman. The reason that the high priest should not marry a widow is that she may have previously had bad experiences. It is possible that the widow previously had a bad husband, an Israelite who slept with her all the time. Now, she will want to win the high priest in the same way. The high priest must be warned that he should not sleep with her because of his service in the Temple. However, a widow who was previously married to a priest, the high priest is allowed to marry her because she was previously married to a priest and is used to the rules about sex. Concerning this the verse says, “<i>the widow who is the widow of a priest he may marry</i>” [44:22]. That is to say, the high priest may marry the <i>widow</i> of a priest. <i>Radak</i> writes that an ordinary priest may marry a <i>widow</i>, but not the high priest. About this, it says, “<i>of a priest, they should take</i>” [44:22]. That is to say, some priests may marry a widow, meaning ordinary priests.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Ezekiel, 44:22.</i>
“<i>They shall teach My people</i>” [44:23]. The priests should teach Torah to Israel.
“<i>In lawsuits, they shall act as judges</i>” [44:24]. The priests should give judgments in disputes between Israelites.
“<i>They shall not defile themselves by coming near a dead person</i>” [44:25]. The priest should not defile himself with a dead person, except for his father and mother, to a son or daughter, to a brother and an unmarried sister. The priests should count seven days and after another seven days he will be ritually pure.
“<i>On the day that he reenters the sanctuary</i>” [44:27]. The first time the priest will bring sacrifices in the Temple, he should bring a sin offering.
“<i>This shall be their portion</i>” [44:28]. The priesthood should be a <i>guarantor</i> and an inheritance for them. They should take no fields and cities, like the rest of Israel. I, God, am their inheritance and guarantor for them. They will have sacrifices to eat, meal offerings, sin offerings, and guilt offerings. Everything that is sanctified as holy will be theirs. The first fruits, the <i>terumah</i>, and the <i>hallah</i> offering should be given to the priest to eat. The Holy One will give the Israelite a blessing in his house because of this merit.
“<i>Priests should not eat anything, whether bird or animal, that has died or was torn by beasts</i>” [44:31]. The priest should not eat an animal that died or was killed by beasts. Even an ordinary Jew who is not a priest should not eat an animal that died or was killed by beasts. The priest must separate himself from all <i>impurity</i>, in the expectation that he will enter the Sanctuary in purity.

<b>[Jeremiah, 32:6–27]</b>
“<i>Jeremiah said: The word of God came to me</i>” [32:6]. <i>Jeremiah</i> said: God said to me, <i>Hanamel</i>, son of your uncle <i>Shallum</i> will come to you and will say: buy the field that is in the city of <i>Anatoth</i> from me. It is right that you should buy it, as you are the successor to this field.
“<i>Hanamel came to me</i>” [32:8]. <i>Hanamel</i>, the son of <i>Jeremiah</i>’<i>s</i> uncle came, as God had said, and said to <i>Jeremiah</i>, buy this field from me. Jeremiah had understood that everything was from God, because the Holy One had foretold that your uncle’s son would come.
“<i>And I bought the land from Hanamel</i>” [32:9]. Jeremiah says: I bought the field and paid for it.
“<i>I wrote the deed, sealed it, and it witnessed</i>” [32:10]. I wrote in a scroll that I bought the field and had it <i>sealed and witnessed.</i>
“<i>I took the deed of purchase</i>” [32:11]. I took the scroll with the seal that I bought the field and gave it to <i>Baruch the son of Neriah</i> in the presence of my uncle’s son and before the witnesses and before all of the Israelites that were present.
“<i>I commanded Baruch</i>” [32:13]. I asked <i>Baruch</i>, before them that he should hide the scrolls in which the sale of the field with the seals was written. He had a <i>copy</i> made of the scroll where the field was sold, so that he should not need to go to the original scroll. That is to say, Jeremiah made a copy so that if he wanted to show that he had bought the field he would not have to show the original scroll, but would show the copy. Jeremiah told <i>Baruch</i> that he should take an earthen vessel in which to put the copy and the original scroll which was sealed, in the hope that would last for a long time and not be destroyed.
“<i>Thus said the Lord of Hosts, etc.</i>” [32:14]. Thus has God said: I have commanded this because you should buy the field and you should do this <i>publicly</i> in the hope that Israel should know that they will be redeemed from the exile and will again come to the land, to their fields and their houses. Therefore, the Holy One commanded him to buy the field, to comfort Israel that they should not think that they would be destroyed.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Jeremiah, 32:14.</i>
“<i>I prayed to God</i>” [32:16]. I prayed to God. I have given the scroll to Baruch and said to God: You have created heaven and earth with your might and you know well all the hidden things. You know well that we will be in exile, so why did you tell me to buy the field?<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Jeremiah, 32:16.</i>
“<i>You show kindness to the thousandth generation</i>” [32:18]. The Holy One who shows kindness to a thousand generations and pays for the sins that the father does to the children must suffer for the father, when the children also commit the sins that the father committed.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Jeremiah, 32:18.</i>
“<i>Wondrous in purpose and mighty in deed</i>” [32:19]. You are good and very wise to give advice and You do great things. You observe the ways of people, to pay each one his measure.
“<i>You displayed signs and wonders in the land of Egypt</i>” [32:20]. You God have done great things in the land of Egypt, until the present day, for Israel and for other nations because of the merit of Israel. You have taken Israel out of Egypt with great wonders.
“<i>You gave them this land</i>” [32:22]. You have given them the land that you promised to Abraham.
“<i>They came and took possession of it</i>” [32:23]. They came and conquered the land and the Israelites did not listen to His commandments. That is why the troubles came upon them.
“<i>The siege mounds have been raised against the city</i>” [32:24]. Now the great cannons have come to the city to conquer the city. The city will be given into the hand of the Chaldeans who are waging war against the city, with hunger, sword and pestilence. You have said so and have seen this with your eyes. You God have said to me, buy the field, with witnesses, even though the city will be given into the hands of the Chaldeans.
“<i>The word of the Lord came to Jeremiah</i>” [32:26]. The Holy One responded: I know all the hidden things, and I know well that Jerusalem will be destroyed, but I have told you to buy the field in order to console Israel, that they will be redeemed and will return to their land in the days of the Messiah. <i>Amen.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Jeremiah, 32:26.</i>

<b>[Jeremiah, 16:19–17:14]</b>
“<i>O Lord, my strength and my stronghold, my refuge</i>” [16:19]. The prophet Jeremiah says: You God are my strength and You have helped me in the wars. I run to You in my troubles and I punish Israel because they worship foreign gods. I say to them:Why should you not consider that a time will come, in the days of the Messiah, that the nations will admit and think that their foreign gods are nothing? The nations will say: our fathers gave us a false inheritance and the foreign gods are of no help.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Jeremiah, 16:19.</i>
“<i>Can a man make gods for himself?</i>” [16:20]. The gentiles will say, in the days of the Messiah, how can we have been so mistaken to serve foreign gods that were no gods? That is, the one they called upon does not answer them.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Jeremiah, 16:20.</i>
“<i>Therefore, I will teach them</i>” [16:21]. Therefore, because Israel will not reconsider their foreign gods, I will let them know My might and My strength and they will know that I am God.
“<i>The sin of Judah</i>” [17:1]. The sins of Judah and their foreign gods are strongly written and engraved on their hearts. They cannot forget them, just like when something is written with an iron pen. That is to say, steel. When one makes a pen out of steel, it digs very deeply and is permanent. It never goes away.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Jeremiah, 17:1.</i>
“<i>While their children remember their altars</i>” [17:2]. The children remember their altars and their linden trees. That is to say, just like someone remembers his beloved son and rejoices when he remembers, so too they rejoice when they remember their <i>foreign gods.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Jeremiah, 17:2.</i>
“<i>On the mountains in the open country</i>” [17:3]. Israel made <i>foreign gods</i> in the fields. That is why the prophet calls the mountains and the fields on which they made foreign gods, your god. Your goods and money and all of your treasures will be destroyed, as will the foreign gods that you made in your territories.
“<i>You will forfeit your inheritance</i>” [17:4]. You Israel, because you did not observe the <i>sabbatical year</i> in your land, you will be a <i>sabbatical year</i> yourself. You will serve in foreign lands under your enemies. You do not know that a fire is burning within Me. You have ignited it in My nostrils eternally.
“<i>Thus says the Lord, cursed is the man, etc.</i>” [17:5]. God says: woe to the person who relies on people and puts his trust in them. Woe to him who awaits help from a person who is flesh and blood, and he removes himself from the Holy One.
“<i>He will be like a bush in the desert, etc.</i>” [17:6]. That same person will be like a tree that stands alone in the forest and no rain comes on it. It sits in every heat and the earth is burned by salt. This tree will die.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Jeremiah, 17:6.</i>
“<i>Praised is the man who trusts in the Lord</i>” [17:7]. However, when the Holy One will be a guarantor for him, then He will properly assure him. He will certainly help him.
“<i>He will be like a tree planted by waters, etc.</i>” [17:8]. The one who relies on the Holy One will be like a tree that is planted near a river that sends its roots to the water of the river. When there is a great heat, it does not fear; it has enough water.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Jeremiah, 17:8.</i>
“<i>Its leaves are ever fresh</i>” [17:8]. Its leaves will not fall off in the winter and when there won’t be any rain, it won’t fear since it stands near water and won’t be deterred from growing fruit.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Jeremiah, 17:8.</i>
“<i>The heart is the most devious of all, etc.</i>” [17:9]. That is why he said that assurance depends on the heart. That is why he says that the heart has much deviousness within it. The Holy One knows this well.
“<i>I the Lord probe the heart</i>” [17:10]. The Holy One said: I know what is in the heart of a person and understand everything. Therefore, I can properly pay each one according to his deeds. I do not make mistakes. The person cannot give me false excuses that he did not commit the sin wholeheartedly. I know what is in the heart of the person.
“<i>Like a partridge, etc.</i>” [17:11]. The Holy One said: I have said that I properly pay each one according to their deeds, so how is it that an evildoer is very rich? Concerning this, the Holy One responds that the wealth of the evildoer, when he gathers wealth through <i>theft or usury</i>, it does not remain long. A bird, which is called a <i>partridge</i>, sits on the eggs of other birds and incubates them. When the birds hatch from these eggs, they do not follow this bird, called a <i>partridge</i>, but they leave and follow their own. So too is the wealth of evildoer. Similarly, when he has lots of money it will not remain with him for long. The wealth must depart during his lifetime and in the end he will be left a wretch.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Jeremiah, 17:11.</i>
“<i>Throne of glory, exalted from old, etc.</i>” [17:12]. This verse is related to the previous verse that the evildoer remains a wretch and is thrown down from the <i>Throne of Glory in the world to come.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Jeremiah, 17:12.</i>
“<i>Hope of Israel, O Lord, all who forsake you, etc.</i>” [17:13]. The prophet says that You, God, are a hope for Israel who have left You. They will not assure themselves in You and will be ashamed.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Jeremiah, 17:13.</i>
“<i>Those in the land who turn from you</i>” [17:13]. Those who turn away from God and will not assure themselves of God will remain on the earth and will not come to the <i>world to come. Measure for measure.</i> He relies on people who are on the earth and therefore he must remain on the earth. This is the meaning of the verse, “<i>Those in the land who turn from you</i>” [17:13].<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Jeremiah, 17:13.</i>
“<i>Heal me, O Lord, and let me be healed, save me, etc.</i>” [17:14]. He prayed to God that he should heal and help him not to be shamed. You are my praise and I am Your praise. When we will be helped, it will be Your praise.

Bamidbar

<b>[Hosea, 2:1–22]</b>
“<i>The number of the people of Israel shall be</i>” [2:1]. The prophet says that Israel are called not My people, when Israel are evil with transgressions. God said: you are not My people, but a time will come when the Holy One will say to Israel, you are children to God who lives, instead of the foreign gods that you previously served, who were dead. However, now when the Messiah will come, you will be called children of God who lives. They will be pious to God and God will have compassion on them and will increase them like the sand of the sea that cannot be counted.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Hosea, 2:1.</i>
“<i>The people of Judah and the people of Israel will assemble, etc.</i>” [2:2]. Israel will gather together in the days of the Messiah and will appoint a leader, since it is enough that Israel have been dispersed under the domination of the nations. That is why this is called the <i>exile of Jezreel.</i> This means, He spread and sowed among the nations.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Hosea, 2:2.</i>
“<i>Say to your brothers, My people</i>” [2:3]. Say to your brothers, My dear people that you will keep My Torah, you will keep it and I will have compassion on you.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Hosea, 2:3.</i>
“<i>Rebuke your mother, rebuke her, she is not my wife and I am not her husband, etc.</i>” [2:4]. Quarrel with each other, Israel, and punish the evildoers among you so that they will repent. When Israel will be evil, the Holy One says you are not My wife and I am not your husband. Therefore, remove the licentiousness and the adornments that you made because of licentiousness.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Hosea, 2:4.</i>
“<i>Else I will strip her naked and leave her, etc.</i>” [2:5]. The Holy One said: you Israel should remove your evil deeds or I will put you out, naked as the day you were born from your mother, and as you were in Egypt. I will destroy them and I will have no mercy on their children, since they are children who engaged in licentiousness.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Hosea, 2:5.</i>
“<i>Their mother has played the harlot, she has conceived them</i>” [2:7]. Your prophet who worshiped foreign gods and your <i>scholar</i> and <i>rabbi</i> who teaches them must be ashamed before the <i>ignorant people.</i> He cannot say to the <i>ignorant person</i>, do not steal, when he is himself a thief. He cannot say, do not take <i>interest</i>, when he himself takes <i>interest.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Hosea, 2:7.</i>
“<i>For she said, I will go after my lovers</i>” [2:7]. They said, we would go after our lovers. These are the sun and the moon that they considered to be gods. They said that the sun and the moon give us bread, oil and clothes from the wool of sheep and flax.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Hosea, 2:7.</i>
“<i>Therefore, I will hedge up her roads, etc.</i>” [2:8]. Therefore, I will close your roads and will hedge them with hedges and you will find no paths. They will desire peace from the nations who were their lovers and they will not find it. They will say: I will return to my first husband, who is better than all of them.
“<i>And she did not consider this, that I had given her</i>” [2:10]. They do not know that I, God, give grain, wine, oil, and silver. I have given it to them and they have brought it to the foreign god.
“<i>Therefore, I will take back My new grain in its time</i>” [2:11]. Therefore, I will show them that I have given them the bread and the clothes. I will take away from them the bread, clothes and oil. Then they will know that I have given it to them.
“<i>No I will uncover her shame</i>” [2:12]. Now I will show her evil deeds, when I will leave her. She will be ashamed in the eyes of her lovers.
“<i>And I will end all the rejoicing</i>” [2:13]. I will disrupt her joy and her <i>holiday, New Moon, and Sabbath.</i>
“<i>I will lay waste to her vines and her fig trees, etc.</i>” [2:14]. I will destroy the vineyards and their fig trees that they used to say that their foreign gods had given to them.
“<i>And I will punish her for the days of the Baalim</i>” [2:15]. I will punish them for the days that they brought sacrifices to the foreign gods and they took the beautiful adornments from their bodies and gave them to the foreign gods and Me they had forgotten, says God.
“<i>Therefore, I will</i>” [2:16]. I will cause Israel to repent in the exile and will convince them to come to Me. I will console them in their troubles and will again give them their vineyards. I will give them an open hope in their exile in which they sat and were troubled. They will sing there like they sang during the Exodus from Egypt and like they sang by Sisera.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Hosea, 2:16.</i>
“<i>In the day, says the Lord</i>” [2:18].

“<i>And I will remove the names of the Baalim from her mouth</i>” [2:19]. I will remove the names of the foreign gods from the mouths of Israel. They will no longer be mentioned by their names.
“<i>In that day, I will make a covenant with them, etc.</i>” [2:20]. I will make peace between the wild animal and the birds. I will break the conflict with the sword and the bow, so that they should live in security.
“<i>I will espouse you forever and I will espouse you with righteousness, etc.</i>” [2:21]. I will betroth you forever through the merit of the charity and the merit of justice, <i>kindness and mercy.</i>

<b>[Judges, 13:2–25]</b>
“<i>There was a certain man from Zorah</i>” [13:2]. There was a man from Zorah and his name was <i>Manoah</i> and his wife could not have children.
“<i>An angel of the Lord appeared</i>” [13:3]. An angel appeared to the woman and said to her: you will have a son.
“<i>Now be careful</i>” [13:4]. The angel said to the woman: Be warned not to drink wine and do not eat things that are ritually impure. That is to say, what the nazirite does not eat, you should also not eat.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Judges, <i>Remez</i>, 68.</i>
The Baal ha-Turim asks a question concerning the <i>haftorah.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">I was not able to find the source of this comment</i> Once it is written, “<i>do not eat anything unclean</i>” [13:4]. Another time it is written, “<i>eat nothing unclean</i>” [13:7]. He speaks once the way one used to speak to a man and once he talks the way one used to talk to a woman.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The problem that is being raised is that in the first verse, the word for impurity is in the masculine form, while in the second verse it is in the feminine form.</i> The explanation is that women advised the woman who could not have children that she should eat the stomach of a hare and she would have children. It was the custom that every woman who could not have children was given the stomach of a hare to eat. That is why the verse says once, impure in the masculine, if it was a male hare and once it says impurity in the feminine, if it was a female hare. The truth is that the term hare is both male and female. That is to say, the term hare includes both genders. The angel warned the woman that she should not eat the stomach of a hare as a remedy. The Holy One would give her a son without the remedy from the hare.
“<i>You are going to conceive and bear a son, etc.</i>” [13:5]. The angel said to the woman. You will have a son and do not allow him to cut his hair. He will be a nazirite to God and he will help [free] Israel from the Philistines.
“<i>The woman went and told her husband</i>” [13:6]. The woman came to her husband and told him: an angel had come and said to me and I will have a son. I did not ask the angel his name or where he came from.
“<i>Manoah pleaded with God</i>” [13:8]. Manoah prayed to God and said: <i>Lord of the Universe</i>, send the angel again and let us learn how we should behave with the youth so that he will be a nazirite.
“<i>God heard Manoah</i>’<i>s plea</i>” [13:9]. The Holy One heard the voice of Manoah and the Holy One sent the angel to the woman. The woman was sitting in the field and her husband was not there. Here one asks a question. Why did the angel appear in the field? Or, why does the verse need to say, there in the field? The explanation is that one should not suspect that the angel is an evil person and how relevant is it that a man should come alone and appear to a woman for sexual purposes? That is why the angel appeared in the field, where there is no forest, in the expectation that she should not be suspected [of misbehavior] with the angel. That is why the verse says, “<i>she was sitting in the field and Manoah her husband was not with her</i>” [13:9]. That is why he appeared in the field because her husband was not with her and she had no guardian with her. That is why the angel appeared in the field. One must give a similar explanation concerning Deborah. She was sitting under a tree and was judging Israel and not in a house,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Judges, 4:5.</i> in the expectation that a strange man should not come alone to her without a guardian. However, she can sit under a tree in the field where all the people go without problem. From here we learn that every woman should be warned that she should not be without a guardian, not to be <i>suspected.</i> People should not say that she was alone with a man, even though she was a completely righteous woman.
“<i>The woman hurried to tell her husband</i>” [13:10]. The woman hurried and told her husband that the man that appeared to me previously, appeared to me again, during the day. It is shown in the verse that both of them thought that he was a man and not an angel.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Judges, <i>Remez</i>, 40.</i> That is why she said that he appeared to me during the day. That is to say, do not suspect that he appeared to me at night or also where there is carelessness, but during the day, openly, in the field.
“<i>Manoah arose and followed his wife, etc.</i>” [13:11]. Manoah went after his wife to the man. Manoah said: are you the man who told me wife that she will have a child? The angel said: I am he. Manoah said to the angel: Tell me what the youth should do? The angel said that he should drink no wine and eat no ritually unclean things.
“<i>Manoah said to the angel of the Lord, etc.</i>” [13:13]. Manoah said to the angel: come into my house and I will honor you with a kid. The angel responded: I will not eat your bread and if you want to offer a kid as a sacrifice to God, offer it on the altar. Manoah did not know that this was an angel. Manoah asked the angel. What is your name, so that when you will send a messenger to us, we will honor your words? The angel responded. Why do you ask my name? My name is hidden. That is, every time I have another name. I am given a name according to where I have been sent, and what is the task.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Judges, <i>Remez,</i> 69.</i>
“<i>And Manoah took the kid</i>” [13:19]. Manoah brought the kid as a sacrifice to God on a rock. The angel showed wonders. He drew fire out of the rock to burn the kid and the meal offering. The flame was so great that it reached to heaven and the angel ascended to heaven in the flame of the fire. Manoah and his wife saw this and fell to the ground and the angel never again appeared to them. Now Manoah knew that this was an angel. Manoah said to his wife: we will die because we have seen God. His wife responded: if the Holy One had wanted to kill us, he would not have accepted our sacrifice and would not have shown us the wonders and would not have told us the good news that we will have a son.
“<i>The woman bore a son and she named him Samson</i>” [13:24]. The woman bore a son and his name was <i>Samson.</i> The youth grew up and the Holy One blessed him.
“<i>The spirit of the Lord first moved him in the camp of Dan, etc.</i>” [13:25]. The prophecy from God came to Samson in the area of <i>Dan</i>, between the city of <i>Zorah</i> and the city of <i>Eshtaol.</i> Now began the prophecy that Jacob had spoken of, that a son will come from the tribe of Dan and will defeat the <i>Philistines.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Sotah,</i> 9b; <i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Judges, <i>Remez,</i> 69.</i>

“<i>Shout for joy, fair Zion, etc.</i>” [2:14].

Many nations will attach themselves to the Holy One on that day and they will become one people and I will rest among them.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Zechariah, 2:14.</i>
“<i>The Lord will take Judah as His portion</i>” [2:16]. Each Israelite will inherit his share in the Holy Land and He will choose <i>Jerusalem.</i>

When I will see that the poor are treated unjustly and the <i>paupers</i> will cry out, as the verse says, “<i>because of the groans of the plundered poor and needy, I will now act, says the Lord</i>” [Psalms, 12:6]. This is the meaning of the verse “<i>Be silent, all flesh.</i>” That is to say, when the Holy One awakes and arises, for the sake of the poor, then every person should be afraid of God and should be silent.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Genesis Rabbah,</i> 75.1; <i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Zechariah, <i>Remez</i>, 569.</i>
“<i>He further showed me Joshua the high priest</i>” [3:1]. He showed me <i>Joshua the high priest</i> standing before the <i>angel</i> of God. The <i>angel of death</i> stood at his right hand and he wanted to speak evil about <i>Joshua the high priest.</i> The angel said: God should rebuke you, <i>Satan.</i> Joshua is worthy to be the <i>high priest.</i> He has been separated from the fire.
A similar story is found in the Talmud, [<i>Sanhedrin</i>] <i>in chapter 10.</i> There were two <i>false prophets.</i> One was called <i>Zedekiah</i> and another one was called <i>Ahab. Zedekiah</i> went to the daughter of <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i> and told her <i>false prophecies.</i> He said to her that God had ordered that she should sleep with <i>Ahab the prophet</i> and <i>Ahab</i> said the same thing about <i>Zedekiah</i> that the daughter of <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i> should sleep with Zedekiah. The daughter went to her father and told him the news. Her father said: when they come to you, send them to me. She sent both of them to her father. Nebuchadnezzar, her father, said: why has the Holy One commanded you to do this and not <i>Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah?</i> They responded: <i>Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah</i> are not prophets and we are prophets. Nebuchadnezzar said: I will test you like I have tested <i>Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah.</i> I tested them in the furnace with fire. The false prophets answered that they were three and we are only two. Their merit was greater. The king answered: take another one so that you will also be three and I will throw you into the fire. They chose <i>Joshua the high priest</i> who is mentioned in the <i>haftorah.</i> They said that perhaps we would also be protected from the fire by the merit of the high priest. They were thrown into the fire. The two <i>false prophets</i> were burned and <i>Joshua the high priest</i> only had his clothes singed by the fire. Nebuchadnezzar asked him, I know very well that you are righteous. Why were your clothes singed by the fire, and <i>Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah</i> were not singed by the fire? Joshua answered that they were three and I was alone. He said that Abraham was also alone in the furnace and his clothes were not singed. Joshua responded that the fire was not given permission to burn people in Abraham’s oven. However, here in my case, the fire was given permission to burn Zedekiah and Ahab. That is why the fire came up to my clothes. Further, if there are two pieces of dry wood, then the third log of wood must also be singed, even if it is wet and damp. What sin did Joshua commit? The explanation is that he allowed his children to marry <i>divorcees</i>, which is forbidden.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Sanhedrin,</i> 93a.</i>
“<i>A brand plucked from the fire</i>” [3:2]. That is to say, Joshua was separated from the fire.
“<i>Joshua was clothed in filthy garments</i>” [3:3]. Joshua had filthy clothes. That is to say, transgressions that are like stains on the person. Joshua did not warn his children about not marrying <i>divorcees.</i> The angel shouted at Joshua that he should remove the garments. God will forgive your transgressions and you will don beautiful garments.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Zechariah, 3:3.</i>

“<i>Here is the stone that I have placed before Joshua, etc.</i>” [3:9]. The angel said to <i>Joshua. Zerubbabel</i> who is building the Temple that will continue to exist. The evildoers will not be able to prevent it from being built. Each stone will have great supervision from the Holy One that it should not be moved, just like seven eyes would be watching and guarding the stones of the <i>Temple.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Zechariah, 3:9.</i>
“<i>I will execute its engraving</i>” [3:9]. The angel said: I will disrupt the ideas of the evildoers who want to prevent the building of the Temple and I will remove the sins of the land in one day. There will be great peace in the country, and they will live in freedom under their fig tree and vines.
“<i>The angel who talked to me came back and woke me</i>” [4:1]. The angel woke me, just like someone wakes up from sleep, and said to me. What do you see? I said, I see a golden candelabrum and over the candelabrum there was a large bowl in which they used to put oil. The candelabrum had seven branches. From the bowl there were seven small pipes through which oil poured into each branch of the candelabrum from the bowl. Afterwards, I saw two olive trees from which olive oil is made, one tree on the right side of the bowl and one tree on the left side of the bowl. That is to say, oil should never be depleted. This is the meaning of the verse “<i>two olive trees near it</i>” [4:3].
“<i>I, in turn asked the angel who talked to me, etc.</i>” [4:4]. I asked the angel, what is this that the olive tree produces oil by itself which flows into the bowl and from this bowl the oil flows into each branch of the candelabrum and no person is involved in it.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Zechariah, 4:4.</i>
“<i>Not by might, nor by power, but through My spirit, says the Lord</i>” [4:6]. The angel responded: I will tell you what this means. Just like you see that the tree making oil run from itself into the bowl and the bowl causes the oil to flow by itself into the candelabrum, into each branch, so too, the Temple will be built by God himself, and not through the hands of the people. The tree and the candelabrum signify this.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Zechariah, 4:6.</i>
“<i>Whoever you are, O great mountain, etc.</i>” [4:7]. He says: when it will be before the evildoers who want to prevent the building of the Temple, it will be like a great mountain that one cannot conquer. The evildoers will think that it is not possible to build the Temple. However, for Zerubbabel the righteous one, the building will be very easy, just like it is easy to build on a fine smooth field.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Zechariah, 4:7.</i>

The Talmud writes in [tractate] <i>Berakhot</i>, concerning the verse, “<i>the Lord said to the Accuser</i>” [3:2]. <i>Rabbi Joshua the son of Levi</i> said: The <i>Angel of Death</i> told me that you should not stand in front of the women when they walk past a deceased person. That is to say, when they are leaving the <i>cemetery</i>, since I, the <i>Angel of Death</i>, dance and jump before the women and I have permission to kill and harm anyone I encounter. If someone does encounter him, they should say, “<i>The Lord said to the Accuser, the Lord rebuke you</i>” [3:2].<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Berakhot,</i> 51a.</i>
The Talmud writes all this and the <i>Angel of Death</i> dances before the women, for if the women had not sinned through Eve, people would have lived forever. The <i>Angel of Death</i> would not have been able to kill people and he would not have had his <i>work.</i> That is why he dances before the women when there is a corpse.
The <i>Pardes Rimmonim</i> writes that women used to cry very quickly in the presence of a corpse. The women had red faces from crying. When the men would walk near them and see the women’s red faces, the Evil Inclination would jump on the men and incite them to have thoughts about the women.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">I could not find the source in the <i>Pardes Rimmonim</i>, but the earlier source is <i>Zohar</i>, II: 196ab.</i>

<b>[Joshua, 2:1–24]</b>
“<i>Joshua ben Nun sent from Shittin, etc.</i>” [2:1]. Joshua sent two men to the land of Israel that they should spy out the land, and the city of <i>Jericho</i>, which was as strong, as the whole land of Israel. The two men were righteous, not like the other spies in the days of Moses, who were evildoers. The two men went to the city of Jericho and appeared to be deaf and dumb. That is to say, people should not ask them, where are they from?<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Joshua, 2:1.</i>
The Midrash writes that they made themselves to appear as potters who had pots to sell, so that people would not bother them about who they are.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Joshua, <i>Remez</i>, 7.</i> They also made themselves to be potters so that the women would come to buy pots. Women speak much gladly and tell secrets about what is happening in the city. Thus, they could ask the women if they were afraid of the Israelites in the city of Jericho. The Israelites wanted to hear if the people of the land of Israel were afraid of the Jews. The two spies came to the house of <i>Rahab the Zonah.</i> She kept an inn in which guests stayed.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The term “<i>Zonah</i>” is normally translated as harlot or prostitute. However, the <i>Targum,</i> Joshua, 2:1, translates “<i>zonah</i>” as innkeeper, playing on “<i>mazon</i>” or food. Radak, Joshua, 2:1, has an extensive discussion of this term and its history in Rabbinic literature.</i>
“<i>The king of Jericho was told</i>” [2:2]. The king of Jericho was told that two Israelites had come to the house of Rahab. They wanted to see how the city of Jericho and the whole land could be conquered. The king sent to Rahab that she should hand over the two men.
“<i>The woman took the two men and hid them</i>” [2:4]. Rahab hid them and she said: yes, two men did come to my house and I do not know from where they are. When the gate was locked for the night, they went out. The king’s messengers chased after the men as far as the Jordan. The gate was locked behind the messengers. Here one asks a question. Why is it written, “<i>and she hid him</i>”? This means, she hid him. That is, she only hid one of them and there were two. Why did she not hide both of them? The explanation is that the two men were <i>Phinehas</i> and <i>Caleb.</i> Phinehas said: I am a priest who is like an angel who cannot be seen. Therefore, Rahab does not have to hide me. That is why it is written, “<i>and she hid him.</i>” She only hid Caleb.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Joshua, <i>Remez</i>, 8.</i>
Another explanation is that she hid both of them in one tight hole where only one person could hide. They were hidden there, as if they were one man. The woman hid the men on the roof, under flax. She came to them and said: I know very well that God has given you the land, since the fear of you has fallen upon us and has spread to all the nations in the land.
“<i>We have heard how the Lord has dried up, etc.</i>” [2:10]. We have heard that the Holy One split the sea before you, and He destroyed two strong kings, Sihon and Og. Our hearts have dissolved and no person has any spirit, since God is with you. He is God in heaven and God on the earth.
“<i>Now swear to me, etc.</i>” [2:12]. Rahab said to them. Swear to me that because I have done kindness to you, so you should do kindness with me. Give me a sign, with truth and not with falsehood, and allow my family and my household to live. They responded: we will give you a sign, but do not tell our words and the sign to your neighbors; so that your neighbors will also make the sign that we will give you.
“<i>She let them down by a rope through a window, etc.</i>” [2:15]. She lowered the two men on a rope through the window in the wall, in the expectation that the neighbors would not see it. She said to them that they should go to the mountains, so that the men who were looking for them should not encounter them. Remain hidden for three days until the men who were looking for you will return home. The men said: you should tie a red thread on the window where we were lowered and we will not allow evil things to be done to your house. Gather all of your family. If somebody will go out and will be killed, we will not be responsible.
“<i>She sent them on their way, and they left; and she tied the crimson cord to the window</i>” [2:21]. She sent the men and they knotted the red thread on the window. They went to the mountains and stayed there for three days until the messengers of the king of Jericho returned. It is said that Rahab always tied a red thread when she was menstruating, so that no man should come to sleep with her. Rahab was a prostitute for forty years and nobody slept with her when she was menstruating. Now, when the two Israelite spies came to Rahab’s house, she also tied a red thread, a sign for the spies and also that no man should come and sleep with her. Caleb and Phinehas came to Joshua and told him how it went for them. They said to Joshua: the Holy One has given the nations into our hands. Their hearts melted before us.
The Talmud says in [tractate] Zevahim. How did Rahab know that no chieftain of the nations had any spirit that she said, “<i>no man had any more spirit left</i>” [2:11]. The explanation is that she was a great prostitute. There was not a single chieftain in the whole land that did not come to sleep with her. However, now no man came to her. They were all afraid and they had no lust for any woman. <i>Rahab</i> was ten years old when the Israelites left Egypt. She was a prostitute for the forty years that Israel was in the wilderness. After forty years she converted and said: <i>Lord of the Universe</i>, with three things I sinned before you, with <i>Nidah</i>, with <i>Hallah</i>, with candle lighting.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">These are considered the three classic commandments for women.</i> With these three things forgive me, with the rope that I lowered two men, with the window, and with the wall. What did she merit? Eight prophets were descended from her and Joshua married <i>Rahab.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Zevahim,</i> 116a-b; <i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Joshua, <i>Remez</i>, 9.</i>

Korach

<b>[I Samuel, 11:14–12:22]</b>
“<i>Samuel said to the people</i>” [11:14]. Samuel said to the people. Let us go and we will renew the kingship, with King Saul, since many Israelites had shamed Saul. They said: what can this Saul help us? However, now they had seen that Saul had helped Israel from <i>king Nahash</i>, all of Israel accepted him as the proper king in Gilgal.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, I Samuel, 11:14.</i> They brought sacrifices to God and they rejoiced greatly. Samuel said: I have done your will and have given you a king. The king can go before you and I am old and gray.
Our sages say that he was only fifty-two years old when he died. The Holy One had made him prematurely gray in the expectation that the people should remember that he was old and should not say that such a righteous person like <i>Samuel the prophet</i> died so young. He must certainly have committed sins. The truth is that <i>Samuel prayed</i> that he should die, so that he should not see Saul die in his lifetime. That is why the Holy One made him prematurely gray.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, I Samuel, 12:2.</i>
“<i>Here I am. Testify against me before the Lord and before His anointed one</i>” [12:3]. Samuel said: I have served you from my youth until now. Tell me, whose ox have I taken or whose donkey? From whom have I stolen or from whom have I taken with good will, that I should have asked someone to lend me something? From whom have I taken bribes that I should not give proper judgments? If they will be embarrassed and do not want to say anything in my presence, let him tell other people and I will repay everything.
“<i>They responded: you have not defrauded us</i>” [12:4]. They said: you have not stolen from us and you have not taken what you should have asked from us. Samuel said: God should testify and King Saul should also testify that I have done no injustice.
“<i>Samuel said to the people</i>” [12:6]. Samuel said: the God who taught <i>Torah to Moses and Aaron</i>, who brought you out of Egypt, He should testify about me. Since He wanted to punish Israel, Samuel said beforehand: If you would say to me, I have defrauded you, and how should I punish you? It is not just that a person who has done evil deeds should punish other people. That is why Samuel said: I have not taken from you and therefore I will punish you. Come here and we will declare the good things that the Holy One has done for you and for your ancestors. First, Jacob came to Egypt and your ancestors called to God. God sent Moses and Aaron and they took Israel from the exile and brought you to this holy land. You forgot the Holy One and the Holy One gave you into the hands of <i>Sisera</i>, and the hands of the <i>Philistines</i> and the hands of <i>Moab.</i>
“<i>They cried to the Lord, and they said, we have sinned</i>” [12:10]. You shouted to God and said. We have served foreign gods. We ask you to redeem us. The Holy One sent a man named <i>Gideon, Samson the hero, Jephtah and Samuel.</i> They protected you from the evil nations.
Our sages learn from here that every <i>communal leader</i> or <i>rabbi</i> who is in a community should be honored and esteemed. One should not say that the rabbi in the community, communal leader or <i>judge</i> is insignificant and not as good as the rabbi who was here long ago, or similarly about a communal leader. When the Holy One raises someone over a community, he is worthy of it. One is as good as another, as is written in the haftorah. He counted Moses, Aaron, and Samuel, who were very pious and were placed over Israel. In comparison to these important <i>prophets, Gideon, Samson, and Jephtah</i> were also placed over Israel. Even though they were unequal to Moses, Aaron, and Samuel, yet Scripture counts them together, to teach us that we should not consider any rabbi, <i>judge</i> or <i>communal leader unimportant.</i> Whoever is placed in a position is good for it.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, I Samuel, <i>Remez</i>, 114.</i>
Our sages learn from here that the prophets prophesy with their mouths and do not know what they are saying. Here, he counts Moses, Aaron, and Samuel. The truth is that Samuel said this himself. He should have said, Moses, Aaron and also me. Samuel said Samuel with his mouth. He did not know what he was saying, but the Holy One put the words in his mouth that he should speak. Even though Samuel was a lord over all the prophets, yet he did not know what he was saying.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, I Samuel, 12:11.</i>
“<i>When you saw that Nahash, king of the Ammonites</i>” [12:12]. Israel again had troubles from the king of Ammon. You said to me that you should be given a king for Israel and you had a good and elevated king. This is the Holy One in Heaven and now the Holy One gave you a king. This is Saul, who is standing before you here.
“<i>If you will revere the Lord</i>” [12:14]. Now when you will fear the Holy One and will keep His commandments, then you will be worthy to endure before God forever.
“<i>If you did not listen</i>” [12:15]. If you will not listen to the Holy One’s commandments, God will punish you. Therefore, see now also that God does miracles for you. Is today the wheat harvest? I will call on the Holy One and He will give me rain and great thunder and lightning. It was a great wonder that rain should fall during the harvest of the wheat or grain. Therefore, Samuel said: I want to make rain fall today with my prayers. Samuel prayed and rain fell and there was great thunder. Israel feared God and Samuel.
“<i>All the people said to Samuel, pray</i>” [12:19]. The Israelites said to Samuel. Pray to God that we should not die. We have done evil in desiring a king, since God is king over Israel.
“<i>Samuel said to the people, do not fear</i>” [12:20]. Samuel said, do not be afraid, but be pious and serve God with your whole heart. Do not go after the foreign gods that do not help you and cannot protect you.
“<i>The Lord will not abandon His people, etc.</i>” [12:22]. God will not abandon you, for the sake of His holy name, and will always redeem you. When Israel are in exile, the nations say, your God of Israel cannot help you. Therefore, the Holy One must redeem them from exile, so that God should show His strength and His wonders.
The <i>Yalkut</i> writes that it is written here, “<i>For the sake of His great name</i>” [12:22]. This means, for the sake of His holy name He does not want to abandon Israel. Elsewhere it is written, “<i>the Lord will not abandon His people, etc.</i>” [12:22]. This means that the Holy One does not abandon Israel because they are the people of God. The explanation is that the Holy One does not abandon Israel outside the land of Israel because they are the people of the Holy One. However, in the <i>land of Israel</i> the Holy One does not abandon Israel for the sake of His holy name.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, I Samuel, <i>Remez</i>, 117.</i>
We should merit that God should not abandon us and redeem us with the Messiah. <i>Amen.</i>

<b>[Judges, 11:1–33]</b>
“<i>Jephtah the Gileadite was a mighty warrior, etc.</i>” [11:1]. <i>Jephtah the son of Gilead</i> was the son of a concubine of Gilead. That is why he is called in Scripture, <i>the son of a prostitute</i>, because she was not a legal wife. That is why she is called a prostitute.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Judges, 11:1.</i> Some sages say that <i>zonah</i> means a provider of food. That is to say, she kept an inn that had guests.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Judges, 11:1.</i> The legitimate children of <i>Gilead</i> excluded Jephtah from the house of <i>Gilead.</i> They said: you will not inherit with us from our father. <i>Jephtah</i> fled and settled in the land called <i>Tob.</i> Many ordinary people and <i>idlers</i> gathered around <i>Jephtah.</i> That is to say, strong and irreligious people.
“<i>It was when the Ammonites went to war with Israel</i>” [11:4]. When the people of <i>Ammon</i> came to <i>wage war</i> with Israel, the elders from the city of <i>Gilead</i> went to <i>Jephtah</i> and said to him. Come with us and you will be a lord over us and we will wage war against Ammon. <i>Jephtah</i> responded: you hated me and drove me out of my father’s house. Now, you are in trouble and you come to me. They pleaded with him that he should go and wage war and he will be a lord over them. Jephtah asked and said: promise me that if I will defeat Ammon that I will certainly be a lord over you. The elders responded to Jephtah: God should be a witness between us that we will do everything that you have said.
“<i>Jephtah went with the elders of Gilead</i>” [11:11]. Jephtah went with the elders and they made him a lord over them. Jephtah spoke all of his words before God in the city of <i>Mizpah.</i> That is, the place where the people of Israel gathered, and the Shekhinah rested. The house of Jephtah was in the city of <i>Mizpah.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Judges, 11:11.</i>
“<i>Jephtah sent messengers to the king of the Ammonites</i>” [11:12]. <i>Jephtah</i> sent <i>messengers</i> to the <i>king of Ammon.</i> Why do you want to wage war against my land? The king of Ammon responded: Israel have taken away my land when they left Egypt. Therefore, give it back to me peacefully. <i>Jephtah</i> again sent messengers to the <i>king of Ammon</i> and told them to say. Israel has not taken your land. Israel avoided <i>Edom</i> and the <i>king of Moab</i> and did not touch their land. Afterwards, Israel came to Sihon the king of the land of the Amorites. Sihon also did not want to allow them into his land. Sihon gathered his people in the city of <i>Jahaz</i> and Israel defeated them and took it over.
“<i>Now, the Lord, the God of Israel dispossessed</i>” [11:23]. Now you see that the Holy One has helped and has given the land of the Amorites to Israel, and you want to inherit this same land? Be certain that your idol will cause you to inherit the same land. We will hold on to what the Holy One will cause us to inherit.
“<i>While Israel was inhabiting Heshbon</i>” [11:26]. Israel dwelled in the city of Heshbon and its villages and in the city of <i>Aroer</i> and its villages and in all the cities near the city of <i>Arnon</i> for three hundred years since Joshua conquered them. Why have you not conquered these cities from Israel? What evil have I done you that you are now coming? The Holy One should judge between us. Ammon did not leave Israel alone.
“<i>The spirit of the Lord came upon Jephtah</i>” [11:29]. The spirit of God came upon Jephtah that he had a strong heart and he went against Ammon.
“<i>Jephtah made a vow to God, etc.</i>” [11:30]. Jephtah made a vow and said. If the Holy one will help me to defeat the people of Ammon, then I make a vow that I will bring the first thing that I will encounter from my house as a sacrifice to God, if I will come home to my house in peace.
“<i>Jephtah crossed over to the Ammonites</i>” [11:32]. The Holy One gave Ammon into the hands of Jephtah and he defeated them. Those who were left alive were subservient to and dependent on Israel. When Jephtah came home, his daughter came out to greet him with drums and dancing. She did not have a husband. Jephtah tore his clothes when his daughter came to meet him. He said to her: my dear daughter, I made a vow that whoever would come to me from my house, I would offer as a sacrifice. His daughter said to him. Let me wander on the mountains and let me mourn my virginity and my maidenhood for two months. Her father sent her for two months and she cried over her virginity and that she should die in this way. She returned home to her father who fulfilled his vow.
Some sages say that he did not slaughter his daughter as a sacrifice, but she cried and remained single all her life. She could not marry a husband since she was sanctified to God. If one wants to ask a question, Jephtah did say that which would encounter me first; I will bring it as a sacrifice. The explanation is that Jephtah said, if something that is appropriate for a sacrifice will greet me, I will slaughter it. If something will come that is not appropriate for a <i>sacrifice</i>, I will <i>sanctify</i> it and not slaughter it. That is why his daughter had to sit alone, without a husband, and the daughters of Israel lamented the fate of Jephtah’s daughter every year.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">According to Ginzberg, <i>Legends of the Jews</i>, 6: 203, n. 109, this idea first appears in medieval commentators, like Radak, Judges, 11:39–40.</i>
The <i>Rabbati</i> writes. There was Phinehas who could have <i>annulled the vow.</i> The explanation is that Jephtah was very arrogant and did not want to go to Phinehas. Phinehas was also arrogant and because of this Jephtah’s daughter was lost. The Holy One punished Jephtah in that his flesh fell off his body and Phinehas’ prophetic status was removed from him.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Genesis Rabbah,</i> 60.3; <i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Judges, <i>Remez</i>, 68.</i>

<b>[Micah, 5:6–6:8]</b>
“<i>The remnant of Jacob shall be in the midst of the many peoples, etc.</i>” [5:6]. It will be when <i>Gog and Magog</i> will come and Israel will have great troubles. They will be captives of the people of <i>Gog and Magog.</i> They will believe in God and in the Messiah. They will be a remnant and they will have endured enough troubles that they will be purified of sins, like pure silver. The remnant that will remain will be like dew that comes from God. So too, Israel hopes for the Holy One and not for a person who should help them and Israel will be redeemed through this merit.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Micah, 5:6.</i>
“<i>The remnant of Jacob shall be among the nations, etc.</i>” [5:7]. The nation that will subdue the city of Jerusalem will be numerous. Many Israelites will be under the domination of this nation and many Israelites will be killed. The remnant of Israel that will remain will be like a cow that finds itself in the hands of lions or other <i>wild animals</i> that are so strong that one cannot get out of their hands. They are the strongest of the wild animals. No person can help guard the sheep from their hands. So too were Israel in the hands of the nation of Gog and Magog. It was not possible to protect them with the people of Israel, since the people of Gog and Magog were very numerous.
“<i>Your hands shall prevail over your foes, and all your enemies shall be cut down</i>” [5:8]. The Holy One will but raise His hand against the great nation of Gog and Magog and they will all be cut down and destroyed.
“<i>On that day declares the Lord, etc.</i>” [5:9]. There will be great peace after that war of Gog and Magog. Israel will no longer need horses to fight wars with the nations.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Micah, 5:9.</i>
“<i>I will destroy the cities of your land and demolish all your fortresses</i>” [5:10].

“<i>I will destroy the sorcery you practice</i>” [5:11]. The Holy One said: I will remove the evil from your heart so that you will no longer practice sorcery. The Holy One will remove the evil inclination in the days of the Messiah. With this, there will be peace for Israel from all the nations. First, there will be peace from wars with the nations. Afterwards, there will be peace over the body. When the person contains the evil inclination, there is a war over the body. The evil inclination and the good inclination fight with each other. I will cut down your idols and your linden trees and I will destroy your enemies.
“<i>In anger and wrath I will wreak, etc.</i>” [5:14]. I will attack the nations that did not hear My commands with wrath and vengeance.
“<i>Hear what the Lord is saying, etc.</i>” [6:1]. God said: come and hear O Israel. I will have a judgment with you. Let heaven and earth hear which of us is just.

“<i>My people, what have I done to you, etc.</i>” [6:3]. The Holy One said: My people Israel, what evil have I done you or what difficult <i>commandments</i> have I commanded you that you have grown tired of Me? Say and let Me hear now.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Micah, 6:3.</i>
“<i>I brought you from the land of Egypt</i>” [6:4]. I have done much good for you. I took you out of Egypt through Moses, Aaron, and Miriam.

“<i>My people, remember, etc.</i>” [6:5]. The <i>Holy One</i> said: come here My people and remember how <i>Balak, king of Moab</i>, asked Balaam to curse you in the <i>wilderness.</i> Balaam said to Balak, the Holy One has forbidden me. I have no power curse them. He had to praise and bless you. Afterwards, you committed sexual sins in <i>Shittim.</i> You were very guilty and worthy of destruction, but I punished you lightly with a plague in which twenty-four thousand died.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers, 22:2–25:9.</i> I caused you to cross the Jordan with dry feet.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Joshua, 3:15–17.</i> I have only done charity and kindness with you.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Micah, 6:5.</i>
“<i>With what shall I approach the Lord, do homage to God, etc.</i>” [6:6]. If the person wants to say, with what offering should I come to God that He should become kindly disposed with it? With what shall I bow down and be humble before God? If I will bring good sacrifices, young calves, will God be pleased with a thousand sheep or with ten thousand vessels of oil? If I will give my <i>firstborn</i> son to forgive my <i>sins?</i>
“<i>He has told you O man, what is good and what the Lord requires, etc.</i>” [6:8]. The verse answers what the person should do for his sins. God tells you, you man, what is good and what does God desire from you? The Holy One does not desire your sheep or cows or much oil, but be pious and keep God’s <i>commandments.</i>
“<i>Only to do justice, etc.</i>” [6:8]. God wants from the person that he should do justice. That is to say, what is correct. Do <i>kindness and charity</i>, recognize the Holy One and love God in your heart and your modesty.
Our sages say: “<i>walk modestly with your God</i>” [6:8]. This means you should attend a <i>funeral</i> and help lead a <i>bride</i> to the wedding canopy. Furthermore, our sages said, “<i>walk modestly</i>” means that when someone does something wrong against his friend, he says, go and call people that they should go with you to ask forgiveness in the expectation that he will embarrass himself before many people. However, the Holy One only desires that one should repent and regret in his heart, so that no person should know about it and his sins are forgiven.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Micah, <i>Remez</i>, 555.</i>
We will write <i>midrashim.</i> The Rabbati writes about the verse in the <i>haftorah</i> “<i>my people, what have I done to you</i>” [6:3]. <i>Rabbi Samuel the son of Rabbi Nahman</i> said: the Holy One came to punish Israel in three cities. The nations heard that the Holy One wants to judge Israel and the nations became very joyous, They said: How can Israel withstand against their God? Now He will destroy them completely. When the Holy One saw that the nations were joyous, the Holy One changed His words to good, when He had the idea to punish them and judge them. The Holy One put aside the judgment and gave them everything good as soon as at the same time that He wanted to judge them. The nations were amazed and said: what is He doing that He absolves their sins and does only good for them? It is a parable. A woman brings her son to the <i>judges.</i> She has had him called and wishes to charge that he had beaten her. When the woman saw how the judges rule, very quickly to kill people who are guilty, the woman was afraid that the judges would also sentence her son to death. When the judges asked the woman, what did your son do to you? The woman said: when I carried him in my womb, he kicked very hard. The <i>judges</i> said: tell us what he is doing now from the time that he left your womb. The woman said: he has not done any evil. The <i>judges</i> said: we do not rule on what is done in the womb. The Holy One is like the mother. He is compassionate toward Israel, since they are like the children of the Holy One and He forgives their transgressions, even when they have committed sins.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Leviticus Rabbah,</i> 27.6; <i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Micah, <i>Remez</i>, 555.</i>
“<i>What hardship have I caused you?</i>” [6:3]. <i>Rabbi Berachiah</i> said: It is a parable. A king sent a letter to the nobles of his land. They immediately stood up on their feet, took off the hats from their heads and read the letter with fear. The Holy One says that <i>reading the Shema</i> is My letter and I did not tell you to stand up on your feet, but you should sit to read the Shema and do not need to take off your hat from your head. Concerning this, the verse says here, “<i>What hardship have I caused you? Answer Me</i>” [6:3].<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Micah, <i>Remez</i>, 554.</i>
“<i>And I will send before you, Moses and Aaron and Miriam</i>” [6:4]. The <i>Yelamdenu</i> writes. The Holy One said: come and see what the difference is between people and Me. When an earthly king sends noble messengers into the land, the people of the land immediately come and give them enough food. However, I, the Holy One, do not do so. I have sent Moses and Aaron and Miriam to redeem you and you did not feed them and they even gave you food. The <i>manna</i> was through the merit of Moses. The clouds were through the merit of Aaron. The well was through the merit of Miriam.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Micah, <i>Remez</i>, 554.</i>

<b>[I Kings, 18:46–19:21]</b>
“<i>The hand of the Lord had come upon Elijah, etc.</i>” [18:46]. The prophecy came upon Elijah and he girded his loins and he ran before <i>king Ahab.</i> Though he was an evildoer, he did this out of respect for the kingship. He had once been a king.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, I Kings, <i>Remez</i>, 217.</i>
“<i>Ahab told Jezebel</i>” [19:1]. <i>Ahab</i> told his wife that <i>Elijah</i> had killed all the <i>false prophets. Jezebel, the wife of Ahab</i>, sent a messenger to Elijah. Tomorrow, I will have you killed, like you did to the false prophets. Elijah saw that this was a danger. He went to <i>Beer Sheva</i> and left his servant in <i>Beer Sheva. Elijah</i> himself went into the wilderness and sat under a tree. He asked God that he should die. He said, am I better than my fathers?
“<i>He lay down and slept under a broom bush, etc.</i>” [19:5]. Elijah lay down and fell asleep. An angel came quickly, woke him, and said, wake up and eat. Elijah saw a cake baked on coals and a small jug of water. He ate and drank and lay down again. The angel came again and said to him, get up and eat. You have a long journey before you. Elijah immediately ate and drank and he went with this food that he had eaten this time, forty days and forty nights until he reached Mount <i>Horeb.</i> From that food, his body did not digest the food for the whole forty days and forty nights and he was satiated from this food. He came there, to a cave, and the word of the God came to him. The cave was the rock where the Holy One had spoken and appeared to Moses. The Holy One asked <i>Elijah.</i> What are you doing here? <i>Elijah</i> responded, I could not behold the <i>false prophets</i> and was zealous and killed them. This caused that I had to run away since they killed many good <i>prophets</i> through <i>Jezebel.</i> I have been left alone and they desired to kill me. Though more prophets survive, they are hidden in a cave. They are all <i>righteous</i>, but Elijah said, because they are hidden, it is as if they did not exist in the world and I alone am here. He said: You Elijah should go out and stand on the mountain before God, who will pass over you. There was a strong wind that was tearing out mountains and breaking strong rocks. The Holy One was not in the wind and the Holy One was also not in the great storm. Afterwards, there was a great fire and the Holy One was not in it. However, after the fire there was a low voice and Elijah understood that this was the Holy One. When Elijah heard this, he covered his face with his mantle and stood at the door of the cave. The Holy One said to Elijah: go home again to the city of <i>Damascus</i> and you should anoint <i>Hazael</i> as <i>king of Aram.</i>
“<i>You should also anoint Jehu the son of Nimshi, etc.</i>” [19:16]. You should make <i>Jehu</i> king over Israel and <i>Elisha the son of Shaphat</i> you should make a prophet in your stead. Since you desire to die, you must make another prophet.
Our sages say that Elijah spoke much evil against Israel because they had committed many sins. Therefore, the Holy One did not want to have Elijah as a prophet, and said that he should make Elisha a prophet. When Israel continued to commit sins, the Holy One did not want that one should speak ill against Israel, just like a father who covers the disgraces of his son.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, I Kings, <i>Remez</i>, 218.</i>
“<i>Whoever escapes from the sword of Hazael, Jehu will kill</i>” [19:17]. They should kill all those who worship foreign gods and those evildoers that Hazael will let live will be killed by Jehu, and Elisha will kill what Jehu lets live. One should help the other to clean out those who serve foreign gods.
“<i>I will leave in Israel seven thousand, etc.</i>” [19:18]. I will leave seven thousand in Israel, those who have not bowed down to the foreign gods and the mouth that has not kissed the foreign gods.
“<i>He set out from there and found Elisha, etc.</i>” [19:19]. Elijah found Elisha, who was plowing with twelve pair of oxen. There were eleven servants who were guiding eleven pair of oxen and Elisha was guiding the twelfth pair of oxen. Elijah took his mantle and threw it over Elisha. That is to say, he laid his garment over him. He wanted that he should go with him, and Elijah took back his garment.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, I Kings, 19:19.</i>
“<i>He left the oxen and he ran after Elijah</i>” [19:20]. Elisha left the oxen standing and ran after Elijah. He said to Elijah: I want to go and kiss my father and my mother and then I will follow you. Elijah said to him, go.
“<i>He turned back from him and took the yoke of oxen, etc.</i>” [19:21]. Elisha turned back, took the pair of oxen and slaughtered them. He did not want to take time to chop wood to cook the meat and he took the wood [of the yoke] and cooked the meat and fed it to the same people who had been plowing. These people accompanied him on his way. They ate and afterwards, Elisha followed Elijah and became his servant.

<b>[Jeremiah chapter 1:1–2:3]</b>
“<i>The words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah, etc.</i>” [1:1]. <i>Jeremiah</i> was descended from <i>Rahab the prostitute.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Megillah</i>, 14b.</i> The Holy One said that Jeremiah, who was descended from a prostitute, should come to punish Israel, who were descended from a very proper mother.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Jeremiah, 1:1.</i> That is, the son of a prostitute who has done good deeds should come and punish Israel who have done bad deeds and who have a good father and mother. Jeremiah came from a city of priests called <i>Anatot.</i>
“<i>The word of the Lord came to him, etc.</i>” [1:2]. The Holy One spoke to Jeremiah in the days of <i>Josiah the son of Amon the king of Judah.</i> This was also in the days of <i>Jehoiakim the son of Josiah the king of Judah.</i>
“<i>The word of the Lord came to me saying</i>” [1:4]. God said to me: “<i>before I created you in the womb, I knew you, etc.</i>” [1:4]. The Holy One said: before I created you in the womb, I knew you. Before you came out of your mother’s womb, I have prepared you to be a prophet. I will give you among the nations.
“<i>I said: Ah Lord God, etc.</i>” [1:6]. Jeremiah said: I shout, God You Lord, I do not know how to speak or how to punish a people, since I am a youth. We find the same thing with the <i>prophet Samuel</i>, who was a youth and was a prophet.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Jeremiah, 1:6.</i>
“<i>And the Lord said to me, do not say, etc.</i>” [1:7]. He said to me, you should not say that you are a youth, since I will send you to prophesy to Israel and also to the nations.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Jeremiah, 1:7.</i>
“<i>Do not fear them, for I am with you, etc.</i>” [1:8]. Jeremiah, you should not fear the nations, for I will protect you, so says God.
“<i>And the Lord put out His hand and touched, etc.</i>” [1:9]. God put His hand on my mouth and God said to me, I have put My words in your mouth.
“<i>See, today I appoint you over the nations</i>” [1:10]. I have made you an <i>overseer</i> over the nations and over Israel, for good and for evil. Everything that you will say will certainly happen to them. When you will say, they will be defeated, destroyed and dispersed, and to build and to plant. That is to say, what you will say, good and evil. It is shown in this verse that Jeremiah in his day prophesied much evil, but he proclaimed very few good things all of his days. That is why there are many terms of <i>defeat</i>, destruction and dispersion. However, when he proclaims good tidings, he only uses two terms, to build and to plant.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Jeremiah, 1:10.</i>
“<i>The word of the Lord came to me: What do you see Jeremiah? I said: I see a branch of an almond tree</i>” [1:11]. The word of God came to me and said: what do you see Jeremiah? I said: I see a branch of an almond tree. The branch was without blossoms or leaves and it was difficult to recognize the wood, but he recognized the branch through prophecy. That is why the Holy One said: you have seen well and correctly. If the branch had leaves and blossoms, it would not have been a novelty that he recognized it.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Jeremiah, 1:11.</i>
“<i>You have seen right, for I am watchful, over My word to bring it to pass</i>” [1:12]. God said: you have seen correctly. I will hasten to soon fulfill My words to punish the nations. Just like a branch of almond wood blossoms before all the other trees, so will the trials and tribulations come upon Israel.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Jeremiah, 1:12.</i> The Midrash writes that when the almond begins to blossom, it blossoms for twenty-one days and the fruit is ripe.

“<i>And the word of the Lord came to me a second time, etc.</i>” [1:13]. God said to me a second time: what do you see? I said: a hot, steaming pot, and the face of the pot was to the north. That is, the rim of the pot on the side where one pours out from the pot, this is called its face. That is to say, from the north indicates that the evil and the steam from the pot comes from the north. This is the land of Babylon. They have committed transgressions and the pot is steaming because of their transgressions.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Jeremiah, 1:13.</i>
“<i>The Lord said to me: from the north shall disaster break loose upon all the inhabitants of the land</i>” [1:14]. The Holy One said: the troubles from the north will be opened on all the inhabitants of the earth.
“<i>For I am summoning all the peoples of the kingdoms of the north, declares the Lord</i>” [1:15]. I will implant a thought in all the families of the evil people, and to the kings that they should come to Jerusalem. Just as I might call them to come, so will I give into their hearts that each king should place his throne near the gates of Jerusalem, and near the walls and there will be kings over the cities of Judah.
“<i>And I will argue My case against them, for all of their wickedness, etc.</i>” [1:16]. I will argue my case with them about the evil that they committed by leaving Me. They have offered incense to foreign gods and have left Me.
“<i>So you, gird up your loins, etc.</i>” [1:17]. You <i>Jeremiah</i>, strongly gird up your loins, stand up and speak to them everything that I have commanded you. You should have no fear before them. That is to say, do not be afraid and you will believe that I can protect you. However, if you will be afraid, then I will make you fearful.
“<i>I will make you this day a city, etc.</i>” [1:18]. I will make you a strong city and an iron pillar and a bronze wall, for the whole land and the <i>kings of Judah</i>, to their princes, and the whole people. You should not be afraid of any person.
“<i>They will attack you, but they will not overcome you, etc.</i>” [1:19]. The nations will fight with you, but they will not be able to do anything to you, since I am with you, to protect you. Thus says the Lord. That is to say, they will wage war with you. They will say that your prophecy is not true.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Jeremiah, 1:19.</i>
“<i>The word of the Lord came to me saying, etc.</i>” [2:1]. The word of God came to me. You should go and should proclaim in the ears of Jerusalem. That is to say, just like you would speak with the city of Jerusalem, to punish the people of the city of Jerusalem.
“<i>I remember the devotion of your youth, your love as a bride</i>” [2:2]. Say to Israel, just as I would bring <i>troubles</i> upon them because of their <i>evil deeds</i>, but I will in no way destroy them completely. I will also pay those nations who have troubled Israel and will bring troubles upon them. I remember the good deeds that Israel did for me in its youth, during the <i>giving of the Torah.</i> They are compared to a bride and the Holy One to a groom. This is the meaning of “<i>your love as a bride</i>,” the love of a bride at the <i>giving of the Torah</i> at Mount Sinai.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Jeremiah, 2:2.</i>
“<i>How you followed me in the wilderness, in a land not sown</i>” [2:2]. I remember the good deeds that Israel did. They followed me in the wilderness, where no grain, fruit, or grass grows and they relied on me.
“<i>Israel was holy to the Lord, the first fruits of his harvest</i>” [2:3]. Israel is compared to <i>holiness.</i> Just like <i>terumah</i>, <i>which is holy</i> and an Israelite should not eat it, but only the <i>priests.</i> If an Israelite eats the <i>terumah</i>, he is strongly punished. In the same way, God will punish whoever persecutes Israel. They are the first fruits, that grow first and no person should eat of them before they bring the <i>Omer offering.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Jeremiah, 2:3.</i>
“<i>All who ate of it were held guilty; disaster befell them, says the Lord</i>” [2:3]. All those who will eat from it will be punished with evil. This will come upon all those who do evil to Israel, so says God.
The Rabbati writes about the verse in the haftorah “<i>before I created you in the womb, I knew you</i>” [1:5]. What a child in its mother’s womb will become, is recognized, as the verse says, “<i>the children struggled in her womb</i>” [Genesis, 25:22]. When Rebecca went past a <i>house of study</i> where Torah was being studied, Jacob wanted to get out of his mother’s body. When Rebecca went past a <i>pagan temple</i> where foreign gods were worshiped, Esau wanted to get out.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Genesis Rabbah,</i> 63.6; <i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Jeremiah, <i>Remez</i> 261.</i>

If someone would tell her that today is <i>Yom Kippur,</i> and but the desire did not go away and she had to eat or she would miscarry the child, then she must eat on <i>Yom Kippur.</i> The child that was born to that woman was an evildoer. Another story occurred to a woman who also wanted to eat on <i>Yom Kippur. Rabbi</i> [Judah the Prince] said: one should tell her that today is <i>Yom Kippur.</i> As soon as she was told that today was <i>Yom Kippur</i> she no longer had any desire to eat.

Masei

<b>[Jeremiah, 2:4–28]</b>
“<i>Hear the word of the Lord, O House of Jacob, every clan of the house of Israel</i>” [2:4]. Come and hear the words of God.
“<i>Thus said the Lord: What did your fathers find, etc.</i>” [2:5]. What wrong did your fathers see in Me that you served foreign gods from the time that you came to the land of Israel. You did not say, where is God who took us out of Egypt and led them in the wilderness where nothing grew and where no person had ever traveled? From the wilderness I brought you into the land of Israel, into a land that has good fruit. You have defiled this good land with worship of foreign gods.
“<i>The priests never said, where is God</i>” [2:8]. The priests did not say, where is your God? The scholars did not teach Torah to them, but they followed false prophets who uttered false prophecies. That is why I will still punish you with proper prophets, that you should be pious before I will expel you, and I will do the same with you children, to punish them.
“<i>Cross over to the islands of the Kittim and look</i>” [2:10]. The Holy One said: send messengers to the nations called Kittim, the Romans who bow down to the water and the Tatars who bow down to the fire. Even though those who worship and bow down to the fire know that water extinguishes the fire, yet each one remains with their own god. They do not exchange them, as you did with Me.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Jeremiah, <i>Remez</i>, 266.</i>
“<i>Has any nation changed its gods and they are</i>” [2:11]. The Holy One said: where is there a nation that exchanges its foreign gods, even though they are not gods to that nation? That is to say, they know well that it is no god; it does not help them when they call on it. However, Israel had a true God and exchanged Me for a foreign god that is nothing.
“<i>Be appalled, O heavens at this</i>” [2:12]. The Holy One said that it would be just that the heavens should be destroyed because of the great evil that you do.
“<i>My people have done a twofold wrong, they have forsaken Me</i>” [2:13]. He said: They have done two evil things to Me. If they had exchanged their God for another god, this would have only been one evil that they would have done, but how appropriate is it to change? However, now they have done evil in that they have exchanged Me for a god that is nothing. I, God, am a fountain that comes from the depths of the earth, which never ceases to flow. That is to say, I am eternal. However, they have taken a god that is a river of water that dries up when a little heat comes. So are their foreign gods.
“<i>Is Israel a bondman? Is he a home-born slave? etc.</i>” [2:14]. The Holy One said: Is Israel like a slave that is born from a bondswoman? He is called Israel my son, the firstborn. Why has he become so humbled and ashamed?
“<i>Lions have roared over him, have raised their cries, etc.</i>” [2:15]. That is to say, Israel asks why have they become so humbled that the strong nations shout over them, like the lions and wild animals and they destroy his land. Their cities are desolate and nobody is in them.
“<i>Those too, in Noph and Tahpanhes, etc.</i>” [2:16]. Also the city called <i>Noph</i> and the other city called <i>Tahpanhes</i>, from the land of Egypt, are the two cities that Israel relied upon that they should help them. That is why the prophet says, even these cities that you relied upon will also bash in your head.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Jeremiah, 2:4.</i>
“<i>See, that is the price you paid, etc.</i>” [2:17]. The prophet responded: why do you think things are so bad for you? You have left the Holy One who taught you the right way. That is the cause of your troubles.
“<i>What, then, is the good of going to Egypt, etc.</i>” [2:18]. What do you want to have from Egypt? That they should help you? You desired to drink from the river Nile in Egypt and the like. You desire help from the king of Assyria that is of no use to you.
“<i>Let your misfortunes reprove you, etc.</i>” [2:19]. It would be just for Me to punish the evil deeds that you did. You should no longer do the evil deeds since you see well that evil comes to you because of the evil deeds. You have left the Holy One and no fear of Me has entered your heart. So says the Lord God.
“<i>Long ago you broke your yoke, etc.</i>” [2:20]. The Holy One said to Israel: long ago, I broke your yoke when you were captive in Egypt and the like. Similarly, in all times I tear your yoke bands.
“<i>And said, I will not work, on every, etc.</i>” [2:20]. The Holy One said: when I broke your yoke, that same time you promised me, that you want to be pious and will no longer transgress the commandments. However, you were not amenable. You made for yourself a foreign god from one mountain to the other mountain. You placed a foreign god and a linden tree as a foreign god. Just like a prostitute who engages in illicit sex with a man, and the next day with another man. You are also like this.
“<i>I planted you with noble vines</i>” [2:21]. You have good fathers and mothers. These are <i>Abraham, Isaac and Jacob</i> and their wives. However, you are not worthy of them. You have become the complete opposite.
“<i>Though you wash</i>” [2:22]. The Holy One said: if you would wash yourself with soap, that is to say, you will repent. Nonetheless, I will still punish you because your sins are great.
“<i>How can you say, I am not defiled</i>” [2:23]. The Holy One said to Israel: how can you say that you are not <i>impure</i> with transgressions and have not worshiped foreign gods? Come and hear what you have done near the house of Peor. You have worshiped <i>foreign gods</i> and pursued illicit sex there. You still do the same things today. You are like a young horse or a young camel that one wants to teach it to work. They go back and forth. So too are you also Israel.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Jeremiah, 2:23.</i>
“<i>A wild ass used to the desert</i>” [2:24]. You Israel are like a wild ass that is used to living in the desert.
“<i>The desires of her soul</i>” [2:24]. When she desires, she opens her mouth and she sniffs the wind.
“<i>Whose passion none can restrain</i>” [2:24]. When she arrives in the city where she desires to eat, nobody can deter her and she does not grow weary of what she desires.
“<i>In her season, they</i>’<i>ll find her</i>” [2:24]. One cannot capture the elephant, except for one month a year. It sleeps the whole month and during that time one can capture it. Israel are similarly wild. One cannot capture them, except for one month. This is the <i>month of Ab.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Jeremiah, 2:24.</i>
“<i>Save your foot from going bare</i>” [2:25]. The prophets have come to you and have told you not to go a long distance. You will tear your shoes on the way and you will go barefoot for long distances. You will have to go barefoot, without shoes, and you will be very thirsty from walking such long distances. You will not find any water to drink. That is to say, the prophet who tells you not to rely that the nations will help you. You will have to go a long way before you come to them. Your shoes will be torn because of it. This will cause you to go barefoot. You will have to be thirsty, since you will not find any water on the way. Therefore, it is better to stay home and rely on the Holy One and avoid going barefoot and your throat from going thirsty. That is, you should save the troubles, remain at home and rely on the Holy One. However, you Israel did not turn there and thought that exile would not come upon you and you followed your <i>foreign gods</i>, saying, I love them.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Jeremiah, 2:25.</i>
“<i>Like a thief chagrined when he is caught, etc.</i>” [2:26]. Israel is shamed, just like a person who was considered <i>trustworthy</i> and became a thief. He is very embarrassed because previously he was not considered to be a <i>thief.</i> However, when someone has been a thief for a long time, he is not embarrassed at all when he is discovered in the midst of a theft. Israel has been embarrassed like a thief. Previously, her <i>kings, nobles, priests and prophets</i> should have been embarrassed since they were considered to be pious, since they observed the commandments, but they worshipped <i>foreign gods.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Jeremiah, 2:26.</i>
“<i>They said to wood, you are my Father</i>” [2:27]. They worship the wood and say, you are my father. They say to the stone, you are my mother. You have given birth to me and they turn their back to God. When they hurt, they call upon God almighty.
“<i>Where are those gods you made for yourself?</i>” [2:28]. The Holy One responded and said: where is your god that you relied on? Let him help you when you are in pain.
“<i>For your gods have become, O Judah, as many as your towns</i>” [2:28]. The prophet said: You have as many foreign gods as there were cities in the land of <i>Judah.</i> That is to say, there were foreign gods in each city.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Jeremiah, 2:28.</i>
The <i>Pesikta</i> writes: There are four who hear what one says. There are some who listen to what they are told and are damaged by it, as we find concerning <i>Adam</i>, who listened to his wife and ate of the apple. He was damaged by this in that he had to die. We find another one that listened and was rewarded for it, as we find concerning Abraham. The Holy One said: “<i>whatever Sarah tells you, do as she says</i>” [Genesis, 21:12]. You should listen and do what Sarah will tell you. Abraham was rewarded for listening to his wife. The third one is someone who did not listen and was rewarded. We find this concerning <i>Joseph the Righteous.</i> It is written, “<i>he did not yield to her request to lie beside he</i>r” [Genesis, 39:10]. He did not want to listen to his master’s wife, to sleep with her. The Holy One rewarded him well for this. The fourth are Israel who did not want to listen to what the prophets said, as the verse says; “<i>yet they did not listen or give ear</i>” [Jeremiah, 7:24]. Israel did not want to listen to the prophets and the Holy One killed them.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Pesikta de-Rav Kahana</i>, 14.2; <i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Jeremiah, <i>Remez</i> 264.</i>
“<i>Thus says the Lord, what did your fathers find, etc.</i>” [2:5]. <i>Rabbi Isaac</i> said: The verse teaches us that when a person is in the synagogue and the <i>Torah scroll</i> is being read, and he goes out and leaves the people and goes away. The Holy One said: What do you have against Me? What injustice have you seen that you are leaving Me?<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Jeremiah, <i>Remez</i> 265.</i>
It is a great sin for someone to leave the synagogue when the <i>Torah scroll</i> is open. A person leaving the synagogue is like what <i>Jeremiah</i> described and why Israel was punished in his days. There were three who punished Israel at one time. First there was <i>Jeremiah</i>, who <i>preached</i> and punished Israel publicly in the streets. There was also <i>Zephaniah</i> in his times who also punished Israel in all the synagogues. The third one was <i>Huldah</i>, a woman who punished the women. She was also a <i>prophetess</i> and yet Israel did not want to be pious.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Pesikta Rabbati, <i>piska</i> 26.</i>
The <i>Mechilta</i> writes: “<i>who led us through the wilderness</i>” [2:6]. God who led the Israelites out of the wilderness, which was full of large snakes that were thick as pillars, and was eight hundred miles long. The Holy One killed them all for the sake of Israel that they should all pass through in peace. Now you have all forgotten this. There is a snake called <i>Akas.</i> When it sees a bird flying in the sky with its eyes, the bird must fall down. The <i>Akas</i> causes a poison to come out of its eyes that paralyzes the bird, just by looking at it. From here we can see what kind of great kindness the Holy One did for Israel, that He killed the snakes in the wilderness before Israel. <i>Rabbi Abba</i> said: a person in the land of Israel once went up on a mountain. He saw a snake lying that was sleeping. The snake did not see him and out of great fear, his hair fell out. They called him the plucked one, since his hair never grew back for the rest of his life. If the snake had looked at him, then all of that person’s organs would have fallen apart.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mekhilta de-Rabbi Ishmael, Beshallah</i>, <i>va-Yosa</i> 1.</i>

<b>[Isaiah, 1:1–27]</b>
“<i>The prophecies of Isaiah</i>” [1:1]. The <i>prophet Isaiah</i> prophesied about Israel and about Jerusalem. He punished Israel for their transgressions that they should be pious and that Jerusalem should not be destroyed. He says: listen, heaven and understand, O earth. The Holy One had said to Moses: Say unto Israel that they should see the heaven that I have created to serve you. See if the heaven has altered its service and if the sun stopped shining or giving you light. The sun rejoices in its going out to serve you, as the verse says, “<i>like a groom going out from his wedding</i>” [Psalms, 19:6]. Look at the earth and see if it has changed from serving you. Someone sows a little rye or wheat and does it not grow? You, Israel, need to learn from heaven and earth. They serve as the Holy One commanded them, even though they will have no reward from their service. Even more so, Israel will be punished if they do not observe their commandments.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Isaiah, <i>Remez</i>, 387.</i>
<i>Rabbi Banah</i> said: when a person has done something evil, the <i>witnesses</i> are the first ones to begin to punish him and then all of Israel helps to kill him. In this way, <i>Isaiah the prophet</i> said: you, heaven and earth. I take you as witnesses that when Israel will sin, you should punish them first. The heaven should not give its dew or rain and the earth should not cause things to grow.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Isaiah, <i>Remez</i>, 387.</i>
“<i>Hear, O heavens and listen, O earth, etc.</i>” [1:2]. The <i>prophet Isaiah</i> says to the heaven, listen and to the earth, understand. However, <i>Moses Our Teacher</i> said to the heaven, understand and to the earth he said, listen to me. Moses Our Teacher was close to the heaven and that is why he says to the heaven, understand what I say. To the earth he says, listen to me. However, the <i>prophet Isaiah</i> was very far from the heaven. Therefore, he says to the heaven, hear me. When a person is far from his friend, he must shout, hear me. However, Isaiah was close to the earth. Therefore, he says to the earth, understand my words.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Isaiah, 1:2.</i>
Why did they take heaven and earth as witnesses? It is just like someone who punishes his friend in front of his relative and says to him, your relative is present. Therefore, I am warning you not to do it anymore. So too, the person was created from heaven and earth and they are the person’s relatives. The soul was given from heaven and the body is from the earth. Therefore, Moses and Isaiah say to Israel, we are warning you before witnesses and before your relatives, be pious. Another explanation is that they took heaven and earth as witnesses. They thought that if we took people as witnesses, the people would die. However, heaven and earth are eternal and the person cannot run away from the earth. Thus, the witness can always be found and the heavens write down what transgressions are done, as the verse says, “<i>heaven will expose his iniquity</i>” [Job, 20:27]. This means that heaven exposes his sins and the earth tells what kinds of sins the person committed, as the verse says, “<i>earth will rise up against him</i>” [Job, 20:27].<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Isaiah, <i>Remez</i>, 387.</i>
Another explanation is that the Torah was given in heaven and on the earth. The Holy One lowered the heaven to Mount Sinai and gave the Torah through heaven and earth, so that they should not transgress the Torah.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Isaiah, <i>Remez</i>, 387.</i>
Another explanation is a parable. Reuben gave a pledge to Simeon to guard and Reuben died. The son of Reuben comes to the house of Simeon all the time and always honors both Simeon and his wife. People say to the son of Reuben, why do you honor the wife of Simeon? The son responds: I do not know where my pledge is, with Simeon or his wife. That is why I honor both, in the hope that the pledge will be well hidden by whoever has it. Moses and Isaiah say the same thing. I will die, but I do not know where my soul will end up. Will it ascend to the heaven or will it remain on the earth? Therefore, I honor heaven and earth and shout at both of them, wherever my soul will wind up, you should be warned. However, the Holy One answers Moses, your soul will be under the <i>Throne of Glory</i> in heaven.
Our sages say in <i>tractate Megillah.</i> A woman who is chaste is worthy that children who will be kings and prophets will come from her, as we find concerning <i>Tamar.</i> She was chaste and King David and <i>Isaiah the prophet</i> were descended from her. Tamar was very chaste and did not show her face to her father-inlaw, Judah. That is why Judah did not recognize her, that she was his daughter-inlaw. Tamar’s husband died and she went to her father-in-law, Judah. He knew her and slept with her. King David and other prophets were descended from her.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Megillah,</i> 10b.</i>
“<i>I reared children</i>” [1:2]. God said: I have raised Israel with Torah and good deeds, like someone raises a child. I have elevated them with My Shekhinah and they have left my Torah and have angered Me.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Isaiah, 1:2.</i>
“<i>An ox knows its owner</i>” [1:3]. Isaiah said: an ox that has no understanding still recognizes its master, where he has been fed. It returns to its master. However, Israel who have understanding and have everything good from the Holy One, they do not want to recognize Me. The cause of all this is that they did not want to study the Torah.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Isaiah, <i>Remez</i>, 387.</i>
Our sages say in the <i>Talmud</i>, [tractate] <i>Makkot.</i> When someone received thirty-nine lashes, they used a single strap from a donkey or an ox, and they whipped him with that strap. The Holy One says that the ox or the donkey that recognize their master should come and pay the one who does not recognize the goodness of his master.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Makkot,</i> 23a; <i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Isaiah, <i>Remez</i>, 387.</i>
Concerning this, <i>Sefer Rabbati</i> writes. The Holy One said to Israel: you should also learn from the ox and the steer. There was an incident regarding <i>Elijah.</i> Israel was worshiping foreign gods and there were five hundred false prophets. Elijah said to them: choose a pair of oxen that are twins that were raised together and ate together in one crib. Throw lots for the oxen, one to God and the other to your foreign god that is called <i>Baal.</i> When they cast the lots, Elijah took the ox that fell to him and the ox came to him immediately and wanted to be brought as a sacrifice to God. Elijah said that he wanted to bring a sacrifice and the false prophets should sacrifice an ox to their foreign god, <i>Baal.</i> No fire should be brought, but each one should shout to his God, whoever will bring fire from heaven on their sacrifice, that God would be considered a true God. However, the ox that belonged to the foreign god did not want to be a sacrifice for the foreign god. The five hundred false prophets gathered and wanted to bring the ox to the foreign god. They could not even budge it a foot. Elijah shouted at the ox, go with them. The ox responded, before all the <i>false prophets</i>, and said. I and my colleague, the other ox, lay in one womb of our mother. We lay in one stall and my colleague should go to the Holy One and I should go to the foreign god and anger my creator? Elijah said to the ox: go! Through you, the name of the Holy One will be sanctified. Everyone will see that their foreign god does not have the power to bring down fire from heaven. The ox responded: I swear that I will not go of my own will, but you Elijah must hand me over to them, as the verse says, “<i>they took the bull that was given to them</i>” [I Kings, 18:26]. This means, they took the ox that Elijah gave them. Therefore, the Holy One said to Israel: you should learn from the ox. The Holy One also said, “<i>makes us wiser than the birds of the sky</i>” [Job, 35:11]. This means, you Israel should learn what the birds did with Elijah who ran away into the wilderness from <i>king Ahab.</i> The birds, called ravens, brought him meat and bread from the house of <i>Jehoshaphat</i> and the birds did not want to go to the house of Ahab to take meat or bread, since there was an foreign god in the house of Ahab and so that the righteous Elijah should not derive benefit from the foreign god.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Numbers Rabbah,</i> 23.9.</i>
We also find a story concerning <i>Phinehas ben Yair</i>, who went with his donkey and came to an inn. His donkey did not want to eat any oats or grain because the tithes were not taken from it. Therefore, the prophet Isaiah said that an ox knows its master and a donkey recognizes its stall. It was used to only eat grain from which the tithes had been given.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Hullin,</i> 7a-b.</i>
However, you Israel, however, did not want to be pious. Isaiah said: your land will be devastated and foreign nations will eat your goods. The city of Jerusalem will be like a hut in the vineyard. When the wine is finished, the hut stands empty and desolate. However, the Holy One, because He wants to have Israel below on the earth and the angels in Heaven, therefore, He allows Israel to remain. The Holy One said: what are your sacrifices worth if your intentions are not good? Who desires from you that you come into My house to pray? The sages said that prayer is better than sacrifices.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Berakhot,</i> 32b.</i>

“<i>Where righteousness dwelled</i>” [1:21]. <i>Rabbi Judah bar Simon</i> said: no person spent a night in Jerusalem and had a sin, since the sin that he committed during the day was forgiven by the evening sacrifice and a sin committed at night, the early morning sacrifice forgave their sins.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Isaiah, <i>Remez</i>, 390.</i>
However, now Isaiah says, the city of Jerusalem is full of murderers. Your silver is false and your drinks are mixed with water. The <i>judges</i> take bribes to rule falsely. No orphan is listened to in order to judge properly, and a widow cannot receive <i>justice. Rabbi Levi</i> said: an incident occurred that a woman brought a silver candelabrum to the <i>judge</i> and the other person who was her opponent, brought a golden vessel to the <i>judge.</i> The woman shouted at the <i>judge:</i> my judgment should shine like the silver candelabrum. The <i>judge</i> said to her: the gold has covered the silver.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Isaiah, <i>Remez</i>, 391.</i>
When someone first came to the <i>judge</i>, the <i>judge</i> told him to chop wood for him today and tomorrow, to bring him water. Thus, he had spent his money before he even had his case heard. A widow encountered him and asked him how it went. He said: I spent my money and was not able to have <i>justice.</i> The widow said to him. When a man cannot receive <i>justice</i>, even more so how will I, a poor widow, receive justice? The widow turned back immediately.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Isaiah, <i>Remez</i>, 391.</i>
“<i>Zion will be saved in the judgment</i>” [1:27]. However, when you Israel dispense proper justice to the poor, like to the rich, the city of Zion will be redeemed and Israel will again enter it when they will give charity. Amen, so may it be His will.

“<i>A voice rings out: Proclaim! Another asks what shall I proclaim?</i>” [40:6]. A <i>prophetic voice</i> goes forth and calls to the prophet. The prophet says, what shall I prophesy? The voice of God responds: I say that all the people that come with <i>Gog and Magog</i> will be destroyed, like a grass that soon withers.

“<i>Ascend a lofty mountain, O herald of joy to Zion, raise your voice with power</i>” [40:9]. When a person wants to make his voice heard, he goes to a high mountain and his voice is heard very far. Therefore, the <i>prophet</i> said: go to a high mountain and proclaim the good news to the city of <i>Zion</i> and Jerusalem. That is to say, Jerusalem and Zion are the primary city of the land of Israel. Therefore, they should further report the good news of the Redemption to the other cities of the land of Israel and do not be afraid to proclaim the good news that God has come to you.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Isaiah, 40:9.</i>

“<i>His reward is with Him, etc.</i>” [40:10]. The reward of the person who relies on the Holy One is that He will take him out of exile.

“<i>Who measured the waters with the hollow of His hand, etc.</i>” [40:12]. If the nations will wonder how it can be that the Holy One should redeem Israel from the exile, since Israel have been strongly captive in our hands for many years. Therefore, he says here, that all of this is nothing new for the Holy One. He measured the water of the whole world in the hollow of His hand. He created the heaven with the span of His hands. He measured the earth with His great measure and divided the world into three parts. One third is the earth where people live. One third of the world is completely water. One third is the wilderness where no people live.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Isaiah, 40:12.</i>

“<i>The nations are but a drop in a bucket, reckoned as dust on a balance</i>” [40:15]. The nations are all for the Holy One like a drop of water in a bucket, that is not noticed, and a bit of dust in the scales that one can blow away.
“<i>The coastlands He lifts like motes</i>” [40:15].

You want to say, heaven forbid, that the Holy One is the same. You should not say this, to compare your foreign gods to our God. Your god is an image that a person made. Concerning this, the verse says, “<i>the idol? A woodworker shaped it, and a smith overlaid it with gold</i>” [40:19].

“<i>Do you not know? Have you not heard, etc.</i>” [40:21]. The prophet said: how can you be so mistaken about your foreign gods? It is no god that can help you. Therefore, serve our God. You have intelligence and can understand who is Lord of the world.

The Holy One is like a person who sits very high and sees everything easily from a distance.
“<i>Who spreads out the heavens like a gauze, etc.</i>” [40:22]. The Holy One spreads out the heaven like a person spreads out a tent, so that they should sit under it.
“<i>He brings potentates to naught, makes rulers of the earth as nothing</i>” [40:23]. The person is a minister and considers himself high and important and is arrogant.

A storm wind will quickly carry them away as easily as straw.
“<i>To whom, then, can you liken Me, to whom can I be compared, says the Holy One</i>” [40:25]. The Holy One said: to what will you compare Me, that I should be compared to it?
“<i>Lift up your eyes and see who created these</i>” [40:26]. The Holy One said: lift up your eyes to heaven and look at the stars that I created. You will see My <i>power and strength</i>, and how it is limitless. However, the Holy One knows the number of the stars and he calls each star by its name. Every blade of grass on the earth has a star in heaven that causes that grass to grow.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Genesis Rabbah,</i> 10.6.</i>

We will write what the <i>Sifre</i> writes about the <i>haftorah</i> [verse], “<i>let every valley be raised</i>” [40:4].

The Holy One says: I will soon destroy it and remove it from the world, as the verse says, “<i>every valley shall be raised</i>” [40:4]. Each valley will be raised. Israel said to the Holy One: The witnesses, who testified about my sins, are the heaven and earth. I see them before me and I ashamed before them, since they mock me. The Holy One says: I will cause them to be destroyed, as it is written, “<i>I am creating a new heaven and a new earth</i>” [Isaiah, 65:17]. Israel said to the Holy One: my name is still known, that I have committed sins. The Holy One responded: I will change your name, as the verse says, “<i>you shall be called by a new name</i>” [Isaiah, 62:2]. Israel said: the name of the foreign gods is still found.

How did the Holy One immerse himself, since all the bodies of water are too small for Him to immerse Himself, as the verse says, “<i>who measured the waters with the hollow of his hand</i>” [40:12]. Who measured the waters in the whole world with one hand like the Holy One measured it? <i>Rabbi Abahu</i> responded: He immersed Himself in fire, as the verse says, “<i>the Lord is coming with fire</i>” [Isaiah, 66:15]. “<i>All the nations are as naught in His sight</i>” [40:17].<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Sanhedrin,</i> 39a; <i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Isaiah, <i>Remez</i>, 445.</i>

The Holy One said: do not be afraid. They are like a horse that I will soon destroy, as the verse says, “<i>for the horse of Pharaoh came</i>” [Exodus, 15:19]. That is to say, a horse and the like. When the Messiah will come, <i>Gog and Magog</i> will come with a large multitude.

<b>[Isaiah, 49:14–51:3]</b>

“<i>Can a woman forget her baby or disown her child, etc.</i>” [49:15]. The Holy One responded: is there a woman who forgets her young small children? She thinks much about small children and cannot even eat. A mother has all of her thoughts on her small child. Even though one can even find some women who forget their small children, but I, the Holy One, will never forget you.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Isaiah, 49:15.</i>

“<i>You shall don them all like jewels, etc.</i>” [49:18]. When Israel will gather to come to you they will be adorned like a bride, with beautiful children.
“<i>As for your ruins and desolate places and your land laid waste, etc.</i>” [49:19]. The Holy One said: you worry about your cities that are now desolate. A time will come when these cities will be inhabited with many people, so that it would be very crowded to live there. I will move the enemies that tried to swallow you far away from you.
“<i>The children will say in your ears, etc.</i>” [49:20]. You should not worry about your children that you have lost. You will be united with them. A time will come when your children who were dispersed will say it is crowded in the city. Go to the side a bit; let me sit. It will be so crowded because of numerous people.
“<i>You will say to yourself, who bore these for me, etc.</i>” [49:21]. You will say: Who bore all these for me? I was alone, dispersed, exiled, finished and who raised all these? I remained alone. From where do all these come here?
“<i>Thus said the Lord God, etc.</i>” [49:22]. Thus says the Holy One: I will raise My hand to the people and I will also raise My banner to gather them. The nations will bring your children in the <i>folds</i> of their garments. That is to say, they will carry Israel in the bosom of their garments to the city of Jerusalem and the nations will carry Israel on their shoulders to the city of Jerusalem.
“<i>Kings will tend your children, etc.</i>” [49:23]. The kings will raise you and the wives of ministers will nurse your children and they will bow down twice to you. The nations will lick the dust of your feet with their mouths, out of love. You will know that I am God and those who trust in Me will not be shamed.
“<i>Can spoil be taken from a warrior, etc.</i>” [49:24]. The nations said: from where did it come that Israel was taken out of our hands? We were <i>mighty warriors</i> and it is difficult to take out of the hands of a <i>warrior.</i> In addition, we properly captured Israel to be our captives. How is it that they ran away from us?<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Isaiah, 49:24.</i>
“<i>Thus says the Lord, etc.</i>” [49:25]. The Holy One responded to the nations. The first thing that you said, that you are <i>warriors.</i> I am much stronger than you are. You said that you have taken Israel justly. This is not true. You have done everything through robbery. Therefore, you will have to release Israel. I will fight with those who fight with you and I will help your children.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Isaiah, 49:25.</i>
“<i>I will make your oppressors eat their own flesh, etc.</i>” [49:26]. The Holy One said to Israel. I will make your oppressors and those who were a thorn to you eat their flesh and drink their blood like a sweet wine. All the people will know that I am God your helper and your redeemer, strong Jacob.
“<i>Thus said the Lord, where is the book, etc.</i>” [50:1]. The prophet said: you should not think that I have driven you away for so long that you have been exiled forever, like a man who drives away his wife and gives her a <i>divorce</i> that she should remain away forever. I have not done this since I have not given you a divorce. Show me, where is the divorce that I sent your mother away? Or, who is the person who lent Me money for you? Who is the person to whom I sold you? You were sold into the hands of the nations because your sins. That is, the sins are the money for which you were sold and the repentance that you will do will be the money with which you will be redeemed from the nations.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Isaiah, 50:1.</i>
“<i>Why, when I came, was no one there, etc.</i>”? [50:2]. The Holy One said: you delay the <i>redemption</i> yourself. I am prepared for you to begin your repentance. Why does the exile tarry so long? I came and desired to see if there was one person who desired repentance. However, there was no person there. I called the people to repent and nobody responded and nobody remembered that I have allowed you to remain in exile for so long. Is it because I would not have the strength to redeem you from the exile? However, it is not so, but your sins caused all this.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Isaiah, 50:2.</i>
“<i>With a mere rebuke I dry up the sea, etc.</i>” [50:2]. The Holy One said: why should you say that I do not have the strength to redeem you from the great <i>exile.</i> Come here and see, when I will scold the sea, the water would dry up, as I did at the <i>Sea of Reeds</i> when Israel went out of Egypt. I only scolded the water that it should dry up and Israel went through the <i>great sea.</i> If I wanted to, I could make a desert of the great rivers, as I did with the <i>Jordan</i> and Israel crossed with dry feet. Many great rivers emptied into the Jordan and they all became dry and all the fish died from thirst and rotted.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Isaiah, 50:2.</i>
“<i>I clothe the skies in blackness and make their raiment sackcloth</i>” [50:3]. The Holy One said: I have done even more in Egypt. I clothed the skies in black. That is to say, I caused three days of darkness in Egypt. And sackcloth over heaven. That is to say, they should not shine and therefore see that I can perform wonders. How could you think that I could not take you out of the exile?<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Isaiah, 50:3.</i>
“<i>The Lord God gave me, etc.</i>” [50:4]. The prophet said: The Lord God has given me a good tongue, to speak sharply, and to explain the word of God in a timely way. Whoever desires to learn the words of God cheerfully, is like a person who is thirsty to drink, and when he finds water, he drinks cheerfully. He wakes me every morning that I should go and reprove. He opens my ears to learn and accustoms the tongue to speak. I have not rebelled against going where God sent me. I always said I am prepared to go.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Isaiah, 50:4.</i>
“<i>I offered my back to the floggers, etc.</i>” [50:6]. The prophet said: I am always prepared to go, even when I knew well that they wanted to beat me on my back. I exposed my back and allowed whoever wanted to beat. I also exposed my cheeks and beard. Let whoever wants to, tear out my beard. I have not hidden my face and have not hidden myself from being shamed. Rather, I have gone and followed the word of God to reprove the people.
“<i>The Lord God will help me, etc.</i>” [50:7]. The prophet said: if they will beat me, the Holy One will not give me into their hands to kill me. God helps me and therefore, I am not afraid to publicly reprove. I have made my face as a strong rock to go on and to reprove the people. I know well that I say everything for the sake of the Holy One that will certainly come and publicly utter the words of God.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Isaiah, 50:7.</i>
“<i>My Vindicator is at hand, who dares to contend with me, etc.</i>” [50:8]. The prophet said: my words will soon come. That is to say, my words will soon be justified, that I am telling the truth. Whoever does not want to believe my words will be true, let them come and argue with me and let them stand before me. We will stand together and talk with each other. The one who wants to have justice, let them approach me.
“<i>The Lord God will help me, etc.</i>” [50:9]. The prophet said: I am not afraid of trials or a conflict with the people who say that my words are not true. God helps me and whoever will accuse me over my words; God has said them and who wants to change them?
“<i>They shall all wear out like a garment, the moths shall consume them</i>” [50:9].
The prophet said: whoever will speak against me, will be like a worn out garment that the moths will eat, so will he also be.
“<i>Who among you fears the Lord</i>” [50:10]. The prophet said: whoever wants to fear God should listen to me. Those who went into the darkness. That is to say, evil ways and evil deeds should now come here to me to repent and should rely on God.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Isaiah, 50:10.</i>
“<i>But you are all kindlers of fire</i>” [50:11]. You will all be burned with wrath from the Holy One. This is to say, the fire from His nose. From my hand. That is to say, you will lie in mourning; you will lie in every sickness. You will have no strength against your enemies.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Isaiah, 50:11.</i>
“<i>Listen to me, you who pursue justice, you who seek the Lord, etc.</i>” [51:1]. Come here and follow Me, those who desire the Holy One and go back to your fathers, this is Abraham. Look back to your mothers, this is Sarah. That is to say, go in their path and see what <i>good things and virtues</i> I did for them.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Isaiah, 51:1.</i>
“<i>He was one when I called him, but I blessed him</i>” [51:2]. I called Abraham <i>one</i>, since he was alone, without children. Later, I gave him many children. That is to say, you Israel should not be despondent about the Holy One, even though you have sat in the exile for a long time. Just as Abraham was without children for a long time and later the Holy One gave him many good children, so will it be for you and you will be redeemed.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Isaiah, 51:2.</i>
“<i>The Lord has comforted Zion, etc.</i>” [51:3]. The Holy One will comfort <i>Zion</i> and will make the desert like the <i>Garden of Eden</i>, with every good tree and good <i>fruit. Gladness and joy</i> will be found among them, praise and song.
The <i>Talmud</i> says in [tractate] <i>Berakhot.</i> “<i>Why, when I came, was no one there</i>” [50:2]. <i>Rabbi Johanan</i> said: When the Holy One come to the synagogue and does not find a <i>minyan</i>, the Holy One is angry and says: why have I come and no one is here? <i>Rabin the son of Rabbi Ada said in the name of Rav Hisda.</i> A person used to go to the synagogue every day and one day he does not go to the synagogue. The Holy One asks: where is the righteous person who used to come every day? Did he go to perform a <i>mitzvah?</i> If so, may it be light for him and not dark where he goes. However, if he went for his own needs, then it should be dark for him. He should have relied on God, <i>Blessed be His Name</i>, who helps and gives to each person.

<b>[Isaiah 54:11–55:5]</b>
“<i>O afflicted one, storm-tossed, and not comforted</i>” [54:11]. The Holy One said about the city of <i>Jerusalem.</i> You poor one who has been buffeted by storms and troubles of exile. You have not been consoled until now for the <i>redemption.</i> I will set small pearls in the foundations of your walls and I will set <i>precious stones</i>, <i>sapphires</i> and other semi-precious stones on them.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Isaiah, 54:11.</i>
“<i>I will make your pinnacles of rubies, etc.</i>” [54:12].

All the stones that were found in your boundaries will now become <i>precious stones</i> and pearls.

You will have no fear or anxiety. No anxiety will come to you.
“<i>Surely no harm can be done without my consent, etc.</i>” [54:15]. Many nations may gather, but I did not command it. This is <i>Gog and Magog</i> who will come against you. However, I did not order that he should do evil to Israel. Rather, he will do a favor for Israel. Israel will take goods and money from the nation of <i>Gog and Magog.</i> No nation will be able to win against you. They will be defeated.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Isaiah, 54:15.</i>
“<i>It is I who have created the smith, etc.</i>” [54:16]. The Holy One said: how good. Though <i>Gog and Magog</i> will come against you with swords, bows and arrows, and all the <i>weapons</i> of <i>war</i>, do not fear. I have created the people who make the weapons of war. Everything is in my hands and I can protect you from them. I have created the smith who blows on the coals to make them hot to make the iron from which swords are made. Whatever he wants to make, I can disrupt the same person from his craft, <i>even more so</i> I can destroy the swords, so that they cannot do anything to you. Concerning this, God says in the verse “<i>it is I who created the ravager to destroy</i>” [54:16]. I have created a <i>ravager</i> who destroys what I want. Therefore, do not fear the weapons.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Isaiah, 54:16.</i>
“<i>No weapon created against you shall succeed, etc.</i>” [54:17]. All the swords that will come against you will have no luck to harm you. They will be broken. When they will <i>go to court</i> against you, they will be found at fault and you will be justified. This will be an <i>inheritance</i> to the divine servant, <i>David.</i> Their justice is from me, says God.
“<i>Ho, all who are thirsty, come to the waters, etc.</i>” [55:1]. You should study <i>Torah and wisdom</i> like a person is thirsty to drink water, and you should study Torah with desire. The world is impossible without Torah. If someone does not have money, he should not worry. He will have wisdom and Torah and silver without effort. The Torah is much better than wine and milk.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Isaiah, 55:1.</i>
“<i>Why do you spend money for what is not bread, etc.</i>” [55:2]. Why should you spend your money for a wisdom that is not Torah? This is not called bread. That is to say, the wisdom of the Torah is compared to bread. Just as one cannot live without bread, so one cannot live without the wisdom of the Torah. However, one can live very well without other wisdoms. One is not helped by them, not for the body and not for the soul. Therefore, we learn that the Torah is called <i>good.</i> It is good for the <i>body</i> and the <i>soul</i> and it makes your body fat and thick and the soul will live from this.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Isaiah, 55:2.</i>

“<i>So you shall summon a nation you did not know, etc.</i>” [55:5]. A nation that does not know you.

They will hear about <i>miracles</i> that God will do for Israel and He is the one who gives you this beauty. The <i>Yalkut</i> writes about a <i>story</i> that happened. <i>Rabbi Johanan</i> preached in the <i>house of study</i> about when the Messiah will come. Then they will build the eastern gate of the <i>Temple</i>, with two chambers, out of one <i>precious stone</i> and in one piece. A <i>student</i> was sitting there who asked how was this possible? One does not even find a stone the size of a dove’s egg in the world of <i>precious stones</i>, which are called carbuncle. How can one build a gate in the <i>Temple</i> with two doors, out of one precious stone? The same <i>student</i> once traveled on the sea and his ship sank and he came to the depths of the sea. There he saw <i>angels</i> carving and straightening a very large <i>precious stone.</i> He asked, what is this? The angels said that this will be a gate with two chambers for the <i>Temple</i>, out of one piece. The <i>angels</i> said: if you had not seen this, you would not have believed that it was possible to make this gate with two chambers, out of one <i>precious stone</i> for the <i>Temple.</i> You did not believe what is said in the Torah about the Messiah. The same person immediately became a clod of earth and was destroyed, because he made fun of what had been preached.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni,</i> Isaiah, <i>Remez</i> 478; <i>Pesikta de-Rav Kahana</i>, 18.5.</i>
The <i>Pesikta</i> writes about the verse “<i>all your wall of precious stones</i>” [54:12]. <i>Rabbi Benjamin son of Levi</i> says that in the days of the Messiah, the Israelites will mark the boundaries of their fields with <i>precious stones.</i> Each person will take many precious stones and will place them around his field so that he should know how far his field extends. That is to say, he will make a wall out of <i>precious stones</i>, since there will be so many in <i>Jerusalem. Rabbi Levi</i> said that when a person owes his friend a thousand gulden, they both come to the <i>judges.</i> Sometimes the <i>judges</i> cannot do enough for both of them and one of them does not like the <i>judgment.</i> However, in the days of the Messiah if someone will grasp his friend and say to him, let us go to the <i>Messiah in Jerusalem</i> and let him judge us. When they approach <i>Jerusalem</i>, they will see many <i>precious stones</i> lying on the ground. One Jew will take two good stones and say to his friend. Do I owe you the value of these two precious stones? What do you want from me? Take these two <i>precious stones.</i> They soon make peace with each other and he will say, you don’t owe me so much. You owed me a thousand gulden and the <i>precious stones</i> you have given me are worth two thousand gulden. Concerning this the verse says, “<i>He grants peace within your borders</i>” [Psalms, 147:14]. Your borders will make peace. That is to say, the <i>precious stones</i> near Jerusalem make peace over Israel. <sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni,</i> Isaiah, <i>Remez</i> 478; <i>Pesikta de-Rav Kahana</i>, 18.6.</i>
The <i>Yelamdenu</i> writes: The Holy One says that Israel learns Torah from people; therefore they forget what they learned. Since Moses was a human being, who disappears, thus the Torah that derives from him also disappears and is soon forgotten. However, when the Messiah will come, Israel will learn Torah from the Holy One Himself, as the verse in the <i>haftorah</i> says, “<i>and your children will be disciples of the Lord</i>” [54:13]. That is to say, they will learn Torah from the Holy One Himself.

We find in the <i>Talmud. Rabbi Hanina</i> said: Why is the Torah compared to water, as the verse says, “<i>all who are thirsty, come to the waters</i>” [55:1]. He shows us how a body of water behaves. It flows into a valley and not up a mountain. So too should the <i>scholar</i> be. He should be humble and not arrogant, just like the water runs away from the mountain, the Torah runs away from someone who is arrogant. <i>Rabbi Oshaiah</i> said: Why is the Torah compared to three drinks, to water, to wine, and to milk? He teaches us how these three drinks are similar. They can only be preserved in inexpensive earthen vessels. They cannot remain long in vessels of gold and silver. They spoil quickly in vessels of silver. The Torah is similar. It cannot remain where a person is arrogant and haughty. Like a body of water, from the first drop of rain until it becomes a great body of water or river, so too is the Torah. First one learns two <i>halakhot</i> and later others are added and the result is many <i>halakhot</i>, and just like water causes <i>grain and fruit</i> to grow, so too is Torah study. They raise a person to greatness, as the verse says, “<i>through me kings reign</i>” [Proverbs, 8:15].<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Ta</i>’<i>anit,</i> 7a.</i>

<b>[Isaiah, 51:12–52:12]</b>
“<i>I am He who comforts you, etc.</i>” [51:12]. The Holy One said: I, God, am your comforter. You are very righteous with much merit. Why do you fear a person who can die any day? He is like a grass that withers very quickly.
“<i>You have forgotten the Lord, your Maker, etc.</i>” [51:13]. The Holy One said: why should you fear the nations? You did not rely on the Holy One who can help you. He created you and also created heaven and earth. Why should you fear the oppressors? Whenever there is the wrath of the nations, tomorrow it is no longer there.
“<i>Quickly the crouching one is freed, he is not cut down and slain</i>” [51:14]. You should not rely on the nations, that they would not harm you, since you will soon be redeemed from the exile. Your persecution in the exile will soon be ended. If the exile is compared to a grave, in any event you will not die in the exile. If some will die in the exile, they will rise again at the <i>resurrection of the dead.</i> They will have enough food in the exile among the nations. Some sages say that you should not be afraid of the nations. They are people who will soon die and because he lives, he is very weak. When he eats too much, his stomach hurts. He must have a bowel movement so that he does not burst, or he will die and will come to a grave. If you want to say that he wants to eat nothing, then he must die of hunger. Concerning this, the verse says, “<i>he shall not want for food</i>” [51:14]. That is to say, he must see that no food is lacking. He must eat every day so that he should not die.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Isaiah, 51:14.</i>
“<i>I the Lord your God stirs up the sea, etc.</i>” [51:15]. I am God who can certainly redeem you from the exile. I split the sea and the winds of the sea roar.
“<i>I have put My words in your mouth, etc.</i>” [51:16]. I have put My words in your mouth so that you will be My people. I covered you with My hand, protecting you from your enemies. So will I protect you in the exile in this way until the Messiah will come and I will renew heaven and earth at the same time?
“<i>Rouse, rouse yourself, arise, O Jerusalem, etc.</i>” [51:17]. Awake Jerusalem, you have drunk enough of the bitter drink of exile. You have drunk it all; you have not even left the dregs. That is to say, they have imbibed the exile, for their sins.
“<i>She has none to guide her, of all the sons, etc.</i>” [51:18]. When they were in exile, none of them could guide her in the correct path.
“<i>These two things have befallen you, who can console you, etc.</i>” [51:19]. I have given you two evil troubles. The first is hunger. The other is the sword of the enemy. When one occurred, you wanted to console yourself with it and say, it also happened to others, like to me. So go, search and find another person to whom this happened. In this way, the anguish is not so great.
“<i>Your sons lie in a swoon, etc.</i>” [51:20]. Your children have fallen into a faint, with broken limbs in all the streets. Israel was trapped in the exile like a wild ox captured in a net.
“<i>Therefore, listen to this, etc.</i>” [51:21]. Therefore, listen. You Israel are poor in the exile and you have drunk troubles and not wine.
“<i>Thus says the Lord, your Lord, your God, etc.</i>” [51:22]. Thus has God said. I am your Lord and the nations are your lords and I am your God. He will fight with the nations on behalf of His people Israel and will take the goblet of bitter troubles from your hand and you will no longer drink the dregs of the goblet. That is to say, the troubles of the exile are compared to the dregs of the wine.
“<i>I will put it in the hands of your tormentors, who have commanded you, etc.</i>” [51:23]. The Holy One said: I will take the goblet of bitter drink out of the hand of Israel and will put it in the hands of those who caused you troubles. Those who used to say to you, prostrate yourself, I want to traverse over your body. That is to say, the nations used to say to Israel, prostrate yourself, I want to walk over you. You Israel prostrated yourself on the ground to suffer troubles and pain. Like a boulevard that many people walk on, so did you make yourself and many nations and walked over you.
“<i>Awake, awake, O Zion, clothe yourself in splendor, etc.</i>” [52:1]. Awake and clothe yourself, you city of Zion, in the garments that you previously had. The <i>uncircumcised</i> and the <i>impure</i> will not come again to Jerusalem. Therefore, you may don your beautiful clothes.
“<i>Arise, shake off the dust, sit Jerusalem, etc.</i>” [52:2]. You have lain enough in the dust, in exile. Arise and sit Jerusalem, loosen your bonds that you were bound with in the exile.
“<i>For thus said the Lord, for no price, etc.</i>” [52:3]. You Israel were sold without money, but your sins sold you and you will not be redeemed with silver, but with repentance.
“<i>For thus said the Lord, to Egypt, etc.</i>” [52:4]. The Holy One said: My people Israel went down to Egypt previously, and afterwards in the <i>exile of Babylon.</i> Then the king of Assyria gave Me nothing and robbed them.
“<i>What therefore do I gain here, etc.</i>” [52:5]. Now, in the third exile, what sins have they committed that they are waiting for so long. Thus says the Lord.

“<i>Assuredly, My people shall learn My name</i>” [52:6]. The Holy One said: My name was shamed in the exile. However, in the time of the redemption My name will be recognized and My prophecy that I have allowed to be uttered through the prophets has come true. They will know that I am God and they will see that My prophecy is true. I do not change and the prophets said everything for My sake.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Isaiah, 52:6.</i>
“<i>How welcome on the mountain are the footsteps, etc.</i>” [52:7]. How very nice will be the feet that will walk on the high mountains to tell the good news that there will be peace and that the Messiah will come and the Holy One will be King over Zion. The nations previously ruled over Zion when it was in exile, but in the days of the Messiah the whole world will say that God is King over Zion.
“<i>Hark, your watchmen raise their voices as one, etc.</i>” [52:8]. They will shout all together on the high ramparts. They used to call out on the ramparts: listen, the Messiah is coming with joyous songs and shouts. The prophecy that ceased in the exile will again come and they will see the Holy One clearly.
“<i>Raise a shout together, O ruins of Jerusalem, etc.</i>” [52:9]. The <i>ruins of Jerusalem</i> will all raise their voices to sing together, that the Holy One has consoled His people from their troubles.
“<i>The Lord will bare His holy arm, etc.</i>” [52:10]. The Holy One will reveal and make public His holy hand before the eyes of all the nations. All the nations and all the rulers of the land will see and hear the hand of our God, who will take Israel out of the exile.
“<i>Turn, turn away, touch naught unclean, etc.</i>” [52:11]. That is to say, the Holy One will say to Israel: remove yourself from the exile and do not touch anything unclean. Go out from among them, out of all the cities where you are. Purify yourselves of all impurities and all sins of those who carry the sword of the Holy One. That is to say, Israel has no sword and no bow, but the mercy of the Holy One that is their sword and spear, and leave the nations for the redemption.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Isaiah, 52:11.</i>
“<i>For you will not depart in haste</i>” [52:12]. You will not run out of the exile like someone who runs away from an enemy, since you will not be afraid of the nations. You will go publicly and the Holy One will go before you on the way. However, the Israelites ran out of Egypt. The Egyptians said to the Israelites, leave us quickly. However, all the ways that the Israelites went were Egyptian cities and Israel went out very slowly and publicly. So too will Israel also go in the days of the Messiah. The Holy One will go ahead and behind to see that whoever is not strong enough to go, He will help lead them.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Isaiah, 52:12.</i>

Similarly, Israel who were driven away into exile, say: let the Holy One write a <i>marriage contract for double</i> the amount. Therefore, on Mount Sinai I said once, “<i>I am the Lord your God</i>” [Exodus, 20:2]. At the redemption I should pay you <i>double the amount of the marriage contract.</i> That is why he says here, “<i>I, I</i>” [51:12], twice for the <i>double amount of the marriage contract.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Isaiah, <i>Remez</i> 474.</i>

“<i>Sing, O one who did not bear children, burst into song, etc.</i>” [54:1]. The prophet said: sing you woman who did not have children.

When she wants to have children, she cannot become pregnant. Now, the children will be many in the city that was devastated during the exile, many more children than the nations will have. She is like a woman who has a husband. <i>Jerusalem</i> was like an <i>abandoned wife</i> whose husband was still alive.
“<i>Enlarge the site of your tent</i>” [54:2]. The prophets said to the city of Jerusalem. Make your tent wide and long for your many children. The other cities, in addition to Jerusalem, should also extend the length and breadth of the curtains of your tent and the length of your rope, and strengthen the nails of your tent.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Isaiah, 54:2.</i>

“<i>Do not fear, you will not be ashamed</i>” [54:4]. Do not fear that you will find troubles in the departure from the exile. You will never be embarrassed forever. Furthermore, you will have so much good that you will forget the <i>disgraces</i> that you suffered in the exile. Also, the <i>disgrace</i> that you were like a <i>widow</i> in the exile will not be remembered.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Isaiah, 54:4.</i>
“<i>For your maker is your husband</i>” [54:5]. The one who is your master is your Creator and He is your husband. However, in the exile the nations were your husband. Your master, God, <i>Lord of Hosts</i>, is your husband and your Redeemer. The Holy One of Israel is the God of the whole world.
“<i>For like a wife forsaken, etc.</i>” [54:6]. The prophet said: you are not like a wife whose husband has died, but you are like a wife whose husband was angry with her for a time and returned to her. The Holy One called you a forsaken woman. If you want to think that you will be eternally forsaken because he find you undesirable. It is common that when someone has an old wife, she is not so beloved. Therefore, God says, “<i>like the wife of a man</i>’<i>s youth who is cast off</i>” [54:6]. That is to say, one who despises his wife, who he married as a maiden, that is to say, a <i>virgin.</i> She is the same when she has gotten old and he remembers that she is the same one who came to him as a young woman. However, when one takes an old wife, then he may eventually come to despise her.
“<i>For a brief moment I abandoned you</i>” [54:7]. Since much good will be given to you in the days of the <i>Messiah</i>, you will think that the exile was but a blink of the eye. You will be redeemed with great <i>mercy.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Isaiah, 54:7.</i>

“<i>This is like the days of Noah for Me</i>” [54:9]. The Holy One said: Just like I swore after the Flood to never again bring it to the world. So too, the exile that has been, will not be forever. I have sworn that there should not be a Flood again. Similarly, I will not be angry and will not scold you.
“<i>For the mountains may depart and the hills be removed</i>” [54:10]. The mountains will be removed in time, but my <i>oath</i> will not depart and will remain forever. So says God, who has compassion for you. The <i>Talmud</i> writes in <i>Sanhedrin</i>, <i>Rabbi Judah said to his son Rabbi Isaac:</i> No person has a joyous heart, except with his first wife, but not with the other wife that he takes.

This time you will see your children coming and your face will glow with joy, just like when a person would become frightened when something joyous that was unexpected happens to him.

“<i>Behold the coastlands await me, etc.</i>” [60:9]. Those who live among the nations will hope to me. They will recognize Me that I do good to those that I want and evil to those that I want. The great ship from the sea that is called <i>Tarshish,</i> like the ships came in the days of <i>King Solomon.</i> They will bring your children from afar. Israel will bring their their silver and gold with them out of the exile. Therefore, the rich person who has much money in the exile should not worry and should not say that his money will be lost when the Messiah will come. He will not be able to take it with him, because it is too heavy. That is why the verse says here, he should not worry that he has to provide many provisions for the long journey. The nations will give him money and provisions, to praise and for the holy name of the Holy One, who is your beauty.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Isaiah, 60:9.</i>
“<i>Foreigners will rebuild your walls, etc.</i>” [60:10]. The nations will build your walls and their kings will serve you. You will recognize that everything that comes to your hand, whether it is good or evil, all of this comes from Me, God. I will kill whomever I want to punish. I have compassion on the one I love.
“<i>Your gates will always be open, etc.</i>” [60:11]. All of your gates will be open all the time, day and night. Many nations and kings will come in to the Messiah, like the servants come to their masters. Those nations and peoples who will not want to serve you will be destroyed.

“<i>You will suck the milk of the nations, suckle at royal breasts, etc.</i>” [60:16] You will suck milk from the nations and from kings.

Israel will know that I am God who helps and am your Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Isaiah, 60:16.</i>
“<i>Instead of copper, I will bring gold</i>” [60:17]. The Holy One said: Israel, do not allow yourself to be anxious. If the foreigners in the exile take money and silver from you, therefore he said here to the city. If a foreigner took copper, he will have to repay gold.

The remnant will all be righteous. They will have the land forever. They will not be driven out and they will be planted like a root. It will be seen that I have planted them and I will boast about them.
“<i>The smallest shall become a clan, the least a mighty nation, etc.</i>” [60:22]. The small <i>family</i> of <i>Israel</i> will become great, a thousand times as great as they were.

The <i>Pesikta</i> writes: “<i>And God saw the light that it was good</i>” [Genesis, 1:4]. The Holy One saw that the light was very good, and saw that the Messiah and his people will be righteous. The Holy One hid this good light and will not give it to the people until the Messiah and his righteous ones will come. The Holy One will give them the great light that He had hidden under the <i>Throne of Glory. Satan</i> came and asked the Holy One. To whom will You give the light? The Holy One answered: to the one who will shame you and <i>disgrace</i> you. He responded: <i>Lord of the Universe</i>, show him to me. The Holy One said: go and see him, here he is. As soon as Satan saw him, he became very frightened and fell on his face. He said: this is certainly the Messiah, who will cause me and the nations to fall into <i>Gehenna</i>, as the verse says, “<i>He will destroy death forever</i>” [Isaiah, 25:8]. The nations will also be very afraid of the Messiah and the Messiah will take upon himself great suffering and travails to suffer because of the sins of Israel. Thus, he will say with complete joy, I will accept the travails, but do not allow a single one of Israel to be destroyed. I not only ask this for those who are alive, but also those who have died, from <i>Adam</i> until my days, that they should all live. The <i>stillborn</i> children who died within four weeks of their birth should also live.

He will say before the <i>Holy One: Lord of the Universe</i>, how much longer will my troubles continue and how do I have the strength to endure them? The Holy One responded: let your suffering be as great as My suffering was from the time that <i>Nebuchadnezzar destroyed the Temple</i> and exiled My children among the nations that I have not sat on My <i>Throne of Glory.</i> The Messiah responded: if it is so, do not add to the suffering that I am already suffering. Let the servant be as good as the master. When the Messiah will come, many nations will war with each other and Israel will say, where shall we go? The Holy One responded: Do not be afraid. I have done all of this for your sake. You will be redeemed from the exile. When the Messiah will come, he will stand on the roof of the Temple and will call out: come here you righteous ones, the redemption has come. If you don’t want to believe this, see the light that shines on you, as the verse says, “<i>arise, shine, for your light has dawned; the presence of the Lord has shone upon you</i>” [60:1]. The light will shine only on you, Israel, and it will be dark for the nations of the world. All the nations will gather and will bow down to the Messiah and will lick the earth under his feet. They will ask the Messiah: let us be your servants, and each Israelite will have two thousand and eight hundred servants.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Isaiah, <i>Remez</i> 499.</i>
Our sages said: the Patriarchs came to the Messiah and said to him. You have suffered much exile because of Israel, our children. You were despised and mocked among the nations. You sat in the dark, your skin withered on you and your eyes became darkened because of much fasting. Now we are asking you to allow Israel to enjoy the great honor that is given to you. The Messiah responded: I did all this for the sake of Israel, that they should have honor with me. At the same time, the <i>Holy One</i> will lift up the <i>Messiah</i> very high under the heaven and place a great light over him in the expectation that the nations will be afraid of the Messiah. All the nations will gather and the Messiah will destroy the evil nations with the breath of his mouth. The Holy One will make seven <i>canopies</i> out of precious stones. Four rivers will flow from each <i>canopy</i>, one with wine, on with milk, one with honey, and one with fragrant spices. The Holy One will embrace him and will bring him into the <i>canopies.</i> All the righteous will see this and the Holy One will say: My <i>Messiah</i> has not yet received half of his <i>recompense</i> for the <i>suffering</i> he has endured. I must give him a great honor and do something that no person has seen. At that time, the Holy One said to the winds from the <i>north</i> and the <i>south:</i> blow for the Messiah with good odors and <i>spices from the Garden of Eden.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Isaiah, <i>Remez</i> 499.</i>
“<i>Raise your eyes and look about</i>” [60:4]. At that time, The Holy One will bring the <i>Messiah and Elijah.</i> They will have a glass of oil in one hand and a staff in the other. They will assemble all of Israel and the Shekhinah will be with them and the prophets behind them. The Torah is in their right hands and they will go together to a field that is called the valley of <i>Jehoshaphat.</i> All the nations will assemble and the Holy One will bring the foreign gods and will give a <i>soul and spirit</i> into these same foreign gods. He will allow them to go over the bridge from <i>Gehenna</i> and they will fall into <i>Gehenna.</i> Israel will immediately become very frightened and they will say to the Holy One: you will do the same thing to us. The Holy One will say: who are you? They will say: we are your people Israel. The Holy One will say: who will <i>testify</i> that you are My people? Israel will say: let <i>Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob</i> testify. Immediately, all three of them came and testified about Israel. The Holy One goes with Israel and puts the <i>scroll of the Torah</i> in his lap and illumines the whole world with the light of Israel. <i>Gabriel</i> then goes and says before the <i>Holy One: Lord of the Universe</i>, do You want the nations to come and see Israel’s glory? The Holy One says: let them not see. Then Moses and the <i>community of Israel</i> come and say: <i>Lord of the Universe</i>, let the nations come and see the glory of Israel and let them be ashamed. The Holy One immediately will open Gehenna and the nations come out and will see and say, how great and important is the Lord and how very important is the people of Israel that God loves very much. <i>Pharaoh</i> will come and say: <i>Lord of the Universe</i>, why do you love this people more than all the other nations? The Holy One will respond: you fools, don’t you know that Israel have relied on Me and recite “<i>Hear O Israel</i>” [Deuteronomy, 6:4] twice a day. However, you have seen My wonders in Egypt and always left Me and served <i>foreign gods.</i> The nations will immediately be ashamed and will have to return to Gehenna. <i>Israel</i> will sit in the <i>Garden of Eden</i> and the Holy One will sit with them.

He has clothed me with garments of salvation and a shirt of righteousness. That is to say, the lovingkindness of the Holy One, which is compared to a good garment.
“<i>Like a bridegroom adorned with a turban, etc.</i>” [61:10]. The Holy One robed me with honor and dressed me in garments of honor, like a priest who was dressed in beautiful garments and like a <i>bridegroom</i> who dons very beautiful clothes.
“<i>For as the earth breaks forth her shoots, etc.</i>” [61:11]. The prophet compared the redemption to a seed that one throws into the earth, so that it should grow. The person sometimes <i>despairs</i> that it will be lost in the earth. So too are Israel. They were dispersed and lost in the exile for many years and when the <i>redemption</i> will come, they will be like something that one sows and grows.

They will give you a new name and the Holy One will explain what the name should be.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Isaiah, 62:1.</i>
“<i>You will be a crown of beauty in the hand of the Lord, etc.</i>” [62:3]. You will be beautiful like a crown and God will always strengthen you. You should place this crown and the cap of kings in the hands of God.
“<i>You shall no more be called forsaken, etc.</i>” [62:4]. It will no longer be said about your land, that it is desolate or destroyed. When the Holy One will call you by the name “<i>My delight.</i>” That is to say, My desire is for you.
“<i>Your land shall be espoused for the land delights in you, etc.</i>” [62:4]. When a city or a land is destroyed and there is no person in it, this is like a woman who has no husband. That is why he says your land will have a husband, because the Holy One desires you.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Isaiah, 62:4.</i>
“<i>As a youth espouses a maiden, etc.</i>” [62:5]. Just as when a <i>youth</i> espouses a <i>maiden</i>, this is a much more appropriate <i>match</i> than if an <i>old man</i> takes a <i>maiden.</i> So too was the <i>land of Israel.</i> Because Israel was in exile, when the nations lived in it, it was like an old man espousing a maiden. However, when Israel will again come to the <i>land of Israel</i> it will be like a <i>youth</i> espousing a <i>maiden.</i> Just as a <i>groom</i> rejoices with his <i>bride</i>, so will the Holy One rejoice with you.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Isaiah, 62:5.</i>
“<i>Upon your walls, O Jerusalem, I have set watchmen, etc.</i>” [62:6]. The Holy One will place angels to guard the walls and they will ask that the Holy One should build the city of Jerusalem. Some say that the Holy One says to the city of Jerusalem: do not fear, you will not collapse, for I have placed good <i>watchmen</i> over your city to stand watch day and night, unlike other <i>watchmen</i> who stand guard during the day and sleep at night. The Holy One’s <i>watchmen</i>, on the contrary, stand guard day and night. That is to say, the Holy One will give His <i>supervision</i> over the city. The Holy One said: you children in exile remember God. You should not sleep and should not be silent. You should always pray and praise God that the walls should be established and also the city of Jerusalem.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Isaiah, 62:6.</i>
“<i>The Lord has sworn by His right hand, by His mighty arm, etc.</i>” [62:8]. The Holy One who is strong in keeping what He promises and therefore He will certainly make peace with your enemies. They will no longer eat your grain and will not drink your wine for which you have worked.
“<i>Those who harvest it shall eat it and give praise to the Lord, etc.</i>” [62:9]. Those who gather the grain and wine will eat and drink it themselves and they will praise the Holy One in His Temple. That is to say, the tithes and fruit from a tree that one does not eat until it is three years old. These fruits have to be eaten in the Temple in Jerusalem.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Isaiah, 62:9.</i>
“<i>Pass through, pass through the gates, clear the road for the people, etc.</i>” [62:10]. Pass through, from city to city and clear the path where Israel will go to the city of Jerusalem, and the steps where one goes on foot. Lift up high the banner, that all of Israel should see in the cities where they are dispersed.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Isaiah, 62:10.</i>
“<i>See the Lord has proclaimed to the end of the earth</i>” [62:11]. The Holy One proclaims to all the ends of the earth, to announce to the city of Zion that the Messiah is coming with the help of God.
“<i>See, his reward is with Him, his recompense before Him</i>” [62:11]. The prophet talks about the good reward that the Holy One will give to Israel for their suffering great troubles that they suffered in the exile in the name of the Holy One and the reward that the Holy One has prepared.
“<i>They shall be called, the Holy people, etc.</i>” [62:12]. They will call you the holy people that have been redeemed by God. They will call you the sought after, a city that was not forsaken.
“<i>Who is that coming from Edom, in crimsoned garments, etc.</i>” [63:1]. The prophet compares the Holy One to a great warrior who has killed many people. His garments are besmeared with the blood of the people that he has killed. Thus, will Israel also be in the days of the Messiah, and the Holy One who will kill many nations. Who is this that comes from Edom with besmeared red clothes, girded with rope, from the great city that is called <i>Bozrah?</i> The Holy One responds: I spoke with justice. I am taking vengeance now, for I have much strength to help Israel.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Isaiah, 63:1.</i>
“<i>Why are your robes red</i>” [63:2]. Why are your garments red? He compares the nations to a winepress where one tramples the grapes. So will the Holy One squeeze the nations and trample them.
“<i>I have trodden the winepress alone and of the peoples, etc.</i>” [63:3]. The Holy One said: I have trodden the winepress alone. That is to say, your merit did not help with this. None of the nations was with me. Their blood sprayed my clothes and I have smeared my clothes.
“<i>For I had planned a day of vengeance and My year of redemption arrived</i>” [63:4]. I have had a day in My heart on which to take vengeance and the year of redemption has come.
“<i>I looked, but there was no one to help, none to aid</i>” [63:5]. I looked around and did not see a helper for Israel. I wondered that there was no supporter.
“<i>My own arm wrought the triumph, and My own rage</i>” [63:5]. But the rage I had against the nations helped and supported Me to destroy.
“<i>I trampled peoples in My anger, I crushed them in My wrath, etc.</i>” [63:6]. I will trample the nations and crush them with My wrath. I will bring down their strength to the ground.
“<i>I will recount the kind acts of the Lord, the praises of the Lord, etc.</i>” [63:7]. The prophet said: I will remind Israel of the kindness that the Holy One will do and the many good things that He does for Israel with His compassion and much grace.
“<i>For He said: surely they are My people, children who will not deal falsely, etc.</i>” [63:8]. He said: just as the Holy One has taken them as a nation when they left Egypt. The Holy One says about Israel: they should be My people forever and they will not deal falsely with Me.
“<i>In all their troubles He was troubled, etc.</i>” [63:9]. They will not remain long in their troubles. The angel who will help them was before them. He redeemed them in His love and compassion. Some say that the verse tells us that when Israel have troubles in the exile, it is disgusting to the Holy One.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Isaiah, 63:9.</i>
“<i>Raised and exalted them all the days of old</i>” [63:9]. The Holy One always elevated Israel and exalted them.
The <i>Pesikta</i> writes: “<i>I greatly rejoice in the Lord</i>” [61:10]. It is a parable about a <i>queen</i>, whose husband, son, and son-in-law, went to a distant land. Someone comes to the <i>queen</i> and tells her that her son is coming. She says, let my daughter-in-law rejoice. Then she is told that her that her son-in-law is coming and she said: let my daughter rejoice. When she was told that her husband was coming, she became very happy and said that the joy is complete. Similarly, the <i>prophets</i> said to <i>Jerusalem</i>, your children are coming from a distance. She says, “<i>let Mount Zion rejoice</i>” [Psalms, 48:12], <i>Zion</i> should rejoice. The prophets say, your daughters will bring the nations. She says, “<i>let the daughters of Judah exult</i>” [Psalms, 48:12]. The daughters of <i>Judah</i> should rejoice. However, the prophets say, your king is coming and she says, now the joy is great, as the verse says, “<i>I greatly rejoice in the Lord</i>” [61:10].<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Pesikta de-Rav Kahana,</i> 22.3; <i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Isaiah, <i>Remez</i> 505.</i>

Midrash <i>Shohar Tov</i> writes: “<i>It is I announcing vindication</i>” [63:1]. When the Messiah will come, ministers will come and say: <i>Lord of the Universe</i>, do you take bribes, heaven forbid? You cause the nations to be destroyed, because they have worshiped foreign gods and engaged in illicit sex. Israel have also worshiped foreign gods and engaged in illicit sex. Why are the <i>nations of the world</i> in Gehenna, and Israel are not in Gehenna? <i>Michael</i> will get up and speak for Israel and cause the evil <i>ministers</i> to be silent. The Holy One said to Michael: with what do you want to silence the evil ministers? The Holy One said: I will cause them to be silent with the Torah that they have accepted and the charity that they have given will help them. <i>Rabbi Eliezer</i> said: they were protected by the <i>merit of Joseph.</i> The Holy One thought about <i>Joseph</i>, that he did not want to listen to his master’s wife, Potiphera, to have sexual relations with her. That is why Israel are called by the name of Joseph, as the verse says, “<i>perhaps the Lord of Hosts will be gracious to the remnant of Joseph</i>” [Amos, 5:15]. <i>Rabbi Levi</i> said: they will be protected by the <i>merit of circumcision.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Midrash Shohar Tov</i>, 20.3; <i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Isaiah, <i>Remez</i> 507.</i>

<b>[Hosea, 14:2–10; Micah, 7:18–20]</b>
[When these two portions are read together, the <i>Haftorah</i> from <i>Nizavim</i> is read. When <i>Shabbat Shuvah</i> occurs, the following <i>Haftorah</i> is read. “<i>Return O Israel, to the Lord your God</i>” [Hosea, 14:2].

“<i>Who is like You, forgiving iniquity, etc.</i>” [Micah, 7:18]. The prophet said: who is a God that forgives the transgressions of the remnant, in the days of the Messiah.
“<i>Who has not maintained His wrath forever</i>” [7:18]. How just it would have been that these evildoers did not go out of the exile because of their transgressions that they are full of, but God’s wrath is not long lasting and desires to do lovingkindness.
“<i>He will take us back in love; He will cover up our iniquities, etc.</i>” [7:18]. He will return to us, to have mercy on us. He will push our transgressions into the ground and throw our transgressions into the depths of the sea, so that they should not be seen anymore.
“<i>You will keep faith with Jacob, loyalty to Abraham, etc.</i>” [7:20]. The Holy One who has promised lovingkindness to Abraham, to give the land to him and his children. Therefore, because [the children of] Jacob are the children of Abraham, He must give the land to [the children of] Jacob. Therefore, he says <i>truth</i> concerning <i>Jacob.</i> That is to say, with truth He must give the land to the children of Jacob, because He promised to do lovingkindness with Abraham.

“<i>Gather the people, bid the congregation to purify themselves, etc.</i>” [2:16]. The prophet awakened Israel that they should take repentance to heart. That is why he said: assemble the old and the young. Those feeding at the breast should not feed now. The groom who used to drink with his bride should also fast and similarly; one directly from the wedding should fast.
“<i>Between the portico and the altar, let the priests weep, etc.</i>” [2:17]. The prophet said that the priests should weep and shout in the Temple where they do the service and bring the sacrifices. Now they should cry and pray and should say, “<i>spare.</i>” That is to say, Holy One have compassion on your people and do not disgrace your people that the nations should have dominion over them and why should the nations say to Israel, where is your God?
“<i>The Lord was roused on behalf of His land and had compassion upon His people</i>” [2:18]. The prophet said that when Israel will pray and repent, then the Holy One will certainly take revenge on the foreigners for the sake of His holy land and will have compassion on His people Israel.
“<i>In response to His people the Lord declared: I will grant you, etc.</i>” [2:19]. The Holy One responds to those who pray to Him and call on Him. He says to His people: I will give you grain and new wine and oil and will no longer tolerate disgraces from the foreigners.
“<i>I will drive the northerners far from you, etc.</i>” [2:20]. The Holy One says. I will remove the locusts from you. They will not eat up your grain. They will all have to die. It will stink and the stench will rise. There are many locusts and they have done much harm to the land.
Our sages say about the verse “<i>the northerners.</i>” That is the evil inclination that is hidden in the hearts of people. He does not show himself to the person. When the Messiah will come, the Holy One will remove him from Israel and will banish him very far from the people, where the world is desolate. “<i>With his face toward the eastern sea</i>” [2:20]. The evil inclination set his face against the first Temple and destroyed both of them through transgressions. “<i>The stench shall rise</i>” [2:20]. It killed the sages and allowed the nations of the world to continue to do everything to incite against Israel. “<i>Because He has done great things</i>” [2:20].

“<i>You shall eat your fill and praise the name of the Lord, your God</i>” [2:26]. You will eat and be satiated and you will praise God, who has done wonders with you. The Holy One will pay you with so much grain as used to grow in four year, for there will be a famine for four years in the days of the Messiah.

“<i>For the breakers of Death encompassed me, the torrents of Belial terrified me</i>” [22:5]. Great troubles surrounded me that break the heart with sorrows, like the woman who comes to lament over her child, who is in great pain. My troubles are similar, like a great river that comes with much force to flood. Thus did the troubles rush over me.
“<i>In my anguish I called on the Lord</i>” [22:7]. When I am in pain, I call on God and He answered my prayers from heaven and my cry reaches His ears.
“<i>Then the earth rocked and quaked</i>” [22:8]. When the Holy One pours out His wrath on the nations that harmed Israel, the earth will tremble and the foundations of the heavens will tremble before the anger of the Holy One. It is as if smoke comes out of His nostrils, out of great anger, and fire issues from His mouth.
“<i>He bent the sky and came down, thick clouds beneath His feet</i>” [22:10]. When the Holy One took <i>revenge on Egypt</i> and on Pharaoh, the Holy One lowered His heaven and a fog beneath His feet.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, II Samuel, 22:10.</i>

“<i>He reached down from on high, He took me, drew me out of the mighty waters</i>” [22:17]. The Holy One sends His angels and takes me out of all troubles and lifts me out of mighty waters. That is to say, great troubles are compared to mighty waters.
“<i>He delivered me from my strong enemy, from those who hated me</i>” [22:18]. The Holy One protects me from my enemies who are stronger than me, as He rescued me from <i>Goliath the Philistine.</i>
“<i>They came upon me in the day of my calamity, but the Lord was my stay</i>” [22:19]. David said: When I ran away from Saul, my enemies ran before me and blocked my path and informed on me to Saul, but the Holy One helped me.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, II Samuel, 22:19.</i>
“<i>The Lord rewarded me according to my merit, he requited the cleanness of my hands</i>” [22:21]. The Holy One requites my justice and me.

All the laws of the Holy One are before me and I do not remove myself from His laws.
“<i>With the loyal you have dealt loyally, with the blameless hero, blamelessly</i>” [22:26]. David said: A person who is loyal to God’s deeds, the Holy One also show him His loyalty to do good things for him.
“<i>With the pure You act in purity, and with the perverse You are wily</i>” [22:27]. The Holy One is pure with the pure person. That is to say, He shows himself to be pure with him. The person who walks in a crooked path, the Holy One behaves crookedly with him.
“<i>To humble folk You give victory, and You look with scorn on the haughty</i>” [22:28]. The Holy One helps the one who holds himself humble, like a pauper. The Holy One makes the one who holds himself haughty, humble and low.

“<i>I pounded them like dust and the earth, stamped, crushed, etc.</i>” [22:43]. I will crush them and grind them very fine, like the dust of the earth and like the mire in the streets. I will make them fine and trample them.
“<i>You have rescued me from the strife of peoples, kept me to be a ruler of nations</i>” [22:44]. You God, have made me run away from my enemies, from Israel.

“<i>Tower of victory to his king, etc.</i>” [22:50]. He greeted the help of his king, helps and does kindness to his anointed, to David and his children forever.
Midrash <i>Shohar Tov</i> writes concerning the verse “<i>He mounts a cherub</i>” [22:11]. When Pharaoh pursued Israel, Pharaoh said: give me a stallion that runs swiftly and I will swiftly pursue them. The Holy One also took a horse and rode it to help Israel. Pharaoh then said: give me a mare that runs even faster. She can urinate when she runs. However, a stallion that wants to urinate must stop and stand still. The Holy One responded: you evildoer, do you have a cherub, a bird, an angel that I fly upon? Rabbi Aha gives a parable about a king. <i>Robbers</i> came and kidnapped his son. The servants ran and quickly prepared the king’s chariot with many horses to chase after the <i>robbers.</i> The king said: by the time all the horses will be harnessed to the chariot, my son will be lost. The king quickly took a horse from the chariot and pursued them on the horse. The Holy One also did not want to tarry to ride His <i>Throne of Glory</i> with all of His holy <i>animals and cherubs.</i> He took a <i>cherub</i> from the <i>Throne of Glory</i> and He rode on it to wage war with Pharaoh.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Midrash Shohar Tov,</i> 18.14–15; <i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, II Samuel, <i>Remez</i>, 160.</i>
The <i>Talmud</i> writes in [tractate] <i>Sanhedrin</i>, in <i>chapter ten</i>, concerning the verse “<i>to a humble folk You give victory</i>” [22:28]. <i>Rabbi Johanan</i> said: when you will see that Israel are humble in the exile and will be poor, then the Messiah will come and redeem them.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Sanhedrin</i>, 98a; <i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, II Samuel, <i>Remez</i> 161.</i> However, when Israel will be arrogant, then they will delay the Messiah. There are many among Israel who pursue arrogance and are poor. The Holy One hates this very much. When a wealthy person is arrogant, this is nothing new, because money and goods cause the pursuit of arrogance. The Talmud writes that there is nothing better for Israel than poverty, in the expectation that the Messiah should come, and they should not pursue arrogance. It does not help when they are poor and pursue arrogance. Similarly, the opposite, when one is poor and wants to be arrogant, he must acquire fine clothes and good food, in the hope that people will lend him money, and people should think that he is rich. This hinders the Messiah, and many other sins also come from the pursuit of arrogance.
<i>[Midrash] Shohar Tov</i> writes: <i>Rabbi Yudin</i> said in the name of <i>Rabbi Hama the son of Haninah.</i> When the Messiah will come, the Holy One will seat the Messiah at His right hand and Abraham at His left hand. Abraham became frightened and said: the Messiah is my descendant and sits at the right hand. I am their father, should I sit at the left hand? The Holy One placated Abraham and said: your descendant, the Messiah, sits on My right hand and I sit at your right hand. This is an honor for you, as the verse says in the <i>haftorah</i> “<i>your providence has made me great</i>” [22:36]. That is, your humility has made me important.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Midrash Shohar Tov,</i> 18.29; <i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, II Samuel, <i>Remez</i> 162.</i>
The Rabbati writes: There were four kings and each of the spoke differently to the Holy One. One of them was David, who prayed and said, “<i>I pursued my enemies and overtook them</i>” [Psalms, 18:38]. I will pursue my enemies and I will capture them and kill them. The Holy One heard his prayer and killed his enemies. Later there was a king called <i>Asa.</i> He said: I have no strength to kill the enemies, but I will pursue them and You, Holy One, should kill them. The Holy One said; I will do it, because concerning him it is written, “<i>for they broke before the Lord</i>” [II Chronicles, 14:12]. That is to say, they were killed before the Holy One. There arose a king called <i>Jehosaphat.</i> He said before the Holy One. I do not even have the strength to pursue the enemies, but I will sing songs and will sing praises of God, and You, Holy One, pursue and kill the enemies. The Holy One said: I will do it. You sing the songs and I will pursue and kill them. Then there arose a king called <i>Hezekiah.</i> He said before God. I cannot pursue and cannot kill and cannot sing songs, but I will sleep in my bed and You, Holy One, should kill the nations. The Holy One said: I will do it, as the verse says, “<i>an angel of the Lord went out and struck down in the Assyrian camp</i>” [Isaiah, 37:36].<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Lamentations Rabbati</i>, <i>Petihtah</i> 30; <i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, II Samuel, <i>Remez</i> 163.</i>
The <i>Tanhuma</i> writes. “<i>Your providence</i><sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">He translates the word as “humbleness,” based on a misunderstanding of the word.</i> <i>has made me great</i>” [22:36]. We do not find anyone as <i>humble</i> as the Holy One. A person says to his friend, let us go to <i>rejoice with the bride</i>, or <i>visit the sick</i>, or bury the dead. He responds: it is humiliating to go to the bride or the sick person or the dead. However, the Holy One does not consider Himself important. He adorned <i>Eve</i> Himself, since one should dress a bride beautifully and adorn her. He led her to her <i>groom</i>, <i>Adam.</i> Concerning Abraham, the Holy One visited Abraham on the third day after his circumcision. Thus, He <i>visited the sick.</i> He appeared to Abraham and visited him when he was sick from the circumcision. The Holy One himself buried <i>Moses Our Teacher.</i> Therefore, no person should pursue arrogance and the Messiah will come. <i>Amen.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, II Samuel, <i>Remez</i> 161.</i>

V'Zot HaBerachah

<b>[Joshua, 1:1–18]</b>
“<i>After the death of Moses the servant of the Lord</i>” [1:1]. It was after the death of Moses, the faithful servant of God in all things. The Holy One said to Joshua: Moses My servant has died. However, had he lived, I would rather speak with him than with you, since he was <i>faithful</i> to me.
Our sages say that during the mourning for Moses, they forgot three thousand laws. Before Moses died, he said to Joshua: <i>review</i> these laws or they will be forgotten. Joshua said: I have studied them earnestly day and night. I do not have to review them. Therefore, because he was arrogant and said that he did not need to review them, is why he forgot these same laws. Israel came to Joshua and said: teach us the laws or we will consider you as nothing. Concerning this, the verse here says, “<i>My servant Moses has died</i>” [1:1]. The Torah is called “the Torah of Moses” and not “<i>the Torah of Joshua</i>” Therefore, God said to Joshua: arise and make the people go to war. They will forget your forgetting and allow themselves to be led.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Temurah,</i> 16a; <i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Joshua, <i>Remez</i>, 4.</i> From here we learn that whoever is arrogant, wisdom and Torah leave him, as happened to Joshua. God said to Joshua: cross the Jordan with the whole people of Israel. I will give you the whole land of Israel and also even the land <i>outside of Israel</i> where you will go.
“<i>From the wilderness and the Lebanon</i>” [1:4]. I will give you from the wilderness, the Temple to the great sea, to the river <i>Perath</i>, to where the sun sets.
“<i>No one shall be able to resist you, etc.</i>” [1:5]. No one will be able to resist you because you will live, as I was with Moses so will I be with you, to help you. I will not leave you.
“<i>But be strong and resolute</i>” [1:7]. But be strong in the Torah, as Moses had taught you, in the expectation that you will have <i>good fortune, blessing, and success</i> in all your paths. However, study day and night so that the Torah will never be removed from your mouth.
“<i>I command you</i>” [1:9]. For I have commanded you that you should go to war, but have <i>respect</i> and also study Torah. It is also written concerning others, Torah and <i>respect</i> and do not fear the nations, since God is with you wherever you will turn.
“<i>Joshua gave the order to the officials of the people</i>” [1:10]. Joshua gave the order to those officials of the people. They should go among the people of Israel and say to the people that they should prepare food and drink, for in three days they will cross the <i>Jordan</i> to conquer the <i>land of Israel.</i>
“<i>To the Reubenites and Gadites</i>” [1:12]. Joshua said to those of the <i>tribe of Menashe</i> who did not want to have a <i>share in the land of Israel</i>, since they had taken a substantial amount of land as their share on the other side of the <i>Jordan</i>, <i>outside the land of Israel.</i> They said to Moses: let us remain here <i>outside the land</i> and we will help Israel to wage war in the land of Israel so that they will be able to conquer the land. Therefore, Joshua now said to them: remember that you promised that you would help wage war on the other side of the Jordan. Therefore, now come with us to help destroy the nations and your wives and children will remain here <i>outside the land of Israel</i> in their cities that you have taken as your share, until we will have conquered the whole land of Israel. <i>Reuben Gad</i> and half of the <i>tribe of Menashe</i> responded: we will obey everything that you will command and go where you will command. We listened to Moses and so will also follow you, but keep the commandments of God. God will be with you as He was with Moses.
“<i>Any man who flouts your commands</i>” [1:18]. Any person who does not listen to you will be put to death. However, be strong in the commandments of the Holy One and study Torah. <i>Amen.</i>

Shabbat and Rosh Chodesh

<b>[Isaiah, 66:1–24]</b>
“<i>Thus said the Lord: the heaven is My throne</i>” [66:1]. Thus says the Holy One: the heaven is My throne and the earth is a stool for My feet. What kind of house can you build for Me to rest in? If you would think that because I say that the heaven is My throne and the earth My stool that they were created long ago for Me, you should know that I created the heaven and the earth. Even though I am very high and mighty, yet I am very close to the poor people and those who are humble, do not pursue arrogance, and observe My commandments.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Isaiah, 66:1.</i>
The prophet has shown us in these verses how the person should behave in his house, to give charity and honor poor guests. The person should remember and know that the house that he has built for himself is not his house, but he should allow himself to think that the house belongs to the Holy One. Therefore the prophet said here: what kind of house do you want to build for Me that I should live in it? My house is in heaven, but when you want to build a house in which I will dwell among you on the earth, then invite poor people as guests, honor them, and I will certainly be in your house. Therefore, the <i>Talmud</i> writes in [tractate] <i>Yom Tov</i>, chapter two, “<i>whoever wants that his things should last, he should put them into a leather bag</i>… <i>majestic on high is the Lord</i>” [Psalms, 93:4].<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Bezah,</i> 15b. The Aramaic term for leather bag is spelled the same way as the Hebrew word for majestic.</i> This <i>passage</i> teaches us that the person, who desires that his house and his field remain forever, should place the Holy One in his house, which is called <i>majestic.</i> The person should say about his house that it is not his house, but it belongs to the Holy One.
Our sages said: The verse says, “<i>the owner of the house shall come</i>” [Leviticus, 14:35]. Whoever says about his house that it is his house and does not want to allow any guests in it and does not want to lend anything from his house to his neighbor, the Holy One sends leprosy on his house. This was in olden times when the Temple stood. The priest came to the house and ordered all the utensils and clothes be carried out of the house and everything was put in the street. Thus, everyone saw the utensils standing there that he used to tell his neighbors that he did not have that utensil. Now the Holy One has commanded that homeowner to put out into the street all of his dishes that he did not put out. All the utensils became ritually impure because the house became leprous. The Holy One did all this because he did not want to invite guests. He said that everything in the house was his. This is the meaning of the verse “<i>the owner of the house shall come</i>” [Leviticus, 14:35]. That is to say, the one who says that the house is his alone.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Yoma,</i> 11b.</i>
“<i>Its builders labor in vain on it</i>” [Psalms, 127:1]. That is, the one who does not want to say about his house that the Holy One built it, that house will not remain standing. His building is considered as nothing. He must always say that the house belongs to the Holy One alone and is not mine. The person should know that he is like a tenant who rents from an owner to live there for a year. So should he also be in his house. He should know that the Holy One is the owner of his house.
We know of three reasons that people cannot rent and live with a landlord. The first is the one who cannot rent because he is afraid that he will not be able to pursue his business in the landlord’s house. [The landlord] might compete with his merchandise or might give loans to gentiles. He thinks that the landlord will say that he has priority and he is afraid to show his money because of the tax collectors. The second one cannot rent because he has a large household with many children. The third one cannot rent because he is afraid that the landlord will tell everyone about his behavior, with fancy food and how he spends his money. Similarly, if he is very stingy with his food and does not want people to know how despicably stingy he is. Therefore, he does not rent and must build a house for himself. Concerning these three, the verse first said, “<i>In vain do you rise early and stay up late, you who toil for the bread you eat; He provides as much for His loved ones while they sleep</i>” [Psalms, 127:2]. That is to say, the person should know that in his house he is like someone who rents and the Holy One is the landlord. However, he should not fear that the landlord would take away his livelihood, since the Holy One gives each person his or her livelihood. Therefore the verse says, “<i>in vain do you rise early</i>” [Psalms, 127:2]. That is, your waking up early to go after your livelihood does not help, if the Holy One does not want to help. However, the one who relies on the Holy One, the Holy One sends him his livelihood even when he is asleep in his bed. This is the meaning of “<i>He provides as much for His loved ones while they sleep</i>” [Psalms, 127:2].
The second one does not have to fear if he has many children and the landlord will shout at the children that they are taking up too much space and making too much noise. Concerning this the verse says, “<i>Sons are the provisions of the Lord, the fruit of the womb, His reward</i>” [Psalms, 127:3]. That is, the landlord is the Holy One and all the children belong to God, as the Talmud said: “<i>there are three partners in each person.</i>” There are three partners in each person. One is the father, the second is the mother and the third is the Holy One, and through these three the child is born.”<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Kiddushin,</i> 30b.</i> Therefore, when the person dies, the Holy One says to the people, take your part, that is, the body that lies on the ground and I will take back my part, that its, the soul that goes to heaven. Thus, when it is heard that the Holy One has a share in every child and is just like the father, then his child is not despicable and he does not have to fear the landlord, the Holy One, when the Holy One is also the landlord.
The third is that one fears that he will be gossiped about that he is despicably stingy, or a glutton and the landlord will tell everything. However when the Holy One is the landlord, he does not disclose anything about what the person does. As we find that a wise person says to his friend: he belittled him and said bad things to people about this wise person. The wise person responded that we must praise the Holy One, day and night. He knows all of our transgressions and does not divulge any of them. The person, who sees a small sin committed by his friend, tells it to all the people in order to shame him. Therefore the verse says, “<i>when he speaks with his enemies in the gate</i>” [Psalms, 127:5]. That is to say, when the Holy One is the <i>landlord</i>, He does not divulge what he does. The enemies do not talk about him in the market where they used to talk about people. They would gather and gossip about how everyone behaved. Therefore, the verse says, “<i>like arrows in the hands of a warrior</i>” [Psalms, 27:4]. That is to say, gossip that one talks about in the market where <i>householders</i> gather and discuss everyone in the community. This is the meaning in the verse of “<i>in the gate.</i>” That is to say, they talk about what someone eats and drinks. This is like an arrow that is shot far and hits a distant person with evil words.
Since it has been shown that the person should say about his house that it is the house of the Holy One, every person is obligated to take in the relations of the Holy One, because the house belongs to the Holy One. The relations of the Holy One are the poor, as the verse says, “<i>if you lend money to My people</i>” [Exodus, 22:24]. The verse called the poor the people of the Holy One, as the verse also says, “<i>for the Lord has comforted His people and will have compassion on His suffering ones</i>” [Isaiah, 49:13]. It is customary that a <i>rich person</i> who has <i>relatives</i> and these <i>relatives</i> are rich, then he is close to them. However, when he has poor <i>relatives</i>, he denies knowing them. However, the Holy One does the opposite. He considers the poor people to be proper relatives and is close to them, as the verse says here in the haftorah. Which house will you build for me to rest in, that it should be called My house?
“<i>This is the one to whom I will look, to the poor and the contrite in spirit</i>” [66:2]. That is to say, take poor people into your houses and honor guests. With this, I will rest in your house, as the Midrash writes in <i>Leviticus Rabbah.</i> “<i>The poor person who stands at your doorway, the Holy One is at his right hand.</i>”<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Leviticus Rabbah,</i> 34.9.</i> The poor person who stands at your doorway, the Holy One is at his right hand. As soon as the poor person comes into your house, the Holy One follows the poor person into your house and shows himself in that house. That is to say, the Holy One says: My people are in My house just like I would be in it. However, the one who wants to chase the guests out, it is like he also chased out the <i>owner of the house</i>, since the <i>Holy One is the owner of the house</i> and the guests are the people of the Holy One.
Concerning this, the Chapters of the Fathers said: “<i>Let your house be open wide and let the poor be members of your household.</i>”<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">M. <i>Avot,</i> 1.5.</i> Here one can ask: why does he have to say, your house should be open and poor people should be in it. There can be poor people in the house when it is closed. The explanation is, you should make the door of your house wide, so that the Satan should not stand in your doorway. If your door were narrow, you would not be able to enter your house because it is dangerous to pass near the Satan. However, when poor people are in your house, then no Satan comes to your doorway, but the Holy One stands at your door, as the verse says, “<i>He stands at the right hand of the needy</i>” [Psalms, 109:31].
From where do we say that the Satan stands at the door where there are no poor people? We find in the <i>Midrash ha-Zohar parashat Bereshit:</i> at every festive meal the Satan stands at the door and sees if there are any poor people in the house. He returns to heaven and when there are no poor people there, he says before the Holy One that there are no poor people in the house and the Holy One becomes angry.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Zohar,</i> I: 10b-11a.</i>
We also find concerning Abraham that he made a feast for his son Isaac. Abraham honored his guests and was pouring them drinks. Sarah was also busy because she was breast-feeding all the children that had been brought by the noblewomen who did not believe that Sarah had a child in her old age. They said that Sarah had taken someone else’s child and said that it was her child. Therefore, they brought their children and wanted to see if Sarah had milk in her breasts and Sarah breast-fed all the children. Satan made himself like a poor person and placed himself in the door. He asked that he be given bread to eat and nobody turned to him. Abraham did not have the time and Sarah also did not have the time. Satan went to the Holy One and said: you have loved Abraham too much. Just now I have asked for bread from him and he did not give it to me and he did not have any poor people in his house. His feast was immediately made loathsome and the decree went forth before the Holy One that Isaac should be slaughtered on the <i>Akedah.</i> As a result, Sarah died because she was frightened when she was told that Isaac had been slaughtered on the <i>Akedah.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Zohar,</i> I: 10b-11a.</i>
From here we learn that the Satan stands at the door. When there are no poor people in the house, he makes it tight at the door and it is a danger to go through that door. Therefore our sages say, “<i>Let your house be open wide.</i>”<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">M. <i>Avot,</i> 1.5.</i> Your door should be wide and open so that the Satan should not stand at your door. Therefore, bring poor people into your house and you will banish the Satan from your door.
“<i>Those who slaughter oxen</i>” [66:3]. The Holy One said: the evildoer who is full of sins and wants to bring an ox as a sacrifice, in My eyes this is like he would assault his friend and kill him. That is to say, his sacrifice is not accepted before Me. Similarly, the evildoer who brings a sheep as a sacrifice, it is as if he brought a dog as a sacrifice. Similarly, when he brings a <i>meal offering</i>, it is as if he had brought a pig as a sacrifice. This is because a pig has a <i>sign that it is kosher</i>; its feet have split hooves, but it is completely unkosher. So too is the evildoer. He is full of sins and makes himself kosher and brings an ox as a sacrifice. This evildoer is comparable to a pig and a dog in My eyes. I will repay them with the same measure that they have given Me. Since they don’t fear Me, I will punish them with the same fear. I have called to them that they should repent and they do not return and have done evil things all the time, the opposite of Me.
“<i>Hear the word of the Lord</i>” [66:5]. The prophet said: listen to the word of God. The evildoers say, your brothers who hate you and separate themselves from you, say it is because you righteous ones fear God. The evildoers say: the commandments are difficult for me to keep. Each evildoer would gladly have it that all the people would be evildoers. However, the righteous ones who do not turn to them and wait for help from the Holy One will see great joy from the Holy One and the evildoers will be shamed.
“<i>Hark, tumult from the city</i>” [66:6]. When will the help come from the Holy One? When the Messiah will come. There will be a great murmuring and shouting against <i>Gog and Magog</i> from the city of Jerusalem.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Isaiah, 66:6.</i>
“<i>Before she was in labor</i>” [66:7]. He compares Jerusalem to a mother and Israel to children to whom the mother gives birth. That is to say, Jerusalem will soon give birth to her children, Israel. Just like when a woman quickly gives birth, even before the labor pains, Jerusalem will give birth quickly to a large nation.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi Isaiah, 66:7; Radak, Isaiah, 66:7.</i>
“<i>She delivered a son</i>” [66:7]. She will give birth to a son. That is, when a woman has a son, the whole world is happy. So will Jerusalem be, all of Israel will rejoice.
“<i>Who has heard of such a thing?</i>” [66:8]. It will be a wonder among all peoples, and all of Israel will quickly gather in the city of Jerusalem.
“<i>Shall I open the womb and not deliver?</i>” [66:9]. The Holy One said: shall I bring Jerusalem to the stool where women sit when they are about to give birth to a child, and she should not give birth? That is to say, Gog and Magog will come to Jerusalem, since they will certainly learn that they will soon be born, like a woman who gets on a stool and gives birth to a child. She will certainly have a child.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Isaiah, 66:9.</i>
“<i>Rejoice with Jerusalem</i>” [66:10]. Whoever rejoices and hopes for the help of the Holy One, will be worthy to live to see the coming of the Messiah, and will see much joy. Whoever mourns that Jerusalem was destroyed and observes <i>Tisha B</i>’<i>Av</i> properly, will have much rejoicing.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Isaiah, 66:10.</i>
“<i>That you may nurse and be satisfied</i>” [66:11]. Mourn the <i>destruction of Jerusalem</i> and you will have much good, satiety and sufficient goodness.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Isaiah, 66:11.</i>
“<i>For thus says the Lord</i>” [66:12]. Thus said God: I will bring great peace to Jerusalem and I will flood the nations of the world like a river that flows swiftly. You, Israel, will pursue the nations of the world and will take their land and their wealth. The nations will carry you in their arms, like a person carries a beloved child in their hands. That is to say, all the nations of the world will honor you.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Isaiah, 66:12.</i>
“<i>You shall see and your heart shall rejoice</i>” [66:14]. You will see and your hearts will rejoice. Your limbs will be strengthened and will be fat and thick. You will recognize God, who has honored you greatly and given you much good. You will do much harm to the nations.
“<i>For by fire will the Lord</i>” [66:16]. The Holy One will come with great fire, storm winds and great anger against the nations of the world, to destroy them.
“<i>Those who sanctify and purify themselves</i>” [66:17]. The <i>Ishmaelites</i> wash themselves every day for their worship of their foreign gods. They are <i>impure</i> with all of their deeds. They eat pork, mice and other impure things. They will all be destroyed.
“<i>I know their deeds</i>” [66:18]. I, God, will be present at their evil deeds and will repay all the evildoers for their evil deeds. I will gather all the nations and they will see My glory.
“<i>I will set a sign among them</i>” [66:19]. I will place a sign on these nations. Their eyes will run and they will be as blind. They will be dispersed in all the lands to tell of My glory, that I did for Israel. The Holy One will, therefore, allow them to live, in the expectation that they will tell of My glory in the whole world, in the days of the Messiah.
“<i>They will bring all of your brethren</i>” [66:20]. Those Israelites who will be far from the city of Jerusalem and far from the Messiah, dispersed in foreign lands, should not worry that the Messiah will tarry. That is to say, that the Messiah will not come to them. Therefore, the verse says that the Holy One will disperse the nations of the world in all the foreign lands and those nations will lead Israel on the beautiful roads to Jerusalem and the Messiah. The nations will rejoice. When one brings an Israelite to Jerusalem, it is like one gives a present to the king. So will be the nations that will bring an Israelite to the Messiah. It is like he gives a <i>present</i> or brings an <i>offering</i> to the Messiah.
“<i>From them likewise I will take</i>” [66:21]. The Holy One said: When Israel were dispersed and mixed in the nations and they were long mixed in, yet they will come to the Messiah. I will make them <i>priests</i> and <i>levites</i> in the Temple. Therefore, no person should predict and think that he will be lost in the days of the Messiah.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Isaiah, 66:21.</i>
“<i>For as the new heaven</i>” [66:22]. Just like the heaven and the earth exist and remain new and strong, like the day that they were created. They are always strong and new. So too will Israel be, they will be eternal.
<i>Tanhuma</i> writes: A <i>noblewoman asked Rabbi Yose the son of Halafta:</i> it is written in your Torah that Israel will live as long as heaven and earth will exist, and the <i>prophet Isaiah</i> said that the heavens will be devastated and destroyed. If so, then Israel will also be destroyed when the heaven is destroyed. <i>Rabbi Yose</i> answered: the <i>prophet Isaiah</i> said that the heaven would be created anew, as the verse says, “<i>the new heaven</i>” [66:22]. The sun and moon will be created anew every day. The sun sets every evening at sunset in the west. It washes itself in the <i>great ocean</i> and its light is extinguished in that water and remains so the whole night. At daybreak it comes to the east, the sun again washes in a river of fire that called the <i>river Dinur.</i> Here the sun is again lit and attains a great light and again illumines the world. It is the same with the stars and the moon. When the Messiah will come, the Holy One will renew them again and will make the light much greater.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanhuma</i>, (ed. S. Buber), Genesis, 20; <i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Isaiah, <i>Remez</i>, 513.</i>
“<i>From New Moon to New Moon</i>” [66:23]. All the people, even from other nations, will come to bow down to the Holy One in the city of Jerusalem. Some people who live near Jerusalem will come every Sabbath to bow down. Those who live far away will come every <i>New Moon</i> to bow down. These nations, when they will be in Jerusalem, will go out into the valley that is called “<i>the valley of Jehoshaphat</i>” to see the corpses that were killed and will see that the worms crawl over their skin and the fire burn their bodies and it will be disgusting to people’s eyes.
<i>Tanhuma</i> writes: how long is Gehenna for the evildoers. It says that each evildoer is in Gehenna for twelve months, as we find in Egypt. They suffered the plagues for twelve months.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanhuma</i>, (ed. S. Buber), Genesis, 33; <i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Isaiah, <i>Remez</i>, 514.</i>
The Talmud writes in [tractate] <i>Rosh Hashanah:</i> The <i>fire of Gehenna</i> was created on Monday. It is never extinguished; it burns forever. The evildoers go down to Gehenna with their bodies and remain in Gehenna for twelve months. During the twelve months the body is destroyed and the soul is burned. The wind spreads the ashes under the righteous. Therefore, the proverbial saying is: someone says to his friend, if you will come higher to the Garden of Eden than I, you will cover my eyes with dust. The Holy One said: Israelites who make the pilgrimage three times a year, but when the Messiah comes, you will make the <i>pilgrimage every month</i>, as the verse says, “<i>From New Moon to New Moon, etc.</i>” [66:23].<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Rosh Hashanah,</i> 17a; <i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Isaiah, <i>Remez</i>, 514.</i>

When Rosh Chodesh occurs on Sunday

(this <i>haftorah</i> is read on the previous Sabbath)
<b>[I Samuel, 20:18–20:42]</b>
“<i>Jonathan said to him, tomorrow is the New Moon</i>” [I Samuel, 20:18]. <i>Jonathan</i> said to <i>David:</i> it is customary that the <i>generals</i> eat at the table of the king on the New Moon. Tomorrow they will ask, why is David not at the table of King Saul, who wanted to kill David? Therefore, David ran away and hid himself. However, Jonathan had sworn to David that he would never betray him. Jonathan said to David: on the third day that you will be hidden, you should go further away. King Saul, my father, will search for you on the third day, because you will be missing for three consecutive days.
“<i>The other time</i>” [20:19]. From here we learn that no work was done on the New Moon, just as the women accepted upon themselves not to work on the New Moon, because they did not give silver and gold to the Golden Calf.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Pirke de Rabbi Eliezer</i>, chap. 45.</i> Jonathan said to David: sit near a large stone called the <i>stone of Ezel.</i> This means a stone that the people use to find their way when they wander.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, I Samuel, 20:19.</i> The stone will be a target to shoot the arrows and to send the lad for the arrows. Jonathan made up a sign with David that he would take along a youth and would shoot arrows at the stone. If I will call to the youth, get the arrows; they are in front of you. Then, come out and talk with me and do not be afraid. However, if I say to the youth, the arrows are behind you, you should know that you should quickly leave, since they will certainly pursue you. Jonathan said to David: what we swore that we would remain as true brothers, that we support each other, and Jonathan left <i>David.</i>
“<i>The king sat</i>” [20:25]. King Saul sat on his throne near the wall and Jonathan did not sit near his father, Saul. He was afraid to sit near his father. Saul might be angry with him because he knew well that <i>Jonathan</i> loved <i>David.</i> He thought: if I sit near him, he could kill me easily. <i>Abner</i> sat next to Saul and all the generals asked, where has <i>David</i> gone? Saul did not say anything the first day. He thought that perhaps David was not ritually pure. He had a <i>seminal emission</i> and therefore he is not coming to eat at the table.
“<i>On the day after the New Moon</i>” [20:27]. It was the day after the <i>New Moon</i> and all the generals asked, why was David, not at the table, yesterday and today? Saul also asked: why is David not at the table?
“<i>Jonathan answered</i>” [20:28]. <i>Jonathan</i> said: he asked me if he could go to the city of <i>Bethlehem.</i> I told him to go. He said: send me, there will be a feast at which my family will gather together in Bethlehem. That is why he pleaded with me that I should let him go.
“<i>Saul</i>’<i>s anger was kindled at Jonathan</i>” [20:30]. Saul was very angry with his son <i>Jonathan.</i> He said to him: you must be a <i>bastard</i>, son of a woman born improperly, because you so love <i>David</i>, who is my <i>enemy.</i> If you were my son, you would justly love when I love and hate when I hate. This will be a disgrace for your mother. They will say that your mother had illicit sexual relations. From here we learn that much depends on the thoughts of the mother. When she has good thoughts, good children come from her. Therefore, <i>King Saul</i> said: “<i>son of a perverse, rebellious woman</i>” [20:30]. You were not properly born from your mother. She was not modest and she was brazen to me when she danced. She asked me to dance with her and I had to take her as a wife.
This is the story of why Saul had to take her as a wife. A story occurred in the days of the <i>Judges</i>, before there was a king over Israel. There was a Levite who lived in the mountains of <i>Ephraim</i> and he took a wife from <i>Bethlehem</i> in <i>Judah.</i> The wife was angry with her husband and she left her husband and returned to Bethlehem, to her father. She was with her father for four months. The husband went after his wife to Bethlehem. He took a youth with him and a pair of donkeys. The father-in-law was very happy and honored him for three days. He had to leave on the fourth day. On the fifth day, he was going with his wife and his youth. They arrived at the city of Gibeah. They stood in the street and nobody wanted to let them into their house. An old man came along and invited them to come to him to spend the night. They would have enough to eat and drink. They were happy after the evening meal. The whole city of Gibeah gathered before the house and said: give us the man so that we can have <i>homosexual relations</i> with him. The owner of the house went out and said: my dear gentlemen, I ask you very much. Do not do this. It is very vile to do such a thing. I will give you my daughter and the wife of the man and sleep with them. The man took his wife and gave her to the men and they had sexual relations with her the whole night. When the day came, the woman went back to the house and she fell down dead, at the door. The man took his dead wife and put her on a donkey. He brought her home to his city in this way. When he came to his house, he took a large knife and hacked his wife into twelve pieces and sent one piece to each tribe of Israel. All of Israel wondered and said: such a deed has never happened since we left Egypt. All of Israel gathered in the city of <i>Mizpe</i>, four hundred thousand armed men. The man told the story before all of Israel. Immediately, all of Israel said that nobody should go home to his house. They sent to the tribe of Benjamin and said to them: why have you done such an evil thing? Hand over these evildoers in the city of Gibeah and we will kill them. They did not want to hand over the Benjaminites from the city of <i>Gibeah</i> and the whole tribe of Benjamin gathered from all of their cities and came to the city of <i>Gibeah</i> to wage war with the <i>rest of Israel.</i> Twenty-six thousand men from Benjamin gathered and there were seven hundred men from the city of Gibeah. Four hundred thousand men gathered from the other tribes. They went out from the city of Gibeah and killed twenty-two thousand of the Israelites. Israel was crying and mourning and they again asked the <i>Urim ve-Tumim</i> if they should continue the battle against Benjamin. God answered that they should again go to battle with Benjamin. They went into battle against Benjamin and eighteen thousand Israelites were killed. All of Israel gathered and repented and fasted. They brought sacrifices to God. <i>Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest</i> again asked the <i>Urim ve-Tumim:</i> The Holy One said that you should go against Benjamin this day and you will defeat them. They went out against Benjamin and Benjamin quickly killed thirty Israelite men. The Israelites said: let us make ourselves as if we fear them and they will pursue us and they will all run out of the city. Israel killed twenty-five thousand men of Benjamin and they burned the city of Gibeah. Six hundred men ran away. Israel made a <i>ban</i> that one of their daughters should not <i>marry anyone from Benjamin.</i> Israel hated them very much. What benefit do we have? A whole <i>tribe of Israel</i> has been destroyed. The city of <i>Gilead</i> did not come into the war to help Israel. Israel sent twelve thousand men against Gilead and they killed the whole city. Every woman that had slept with a man was killed, and all the <i>males</i> were killed. They found four hundred virgins who had not slept with a man in the city of <i>Gilead</i> and they were left alive.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Judges 19:1–21:12.</i>
How did they test that they were true virgins? The explanation is that they took a barrel of wine and placed the maiden on the barrel of wine. Each maiden that was not a <i>virgin</i>, the wine could be smelled on her breath, since the power of the barrel of wine went through the whole maiden to her mouth. However, the maiden who was a <i>virgin</i>, the wine was not smelled on her breath when she sat on the barrel of wine. One asks a question. Why did they not examine the <i>virgins</i> with the metal strip that had the <i>Ineffable Name of God</i> on it? When they captured the daughters of Midian, they allowed those who were virgins to live. They were led before the “<i>frontlet.</i>” This was a piece of silver on which the <i>Ineffable Name of God</i> was engraved. Whichever virgin was a proper virgin, the piece of silver did not harm her. However, the one that was not a true virgin, she became yellow and green and other colors in her face. It was possible to see that she was not a virgin from her face and she was killed because she had committed immoral acts. Why did they not also take the metal strip with the <i>Ineffable Name of God</i> and examine if they were proper virgins. The answer is that the holy strip did not want to <i>embarrass</i> the daughters of Israel who had committed immoral acts. That is why they had to take a barrel of wine to know which one was not a proper virgin in the <i>story of Gibeon.</i> However, the daughters of <i>Midian</i> were <i>foreigners</i> and the metal strip told which ones had committed immoral acts.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Yevamot,</i> 60b; <i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Judges, <i>Remez</i>, 76.</i>
From here we learn that one should not shame and embarrass any person, even if one knows that the person has done something evil. Yet, one should not throw the bad name before him. Similarly, the metal strip did not want to say which one was not a proper virgin, even though the metal strip did not say any falsehood and only told the truth. Therefore, we should learn from here not to embarrass, even to tell the truth. Not like some people who say, I will tell the truth, even when he did do it.
The four hundred virgins were brought to the city of <i>Shilo</i> and Israel sent [a message] to the remainder of the tribe of Benjamin who were in hiding. They said: come out and we will make peace with each other. The four hundred virgins from the city of <i>Gilead</i> were given to the tribe of Benjamin as wives. However, the four hundred virgins were not enough for them. The Israelites said: what should we do that the Benjaminites would take wives? We have sworn that we will not give our daughters to the Benjaminites. They thought of an idea. Every year there was a <i>festival</i> in the city of <i>Shilo</i> and the daughters of the city of <i>Shilo</i> used to dance in the fields. The Benjaminites should jump out from the vineyards to the dancers and each one should grab a maiden and run away with her, to take her as a wife. When the father of the maiden will complain to us, we will respond: they have been waiting to have wives and they ran to the dance and each one took a maiden that he liked as a wife.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Judges, 21:12–24.</i>
<i>King Saul</i> was also from the remainder of the tribe of Benjamin. He was a handsome, fine young man and very tall. When he came to the dance, each of the maidens would gladly have him and they all presented themselves to him that he should dance with them. Saul was very bashful and was ashamed, but one maiden was not ashamed. She said: whoever is ashamed to eat or pray is lost here and there. Therefore, she took Saul and Saul allowed it to happen. He took her as a wife and <i>Jonathan</i> was born. That is why Saul now said to <i>Jonathan:</i> you take after your mother. She was brazen at the dance and you are also brazen to me. You love the one that I hate. That is to say, it all depends on the thought of the wife.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Ibn Shuaib <i>Derashot</i>, II: 329.</i>
“<i>For as long as</i>” [20:31]. <i>King Saul</i> said: as long as David lives, <i>Jonathan</i> cannot be king instead of David. Therefore, Saul said to Jonathan: go and bring David to me and I will have him killed.
“<i>Jonathan answered</i>” [20:32]. <i>Jonathan</i> answered his father. Why do you want to kill him? What has he done?
“<i>Saul threw</i>” [20:33]. Saul threw a spear at Jonathan. Jonathan then saw that his father intended to kill David.
“<i>Jonathan rose</i>” [20:34]. Jonathan got up from the table and he did not eat that day. Jonathan was very upset that he had shamed David.
“<i>In the morning</i>” [20:35]. In the morning, Jonathan went out to the field where David was hidden and he took along a young boy.
“<i>He said to the boy</i>” [20:36]. Jonathan said to the youth. Go and find the arrows that I shot. The boy went and Jonathan shot the arrows far over the stone. The boy came to the target where he had shot. Jonathan shouted out to the boy: go quickly, the arrow was shot past you. The boy went and gathered the arrows and brought them to Jonathan and the boy did not know where David was hidden in the field. Jonathan gave arrows to the boy and told him to go home and the boy went home. David came and bowed down three times to Jonathan, and they kissed and cried together. However, David cried more than Jonathan.
“<i>Jonathan said</i>” [20:42]. Jonathan said to David. Go in peace and everything that we have sworn to one another, so God should be a witness between our descendants and us forever.

<b>[II Kings, 11:17–12:17]</b>
“Jehoiada <i>made a covenant</i>” [11:17]. The priest made a covenant and an <i>oath</i> between Israel and <i>king Jehoash.</i> The story was as follows. One king was named <i>Ahaziah</i> and his mother was called <i>Athaliah.</i> Ahaziah died and left behind several children. Athaliah had the children killed and she became the <i>queen</i> of Israel by force. However, Yehosheva, the sister of Ahaziah, stole a son who was called Jehoash and hid him in the Temple because of <i>Athaliah.</i> He was hidden for six years and he was hidden with his wet nurse, who nursed him. <i>Jehoash</i> was hidden shortly after he was born. <i>Athaliah</i> was queen over Israel for six years. In the seventh year, <i>Jehoiada the priest</i> went with the secret and sought advice and he gathered a large group of people to kill <i>Athaliah.</i> The people stood with spears and swords in the Temple and the group was only priests. They took out Jehoash and they made him a crown for a king. They shouted and clapped with their hands saying; the <i>king Jehoash</i> should live. <i>Athaliah</i> heard shouting and she came to the <i>Temple.</i> She saw the king standing with his crown and with many people all around him, blowing trumpets and with great joy. She tore her clothes. Jehoiada immediately ordered that <i>Athaliah</i> should be killed. She was dragged out and killed outside the city. <i>Jehoiada</i> immediately made a covenant with Jehoash, the young king.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">II Kings, 11:1–16.</i>
“<i>Then all the people of the land</i>” [11:18]. The people went and destroyed and tore down the foreign gods and a priest called <i>Mattan</i>, who was the priest for the foreign gods, was killed.
“<i>He took the captains</i>” [11:19]. The priest Jehoiada took all the people and they led the king out of the Temple to the king’s house and on the royal throne.
“<i>All the people rejoiced</i>” [11:20]. All the people were happy with <i>king Jehoash.</i>
“<i>Jehoash was seven years old</i>” [12:1]. Jehoash was seven years old when he was made king and he was king in Jerusalem for forty years.
“<i>Jehoash did</i>” [12:3]. Jehoash did what was good in the eyes of the Holy One, because Jehoiada taught him to do good. However, as soon Jehoiada died, Israel and the captains came to Jehoash and said to him. You were inside the Temple for six years, where the <i>high priest</i> goes only once a year, only on <i>Yom Kippur.</i> He was in great danger and was only there for one hour. You, Jehoash, were in the same place for six years and nothing happened to you. You must be a god. They bowed down to him and considered him a god. The king let it happen, to have them bow down to him as a god.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, II Kings, 12:3.</i>
“<i>Jehoash said</i>” [12:5]. Jehoash said to the priests. All the silver that is brought to the Temple; there are two types that are brought every year. The first type that is brought is the assessment coin that <i>everyone</i> from twenty onwards paid, the same silver coin. Then there is the other silver that is brought when someone makes a <i>donation</i>, to give silver to the Temple.
“<i>Let the priests receive it</i>” [12:6]. The king said: take all the silver, but you should repair the Temple, and that which is broken, is from the same money.
“<i>The king called</i>” [12:8]. The king called Jehoiada the priest and said to him: why did they not repair the Temple? Therefore, you should not accept any more silver, but it should be given to the Temple.
“<i>The priests agreed</i>” [12:9]. The priests agreed that they would not take silver and would also not repair the House.
“<i>Jehoiada took</i>” [12:10]. <i>Jehoiada</i> took a chest and made a hole in it so that whoever brought silver to the Temple could throw the silver into it. The chest became full of silver and the king’s scribe and the high priest came to count the silver. Those coins that were good, they tied up separately. The pieces of silver were made into coins, since they needed coins to pay the craftsmen to repair the Temple.
“<i>They gave the money</i>” [12:12]. They gave the money to hire woodchoppers and stonemasons and to those who build houses to repair the House and they did not make silver vessels in the Temple from the silver. They first had to repair the House and later made vessels in the Temple.
“<i>No check was kept on the men</i>” [12:16]. They did not ask these men who had the silver in their hands to give an account, since they did everything faithfully. From here our sages learn that they should not make an accounting of the <i>managers of the charity funds</i>, so that people should not say that he acted improperly with charity funds.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Baba Bathra,</i> 9a.</i>
“<i>Money brought as a guilt offering and sin offering</i>” [12:17]. When a person gave money to purchase a <i>guilt offering or sin offering</i> and something remained, it was not given to repair the House, but the priests took that silver and bought sacrifices, for appropriate sacrifices.

<b>[I Samuel, 15:1–34]</b>
“<i>Samuel said to Saul</i>” [15:1]. <i>Samuel said to King Saul:</i> the Holy One has sent me to make you a king over Israel. Therefore, it is just that you must listen to God’s commands that you should take revenge against <i>Amalek.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, I Samuel, 15:1.</i>
“<i>Thus says the Lord of Hosts, I will punish, etc.</i>” [15:2]. Thus said God: now I will remember and repay the deeds that Amalek did to Israel, when they left Egypt. He enticed Israel out of the cloud and killed them.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Pesikta de Rav Kahana</i>, 3.12.</i>
“<i>Now go</i>” [15:3]. Now, you, Saul, should go and kill and destroy Amalek and have no pity, not even on the oxen, donkeys, sheep, or nursing children. Our sages say that there were many among Amalek who made themselves to appear as sheep, by magical means, in the expectation that they would not be recognized and they would be left alive. Therefore, the Holy One commanded that you should even kill the sheep.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, I Samuel, 15:3.</i>
“<i>Saul summoned</i>” [15:4]. Saul gathered the people and commanded everyone from Israel that they should take a lamb from the king’s house and afterwards they would count the sheep. They would know how many Israelites there were to go to war. They did not count the Israelites by name. The <i>plague happens, heaven forbid</i>, when one counts Israel. Thus, they counted Israel with sheep. There were two hundred thousand Israelite men and ten thousand from Judah.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, I Samuel, 15:2</i>
“<i>He lay in wait in the valley</i>” [15:5]. He fought with Amalek in the valley. Our sages say: Saul saw that it is written in the Torah that when an Israelite is found slain and they do not know who did it, they measured which city is closest to where he was killed. That city had to bring a calf to atone for the person who was killed the person.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy, 21:1–9.</i> Now, Saul said: when the Torah so strongly commanded when one person is killed, how much more so can I kill so many people from Amalek? A <i>heavenly voice</i> went forth and said, “<i>do not act too righteous</i>” [Ecclesiastes, 7:16]. Do not be more righteous than what God commanded you. He allowed the city of <i>Nob</i> to be destroyed. They were all priests and Saul let them all be killed and did not have pity on them.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">I Samuel, 22:9–19.</i> A heavenly voice went forth that you should not be too much and too big of an evildoer.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Yoma,</i> 22b.</i>
“<i>Saul said to the Kenites</i>” [15:6]. Saul said to the <i>Kenites.</i> They were the descendants of Jethro, the father-in-law of Moses. Jethro had given good advice to Moses about how he should dispense justice to Israel.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, I Samuel, 15:6.</i> Because of that advice Saul said: we will repay his descendants with good. We will tell them to leave Amalek in the expectation that they should not be killed among the Amalekites. From here we learn how the Holy One gives a good reward when someone gives good advice to his friend; his descendants are benefitted.
“<i>Saul destroyed</i>” [15:7]. Saul killed the Amalekites from the city of <i>Havilah</i> to the city of <i>Shur</i>, near Egypt. He captured <i>Agag</i>, <i>the king of Amalek</i>, alive. Saul and all the people had mercy on <i>Agag</i> and also on all the good sheep and did not want to kill them.
“<i>The word of the Lord came to Samuel</i>” [15:10]. God said to Samuel: I regret that I made Saul a king. He did not keep My words. Samuel shouted and pleaded with God the whole night and went to Saul early in the morning. Samuel was told that Saul was in the city of <i>Carmel</i> and he was dividing the goods and money that he had taken from Amalek. When Samuel came to Saul, Saul said to him: may God bless you. I have carried out what God has commanded me, to kill Amalek. Samuel responded: what are the loud shouts of the oxen and sheep? Saul said: I brought them from Amalek. The people had mercy on them and they want to bring the animals as sacrifices to God. Samuel said to Saul: I will tell you what the Holy One said last night. Saul said: tell me. Samuel said: though you are little and humble in your eyes, nonetheless you are a king over Israel and the Holy One commanded you to kill all of Amalek. Why did you not obey and took much plunder, sheep and cows? With this, you have done much evil. Saul responded: the people had mercy on the animals and wanted to offer sacrifices. I have brought <i>Agag</i> here. Samuel responded: Does the Holy One want sacrifices? The Holy One would rather have that His commands and commandments are listened to, rather than that sacrifices should be brought. It is a great sin, like one who engages in magic or sorcery. The person, who does not want to obey the commands of the Holy One, might as well serve foreign gods. He does not want to obey the commandments of the Holy One. Therefore, you, Saul, have also shamed the words of the Holy One. That is why your kingdom has become disgusting before God, and your kingship over Israel.
“<i>Saul said to Samuel</i>” [15:24]. Saul said: I have sinned that I have transgressed the words of God and also your words. I was afraid of the people and I listened to them. Therefore, I ask you to forgive my sins and go with me that I will ask God that He should pardon me. Samuel responded: I will not go with you. You have shamed the words of God. Therefore, God will not have you as a king. Samuel wanted to turn away to go and Saul held him and tore his garment. Saul held on strongly to Samuel’s garment and that is why the garment of Samuel tore.
“<i>Samuel said to him</i>” [15:28]. Samuel said to Saul: God has torn away the kingship from you and will give the kingship to your associate who will be better than you are. Some sages say that he tore the garment of Samuel. This is an <i>allusion</i> to David who would tear off the garment of Saul and would have the kingship. Some say that Saul tore his own garment, since it is the custom of the righteous to tear their garments when they have troubles.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, I Samuel, <i>Remez</i>, 123.</i>
“<i>Moreover, the Glory of Israel does not deceive</i>” [15:29]. Samuel said: Though your kingship will be ended, but Israel will remain eternal and the Holy One will preserve the good that Israel has been promised.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, I Samuel, 15:29.</i>
“<i>And he said, I have sinned</i>” [15:30]. Saul said: I have committed sins. Honor me before Israel and come with me and I will bow down to the Holy One. Samuel went with Saul and Saul bowed down to God.
“<i>Samuel said</i>” [15:32]. Samuel said: bring <i>Agag</i>, the king of the Amalekites, here to me. <i>Agag</i> went very proudly and not sadly, like a king should go when he goes to his death. He desired that they should kill him quickly. Some sages say that he went to Samuel, bound with iron chains. Agag said: why has the bitter death come so close.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, I Samuel, <i>Remez</i>, 123.</i>
“<i>Samuel said</i>” [15:33]. Samuel said to Agag: you have made many women widows and have castrated many men. You threw their circumcision to heaven and said to the Holy One: take the circumcision that you commanded Israel. Samuel said to Agag: now, your mother will mourn more than other women and Samuel hacked <i>Agag</i> to death in <i>Gilgal.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, I Samuel, <i>Remez</i>, 123.</i>

Parashat Parah

<b>[Ezekiel, 36:16–38]</b>
“<i>The word of the Lord came to me</i>” [36:16]. “<i>You, O mortal, etc.</i>” [36:17]. God said: you person, see. Israel is sitting on their land and they have made the land unclean through their evil deeds. Like a woman who is menstruating, so too are their ways in My eyes. Why are they compared to a menstruating woman? The explanation is that the Holy One wanted that Israel should repent and hoped that they will come to God again; that they will be pious, like a man whose wife is menstruating and he hopes that she will soon immerse herself and will come to him. So too is the Holy One with Israel. He compares them to a menstruating woman and hopes that they will immerse themselves, that is to say, become pious.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ezekiel, 36:16.</i>
“<i>So I poured out My wrath</i>” [36:18]. The Holy One said: I have poured out My wrath on them because they have spilled blood and made the land unclean with foreign gods.
“<i>And I scattered them</i>” [36:19]. I have scattered them among the nations because of their evil deeds.
“<i>But when they came to those nations</i>” [36:20]. They will come to the nations and My name will be profaned, when the nations will say, your God, <i>heaven forbid</i>, has no power to protect His people Israel. This is a great <i>profanation of God</i>’<i>s name.</i>
“<i>But I have concern</i>” [36:21]. I will have compassion on Israel because of My holy name, that it should not be profaned among the nations.
“<i>Therefore, say to the house of Israel</i>” [36:22]. The Holy One said: go and say to Israel. I do not want to redeem you for your sake, but for the sake of My holy name. I want to sanctify My name that was profaned among the nations. I alone am God and I want to take you to Me from the nations and all the lands. And thus said the Holy One: if you will think, what will it help us that we will again come into the holy land when the land cannot suffer the sins. We will again be driven out. The person has an Evil Inclination, and the person must commit sins, as the verse says, “<i>for there is not one good man on earth who does what is best and does not sin</i>” [Ecclesiastes, 7:20]. Therefore, the verse says here, “<i>I will sprinkle clean water upon you</i>” [36:25]. That is to say, the Holy One says, I will sprinkle clean water to cleanse you.
“<i>I will give you a new heart</i>” [36:26]. I will give you a new heart that you will follow and listen to what I, God, will command you and will remove the Evil Inclination from you. I will give you a soft heart.
“<i>And my spirit</i>” [36:27]. I will put My good <i>spirit</i> into you, so that you will fulfill My commandments, so that you will no longer sin. Therefore, do not fear that you will again be driven out of the land; you will dwell forever in the land. I will help you with your transgressions. I will cause that you will have much grain. I will give much rain so that you will have no hunger. I will give you good fruits so that you should no longer be disgraced because of hunger, among the nations.
“<i>You will remember</i>” [36:31]. You will remember your evil ways and the evil deeds that you did. You will remind yourselves and you will say that it is just that the Holy One dispersed us previously from our land, because we committed great sins. Therefore, the Holy One was just when the Holy One threw us out of the land.
“<i>Not for your sake</i>” [36:32]. The Holy One said: not for your sake did I do it. It will be to make known to all the nations, that I am God. Therefore, Israel be ashamed of your evil deeds.
“<i>Thus says the Lord</i>” [36:33]. Thus says the Lord. When I will cleanse you of your sins, then I will build your cities, those that were wiped out by the sword. Now the whole land will be built for all the people.
“<i>They will say, the land</i>” [36:35]. They will say, this land was desolate and has become very beautiful, like the Garden of Eden.
“<i>The nations will know</i>” [36:36]. All the foreigners that will remain among you will know and they will say, I am God, that I have built the cities that were desolate.
“<i>Thus says the Lord</i>” [36:37]. Thus says the Lord. I will respond to Israel, to make them as numerous as the sheep.
“<i>Like sheep for sacrifices</i>” [36:38]. Israel will be as numerous as the holy sheep that are brought to Jerusalem for the festivals. So will be the cities that were destroyed. They will be full of people and they will know that I am God.
We will write several <i>midrashim</i> about the <i>haftorah:</i> The <i>Tanhuma</i> writes: “<i>like the uncleanness of a menstruating woman</i>” [36:17]. Why did the Holy One compare them to a menstruating woman and not to the uncleanness of a corpse? The explanation is that a menstruating woman is sometimes unclean and sometimes she becomes clean, when she immerses herself. Similarly, when a woman is menstruating, the priest can be in her house, but when a corpse is in the house, then the priest must leave the house. Therefore, should the uncleanness of Israel be compared to a corpse, then the Holy One would not have been among them, just like the priest is not in the house with a corpse. However, now that the Holy One has compared them to a menstruating woman, the Holy One is among Israel in the exile and hopes that they will immerse themselves and become pious, like a husband who hopes that his wife will immerse herself.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Ezekiel, <i>Remez</i>, 374.</i>
“<i>When they came to those nations</i>” [36:20].<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Though the translations translate this verse in the plural, the original Hebrew has it in the singular and that is the basis of the discussion. Rashi, Ezekiel, 36:20.</i> One asks a question. It is written here, he came under the nations. It should properly say, <i>and they came</i>, and Israel came under the nations, that there were many Israelites. The answer is that it means that the Holy One is one individual. Therefore, it is written, “<i>and he came</i>,” as if one person came. When Israel was exiled among the nations, it is as if the Holy One was also exiled among the nations. When Israel is in exile and trouble, then the Holy One is also, <i>as it were</i>, as the verse says, “<i>in all their troubles He was troubled</i>” [Isaiah, 63:9].
The Talmud says in [tractate] <i>Sukkah.</i> The Evil Inclination has seven names. He is called <i>bad</i> and that is what the Holy One called him. Moses Our Teacher gave him the second name. He called him <i>uncircumcised. David called him</i> the third name, <i>unclean. Solomon</i> gave him the fourth name and <i>called him enemy.</i> He is a proper enemy and is the enemy of Israel and all people. <i>Isaiah</i> called him by his fifth name, <i>stumbling block.</i> He makes the person stumble. <i>Ezekiel</i> called him the sixth name in this <i>haftorah</i>, <i>stone.</i> This is because the Evil Inclination lies in the road, waiting and wanting to cause the person to fall into sin. <i>Joel</i> gave him the seventh name and called him, <i>hidden one.</i> The Evil Inclination is hidden and shows himself to the person in the hope that he will not protect himself.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Sukkah</i> 52a; <i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Ezekiel, <i>Remez</i>, 375.</i>
“<i>People like sheep</i>” [36:37]. The Tanhuma writes that he compares Israel to a sheep. How is a sheep or a goat and breaks a good tree in the garden and the master of the sheep does nothing to the sheep. Similarly, the Holy One does nothing to Israel when they commit sins. He compares them again in the verse to a person. That is to say, when Israel are pious and fulfill commandments, He pays them with a good reward that is appropriate for a person. That is to say, He compares them <i>for good.</i> That is, once to a sheep that has no sense. Therefore, He does not punish them when they commit sins. Just like later, they are like a person who has sense, expecting to pay them a good reward for their fulfilled commandments.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanhuma,</i> (ed.

Parashat HaChodesh

<b>[Ezekiel, 45:16–46:18]</b>
“<i>The entire population</i>” [45:16]. They should make this <i>contribution</i> to the prince that he should bring sacrifices. That is to say, Israel all together must give contributions that sacrifices should be brought to atone for all of Israel and for the prince. However, the prince should only bring sacrifices on <i>holidays</i> and <i>New Moons</i> and on the Sabbaths, to atone for all of Israel.
“<i>Thus says the Lord</i>” [45:18]. Thus says God, on <i>the first of Nisan</i> the priest should take an ox that has no blemish and you should purify the Temple with it.
“<i>The priest shall take</i>” [45:19]. The priest should take some of the blood and put it on the doorposts of the Temple and on the four corners of the ledge of the altar and the doorposts of the door of the lower courtyard.
“<i>You shall do the same on the seventh day of the month</i>” [45:20]. Furthermore, they should take sacrifices on the seventh day of the month of <i>Nisan.</i> This was done because there were Israelites who were happy that they began to bring sacrifices on the first day of the month of <i>Nisan</i> and out of great joy some Israelites went into the interior of the Temple where they were not supposed to go. They were foolish and they were not afraid to enter. Therefore, they should bring sacrifices to atone for these people. On the fourteenth day of <i>Nisan</i> you should bring the <i>Paschal sacrifice</i> and you should eat unleavened bread for seven days.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Ezekiel, 45:20.</i>
“<i>The prince should provide</i>” [45:22]. The prince should provide an ox for himself and for all of Israel on that day.
“<i>On the seven days of the festival</i>” [45:23]. He should bring burnt offerings to God for seven days, seven oxen and seven rams and one goat for a <i>sin offering.</i>
“<i>And a meal offering of an ephah</i>” [45:24]. He should bring a meal offering, one measure for the ox and one measure for the <i>ram</i> and a pitcher of oil for each measure.
“<i>On the seventh month</i>” [45:25]. When <i>the month of Tishrei</i> will come, the seventh month after <i>Nisan</i>, on the fifteenth day of the month, you shall make booths for seven days and bring sacrifices like on Passover, <i>sin offerings, burnt offerings</i>, meal offerings, and oil.
“<i>Thus said the Lord</i>” [46:1]. Thus said the Holy One: the door of the courtyard, which is the innermost of the Temple, should be closed during the week, but on the Sabbath and New Moon, it should be open.
“<i>The prince shall enter</i>” [46:2]. The <i>prince</i> shall go through the vestibule outside the door and should stand at the door. The priests should bring the sacrifices and he should bow at the threshold and he should go out, but the door should remain open, awaiting whoever will come to bow, should come and bow at the door. The door was opposite the door of the <i>Sanctuary.</i>
“<i>They will bow</i>” [46:3]. The people should bow on the Sabbath and New Moon before God. From here we learn that it is a great <i>mitzvah</i> to bow when one comes into the synagogue. This is compared to bowing in the Temple. Each synagogue is compared to the Temple.
“<i>The burnt offering</i>” [46:4]. The burnt offering that the prince brings on the Sabbath should be six sheep and a ram.
“<i>And the meal offering</i>” [46:6]. He should bring a meal offering, one measure for the ram. For the sheep, he should bring a meal offering that he can afford, and one pitcher of oil for the measure.
“<i>On the day of the New Moon</i>” [46:6]. On the day of the New Moon he should bring an ox, six sheep and one ram, one measure for the ox and one meal offering for the ram. For the sheep, he should make a meal offering according to what he can afford and one pitcher of oil for the measure.
“<i>When the prince enters</i>” [46:8]. The way that the prince entered is how he should leave. He should not make a shortcut to go out, as if it hurt him to be in the Temple and he wanted to leave quickly. Rather, he should leave slowly. From here we learn that one should not run out of the synagogue. One should not say that the synagogue was too difficult for him, and he runs out quickly. However, ordinary Israelites, when they came for the festivals, they should leave by the door opposite the one that they came in. This is so that they should see how beautiful are all the sides of the Temple and the prince should go among them. On the festivals, the meal offering should be one measure for the ox and one measure for the <i>ram</i>; for the sheep, as much as he can afford and one pitcher of oil for each <i>measure.</i>
“<i>When the prince offers</i>” [46:12]. When the prince would make an <i>offering, burnt offering and offering of well being</i>, he should open the <i>eastern</i> door, just like on the <i>Sabbath.</i> He should go out and should close the door behind him.
“<i>A lamb of the first year</i>” [46:13]. They should offer a sheep as a <i>burnt offering</i> every day in the morning and a <i>meal offering</i>, one-sixth part of a measure and a third of a pitcher to mix the choice flour, a <i>meal offering</i> to God forever.
“<i>Thus said the Lord</i>” [46:16]. Thus said God: The prince who wants to give a <i>present</i> to his son during his lifetime this <i>present</i> remains his forever. However, when someone gives something to his slave who served him, the <i>present</i> remains his until the <i>Jubilee year</i> comes. The <i>Jubilee</i> is once every fifty years. <i>After the Jubilee</i>, the slave’s present reverts to the prince. The prince should not take away a field and give it to his children. Every Israelite should retain his own field, his own goods and money. The haftorah says that when the Messiah comes, all this will happen, and the prince will behave, as he should. It is known that the Messiah will come in the <i>month of Nisan.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Rosh Hashanah,</i> 11a.</i> Therefore, we read this haftorah near the month of Nisan and sometimes on the <i>New Moon of Nisan.</i>

Shabbat HaGadol

<b>[Malachi, 3:4–24]</b>
“<i>Then the offerings of Judah and Jerusalem will be pleasing</i>” [3:4]. The offerings of Judah and Jerusalem will be pleasing, like they were accepted in the distant past and forever. That is to say, the Holy One will purify Israel in the exile. Afterwards, they will be pious and the Holy One will accept their sacrifices.
“<i>I will draw near to you for judgment</i>” [3:5]. The Holy One said: I will have a judgment with Israel and those that have accepted their judgment in this world, it is good. However, those who did not accept their judgment in this world, I will judge them in the next world.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Malachi, 3:5.</i>
The Talmud states in [tractate] <i>Hagigah. Rabbi Johanan</i> wept when they came to this verse. He said: a servant whose master brings him to <i>judgment or a court</i>, how will he succeed against his master, when his master testifies against his servant? So here too, the Holy One says, “<i>I will be swift to bear witness</i>” [3:5]. I will be a witness and testify against Israel about the sins that Israel committed. <i>Rabbi Levi</i> said: each person who did not give justice to a stranger, a widow or an orphan, it is as if he had not given justice to the Holy One. It is written here, “<i>who subvert the stranger</i>” [3:5]. That is to say, the one who does not judge the poor justly, this is as if he would not judge Me justly.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Hagigah,</i> 5a.</i>
“<i>I will be swift to bear witness against the sorcerers and the adulterers</i>” [3:5]. The Holy One said: I am a witness to quickly testify against those who pursue sorcery and adultery, those who steal from widows and orphans, and they do not see Me. Thus says the Lord.
“<i>For I the Lord do not change</i>” [3:6]. God said: that which I promised you that even if it wouldn’t come for many years, yet it will come. I, God, keep My word and My statements do not change. That which the <i>prophets</i> said for My sake, will certainly come. You, Israel, will not be lost eternally, like other nations were lost.
“<i>Ever since the day of your ancestors you have turned from My laws</i>” [3:7]. If you would say that if I truly loved you, why have I given you such a long exile? I will tell you. For many years, you and your ancestors have done evil. Now, repent and return to Me. You will say: with what shall we return and repent? The Holy One responds: “<i>should man rob God, yet you are robbing Me</i>” [3:8]. The Holy One said: how does a person rob his God like you are robbing Me? You give no tithes and no terumah.
“<i>You are cursed with a curse</i>” [3:9]. You were diminished and cursed because of other sins that you are guilty of, in addition to not giving tithes and <i>terumah.</i> They are all alike. None of them observed these commandments. However, not all of them transgressed the other commandments.
“<i>Bring the full tithe</i>” [3:10]. Bring the tithes into My house so that My priests and levites should have enough food to do the service in the Temple. The Holy One said: test Me with tithes and giving charity, if I will not bless you with good rain. I will open My windows in heaven to bring blessings down to you, that you will say yourself that it is enough.
The Talmud says in the first chapter of [tractate] <i>Ta</i>’<i>anit.</i> Rabbi Johanan found a child going home from his teacher and he said to the child. What did you study with your teacher? The child said: I studied, “<i>you shall set aside a tenth</i>” [Deuteronomy, 14:22]. The child said to <i>Rabbi Johanan:</i> what is the meaning of this verse? <i>Rabbi Johanan</i> said: give the tithe in the hope that you will become rich. The child said: can we test the Holy One? It is written, “<i>Do not try the Lord, your God</i>” [Deuteronomy, 6:16]. You should not test the Holy One. <i>Rabbi Johanan</i> responded: it is written here, “<i>bring the full tithe into the house, etc.</i>” [3:10]. God said, test me. I will give you enough money and grain so that you will not have enough vessels into which to put the grain.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Ta</i>’<i>anit,</i> 9a.</i>
“<i>I will banish the locusts from you, so that they will not destroy the yield of your soil, etc.</i>” [3:11]. I, God, will rebuke the locusts so that they will not eat your grain and your vineyards, which will grow properly.
“<i>All the nations will account you happy</i>” [3:12]. All the nations will praise you, instead of being shamed among the nations. The [Midrash] <i>Yelamdenu</i> writes: when someone praises his friend or his lover, this is nothing novel. However, when someone praises his enemy, this is a novelty and an honor to the person who is praised by his enemy.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Malachi, <i>Remez,</i> 590.</i>
“<i>You have spoken harsh words against Me</i>” [3:13]. He punished Israel one more time. Your words are harsh against Me. That is to say, you speak much against Me and you say, what sins have we done and you say, the world goes by itself and the Holy One does not guide it.
“<i>You have said: it is useless to serve God</i>” [3:14]. You said: what does serving God and keeping His commandments help us, and that we bow down before the Holy One?
“<i>Now we account the arrogant happy</i>” [3:15]. You say: we will praise the evildoers who do everything evil and things go very well for them. Let us attempt to test God and see if He can cause us to escape all the evil.
“<i>Then those who fear the Lord</i>” [3:16]. The righteous who fear the Holy One will hear that the people are speaking this way and denying the Holy One. They say to one another, God is right in all His deeds and does correct judgment to each one according to their deeds.
“<i>The Lord has heard and noted it and has written a scroll</i>” [3:16]. The Holy One heard the words of the righteous that they speak thusly. The righteous will persuade the evildoers to do good and fulfill the commandments. The Holy One will pay them a good reward for this. The Holy One will also inscribe this in a book <i>as a reminder</i> that they should be paid a good reward. So too, those who think of the name of the Holy One for good.
“<i>They shall be Mine, says the Lord of Hosts on the day, etc.</i>” [3:17]. It will be in that day, on the day that I will judge the evildoers, the righteous will be a people praised by Me and I will have mercy on them, like a father has compassion on his son that has been faithful to his father.
“<i>And you will come to see</i>” [3:18]. Similarly, they will understand who is an evildoer or who is righteous.
“<i>For that day is at hand, burning like an oven</i>” [3:19]. When the day will come to do judgment on the evildoers.

“<i>You will trample the evildoers, for thy will be dust beneath your feet</i>” [3:21]. You righteous ones will trample the evildoers with your feet. Then the evildoers will be dust under the feet of the righteous. The righteous ones have lain under the feet of the evildoers long enough.
“<i>Remember the teachings of My servant Moses</i>” [3:22]. The Holy One said: you Israel are pious because you keep the Torah that Moses has given you. The Day of Judgment will come and you will be protected from the harsh judgment.
“<i>Lo, I will send you the prophet Elijah</i>” [3:23]. I will send you <i>the prophet Elijah</i> one day before the Messiah will come and before the <i>day of judgment</i> will come, in the hope that Elijah will make Israel, the fathers and the children, pious to God.
<i>Midrash Rabbah</i> writes. The sun has a covering and it goes out in this covering. Without it, it might burn up the whole world and that is why it has a covering. A river of water flows before the sun and when the sun is supposed to rise to shine over the world, the Holy One weakens the fire of the sun with that water so that it should not burn up all the people in the world. However, when the Messiah will come, the Holy One will allow the sun to go naked over the world.

Moses responded: how can I boast about the Torah that You have given it to me? You, Holy One, reminded me of it every day in heaven that I should say that You have given it to me.

First Day of Passover

<b>[Joshua, 3:5–7; 5:2–6:1]</b>
“<i>Joshua said to the people</i>” [3:5]. <i>Joshua</i> said to the people. Prepare yourselves, tomorrow the Holy One will show His wonders among you. He said to the <i>priests:</i> carry <i>the Ark with the Tablets</i> before the people and the people should follow.
“<i>The Lord said to Joshua</i>” [3:7]. God said to <i>Joshua:</i> This day I will begin to make you important in the eyes of <i>all of Israel</i>, expecting that Israel may know that I will show with you, just like I showed with Moses, that you are a prophet as proper as Moses. I split the sea for him, so too I will also split the <i>Jordan</i> before <i>all of Israel</i> through your hand.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Joshua, 3:7.</i>
“<i>At that time, the Lord said</i>” [5:2]. At that time the Holy One said to Joshua: sharpen your <i>flint knives</i> and circumcise Israel a second time, since <i>Abraham Our Father did not do the periah.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Periah</i>, is the uncovering of the corona, a part of the circumcision.</i> Therefore, the Holy One commanded <i>Joshua that he should do the periah</i> for Israel, as something new when they came across the Jordan. The Israelites did not circumcise themselves or their children in the desert because the north wind did not blow for forty years. Israel were in the desert and it is not good for someone to circumcise themselves and cause a wound. Why did the north wind not blow for the full forty years? The reason is that Israel were as if they had been <i>excommunicated</i> for the forty years and that is why the good wind from the north did not blow. Another reason that the wind was not there in the desert is that He spread the good clouds over them. The good clouds surrounded Israel and therefore there was no wind from the north. Israel took all the <i>foreskins</i> and the blood from the <i>circumcisions</i> and they made a big pile from them and covered it with ashes. When <i>Balaam</i> saw that there was a large pile of <i>foreskins</i>, from those who had been in the desert, he said: who can count the ashes that Israel used to cover their <i>foreskins</i> in the desert. That is to say, <i>Balaam</i> said that nobody could do anything to Israel because they have the <i>commandment of circumcision.</i> They were warned not to have <i>illicit sex</i>, because the Holy One loves them very much. That is why Balaam later gave advice that they should cause the Israelites to sin with the daughters of Midian. He said that God hates those who pursue illicit sex. They caused many thousands to fall because of illicit sex. Therefore, <i>Balaam</i> said: Israel has the <i>commandment of circumcision</i>, and they made a big pile of <i>foreskins</i> in order to loved in the eyes of God. They do not pursue illicit sex because they are circum- cised with the circumcision. The Israelites observed the <i>commandment of circumcision</i> until the days of the <i>prophet Elijah.</i> They did not circumcise themselves and the <i>prophet Elijah</i> adjured the heavens that they should not give rain and dew. <i>Jezebel</i>, the wife of <i>Ahab</i>, heard about this and wanted to kill Elijah, and Elijah ran away to Mount <i>Horeb.</i> The Holy One came to him. What are you doing here Elijah? Elijah said: I had to run away because Israel did not observe the [commandment of] circumcision and I wanted to take <i>revenge</i> against Israel. The Holy One said: You, Elijah, are always zealous and do not want to tolerate that Israel should commit sins in the city of <i>Shittim.</i> When the Israelites had illicit sexual relations with the daughters of Midian, you killed a prince because of illicit sexual relations. Now too that Israel did not observe the circumcision, you are taking revenge. Therefore, you should also enjoy the merit and Israel should not make a circumcision without having a separate chair for you to sit upon during the circumcision.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Joshua, <i>Remez</i>, 15.</i>
Our sages say that Elijah was Phinehas, who killed a prince of Israel in the desert because of illicit sexual relations. He lived for four hundred years and he went up to heaven alive. Because <i>Elijah</i> had taken revenge in the desert because of illicit sexual relations and also because of the <i>circumcision</i>, whoever observes [the commandment of] circumcision, does not come to illicit sexual relations. As a result of the two acts of <i>revenge</i> that Elijah did, he has the merit that a chair is prepared for him at every <i>circumcision.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Pirke de Rabbi Eliezer</i>, chap. 29; <i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Joshua, <i>Remez</i>, 15.</i>
“<i>This is the reason why Joshua had the circumcision performed</i>” [5:4]. For this reason, <i>Joshua</i> circumcised the <i>Israelites</i> because the children that were born in the desert had not been circumcised in the desert. Therefore, they now had to be circumcised. Another reason was that he admonished Israel that they circumcise themselves so that they should know that they would not come into the Holy Land. You must circumcise yourselves since the Holy Land, the <i>land of Israel</i>, belongs to the Holy One. That is to say, the Holy One is the king of the land of Israel. Other lands have kings placed over them. That is why whoever pursues illicit sex in the land of Israel, the land spits them out and throws them out. However, in other lands that have kings over them, if they pursue illicit sex, the land is not so holy. Therefore, they remain in their land. That is why Joshua said to Israel, you are coming into a holy land. Therefore, <i>circumcise</i> yourselves in the hope that you will not come to illicit sexual relations.
“<i>All the people were circumcised</i>” [5:5]. The verse tells us that the Israelites did circumcise themselves in Egypt, but they all died out because they commit- ted sins and <i>Joshua</i> circumcised their children. As they were all circumcised, they stayed in one place until they were all healed from the circumcision.
“<i>And the Lord said to Joshua</i>” [5:9]. The <i>Holy One</i> said to <i>Joshua:</i> today I will remove the disgrace of Egypt. The Egyptians said that an evil star appeared in the desert over Israel. That is to say, the Egyptians said that the Israelites should not go into the desert because of the star. It showed that the Israelites would be killed because of the [golden] Calf. However, the Holy One reversed the star over the blood of <i>circumcision.</i> That is to say, Israelite blood was shed through the circumcision. It was for good that they were injured. Therefore, the Holy One said that the disgrace that the <i>Egyptians</i> said that a bloody star is over Israel, would be removed through the <i>circumcision.</i> The Egyptians would say that the blood of the star means the blood of the circumcision. That is, the Israelites should have been killed because of the [Golden] Calf, since there was illicit sex at the incident of the [Golden] Calf, as the verse says, “<i>they rose to revel</i>” [Exodus, 32:6]. Rashi interprets it as, they engaged in illicit sex. However, now that the Israelites had been circumcised, they no longer went after illicit sex. The sin of the [Golden] Calf, that is illicit sexual relations, had been removed through the circumcision.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Joshua, 5:9; <i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Joshua, <i>Remez</i>, 15.</i>
“<i>And the Israelites rested</i>” [5:10]. And the Israelites rested in <i>Gilgal</i> and they celebrated the <i>Passover</i> in the plains of <i>Jericho.</i>
“<i>They ate the produce of the land</i>” [5:11].

Moses died on the seventh day of the <i>month of Adar</i> and the <i>manna</i> fell on that day. The Israelites collected the same <i>manna</i> and ate from it for thirtynine days, until the sixteenth day of <i>Nisan.</i> The offered the Omer, a baked cake made of new barley.

“<i>Once when Joshua was near Jericho, he looked up and saw a man</i>” [5:13]. When Joshua passed <i>Jericho</i> he saw an angel standing before him with a drawn sword. Joshua went up to him and said, have you come to help us or to fight with us? The angel responded: I am an <i>angel</i> of God. You have not seen me walking, but I have come down from heaven in an instant. Joshua immediately fell upon his face, bowed down and said to the angel, what do you desire?

The king sent for and assembled all the <i>elders of Judah and Jerusalem.</i> The king went up to the <i>Temple</i> along with the priests, the prophets and all the people from small to great. He read the Torah before them in the Temple. The king stood at the reader’s desk and made a <i>covenant</i> and an <i>oath</i> with Israel that they should go in God’s path with their whole hearts.
“<i>The king ordered Hilkiah</i>” [23:4]. The king commanded the high priest, who was called <i>Hilkiah</i>, and the other priests who were with him and the other nobles who were appointed in the Temple to bring out all the vessels that had been made for the idols and they should be burned outside the city of Jerusalem in the fields of <i>Kidron</i> and they should take the ashes to the house that was the <i>primary place of worship of foreign gods.</i> They should disperse the people and the <i>priests</i> who served these <i>foreign gods.</i> They took the linden trees that had been in the <i>Temple</i> outside the city of <i>Jerusalem</i> to the valley of <i>Kidron</i> and they burned them and threw the ashes on the <i>graves.</i> They tore down all the buildings where the <i>foreign gods</i> had been worshipped and where the women had cried and wove the beautiful tapestries and hangings for the linden trees. All of this was destroyed and torn down.
“<i>He brought all the priests</i>” [23:8]. <i>King Josiah</i> gathered all the <i>priests</i> from the cities of <i>Judah</i> and <i>defiled</i> all the houses and offering stools of their <i>foreign gods.</i> They commanded that all the <i>animal carcasses</i> should be thrown there, to show that their <i>foreign gods</i> were <i>unclean.</i>
“<i>However, the priests of the high places did not come up</i>” [23:9]. The king took the <i>priests</i>, the descendants of <i>Aaron</i>, into the <i>Temple</i> who had served the <i>foreign gods</i>, and they had to clean out all the <i>foreign gods.</i> However, he did not allow them to do any work with the sacrifices to the Holy One. He considered them as if they had a defect, and they could not participate in the <i>worship</i> of God. However, they were given some <i>parts of the sacrifices</i> to eat.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, II Kings, 23:9.</i>
“<i>The king commanded</i>” [23:21]. The king commanded that they should celebrate the Passover to God, as is written in the Torah. Israel had not celebrated <i>Passover</i> for a long time, but in the eighteenth year of <i>King Josiah</i> they celebrated the <i>Passover</i> to God in Jerusalem. Also, <i>King Josiah</i> cleaned out all the <i>foreign gods</i> and all the images that were in the land of <i>Judah and in Jerusalem</i>, in the hope that they would keep the Torah of God.
“<i>There was no king like him before</i>” [23:25]. There was no king like Josiah before him in piety. He was pious with his whole heart and after him there was no king as pious as Josiah. Some sages say that Josiah was evil at first and later repented. Some sages say that he was always righteous. If so, what is the meaning of “<i>who turned back to the Lord</i>” [23:25]? That is, he had repented and if he had not committed any sins, he would not have to repent. The explanation is that all the cases that Josiah ruled on, from the time he became king until the eighteenth year of his reign, he returned each litigants money. That is to say, he said: perhaps I did not rule properly in my youth. Therefore, King Josiah took money out of his purse and returned it to each one where he had <i>ruled.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Shabbat,</i> 56b; <i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, II Kings, <i>Remez</i>, 247.</i> From here we should learn how very meritorious it is to properly <i>judge cases.</i> The redemption will come from just rulings. Amen.

Intermediate Shabbat of Passover

<b>[Ezekiel, 36:37–37:14]</b>
“<i>Thus says the Lord</i>” [36:37]. Thus says God. I will do My good for Israel to make them as numerous as the sheep, like the numerous sheep that are brought for the many <i>sacrifices</i> for the <i>festival</i>, three times a year, so numerous should also be Israel. The cities that were desolate will be full of people, and they will know that I am God.
“<i>The hand of the Lord came upon me</i>” [37:1]. <i>Ezekiel</i> said: the words of God came upon me and the <i>spirit</i> took me out into a field that was full of bones. The <i>spirit</i> caused me to go around the bones and they were all over the field and they were very dry. God said to me: will the bones live again? I said: you God know well if they will live. The Holy One showed him with this that he caused the dead to live, and that Israel in the exile are like the dry bones and the Holy One will take them out, just like He made the bones alive. <i>Rashi</i> writes that <i>Ezekiel</i> was a priest who was not supposed to go near the dead. That is why the verse says here that <i>Ezekiel</i> went around the dead, in the hope that he should not go among the dead to become <i>impure.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ezekiel, 37:2.</i>
“<i>Then He said to me, prophesy</i>” [37:4]. God said to me: prophesy over the bones and say to the dry bones, understand the word of God. The Holy One said thusly to the bones, I will bring a spirit into you and you will live.
“<i>There were sinews on them</i>” [37:6]. I will give you sinews, flesh, skin and a spirit and you will live. You will know that I am God. One asks a question. Why did <i>Ezekiel</i> first talk about giving sinews and then flesh and then skin? <i>Job</i> said to the Holy One. You have given me a skin over my body and then he says, you have given me flesh and then he says, you have surrounded me with bones and sinews. The explanation is that <i>Job</i> said and praised God the way God had created him in his mother’s womb.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Job, 10:11.</i> There, the Holy One first created skin and then flesh and then bone and sinews. However, with <i>Ezekiel</i> the bones had previously been people and each person had been created. Therefore, <i>Ezekiel</i> said sinews first and then flesh and then skin.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Ezekiel, <i>Remez</i>, 377.</i> It is a parable. When a person takes off his clothing, he first takes off his jacket, then his shirt and if he wants to get dressed again he must first put on the shirt and then the jacket. So it is with these bones. First they put on the sinews on their body. They were inside the body, and then flesh that is on the body and then the skin that is on the outside of the body over the flesh, like a jacket is over the body.
“<i>I prophesied</i>” [37:10]. I prophesied to the bones. There was a sound and a noise as the bones banged together as they had been created. I saw sinews, flesh and skin on the bones, but there was no spirit in them. The Holy One said to me: you must say to the spirit that God said from all four directions where the souls spread from the bones, they should now again come into the bones and the bones should live again. As soon as I said this, a spirit appeared and they came to life and they stood up on their feet and they were a great multitude. God said to me: these bones were the children of Israel. They said that our hope is lost, and they did not seek the help of the Holy One. Thus said the Holy One: I showed with the bones that Israel should know that I will make them live in the days of the Messiah, as if they had lain in the earth in the exile for a thousand years or more.
Some sages said that the dead from <i>outside the land of Israel</i> will rise from their <i>graves</i> and will go to the land of Israel. Some other sages said that the dead from <i>outside the land of Israel</i> would have to roll in the earth until they will come to the land of Israel, in the days of the Messiah. The truth is that here was shown that the sages told the truth. The dead <i>outside the land of Israel</i> will rise from their graves and will walk to the land of Israel in the days of the Messiah. They will not roll through the earth with pain, since it is written here, “<i>I will lift you out of your graves, My people, and bring you to the land of Israel</i>” [37:12]. That is to say, I will bring you out of your graves and will bring you to the land of Israel.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Genesis Rabbah,</i> 96.5.</i>
“<i>You shall know that I am the Lord</i>” [37:13]. Say to Israel that they should know that I am God. I will open your graves and I will bring you up to the land of Israel and I will give you a <i>spirit and intelligence.</i> You will live long and will not be driven out again. I, God, have said this and done it.
We will write <i>midrashim</i> and <i>Talmudic passages</i> relating to the <i>haftorah.</i> The <i>Pirke de Rabbi Eliezer</i> writes. The <i>dead</i> were those that were killed by <i>Nebuchadnezzar. Nebuchadnezzar</i> displayed an <i>image</i> and announced that whoever will not bow down to the image will be burned in a fire. The Israelites bowed down to the image, but <i>Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah</i> did not want to bow down to the image and they were thrown into the fire. <i>Michael</i> came and protected them from the fire. He said to Israel: you knew that you have a God who can protect you from the fire. Yet, you left Him and bowed down to the foreign god, that is nothing. That is, he falsely accused them in order to kill them. Therefore, he spoke to Israel in this way and <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i> immediately let them be killed. Twenty years later, <i>Ezekiel</i> brought them back to life. Since Ezekiel did not believe that those who were killed would live again, the Holy One asked him if those who were killed would live again. Ezekiel said: you, God, know this very well. That is to say, he did not believe that they could live. Therefore, God punished him and he was not buried in the land of Israel. Those who were killed were six hundred thousand, as many as those who left Egypt. They all stood up on their feet, but one man remained lying and did not live. <i>Ezekiel</i> asked why did he not rise? The Holy One said: all his life he took usury from Israel. Therefore, he must not rise and live, like the rest of Israel. With this, the Holy One showed that one who is usurious would not rise in the days of the Messiah. This was a hint as to how it will be for people when the Messiah will come.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Pirke de Rabbi Eliezer</i>, chap. 33; <i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Ezekiel, <i>Remez,</i> 375.</i>
It is a great sin to take usury, as is written in <i>Sefer Hasidim.</i> The Torah wrote that one should not engage in usury.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy, 23:20.</i> It is written near this Torah portion that one should not bring the wages of a prostitute to the Temple.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy, 23:19.</i> That is, whoever takes usurious interest; it is like he would bring the wages of a prostitute into the house of God. The person should not say, I will take <i>usury</i> and bring a sacrifice in the Temple from the profits, or I will buy matzoth with it. This is like bringing the wages of a prostitute.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer Hasidim</i>, para. 532 (Margulies ed.); para. 1958 (Wistinetski ed.).</i>
The Talmud writes in [tractate] Sanhedrin. The dead rose and sang songs of praise. “<i>The Lord kills and gives life</i>” [I Samuel, 2:6]. God brings to life through His grace and compassion. They married women and had children in the land of Israel. <i>Rabbi Judah the son of Betera</i> said: I am one of their descendants.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Sanhedrin,</i> 92b.</i>

Seventh Day of Passover

<b>[II Samuel, 22:1–50]</b>
“<i>David addressed the words of this song, etc.</i>” [22:1]. David composed this <i>song</i> when he had <i>rest</i> from all of his enemies <i>at the end of his days.</i> When God had rescued him from all of his enemies.
“<i>He said: O Lord, my crag, my fastness, my deliverer</i>” [22:2]. He praised God and said: You, God, are my strong rock and my refuge who protects me from my enemies.
“<i>My shield, my mighty champion, my fortress, etc.</i>” [22:3]. You God are my shield and protector, strong as a bison. You are my help in protecting me from holdup by robbers.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, II Samuel, 22:3.</i>
“<i>All praise. I called on the Lord and I was delivered from my enemies</i>” [22:4]. When I call upon God and pray with the same praise, God causes me to be helped from my <i>enemies.</i>
“<i>For the breakers of Death encompassed me, the torrents of Belial terrified me</i>” [22:5]. Great troubles that break the heart surrounded me with sorrows, like the woman who comes to lament over her child, who is in great pain. My troubles were similar, like a great river that comes with much force to flood. Thus did the troubles rush over me.
“<i>In my anguish I called on the Lord</i>” [22:7]. When I am in pain, I called on God and He accepted my prayers from heaven and my cry reached His ears.
“<i>Then the earth rocked and quaked</i>” [22:8]. When the Holy One will pour out His wrath on the nations that harmed Israel, the earth will tremble and the foundations of the heavens will tremble before the anger of the Holy One. It is as if smoke comes out of His nostrils, out of great anger, and fire issues from His mouth.
“<i>He bent the sky and came down, thick clouds beneath His feet</i>” [22:10]. When the Holy One took <i>revenge on Egypt</i> and on Pharaoh, the Holy One lowered His heaven and a fog beneath His feet.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, II Samuel, 22:10.</i>
“<i>He mounted a cherub and flew, etc.</i>” [22:11]. The Holy One rides a <i>cherub</i> and soars. He is seen on the wings of the angels called wind.
“<i>He made pavilions of darkness around Him, etc.</i>” [22:12]. The Holy One surrounds himself with darkness and great clouds with water around Him.
“<i>In the brilliance before Him, blazed fiery coals</i>” [22:13]. His fire gives light for the righteous that He loves and with the same fire, he burns the evildoers.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, II Samuel, 22:13.</i>
“<i>He let loose bolts, and scattered them; lightning and put them to rout</i>” [22:15]. The Holy One storms from Heaven, sends His arrows, and disperses them. He confuses the nations and makes them fall.
“<i>The bed of the sea was exposed, etc.</i>” [22:16]. When the Holy One scolded the sea and the mighty rivers, they became dry and the foundation of the world was seen. When the Holy One blew on it, the sea and the Jordan became dry because of Israel.
“<i>He reached down from on high, He took me, drew me out of the mighty waters</i>” [22:17]. The Holy One sends His angels and takes me out of all troubles and lifts me out of mighty waters. That is to say, great troubles are compared to mighty waters.
“<i>He delivered me from my strong enemy, from those who hated me</i>” [22:18]. The Holy One protects me from my enemies who are stronger than me. He rescued me from Goliath the Philistine.
“<i>They came upon me in the day of my calamity, but the Lord was my stay</i>” [22:19]. David said: When I ran away from Saul, my enemies ran before me and blocked my path and informed on me to Saul, but the Holy One helped me.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, II Samuel, 22:19.</i>
“<i>The Lord rewarded me according to my merit, he requited the cleanness of my hands</i>” [22:21]. The Holy One requites my justice and me. He rewards me for the cleanness of my hands, because I have kept the commandments of the Holy One and have not departed from the path of the Holy One. All the laws of the Holy One are before me and I do not remove myself from His laws.
“<i>With the loyal you have dealt loyally, with the blameless hero, blamelessly</i>” [22:26]. David said: A person who is pious with God’s deeds, the Holy One also show him His grace to do good things for him.
“<i>With the pure You act in purity, and with the perverse You are wily</i>” [22:27]. The Holy One is pure with the pure person. That is to say, He shows himself to be pure with him. The person who walks in a crooked path, the Holy One behaves crookedly with him.
“<i>To humble folk You give victory, and You look with scorn on the haughty</i>” [22:28]. The Holy One helps the one who holds himself humble, like a pauper. The Holy One makes the one who holds himself haughty, humble and low.
“<i>You, O lord, are my lamp, the Lord lights up my darkness</i>” [22:29]. David said: in my troubles, the Holy One shines on me and protects me.
“<i>With you, I can rush a barrier, with my God I can scale a wall</i>” [22:30]. With the help of God I will break the gates of many people, of the nations. With the help of God, I will jump over walls.
“<i>The way of God is pure. The word of the Lord, etc.</i>” [22:31]. The Holy One is whole and His words are true and pure to reward those who rely on His protection.
“<i>Yea, who is a god except the Lord, etc.</i>” [22:32]. Who is also like our God and where is there a creator like our God?
“<i>The God, my mighty stronghold, who kept my path secure</i>” [22:33]. The Holy One is my strength with many people. He opens my path to the war.
“<i>Who made my legs like a deer</i>’<i>s, and set me firm on the heights</i>” [22:34]. The Holy One, who makes my feet run swiftly like a hind, and He places me on the heights. He trains my hands for war. The Holy One who draws the bow to shoot the strong bow.
“<i>You have granted me the shield of Your protection</i>” [22:36]. You have given me a shield and a promise of Your help. Your courage makes my stride wide under my feet and my feet should not fall or slip.
“<i>I pursued my enemies and wiped them out, I did not turn back until I destroyed them</i>” [22:38]. I will pursue my enemies and destroy them. I will not leave them under my feet.
“<i>You have girt me with strength for battle, brought low my foes before me</i>” [22:40]. You have strengthened me with power for the war. You bring low my enemies beneath me. My enemies show me their backs. I want to cut down my enemies.
“<i>They looked, but there was none to deliver; to the Lord, but He answered them not</i>” [22:42]. They will pray to God, but the Holy One will not help them and not answer them.
“<i>I pounded them like dust and the earth, stamped, crushed, etc.</i>” [22:43]. I will crush them and grind them very fine, like the dust of the earth and like the mire in the streets. I will make them fine and trample them.
“<i>You have rescued me from the strife of peoples, kept me to be a ruler of nations</i>” [22:44]. You God have made me run away from my enemies, from Israel. This is, <i>Saul, Doeg and Ahitophel</i>, who were all Israelites. You protected me until I became a leader and a king over Israel, my people, that I could not force them to serve me.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, II Samuel, 22:44.</i>
“<i>Foreigners have cringed before me, paid me homage at the mere mention of me</i>” [22:45]. The <i>nations of the world</i> must repudiate their transgressions against me. They are afraid of me, to learn of their transgressions. As soon as I command them, they fear and do what I say.
“<i>Foreigners have lost courage, and come trembling out of their strongholds</i>” [22:46]. The nations will tremble and will limp because of travails and difficult prisons.
“<i>The Lord lives, blessed is my rock, exalted be God, the rock who gives me victory</i>” [22:47]. David was praising and said: God who is my creator, my help who lives forever.
“<i>The God who has vindicated me</i>” [22:48]. God, who gives me victories, places my enemies beneath me, extracts me from enemies and makes me elevated. He protects me from lawless people.
“<i>For this I sing Your praise among the nations and sing praises to Your name</i>” [22:50]. Therefore, I will praise you, God, among all the nations and I will sing to Your name.
“<i>Tower of victory to his king, etc.</i>” [22:50]. He greeted the help of his king, helps and does kindness to his anointed, to David and his children forever.
<i>Midrash Shohar Tov</i> writes concerning the verse “<i>He mounts a cherub</i>” [22:11]. When Pharaoh pursued Israel, Pharaoh said: give me a stallion that runs swiftly and I will swiftly pursue Israel. The Holy One also took a horse and rode it to help Israel. Pharaoh then said: give me a mare that runs even faster. She can urinate when she runs. However, a stallion that wants to urinate must stop and stand still. The Holy One responded: you evildoer, do you have a <i>cherub</i>, a bird, an angel that I fly upon? <i>Rabbi Aha</i> gives a parable about a king. <i>Robbers</i> came and kidnapped his son. The servants ran and quickly prepared the king’s chariot with many horses to chase after the <i>robbers.</i> The king said: by the time all the horses will be harnessed to the chariot, my son will be lost. The king quickly took a horse from the chariot and pursued them on the horse. The Holy One also did not want to tarry to ride His <i>Throne of Glory</i> with all of His <i>holy animals</i> and <i>cherubs.</i> He took a <i>cherub</i> from the <i>Throne of Glory</i> and He rode on it to wage war with Pharaoh.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Midrash Shohar Tov,</i> 18.14–15; <i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, II Samuel, <i>Remez</i>, 160.</i>
The Talmud writes in [tractate] <i>Sanhedrin</i>, <i>in chapter ten</i>, concerning the verse “<i>to a humble folk You give victory</i>” [22:28]. <i>Rabbi Yohanan</i> said: when you will see that Israel are humble in the exile and will be poor, then the Messiah will come and redeem them.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Sanhedrin</i>, 98a; <i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, II Samuel, <i>Remez</i> 161.</i> However, when Israel will be arrogant, then they will delay the Messiah. There are many among Israel who pursue arrogance and are poor. The Holy One hates this very much. When a wealthy person is ar- rogant, this is nothing new, because money and goods cause the pursuit of arrogance. The Talmud writes that there is nothing better for Israel than poverty, in the expectation that the Messiah should come, and they should not pursue arrogance. It does not help when they are poor and pursue arrogance. Similarly, the opposite, when one is poor and wants to be arrogant, he must acquire fine clothes and good food, in the hope that people will lend him money, and people should think that he is rich. This hinders the Messiah, and many other sins also come from the pursuit of arrogance.
<i>[Midrash] Shohar Tov</i> writes: <i>Rabbi Yudin</i> said in the name of <i>Rabbi Hama the son of Haninah.</i> When the Messiah will come, the Holy One will seat the Messiah at His right hand and Abraham at His left hand. Abraham became frightened and said: the Messiah is my descendant and sits at the right hand. I am their father, should I sit at the left hand? The Holy One placated Abraham and said: your descendant, the Messiah, sits on My right hand and I sit at your right hand. This is an honor for you, as the verse says in the <i>haftorah</i> “<i>your providence has made me great</i>” [22:36]. That is, your humility has made me important.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Midrash Shohar Tov,</i> 18.29; <i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, II Samuel, <i>Remez</i> 162.</i>
The Rabbati writes: There were four kings and each of the spoke differently to the Holy One. One of them was David, who prayed and said, “<i>I pursued my enemies and overtook them</i>” [Psalms, 18:38]. I will pursue my enemies and I will capture them and kill them. The Holy One heard his prayer and killed his enemies. Later there was a king called <i>Asa.</i> He said: I have no strength to kill the enemies, but I will pursue them and You, Holy One, should kill them. The Holy One said; I will do it, because concerning him it is written, “<i>for they broke before the Lord</i>” [II Chronicles, 14:12]. That is, they were killed before the Holy One. There was a king called <i>Jehosaphat.</i> He said before the Holy One. I do not even have the strength to pursue the enemies, but I will sing songs and will sing praises of God, and You, Holy One, pursue and kill the enemies. The Holy One said: I will do it. Sing the songs and I will pursue and kill them. Then there was a king called <i>Hezekiah.</i> He said before God. I cannot pursue and cannot kill and cannot sing songs, but I will sleep in my bed and You, Holy One, should kill the nations. The Holy One said: I will do it, as the verse says, “<i>an angel of the Lord went out and struck down in the Assyrian camp</i>” [Isaiah, 37:36].<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Lamentations Rabbati</i>, <i>Petihtah</i> 30; <i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, II Samuel, <i>Remez</i> 163.</i>
The <i>Tanhuma</i> writes. “<i>Your providence</i><sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">He translates the word as “humbleness,” based on a misunderstanding of the word.</i> <i>has made me great</i>” [22:36]. We do not find anyone as <i>humble</i> as the Holy One. A person says to his friend, let us go to <i>rejoice with the bride</i>, or <i>visit the sick</i>, or bury the dead. He responds: it is humiliating to go to the bride or the sick person or the dead. The Holy One does not consider Himself important. He adorned <i>Eve</i> Himself, since one should dress a bride beautifully and adorn her. He led her to her <i>groom</i>, <i>Adam.</i> Concerning Abraham, the Holy One visited Abraham on the third day after his circumcision. He appeared to Abraham and <i>visited him</i> when he was sick from the circumcision. The Holy One himself buried <i>Moses Our Teacher.</i> Therefore, no person should pursue arrogance and the Messiah will come. Amen.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, II Samuel, <i>Remez</i> 161.</i>

Last Day of Passover

<b>[Isaiah, 10:32–12:6]</b>
“<i>This same day at Nob, he shall stand, etc.</i>” [10:32]. <i>Sennacherib</i> soon came before the city of Jerusalem. When he came to the city of Nob, which was near Jerusalem; one could easily see Jerusalem. When he saw Jerusalem, he said: what kind of city is this? He lifted his hand against the city and said: what kind of city is this that I have besieged with a great multitude. I have conquered many strong cities in my day. However, he was very upset that he had to run away from the city.
“<i>Lo, the Sovereign Lord of Hosts, etc.</i>” [10:33]. Thus, God the Lord cut off the strong branches with the roots and the tall tree in the forest. That is to say, the strong <i>kings and ministers</i> who are branches of <i>Sennacherib.</i> The Holy One cut them down and destroyed them.
“<i>And the Lebanon trees will fall</i>” [10:34]. These are the ministers who ruled many peoples, who were with <i>Sennacherib.</i> Just like the tree in the forest, they fell into the hands of an angel who killed them. In one night, he blew into each of <i>Sennacherib</i>’<i>s</i> men’s noses his fiery thread and they all died in the night that he remained in <i>Nob.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Sanhedrin,</i> 95b.</i>
“<i>A shoot shall come from the stump of Jesse, a twig shall sprout from his stock</i>” [11:1]. <i>Isaiah prophesied:</i> do not wonder that I, God, performed this miracle here with <i>Sennacherib.</i> I will do many more miracles in the days of the Messiah, to redeem them from their <i>exile.</i> A king will arise in Israel from the stock of <i>Jesse.</i> The first dynasty came from Jesse and this same root shall sprout a branch to be the <i>Messiah.</i> Israel, who were dispersed in all the lands will be redeemed through this Messiah.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Isaiah, 11:1; Radak, Isaiah, 11:1.</i>
“<i>The spirit of the Lord shall alight on him, a spirit of wisdom and understanding, etc.</i>” [11:2]. The <i>spirit</i> of God and <i>prophecy</i> will rest on this Messiah and he will have all wisdom and understanding. His words will be about the fear of the Holy One. He will judge Israel with wisdom and through prophecy and not like a person who judges on the basis of his own thoughts. Sometimes the person is wrong in his understanding. However, the Messiah will <i>judge with prophecy</i> and great <i>wisdom.</i> Everything will occur properly and even for poor people and <i>widows</i> where the common practice is that they do not receive proper justice. However, the Messiah will judge the poor and the wealthy properly. He will pun- ish those people who do not listen to him with his mouth. He will curse them and they will die because of the curse. He does not need to seek strong people who used to beat up those who would not follow his rulings. God will stand by him and will give him spirit and strength, because the Messiah will praise the Lord.
“<i>The wolf shall dwell with the lamb, etc.</i>” [11:6]. A wolf will live with a sheep and the wolf will not do anything to the sheep. A cow and a bear will eat in the same field. A lion will eat straw like a cow and he will not desire to eat cows or attack them, as he used to do. The Holy One has promised all this to Israel. They will have great peace in the days of the Messiah. They will be full of wisdom from God. Their wisdom will be as great as the waters that cover the depths of the oceans.
“<i>On that day</i>” [11:10]. On the day that the Messiah will come, they will run after the Messiah like people go to war. They all follow the banner. So will the Messiah go, like a banner, and they will do what the Messiah will command. Therefore, he will have great honor and the nations will come to him. He will have great rest and they will all serve him.
“<i>In that day, My Lord will apply His hand again, etc.</i>” [11:11]. In that day, God will gather Israel from all the lands, like he gathered them out of Egypt and God will make a great banner and will gather Israel from all the corners of the world. The <i>jealousy</i> and <i>hatred</i> that previously existed among Israel will be removed.
“<i>They will pounce on the back of Philistia, etc.</i>” [11:14]. And Israel will run quickly as if they were flying with wings at the Philistines to kill them and destroy their god. Israel will also rob and kill <i>Edom, Moab, and Ammon.</i>
“<i>The Lord will utterly destroy the tongue of the sea</i>” [11:15]. The Holy One will dry up the sea, so that the sea will not hinder them in the expectation that Israel will easily come into their land. It will be completely <i>dry</i> and the other rivers of Egypt will be cut up; the rivers of <i>Egypt</i> will cut be up into seven pieces. That is to say, there will be seven paths through the water.
“<i>There shall be a highway, etc.</i>” [11:16]. There will be a road on which they will go through the great rivers with the shoes on their feet being dry, just like when Israel went out of Egypt, they went through the sea on dry land.
“<i>In that day, you shall say, etc.</i>” [12:1]. In that day you will say: I am <i>obligated</i> to praise God that You were justly angry with me and sent me into exile. You have done an additional favor for me that you have redeemed me from the exile, even though I have committed many sins. I was not worthy to be redeemed from the exile.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Isaiah, 12:1.</i>
“<i>Surely God is my salvation</i>” [12:2]. God was my help and I relied on him. I did not fear in the exile when the help from God was strong.
“<i>Joyfully you shall draw water, etc.</i>” [12:3]. You will draw water from a well that will never cease. It will always give water. So too, is our help from the Holy One. It will never cease.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Isaiah, 12:3.</i>
“<i>You shall say on that day, praise the Lord</i>” [12:4]. You will say on that day, praise the Lord; call on His help and on His holy name. Make known His <i>deeds</i>; remind them how strong is His name. Praise God when he has done mighty deeds, let them be known in the whole land.
“<i>Shout for joy</i>” [12:6]. Rejoice, those who dwell in <i>Zion</i>, for the Holy One of Israel is great among you. That is to say, the Holy One who does great <i>wonders and miracles</i> with you.
We recite this haftorah on Passover because the <i>haftorah</i> speaks about how the Messiah will come and how the Holy One killed <i>Sennacherib</i> and his people on Passover. The Messiah will also come on Passover, to perform <i>miracles</i> for us. <i>Amen.</i>

First Day of Shavuot

<b>[Ezekiel, 1:1–28]</b>
“<i>In the thirtieth year, the fourth month, etc.</i>” [1:1]. <i>Ezekiel</i> said: It was in the thirtieth year, in the <i>month of Tammuz</i>; I was in exile near the river of <i>Chebar</i>, with other Israelites who were standing with me. I saw wonders and <i>miracles</i> from the Holy One.
“<i>It was</i>” [1:3]. The words of God to <i>Ezekiel the son of</i> Jeremiah the priest,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Ezekiel, 1:3, quoting <i>Targum Yerushalmai.</i> The Amsterdam, 1711 and some other editions changed it to Buzi, probably not having checked the commentaries cited. The commentaries explain that “Buzi” was a nickname for Jeremiah. The term is based on the idea that Jeremiah was shamed (<i>bushah</i> in Hebrew).</i> in the land of the <i>Chaldeans</i>, near the river that was called <i>Chebar.</i> I saw a great storm wind from the north, a great cloud and a fire was flashing and great light surrounded the cloud. An <i>angel called Hashmal</i><sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Ezekiel, 1:3.</i> was in the middle of the fire. One <i>face</i> was that of a person, one <i>face</i> was that of a lion, one an ox and one an eagle and four creatures, each one with four faces. One face was like a person, the second like an ox, the third face was like a lion and the fourth face was like an eagle. Their feet were together and their feet were like calves feet. They shined brightly, like shiny polished copper. One wing touched the other partner and when they wanted to move, they did not have to turn around since they had a face on all our sides of the world. On their right side, they have the face of a person and the face of a lion on all four creatures. On the left side, the four <i>creatures</i> had an image like an ox and the eagle on all four creatures. Their wings were spread over their faces and with two wings they covered their bodies. The image of the <i>creatures</i> was like fiery coals burning among the <i>creatures</i> and lightning flashed from the fire. The <i>creatures</i> ran back and forth like lightning flashes. Then I saw wheels with each <i>creature</i> and the wheels were like a <i>precious stone</i> called <i>beryl.</i> The wheels were <i>double</i>, and they had a back and a front. They stand in constant <i>fear</i> and their back is full of eyes so that they can see in all directions. When the <i>creatures</i> move, the wheels move with them. The <i>spirit</i> of the <i>creatures</i> is in the wheels of the creatures. The wheels go with them. An image over the heads of the <i>creatures</i> was like a heaven, ice white, and under the heaven each of the creatures had two wings.
“<i>I heard the sound of their wings</i>” [1:24]. I heard the <i>sound</i> of the <i>creatures.</i> It was like a loud <i>sound</i> of strong waters, the <i>sound</i> of the living God. Like the sound of a great multitude shouting, and the <i>sound</i> went forth from the heaven that was spread above their heads was like a <i>precious stone</i> that is called sapphire, and the image of a throne and on the throne the image of a man. When the <i>creatures</i> stood still, they let their wings fall to their sides.
“<i>Then a spirit carried me</i>” [3:12]. A great wind lifted me up and I heard a great shout, “<i>blessed is the Presence of the Lord, in His place</i>” [3:12].
We will write some midrashim about the haftorah. The Tanhuma writes. It is written that each creature had four wings. <i>Rabbi Jacob bar Zavdi</i> said in the name of <i>Rabbi Abahu</i> that the Holy One made two wings for each creature because of the time that Israel made the Golden Calf. The angels and creatures have feet like a calf. That is why the Holy One made the wings, because the Holy One did not want to look at the feet of the angels. He made coverings for the sin that Israel made the Golden Calf. That is why the <i>angels and creatures</i> cover their feet with the additional two wings. This was an act of love for Israel, that the Holy One forgave Israel their sins.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Tanhuma, (ed. Buber), <i>Emor</i> 11; <i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Ezekiel, <i>Remez</i>, 337.</i>
The Talmud writes in [tractate] <i>Berakhot.</i> “<i>Their legs were a single rigid leg</i>” [1:7]. <i>Rabbi Yose the son of Haninah</i> said in the name of <i>Rabbi Eliezer the son of Jacob.</i> The one who prays the <i>Amidah</i> should put his feet together. The verse says, “<i>The Lord is near to all who call Him</i>” [Psalms, 145:18].<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Berakhot,</i> 10b; <i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Ezekiel, <i>Remez</i>, 337.</i> This means, God is near to all who call Him.
<i>Rabbi Levi</i> says: the distance from the earth to the heaven is what a person can travel in five hundred years. The thickness of each heaven is what a person can travel in five hundred years. The distance between one heaven and the other is the same. <i>Rabbi Berachiah</i> said: the hooves of the creatures and the step of the creatures is also what a person can travel in five hundred years. To this must be added fifteen years. This is because the verse says <i>rigid</i> [<i>yesharah</i>]. That is to say, this word has the numerical value of five hundred and fifteen. We can see how very far is the heaven of the Holy One. When the person prays slowly, the Holy One listens to his prayers. Where is there a God that is so close that He understands his words?<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Midrash Shohar Tov</i>, 4.3; <i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Ezekiel, <i>Remez</i>, 337.</i>
We will now write about the <i>Merkavah</i> that <i>Ezekiel</i> saw. It is easy to understand what this meant. The Holy One showed him how the person should behave. That is why the Holy One appeared on a throne that stands on four creatures, as if the Holy One would be riding on it. This has the appearance of someone wanting to travel and wants to ride on a journey. This is how the Holy One appeared to the prophet. That is to say, the Holy One said that He want- ed to move out of the Temple because of the sins that Israel committed. The riding showed that the Holy One wanted to ride and travel outside the Temple. The Holy One also showed that He thinks about all of creation. He does with them as He wishes, like some one who rides a mount and knows very well what it is and knows what is needed for the journey and he leads the mount according to his will.
Why did the Holy One show four creatures with four faces? This is because the animals that live in the world are but four. The first is a lion, the king of the wild animals. The second is the ox, the king of the domesticated animals. The third is the eagle, the king of the birds. The fourth is the human, who is the king over everything in the world. Why wasn’t there a fish from the water in the Merkavah, since the Holy One also does what He wants with them? The explanation is that the bird was created half from the water and half from the <i>dry land.</i> Therefore, he does not have to think about the fish, since the eagle is a remembrance in the <i>Merkavah</i>, since the eagle was created out of the water like a fish. For Ezekiel this meant that the Holy One rode and guided the world according to His will. The human, even when he is the king over all of creation, the Holy One is still over the human and He does what he wants with him.
There was also on the <i>Merkavah</i> how the person should behave. There are many people who boast about their strength. Therefore, he was shown a lion that is very strong, but is in the hands of the Holy One. That is to say, no mighty warrior should boast, since it is all with the help of the Holy One. There are also some people who boast about their wealth. Therefore, an ox is shown in the <i>Merkavah.</i> That is to say, the ox plows and causes much grain to come in to the world and this brings wealth. Therefore, the person should not boast about wealth, since it is all in the hands of God. There are some people who desire to steal, just like the birds, one steals from other. Therefore, the eagle was among the creatures. The person should see that everything is in the hands of the Holy One. The thief will not have luck, since the Holy One hates thievery. One should behave properly with money and give charity. The Messiah will come as the verse says, “<i>and those who repent by righteousness</i>” [Isaiah, 1:27]. <i>Amen.</i>

Second Day of Shavuot

<b>[Habakkuk, 2:20–3:19]</b>
“<i>The Lord is in His Temple</i>” [2:20]. The prophet said: the Holy One is high in heaven and the people on the earth must fear, because the Holy One sees all the people on the earth and all of their deeds from heaven. Therefore, each person should be afraid to do evil.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Habakkuk, 2:20.</i>
“<i>A prayer of Habakkuk</i>” [3:1]. The <i>prophet</i> prayed and said: <i>Lord of the universe</i>, the sins of Israel should be like all of them committed the sins without desire and unwillingly.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Habakkuk, 3:1.</i>
“<i>O Lord, I have heard of your renown</i>” [3:2]. I have heard that You, God, want to bring Israel into a long exile. I have feared that I will not be able to endure in the long exile. He prayed and said: allow Israel to exist in the exile. Tell Israel what You have promised, to answer them now, in our day. In anger, remember your compassion for Israel.
The Midrash writes: “<i>Mercy</i>” [3:2] has the same numerical value as <i>Abraham.</i> That is to say, the verse says, “<i>in anger, remember mercy</i>” [3:2]. You should remember the <i>merit of Abraham</i> and you should have compassion on us.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Habakkuk, 3:2.</i>
“<i>God is coming from Teman</i>” [3:3]. In his prayer he counted the <i>miracles, wonders, and favors</i> that the Holy One did for Israel. The first was that He had given the Torah. The Holy One had previously gone to many nations that they should accept the Torah. They refused and it was an honor that the only nation that wanted to accept the Torah was Israel. At that time the Holy One covered the heaven with fire and the earth was full of a great light. There was a great fire on Mount Sinai from the Holy One and also the light that the Holy One gave to Moses on his face.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Habakkuk, 3:3.</i>
“<i>Before Him went pestilence</i>” [3:5]. When the Holy One was ready to give the Torah, He wanted to banish the angel of death so that he should not speak ill of Israel. He should not say, how could You give the Torah to Israel? They will make the Golden Calf after forty days. Therefore, the Holy One chased away the angel of death, but other burning angels were with the Holy One on Mount Sinai.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Habakkuk, 3:5.</i>
“<i>He stopped and shook the earth</i>” [3:6]. The Ark, which contained the Tablets, stood for forty years in the city of <i>Gilgal</i> until the Holy One gave the land of Israel and measured how much each Israelite would have as his portion of the land. From here the Holy One saw to it to expel the nations from their land and broke the strong nobles of the nations and made them humble and bowed down. In every way they are in the power of the Holy One. Therefore, the Holy One makes the humble one and the rich one the way God wants. He expels one and brings one in, the way He wants.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Habakkuk, 3:6.</i>
“<i>As a scene of havoc I behold</i>” [3:7]. Because I have done injustice and committed sins, the Holy One sent evil angels from the nations against me, but when I repented, the Holy One helped me with all of my enemies.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Habakkuk, 3:7.</i>
“<i>Are you wroth, O Lord, with Neharim?</i>” [3:8]. The Holy One was angry with the river Jordan. He split it and the sea. You threw Pharaoh’s horses into the sea and the chariots did not help.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Habakkuk, 3:8.</i>
“<i>You brandished</i>” [3:9]. The Holy One showed himself like a warrior who shows his strength with his bow and arrows. You have kept your oath that You swore to the tribes. You split the earth and drew out water to give them drink.
“<i>The mountains rock at the sight of You</i>” [3:10]. The mountains of <i>Arnon</i> that joined together and crushed many enemies. The story was that Israel went in the desert and went between two high mountains. The nations hid in holes in these mountains. They said: when Israel will go between the high mountains we will kill them. The Holy One made a <i>miracle</i>, it was dry and the two mountains joined together. All the nations that were within were killed. The Holy One said: one must notify Israel of the <i>miracle</i> and He caused a river to flow between the two mountains. The water carried out many hands, feet and partial bodies. Israel saw the great <i>miracle</i> and sang <i>songs of praise.</i> This is what the prophet thought of here and told the praises of the Holy One. The strong flow of water flowed into the river <i>Jordan.</i> It had to stand still and became dry until the Israelites passed through. All the inhabitants of the earth and all the hosts of heaven praised Him.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanhuma</i>, <i>Hukkat</i>, 20.</i>
“<i>Sun and moon stand still</i>” [3:11]. When Joshua battled the kings in the land of Israel, the sun and moon stood still, so that the day should be longer and he should be able to kill all the <i>kings of the land of Israel.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Joshua, 10:12–13.</i> With the lightning and fire from heaven, the nations were killed and it was illumined for Israel. The Holy One expelled the nations from the <i>land of Israel</i> with anger. In the same way that the Holy One helped, the Holy One will also help in the days of the Messiah. He will kill the multitudes of <i>Gog and Magog.</i>
“<i>You will crack</i>” [3:14]. You will wound and crack their heads with the stick. They will be crazy and one person will attack his colleague among the nations. The nations will rejoice. They will think that they will be able to disperse us, like Pharaoh thought at the sea. He wanted to attack and kill us. He thought that the Holy One would not see. However, the Holy One himself appeared at the sea and made a wall in the sea and Israel crossed the sea on dry land and the <i>Egyptians</i> were killed.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Habakkuk, 3:14.</i>
“<i>I heard and my bowels quaked</i>” [3:16]. The prophet said: I heard that Israel would have great troubles in the days of <i>Gog and Magog.</i> My heart became frightened and my bowels quaked. Even my bones are rotten.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Habakkuk, 3:16.</i>
“<i>Even though the fig tree does not blossom</i>” [3:17]. The prophet said: I want to console myself. I know well that the <i>nations and Gog and Magog</i> will have no long lasting joy. The vine will not give any fruit.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Habakkuk, 3:17.</i>
“<i>I will rejoice in the Lord</i>” [3:18]. I will rejoice in the Holy One who can help. God, who is strong on the heights of Jerusalem, will lead me.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Habakkuk, 3:18.</i>

Tisha B'av

<b>[Jeremiah, 8:13–9:23]</b>
“<i>I will make an end to them</i>” [8:13]. The Holy One said: I will destroy everything on the earth, the best fruits, the wine and the figs, even when they have grown. I have given them commandments and they did not keep them.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Jeremiah, 8:13.</i>
“<i>Why do we sit still?</i>” [8:14]. Why are we sitting in the villages? Let us go to the strong fortified cities. If we remain silent there, it is because we must remain silent. We cannot speak against God, because we are guilty. We have committed sins. God has given us a bitter drink to drink because of this. Should we hope for <i>peace</i> and happiness and the peace does not come. From the city of <i>Dan</i> is heard the great shouting of the enemy’s horses. The earth trembled and they destroyed the earth and all the cities with the people who dwelled in them. Thus says the Lord: I will send the snakes to you and they will bite you and the magicians who used to force the snakes to leave with magic spells will not help.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Jeremiah, 8:14.</i>
“<i>When in grief, I would seek comfort</i>” [8:18]. He lamented and said: I would have wanted to strengthen myself to console myself, but my heart is in great pain.
“<i>Hark, the outcry of my poor</i>” [8:19]. He laments that Israel shouted out of fear of the nations who were distant. Israel thought, is there not someone in <i>Zion</i> who will help us? The Holy One responded: why should you rely on Me that I should protect you? You worshiped foreign gods; let them help you.
“<i>The harvest is past</i>” [8:20]. Israel said: the harvest of the grain has passed. That is to say, a person who hopes that the time to harvest grain and wheat should come. So too have we hoped that we should be helped by God from the enemies, but we see no help.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Jeremiah, 8:20.</i>
“<i>Because my people is shattered</i>” [8:21]. The prophet said: my heart is broken because of the great troubles that Israel are having. I am blackened and unclean; desolation has seized me.
“<i>Is there no balm in Gilead?</i>” [8:22]. Is there no remedy from the apothecary from the city of <i>Gilead</i>, to heal Israel? Why are my people Israel not healed? Were there water in my head and would the water flow into my eyes that I should have with what to shed tears, to cry. I would dearly want to cry day and night, but I have no tears with which to cry. Were that I would live in the desert, that I should not see Israel in their troubles. I see that they are full of sins and falsehood. One gossips about the other one, for one to do evil things to the other. They do not recognize Me, God, and they give false <i>judgments.</i> They pursue <i>slander and hypocrisy.</i> Therefore, the Holy One said: I will make them good and make them pious, refine them like silver, refined through troubles from their enemies that they will have to suffer. They will become pious and I will accept them again. They should not think that they would be lost forever. They are called My people.
“<i>Their tongue is a sharpened arrow</i>” [9:7]. They slaughter and kill with their gossip. They speak peace with their mouths to their friends, but their heart is not in it. Therefore, the Holy One said: how can I restrain Myself, not to pay them for their sins. “<i>Sharpened</i>” also means that their tongue is stuck out.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Jeremiah, 9:7.</i>
“<i>For the mountains I take up weeping</i>” [9:9]. The prophet said that he saw the destruction of the land and lamented. I will go on the mountains to lament and weep. There were many cattle and now everything has been devastated. One no longer hears the noise of the cattle and also not the cry of the birds. Where there was grain, there is no grain to be found. That is why the sound of birds is no longer found.
“<i>I will turn Jerusalem into rubble</i>” [9:10]. I have destroyed Jerusalem, like a mountain and a pile of stones that lie on top of each other. Snakes live under them. The same thing also happened to the other cities in the land of Judah.
“<i>Who is so wise to understand this?</i>” [9:11]. The prophet said that every intelligent person would understand what the Holy One is saying to the prophet. The prophet said: that is to say, he will think about what the prophet said about why the land was destroyed. God said: because Israel left the Torah and followed the desires of their hearts, to worship foreign gods that they learned from their fathers. Therefore, God said: listen, I will tell them to eat bitter gall and wormwood. I will disperse them among the nations that they do not know and will send the sword to destroy you.
“<i>Thus said the Lord</i>” [9:16]. Thus said God, the Lord. Summon and call those who know how to mourn with laments and mourning <i>songs.</i> Let them awaken us with <i>songs</i> of mourning in the hope that we should cry and shed tears from our eyes. A great lament, to have been destroyed and shamed.
“<i>Hear, O women</i>” [9:19]. The women should hear the words of God that they should lament. They should lament, since the women have very soft hearts. They cry quickly and will easily make all the people cry. Therefore, you women should teach your daughters that they should know how to cry and lament when the angel of death appears in our windows. He has come into our fortress to kill the children on the inside and the young men in the streets.
“<i>Speak thus</i> – <i>says the Lord</i>” [9:21]. The Holy One said to the prophet. Say to Israel in My name. The corpses of the people will fall like garbage in the field. Thus said God: the wise man should not boast with his wisdom and the warrior with his strength and the wealthy person with his wealth.
“<i>But only in this should one glory, in his earnest devotion to Me, etc.</i>” [9:23]. With this should he boast, he should think about Me with intelligence and should know that I am God and act with <i>charity, justice, and lovingkindness</i> on the earth. I do everything and desire all these. That is, I make the person smart, strong or wealthy.
The <i>Ikkarim</i> writes that the wise person should not boast about his wisdom. That is, when he wants to keep his wisdom for himself and does not want to share it with his friend. He should not boast, as the verse says here, “<i>the wise man should not boast with his wisdom</i>” [9:22]. That is to say, he should not boast when he wants to keep the wisdom hidden for himself. Similarly, with strength, when he wants to keep the <i>strength</i> for himself and not help his friend with his strength by protecting him from a thief who wants to rob him. That is to say, he points to a <i>judge</i> or <i>head of the community</i> that he can help his friend get <i>justice</i> or find a <i>compromise.</i> Nothing is stronger than justice, since with justice one can force him to pay taxes. Therefore, the verse here calls <i>strength, justice.</i> The third is that the person should not boast about <i>wealth</i>, that he wants to say that the wealth is his alone. That is to say, he does not want to do charitable acts with it. He says: how does the <i>pauper</i> deserve my money, that I should give him money that is mine alone? Therefore, the verse says here, “<i>for I the Lord act with kindness, justice and equity</i>” [9:23]. That is to say, the person should see how I lead with these three things, that I have more wisdom than the whole world and I do not keep it for Myself. I do lovingkindness with My wisdom and give it to the people on the earth. The second one that I have, <i>strength</i>, I give to the people on the earth. That is to say, I help each person from whom the thief wants to <i>steal</i> or rob, by doing <i>justice</i> with My <i>strength</i> and protect the people. The third is that I have <i>wealth.</i> I do not hide it, but give charity to the people on the earth. Therefore, the verse ends with the three words “<i>kindness, justice, and equity</i>” [9:23].<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Albo, Joseph. <i>Sefer Ikkarim</i> (ed. I. Husik), III: 49.</i> He says that when Israel in their exile will observe these three things properly, the Messiah will come. <i>Amen.</i>

First Day of Rosh Hashanah

<b>[I Samuel, 1:1–2:10]</b>
“<i>There was a man from Ramathaim</i>” [1:1]. There was a man who was called <i>Elkanah</i>, from the city of <i>Ramot.</i> He had two wives; one was called Hannah and the other, <i>Peninah. Hannah</i> had no children and <i>Peninah</i> had children.
“<i>This man used to go up from his town</i>” [1:3]. Elkanah went every year to <i>Shiloh</i> for the <i>festival.</i> He was righteous and he called many people on the way to go with him to <i>Shiloh</i> and he brought <i>sacrifices</i> to the city of <i>Shiloh.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, I Samuel, 1:3.</i> Since Jerusalem did not yet exist to bring sacrifices there, everything was brought to Shiloh. The priest called <i>Eli</i> had two children. One was called <i>Hophni</i> and the other was called <i>Phinehas.</i>
The Midrash writes: <i>Rabbi Abba</i> says in the name of <i>Rabbi Isaac.</i> The prayer was in place of the sacrifice. It is written, “<i>to worship and to sacrifice</i>” [1:3]. This means, to bow down and to slaughter sacrifices. He compares bowing in prayer to slaughtering sacrifices. The <i>rabbis</i> say that it is better to bow to God than to bring sacrifices. He first says to bow down to God and afterwards he writes about bringing sacrifices.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, I Samuel, <i>Remez,</i> 77.</i>
“<i>One such day Elkanah offered a sacrifice</i>” [1:4]. When <i>Elkanah</i> offered sacrifices, he gave <i>presents to Peninah</i> and her children. He gave a good present to <i>Hannah</i> in the hope that she would not be upset, since she was sad and unhappy that she did not have children. Peninah caused Hannah to be upset and cry because she had no children. She always spoke to her husband Elkanah. Why did you not give a coat to the oldest son or a shirt to the other son? That is to say, she did this to torment Hannah. Some sages say that she angered Hannah so that she would pray for children. That is why Peninah tormented her, so that she should take it to heart and pray to the Holy One to have children.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, I Samuel, <i>Remez,</i> 77.</i> Hannah was always crying and did not want to eat in the city of Shiloh. Her husband Elkanah said to her, why do you not want to eat? I am to you like the ten children that Peninah has. That is to say, I love you like the ten children from Peninah.
“<i>Hannah rose</i>” [1:9]. Hannah rose after the meal in the city of <i>Shiloh.</i> Eli the priest was sitting on a chair in the House of God. She was sad and she prayed to God and cried and she made a <i>vow</i> and said, “<i>Lord of Hosts</i>” [1:11]. That is to say, <i>Lord of the Universe</i>, you have created many multitudes of angels in the heaven. None of them have children, but they live forever. You have also created many multitudes on the earth. They do have children, but they die. Therefore, I ask you. Am I one of the angels who have no children, then let me live forever. If I am one of the people who are on the earth who die and have children, then let me have children.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, I Samuel, <i>Remez,</i> 78.</i>
Our sages say. That is why she said, “<i>Lord of Hosts.</i>” Therefore, You, God, have many people and creatures and out of all these people you do not want to give me a son. Hannah said: If you do not want to give me children, then I will conceal myself in a room with a strange man. Then Elkanah will have to bring me to drink the “<i>spell inducing water</i>” [Numbers, 5:24] to test me if I did not sleep with a strange man. If I had not slept with him, the “<i>spell inducing water</i>” will not harm me, and the Holy One will bless me after the drinking that I will have children.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Berakhot,</i> 31b; <i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, I Samuel, <i>Remez,</i> 78.</i>
Thus has God promised. When the woman will be just and was put to shame before the people with drinking what the priest gave to drink. Because of this, the Holy One will give her good children. Therefore, Hannah prayed, look at my pain and remember me with a son and with a daughter and You should not forget me. Give me a son, like other people, and I will give him to serve in God’s house forever. It is obvious that he must serve God. He would be a <i>levite?</i> The explanation is that other levites are supposed to serve in God’s house from the age of twenty years. However, I will give my son to serve in the Temple as soon as he is two years old. She prayed this before the Holy One and <i>Eli the priest</i> thought that the woman, Hannah, was drunk. Her lips were moving, but her voice was not heard. She was praying very slowly. Eli said to her: you drunken woman, what do you want to do here? Go home to sleep off your drunkenness. Hannah responded to <i>Eli:</i> you are not a proper prophet. You say that I am drunk, but I am a woman who has great troubles and pain. I have not drunk any wine. I was praying to God and do not think about me that I am a loose woman and a slut. Rather, because of the great troubles that Peninah caused me by mocking me with her children. That is why I am praying to God.
“<i>Eli responded</i>” [1:17]. <i>Eli</i> responded to <i>Hannah</i> and said: go <i>in peace.</i> The Holy One will give you what you desire. Hannah thanked him and she went on her way. She ate and her anguish fell from her face. She was full of happiness. <i>Elkanah</i> went from the city of Shiloh to the city of <i>Ramot</i> with his two wives. Elkanah slept with Hannah and she became pregnant with a child.
Our sages learn from here that a guest should not sleep with his wife when he is in a stranger’s house. Therefore, the verse says here that only when Elkanah came to his house did he sleep with Hannah.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Ketubot,</i> 65a.</i> A year later, Hannah gave birth to a son and she called him <i>Samuel.</i> She said, I have asked the Lord for him.
“<i>The man Elkanah ascended</i>” [1:21]. Elkanah ascended with his whole household to Shiloh to offer sacrifices and a sacrifice for his son that Hannah had given birth to. Hannah did not go up and waited to wean the son that she had given birth to. She said: when I will wean him, then I will bring him to God to serve Him forever.
Our sages say that Samuel only lived for fifty-two years and then he died. A <i>levite</i> should not serve more than fifty years. <sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Numbers Rabbah</i>, 3.8; <i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, I Samuel, <i>Remez</i>, 78.</i> She said that I will nurse him for two years and afterwards he should serve God forever. This is fifty years that the levites serve in the Temple. Our sages say, he should have lived longer, but because <i>Saul</i> became <i>king</i> through the hands of Samuel and he died soon after. Saul was only king for three years and therefore <i>Samuel</i> had to die so that he would not see the death of <i>king Saul.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Ta</i>’<i>anit,</i> 5b.</i>
“<i>May the Lord fulfill His word</i>” [1:23]. The Midrash writes that every day a <i>heavenly Voice</i> is hard that says that a child will be born whose name will be Samuel. He will be very righteous and every woman who has a son will let him be called Samuel. She thinks that this will be the righteous Samuel. When they saw every child named Samuel did not have the good deeds, they said, this is not the <i>righteous Samuel.</i> However, when <i>Samuel the son of Hannah</i> came, the whole world said that this is the correct <i>Samuel the prophet.</i> He has good deeds from childhood.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, I Samuel, <i>Remez</i>, 78.</i>
“<i>When she had weaned him, she took him up with her</i>” [1:24]. She brought Samuel up after she had weaned him. She also brought several oxen for sacrifices and to eat. She also brought a measure of flour and a jug of wine to the house of God in the city of <i>Shiloh.</i> The boy was still a child and he was brought to Eli that he should teach him Torah.
Our sages say that <i>Samuel issued halakhic rulings before Eli.</i> He said to Eli: why do you need to call a priest to slaughter the sacrifice? Every Israelite is allowed to slaughter the sacrifice. Nonetheless, <i>Samuel deserved the death penalty</i> for this. Whoever <i>issues halakhic rulings</i> before his teacher, is deserving of death. <i>Eli said to Samuel:</i> you have spoken correctly, but you are <i>deserving of death.</i> Hannah immediately began to scream before Eli. I beg you my lord, I, a poor woman, have prevailed with great suffering, to have this son and you want to kill him. <i>Eli</i> said: I want to kill him and will pray to God that He should give you another son who will be better than this one. Hannah said: I prayed for this son, as you well know. You were present and the Holy One gave him to me. I have lent him to the Holy One that he should serve God. Therefore, you do not have the power to kill him, and she bowed to God.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Berakhot,</i> 31b; <i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, I Samuel, <i>Remez,</i> 80.</i>
“<i>And Hannah prayed</i>” [2:1]. Hannah prayed and said: my heart that was sad has now become happy. My head, which I could not pick up in front of Peninah, now my head has become elevated with the help of God. My mouth has become expansive before Peninah, to speak and answer her. God has helped me, so that no one is as holy as God and there is no creator other than God. One should pray to Him alone. He can help as He has helped me. At first, I was not worthy to have a child, but now the Holy One made me able to have a child. She said to Peninah and the other enemies who used to torment Hannah. You should not speak mighty or strong words, since God knows well what each person has in their heart. No person can do anything, good or evil, if God does not will it. All the deeds of people are in God’s power and all the deeds of people are counted before God. The <i>mighty warriors</i> who rely on their strong bow, the Holy One makes them very weak. The <i>wealthy and the communal leaders</i> who were here and had enough bread, the Holy One makes them rent themselves out for a piece of bread, out of great poverty. The Holy One makes the poor people rich and sated with much bread. Similarly, when I did not have a child. Now the Holy One has given me seven children. Peninah had ten children, eight of them died, but two remained alive for Peninah.
The Midrash says that when Hannah gave birth to a son, two of Peninah’s children died. When Hannah had her second son, another two of Peninah’s children died. When Hannah had her third son, two of Peninah’s died. When Hannah had her fourth son, two of Peninah’s died. When Peninah saw that Hannah was pregnant with her fifth son, Peninah thought that now the two sons that have been left to me of the ten children would die. She fell down before Hannah and pleaded with her that she should pray that the two children should remain alive. She said: take the two children that they may be yours, that they may remain alive. Hannah prayed and she took the two children and they remained alive. Hannah had a fifth son. Thus, Hannah had seven sons, including the two children of Peninah, who became like her own children.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, I Samuel, <i>Remez,</i> 89.</i>
“<i>The Lord kills and gives life</i>” [2:6]. God causes death and gives life, lowers into the grave and raises him again. God makes rich and makes poor. He makes low and raises up. He raises up the poor from the ash and the garbage and He makes them inherit the <i>seat of honor.</i> The righteous are in God’s hands and the world exists through their merit. The Holy One guards the feet of the <i>righteous and pious.</i> The Holy One cuts down the evildoers in the darkness. A person is strengthened not with strength, but with the will of the Holy One. God causes those who fight with the righteous to break. He storms against them from heaven. God judges the rulers of the land. The Holy One will give strength to His king over Israel and will raise the rule of the Messiah.
We will now write some <i>midrashim</i> about the <i>haftorah.</i> The Talmud writes in [tractate] <i>Ketubot</i>, <i>chapter five. Rabbi Judah</i> says that women should not be given much wine and similar drinks that make one drunk. We learn this from Hannah. It is written, “<i>after they had drunk</i>” [1:9]. This means that she drank little. One should give a beaker to a woman to drink, but when one gives her two beakers to drink, she becomes very disgusting as a result of drunkenness. If one gives her three beakers, she says that one should sleep with her. When she finishes four beakers, even if a donkey would sleep with her, it would not be disgusting to her, as the result of drunkenness. <i>Ravah</i> said: all the things that were said that a woman should not drink to become drunk was only said when her husband is not there. However, when her husband is present, then a woman can drink to become drunk. The Talmud asks a question. Why did Hannah not drink in the city of Shilo? Elkanah, her husband, was with Hannah. The explanation is that Hannah did not drink because she thought that if she became drunk she would want to sleep with her husband, Elkanah. However, a man is not supposed to sleep with his wife while on a journey, in a strange house. <i>Rabbi Judah</i> said: from here we learn that a man should not sleep with his wife when he is a guest.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Ketubot,</i> 65a.</i>
The Talmud says in [tractate] <i>Berakhot</i>, <i>chapter five.</i> A person should only rise to pray with awe in his heart and with an earnest head, not with lightheadedness, as it is written here, “<i>she was deeply distressed</i>” [1:10]. She was bitter in her heart and God accepted her prayer. <i>Rabbi Hamnunah</i> said: we can learn many <i>customs</i> about how we should behave during prayer. First, it is written, “<i>she was praying silently</i>” [1:13]. Each person should have intention in their heart toward the Holy One in their prayer. The second is, it is written, “<i>only her lips moved</i>” [1:13]. This means that only Hannah’s lips were moving and fluttering. That is to say, when the person prays, his lips should move and he should mouth the prayer with his lips. The third thing is, it is written here, “<i>her voice was not heard</i>” [1:13]. The sound of her prayers was not heard. The fourth is that it is written here, “<i>Eli thought that she was drunk</i>” [1:13]. <i>Eli</i> thought that she was drunk. From here we learn that a drunk should not pray. The fifth thing we learn from here is that a drunk who prays is like someone who worships foreign gods, as it is written here, “<i>do not consider your servant as a worthless woman</i>” [1:16]. Hannah said: you Eli say that I am drunk and am praying. This is like I would be worshiping foreign gods. This is the meaning of <i>belial</i>, despicable. The sixth thing we learn from here is that if we suspect someone of committing a sin, the person should be able to explain himself to the people, as it is written here. <i>Hannah</i> said: I have not drunk any wine; you suspect me falsely. The seventh is what <i>Rabbi Eliezer</i> said: when a person suspects his friend and he does him an injustice, he must immediately make amends, as it is written, “<i>Eli said, go in peace</i>” [1:17].<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Berakhot,</i> 31a-b; <i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, I Samuel, <i>Remez,</i> 78.</i>
“<i>Hannah was praying silently</i>” [1:13]. The Talmud says in [tractate] <i>Berakhot, chapter five. Rabbi Eliezer</i> said: Hannah said to the Holy One. You have created each organ in the person for a purpose. No organ was created empty, the eyes to see, the ears to hear, the mouth to speak, the nose to smell, the hands to work. The breast over the heart, for what did you create it? It is certainly for the purpose that a child should suckle milk from it. Therefore, give me a child to suckle. <i>Rabbi Eliezer</i> learns this from this verse. It is written, “<i>and Hannah was talking on her heart</i>”<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">This is a literal translation of the verse.</i> [1:13]. That is to say, she was saying, for what purpose are the breasts over the heart?<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Berakhot,</i> 31a-b; <i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, I Samuel, <i>Remez,</i> 78.</i>

Second Day of Rosh Hashanah

<b>[Jeremiah, 31:1–19]</b>
“<i>Thus says the Lord, found favor in the wilderness</i>” [31:1]. Thus says God; I have found <i>favor for Israel</i>, who were in the desert, whom I have taken out of Egypt, from the swords of Pharaoh. Amalek pursued Israel and they barely got away, when they were running away from Pharaoh. I helped them and I sought a resting place where they could rest in the desert. I also want to find them a resting place in the land of Israel.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Jeremiah, 31:1.</i>
“<i>The Lord revealed Himself to me, etc.</i>” [31:2]. Israel responded to the Holy One. It is true that we found <i>favor</i> in the desert, but it is a long time and a long distance from here. However, now in the exile, the Holy One has departed from us. The Holy One responded: I love you always and I appeared on Mount Sinai. I wanted to do lovingkindness with you always. If the time has been long, you should know that I will still build you again, in order to redeem you.
“<i>Again you shall take up your timbrels, etc.</i>” [31:3]. You will go out of the exile with much joy and goodness, just like someone who goes with timbrels and with dances.
“<i>Again you shall plant vineyards</i>” [31:4]. The practice is that when there are many enemies, they cannot show themselves to go to the fields or the vineyards that they had planted long ago. However, the <i>Holy One</i> said to <i>Israel.</i> When they will go out of the <i>exile</i>, they will plant vineyards and will not fear the <i>nations</i> and will redeem the vineyards in the fourth year. One is not supposed to eat the fruit of a vineyard until the fourth year. One must give all the fruit to be redeemed with dances and joy.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Jeremiah, 31:4.</i>
“<i>For the day is coming when watchmen shall proclaim</i>” [31:5]. It will come in the days of the Messiah a day when the watchmen and those who see long distances from the large cities will call to the people who live in villages to tell them. Come let us go to <i>Zion</i> to God, our God.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Jeremiah, 31:5.</i>
“<i>For thus said the Lord: cry out for Jacob</i>” [31:6]. A voice of the redemption will be heard. God said that there will be a song and joy for Jacob and they will go out publicly before all the nations and they will say further and proclaim and say, praise God, since God helps.
“<i>I will bring them in from the northland</i>” [31:7]. The Holy One says: I will bring Israel from the land of the north, in the expectation that many Israelites are in the exile and I will gather them from all lands.
“<i>The blind and the lame among them, those with child and those in labor together</i>” [31:7]. The Holy One said: I will slowly lead Israel out of the exile with delights. A blind person, a lame one and a pregnant woman with her heavy belly or a nursing mother who just gave birth to a child, will all be able to equally go with the people. They will not have to fear the nations. They will not be pursued.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Jeremiah, 31:7.</i>
“<i>They will come with weeping, and with compassion will I guide them</i>” [31:8]. The Holy one says: Israel will have great joy and they will cry out of great joy when they will remember the great exile that they had. I will lead them with compassion directly to good rivers. They will not stumble because I, God, am a father to Israel and Ephraim is My son who is loved like someone loves his first-born. The verse calls all of Israel by the name of Ephraim, the <i>ten tribes</i> who were driven away, behind the river <i>Sambatyon.</i> They are called after the kings of Ephraim.
“<i>Hear the word of the Lord, O nations, etc.</i>” [31:9]. God said: hear you nations, the words of God, and say the words widely among the nations. The One who exiled Israel a great distance, the same One will again redeem them. That is to say, the Holy One Himself will gather them to redeem them and He will protect them like a shepherd guards his flock and gathers them all together.
“<i>For the Lord will ransom Jacob, etc.</i>” [31:10]. God Himself redeems Jacob and He redeems him from strong nations.
“<i>They will come and shout on the heights of Zion</i>” [31:11]. They will come and sing and praise in Zion. They will run toward the good that God gives, much grain, wine, oil, good sheep and cattle. Their bodies will be like a good fat garden and they will no longer mourn.
“<i>Then maidens will dance gaily, etc.</i>” [31:12]. This time, a maiden will rejoice with dance, young men and old people with each other, and they will be full of joy. I will turn their grief into joy and will comfort and will make you rejoice from your grief.
“<i>I will give the priests their fill of fatness</i>” [31:13]. I will satiate the bodies of the priests and I will satiate My people with goodness.
“<i>Thus says the Lord, a voice, etc.</i>” [31:14]. God said: a voice is heard from a high place that can be heard at a great distance, that someone is crying. It is Rachel crying for her children. She does not allow herself to be comforted. She thinks that her children will never come. Therefore, Rachel says that she is the grandmother of Ephraim. Rachel was the mother of <i>Joseph and Ephraim</i> was the son of <i>Joseph.</i> The <i>kingdom of Ephraim</i> was expelled with ten tribes behind the <i>Sambatyon.</i> That is why she cried. The other two <i>tribes</i> were expelled to <i>Babylon</i> and they came back after seventy years. However, behind the <i>Sambatyon</i> they remain hidden.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Jeremiah, 31:14.</i>
The Midrash writes why Rachel cries more than the other mothers. It is because her descendant <i>Manasseh</i> placed an <i>idolatrous image</i> in the <i>Temple.</i> All the <i>patriarchs, and Sarah, Rebecca, Rachel and Leah</i> went before the Holy One and asked Him that He should forgive the sin, and the Holy One did not want to forgive. Then Rachel went before the Holy One and said: Lord of the Universe, I was compassionate toward my sister <i>Leah</i> when she was led to sleep with <i>Jacob</i> and I was silent when <i>Jacob</i> worked and served for my sake. How can you not be compassionate toward my children? You are more compassionate than a person. The Holy One said to Rachel. You speak appropriately; I will forgive them for your sake.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Jeremiah, 31:14.</i>
“<i>Thus says the Lord, etc.</i>” [31:15]. God said: Rachel, stop crying and your eyes should no longer flow with tears. You will have a good reward because you allowed Leah to go to Jacob and remained silent. Your children will return from the lands of their enemies and the children will return to their land. Thus says the Lord.
“<i>I can hear Ephraim, etc.</i>” [31:17]. I have heard Ephraim crying and lamenting. You, Holy One, have punished me with travails in the exile and I have been beaten like one beats an ox that one is teaching to plow. One must beat it very hard. So too, have I been beaten and have learned enough. I will be pious and will return to You, Holy One. You are my God.
“<i>Now that I have turned back, I am filled with remorse</i>” [31:18]. Ephraim said: and I will no longer think about doing evil deeds.
“<i>Now that I am made aware, I strike my thigh</i>” [31:18]. When I understand the evil deeds that I had done, I know that they were not right. I clapped my hands together and was very upset. I was ashamed of my evil deeds.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Jeremiah, 31:18.</i>
“<i>I bear the disgrace of my youth</i>” [31:18]. I suffered the disgrace and shame for my sins that I did in my youth.
“<i>Truly, Ephraim is a dear son to Me, etc.</i>” [31:19]. The Holy One responded: What is it that I love and remember all the time, just as if he was my son, who is worthy and who never sinned against Me, just like a person rejoices with his beloved son.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Jeremiah, 31:19.</i>
“<i>Whenever I have turned against Him</i>” [31:19]. When I speak of him, I remember the first love.
“<i>That is why My heart yearns for him</i>” [31:19]. Therefore, my organs overflow within me, to him. That is to say, to Israel when I see them in exile.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Jeremiah, 31:19.</i>
“<i>I will receive him back in love, declares the Lord</i>” [31:19]. I will have compassion for Israel and will take them out of the exile and I will send them the Messiah.<i>Amen.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Jeremiah, 31:19.</i>

Fast of Gedaliah

<b>[Isaiah, 55:6–56:8]</b>
“<i>Seek the Lord while He can be found, call to Him while He is near</i>” [55:6]. The prophet said: seek the Holy One with your whole heart to repent, expecting that the Holy One will be close to you.
“<i>Let the wicked give up his ways, the sinful man his thoughts</i>” [55:7]. The wicked person should throw away his evil ways and should throw away his evil thoughts. The Holy One is compassionate and forgives the sins.
“<i>For My thoughts are not your thoughts</i>” [55:8]. The Holy One said: when a person commits a transgression against a friend, he immediately takes vengeance and does not forgive him. However, I, God, am good and compassionate and I forgive. My thoughts are not your thoughts and My ways are not like your ways.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Isaiah, 55:8.</i>
“<i>As the heavens are high above the earth, so are higher, etc.</i>” [55:9]. As far as the heavens are from the earth, so are My ways far and dissimilar to your ways and to your thoughts.
“<i>As the rain and the snow come down from heaven, etc.</i>” [55:10]. The Holy One said: just like My rain and snow come from heaven on the earth and they do not go empty. They cause grain to grow on the earth to provide sufficient bread for the people. So too are My words that I have let you know through the prophets. They will be good for you, if you will be pious and fulfill the commandments that the prophet tells you.
The Midrash writes: The Holy One said: It is inaccurate to compare My deeds to those of people. When a person does something evil to his friend and he admits the transgression, then he is killed. However, I God, whoever admits his transgression to Me, I forgive that person and whoever wants to deny it, then I punish him and do not forgive him.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Midrash Tanhuma</i>, ed. S. Buber, <i>Vayeshev</i>, 11; <i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Isaiah, <i>Remez</i> 482.</i>
“<i>So is the word that issues from My mouth, etc.</i>” [55:11]. My words that I have said through the prophets will not be for nothing, or it will be that he does what I desire from him. He will bewail where I have sent him.
“<i>You shall leave in joy, etc.</i>” [55:12]. If you will be pious, then you will go out of the exile with joy. You will be carried to the land of Israel with peace and the hills will sing and dance for you, out of great joy that you are coming to the land. All the trees will rejoice for you, like a person who claps his hands out of joy.
“<i>Instead of the brier, a cypress will rise</i>” [55:13]. In the city where there were thorns, boxwood will grow and where there were thistles, good smelling <i>myrtles</i> will grow. This will be a testimony to God and an eternal sign that they will not be cut down.
“<i>Thus said the Lord: observe what is right</i>” [56:1]. The Holy One said: dispense proper justice and do what is just. Then the Messiah will come soon.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Isaiah, 56:1.</i>
“<i>Happy is the man who does this, the man who holds fast to it: who keeps the Sabbath and does not profane it</i>” [56:2]. Happy is the person who does this and observes the commandments of the Holy One, and properly keeps the Sabbath so that he does no work on the Sabbath. If Israel would properly observe the Sabbath, the Messiah would soon come, and because Israel did not properly observe the Sabbath they were exiled from the land of Israel.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Isaiah, 56:2.</i>
“<i>Let not the foreigner say, who has attached himself to the Lord, etc.</i>” [56:3]. The foreigner who has converted and cleaves to the Holy One should not think to say that God has separated him from His people. The <i>eunuch</i>, the weak man, should not say, I am a dry tree, since, thus has God said to the people who cannot have children. If they will observe the Sabbath properly and will keep My commandments, I will give them a <i>name better</i> than sons and daughters in My house and within My walls. I will give him an everlasting name that will not disappear.
“<i>As for the foreigners who attach themselves to the Lord, etc.</i>” [56:6]. The foreigners who cleave to God, serve Him and properly observe the Sabbath, I will bring them to My holy mountain, will rejoice with them in My house of prayer. I will accept their sacrifices, for My house shall be a <i>house of prayer</i> for all nations.
“<i>Thus declares the Lord God, who gathers the dispersed of Israel, I will gather, etc.</i>” [56:8]. The Holy One said: I will gather the dispersed of Israel and furthermore, I will also ingather those of the nations who have converted.

Shabbat Shuvah

<b>[Hosea, 14:2–14:10]</b>
“<i>Return O Israel to the Lord your God, for you have fallen because of your sin</i>” [14:2]. Repent Israel and be pious so that it should not happen to you what happened to the city of Samaria. You have seen your sins before you and you stumbled because of them. Therefore, repent to Holy One, for no man can raise you up from the stumbling block of your sins, but only the Holy One when you will repent. Our sages say that repentance is a very good thing that goes up to the <i>Throne of Glory</i> of the Holy One, as the verse says, “<i>to the Lord your God</i>” [14:2].<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Hosea, 14:2.</i>
“<i>Take words with you and return to God</i>” [14:3]. The prophet said: The Holy One does not desire from you more to repent, only good words, that you should recognize your sins with your whole heart, not just with words from your mouth.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Hosea, 14:3.</i>
“<i>Say to him, take away all guilt and accept what is good</i>” [14:3]. Say before the Holy One and say that He forgives and absolves all sins of whoever believes that the Holy One forgives. The Holy One forgives the transgressions of that one. Take to yourself a good heart and a good mouth for good words.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Hosea, 14:3.</i>
“<i>Instead of bulls, we will pay with our lips</i>” [14:3]. The sacrifices that we would have brought, we will pay for with our lips. That is to say, prayer is in place of the sacrifices.
“<i>Assyria will not save us</i>” [14:4]. Recognize and say before the Holy One about the <i>king of Assyria</i> that we relied on him previously. Now we know well that he cannot help us, that he is no helper for you. Therefore, we will no longer send horses to ride, to the <i>king of Assyria</i>, that he should help us. We will not say about the <i>foreign gods</i> that were made by the work of our hands, that we should say about them that this is our god.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Hosea, 14:4.</i>
“<i>In You the orphans find mercy</i>” [14:4]. Only in You, God, is our hope that You are merciful to <i>orphans.</i>
“<i>I will heal their affliction, I will take them back in love</i>” 14:5]. The <i>prophet</i> said: the Holy One has informed me that because you, Israel, spoke so well to me, I will heal them, remove their wildness and will love them. Even though they are not worthy to be loved, but I make a <i>present</i> to them, to freely love them, since My anger is taken away from them.
“<i>I will be like the dew to Israel, he will blossom like the lily</i>” [14:6]. I will be like a dew to Israel that never stops. It is found every day and is good for the grain and for the people. When people travel, the rain is good for the <i>grain</i>, but for the people it is bad. He cannot travel because of the rain. So too, God is equally good to Israel. Like a flowering rose, so too is Israel.
“<i>He shall strike roots like a tree of Lebanon</i>” [14:6]. Israel will be rooted like a tree in the forest whose roots are very deep and wide in the earth. So too will Israel be strong on the earth.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Hosea, 14:6.</i>
“<i>His boughs will spread far out, his beauty will be like the olive tree</i>’<i>s, etc.</i>” [14:7]. His boughs will spread out in all directions and they will be lovely like olive trees that are lovely all year. The fragrance of Israel will be like that of a forest that contains all sorts of vegetation and wood that are fragrant from a distance. Israel will have a <i>good name</i> from a distance.
“<i>Those who sit in his shade will be revived</i>” [14:8]. Israel will return to the <i>land of Israel</i> and will sit in the city of the Holy One. They will always dwell there because they observe the commandments of the Holy One, just like a person remains alive when he has wheat. They will blossom like a vine, his fragrance like wine. Therefore, he says the taste of wine, since Israel is compared to a wine.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Hosea, 14:8.</i>
“<i>Ephraim, what have I to do with idols?</i>” [14:9]. The Holy One said: when Ephraim will say, why do I need the foreign gods, I would rather serve the Holy One. The Holy One will then respond that the verse says further, “<i>I responded and look after you.</i>” When <i>Ephraim</i> will speak thusly, then I, God, will respond to <i>Ephraim</i> in all of his travails and will look to always see the good in <i>Ephraim</i>, all the time.
“<i>I am like a verdant cypress, your fruit comes from Me</i>” [14:9]. I want to be to Israel like a cypress full of branches that one can bend the head of the tree to the branch that is on the ground. So am I, God, very high in the heavens and I show Myself to you on the earth, just like the young tree bends to the ground from its great height. If you want to say, how is a cypress tree that has no fruit? Therefore, the verse says here: everyone will find their fruit from Me.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Hosea, 14:9.</i>
“<i>He who is wise understands these and one who is discerning will know them</i>” [14:10]. When <i>Hosea</i> finished his <i>prophecy</i>, he said: who might understand and reflect on the punishments that I have told you until here and you should know them.
“<i>For the paths of God are straight and the righteous will walk on them, etc.</i>” [14:10]. The paths of the Holy One are just and the righteous walk on them. However, the evildoers will stumble on the same path, when they cannot keep the Torah.
The Talmud says in [tractate] <i>Sanhedrin</i>, what is the meaning of the verse “<i>according to their understanding</i>” [13:2]. <i>Rabbi Isaac</i> said: each one of them made an <i>image</i> of his false god and kept the image in his purse and as soon as he thought of his false god, he took out the image and kissed it. And what is the meaning of the verse “<i>let the men that sacrifice kiss the calves</i>” [13:2]. Rabbi Isaac said: the priest of the <i>false gods</i> looked to steal much money from the <i>wealthy people.</i> They took the calves that they worshiped as a false god, and starved them and did not feed them. They made an image of each wealthy man and placed it near the crib of the calf, where it would have eaten. The calves constantly looked at this image and recognized it. Later, the priests let the calves loose in the market. The calves ran after the <i>wealthy men</i> and they rubbed themselves against the rich men. The calves thought that this was the image that stood near their crib, since they looked like them. The priests said that the calf wants that you should pay for having it sacrificed and that is why it is rubbing against you. In this way, the priests picked up the money. This is the meaning of the verse “<i>sacrifices of man; kissing calves</i>” [13:2]. That is to say, what the calves kiss and rub against the people who will have them slaughtered for their sake.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Sanhedrin,</i> 63b.</i>
The Talmud says in [tractate] <i>Yoma. Rabbi Simeon ben Lakish</i> said that repentance is a great thing, since the Holy One makes the premeditated sins of the person as if he never committed the transgressions as the verse says, “<i>for you have stumbled in your iniquity</i>” [14:2]. That is to say, you have stumbled with your transgressions. That is to say, not deliberately, just like someone who falls over something and does not see it. <i>Rabbi Isaac</i> said: It is said in the <i>land of Israel</i>, in the name of <i>Rabbah the son of Mari.</i> Come and see the <i>difference</i> between the Holy One and people. When a person argues with his friend and wants to apologize to him, he is in doubt if his friend will accept his apology. When he does know that his friend will accept his apology, he does not know if he will be satisfied with money or with good words. However, the Holy One is not so. When a person commits transgressions against Him, He is satisfied with good words, as the verse says in the <i>haftorah</i>, “<i>take words with you and return to God</i>” [14:3]. Take good words with you and repent. It is the same for the Holy One if he had built an altar and brought a sacrifice on it, as the verse says, “<i>instead of bulls, we will pay with our lips</i>” [14:3]. <i>Rabbi Isaac</i> said: If a person commits a sin for which is <i>punishable by death</i>, when a cow or a hen dies, or a glass is broken, or a finger is broken, that person’s sin is forgiven and he has atoned for the sin for which he should have suffered. The cow or hen or glass is his expiation. Therefore, a person should not be anguished when he suffers a loss.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Yoma,</i> 86b, with some interpolations.</i>

Shacharit for Yom Kippur

<b>[Isaiah, 57:14–58:14]</b>
“<i>[The Lord] says: build up, build up a highway, clear a road, remove all obstacles</i>” [57:14]. This means, clean out the road and remove the obstacles. This is the Evil Inclination that makes the person stumble and fall, so that one cannot follow the proper path. The evildoer is full of evil thoughts. The person should not think, how does the Holy One have His thoughts on me, humble, weak person? He does not observe my transgressions, since He is very high in heaven. Similarly, how should the Holy One hear my repentance, because the Holy One is very important and lives in the high heaven? Therefore, the prophet said: “<i>I dwell on high, in holiness, etc.</i>” [57:15]. This means, the Holy One said: I am high, among holy angels in the high heaven, yet at the same time I am also among the people on the earth who consider themselves humble and have a broken heart. Even though they are in the exile and have troubles, they should not think that I do not think of them, but I will not war with them and torment them forever.
“<i>I who make spirits flag</i>” [57:16]. This means, the soul is a spirit for me. I have given the same spirit into the person’s body, which can make the body good. The body commits transgressions because it is from the earth.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Isaiah, 57:14</i>
“<i>For their sinful greed I was angry</i>” [57:17]. This means, because of sin, that is stealing and robbing, therefore the Holy One is angry. All transgressions come from money, that one steals from another. The first is <i>encroaching on a boundary</i>, <sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew term is “<i>masig gevul</i>,” and refers to improperly or unlawfully encroaching on a boundary, and can refer to anything that belongs to another person.</i> the second <i>jealousy</i>, that somebody is <i>jealous of his friend</i> when he sees that he acquires something. <i>Hatred</i> is when he hates his friend. This also comes because of money. False <i>oaths</i> also come because of money. <i>Desecration of God</i>’<i>s name</i> is also because of money. This is when he wants to do something unjust to a gentile and the gentile learns of it. He has committed a great sin and no repentance helps. The gentile says about this that not only are their business dealings unjust, but their religion is also unjust, <i>heaven forbid. Desecration of the Sabbath</i> also comes from money, because many forbidden things are done on the Sabbath that should not be done. Many people, because of stinginess, eat nonkosher food. There are many very <i>rich people</i> who can well afford to hire a Jewish cook, poor Jewish maidens, and they would rather hire <i>gentile maids</i> who cook everything <i>non-kosher</i>, particularly in wealthy houses. The mistress of the house considers herself rich and important, and sleeps until late in the day, the maid makes everything non-kosher, since the mistress does not come into the kitchen. She is afraid to dirty her beautiful clothes. That is why the verse says here in the haftorah, “<i>For their sinful greed I was angry</i>” [57:17]. This means, because of the sin that their meal was cooked in a non-kosher way. Therefore, the Holy One is angry and He says, “<i>sinful greed.</i>” This means, the blessings over the meal are called, <i>his greed.</i> The same meal is not kosher. Because of the sin, I will not accept it and will remove My Shekhinah from you. The Shekhinah is not at the table where the meal is not kosher. The table compared to the altar and atones for the person. In the exile, when there is no Temple, the table is compared to the altar. Or, heaven forbid, when there is non-kosher food on the table, then the Shekhinah removes itself. Therefore, He says, “<i>I struck and turned away</i>” [57:17]. This means, I will remove My Shekhinah. The sin comes from stinginess, because he is not careful to have a Jewish cook.
“<i>I note how they fare and will heal them</i>” [57:18]. He said: when the person will hold himself humble and will repent, I will give him a good reward, because he has suffered exile and travails for Me. Whoever accepts the exile and travails and becomes humble through them, I will give him a good reward.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Isaiah, 57:18.</i>
“<i>Heartening, comforting words</i>” [57:19]. The Holy One said: I do not desire sacrifices or much mortification of the body, but the words of the mouth and recognition of the transgression that he did before Me. This is the meaning of “<i>heartening, comforting words</i>” [57:19]. I have created speech of the mouth, therefore speak to Me. The transgressions that are between a person and his friend, when he is angry with his friend, Yom Kippur does not help with this. He must make peace with him. Therefore it says here, “<i>peace, peace to the distant and the near</i>” [57:19]. That is to say, you should make peace with and ask forgiveness of strangers and those close to you.
Our sages learn from the verse that the penitents have a better place in the Garden of Eden than the righteous. Therefore, the verse first says, “<i>to the distant.</i>” This means, the evildoer who was far from the Holy One because of his evil deeds and has repented, the Holy One forgives him first.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Isaiah, <i>Remez,</i> 488.</i>
What happens with the evildoer who sins and has arrogance in his heart? He forgets the Holy One, as the verse says, “<i>your heart grow haughty and you forget</i>” [Deuteronomy, 8:14]. This means, the haughty heart causes you to forget God. Therefore, it says here, “<i>but the wicked are like the troubled sea</i>” [57:20]. That is to say, the waves of the sea; one is greater than the other one. One wave sees the other wave crash against the barrier and it disappears. Immediately, other waves come and make themselves high, even though they too will disappear. The evildoers are also like this. They say that they will do all evil, even though they will go to Gehenna.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Isaiah, 57:20.</i>
“<i>There is no peace for the wicked</i>” [57:21]. That is to say, the Holy One said: I will give the evildoers no peace and I will let them be warned by the prophets, in order to punish them, so that they should not say, we did not know what is a your sin. Therefore, the verse says here, “<i>cry with full throat, without restraint; raise your voice, like a ram</i>’<i>s horn</i>” [58:1]. This means, cry with your throat, shout very loud, like a ram’s horn, and tell Israel all of their sins. These same evildoers present themselves as very pious, just like they would love Me, God. They bow down at <i>Modim</i> [we thank you] often. Therefore the verse says, “<i>they seek me daily</i>” [58:2]. They come into the synagogue to seek Me, just like they wanted to know My path. Therefore he says, “<i>eager to learn My ways</i>” [58:2]. They always seek Me and do not desire to observe this. They fast and they do not receive what they desire. He says, why should we fast? Should we torment our bodies because He heeds our <i>fasts?</i> Concerning this, the verse says, “<i>why, when we fasted, did You pay no heed?</i>” [58:3]. That is to say, we fast and God does not look upon our fasts and we torment our bodies and you do not want to know. The Holy One responds, “<i>because on your fast day you see to your business</i>” [58:3]. That is, how should I accept your fasts when you fast? You follow all of you desires. You play cards and discuss the news. You spend the day and sometimes <i>engage in slander</i> about people in the course of your conversation.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Isaiah, 58:3.</i>
“<i>You fast in strife and contention</i>” [58:4]. Your fasts are full of contention.
“<i>And oppress all your laborers</i>” [58:3]. That is to say, you fast only occasionally. He cannot digest his food. He eats after the fast with great desire. This is the meaning of “<i>And oppress all your laborers</i>” [58:3]. You want to chase away your mourning and sickness with the fast. He makes a doctor out of the fast.
“<i>Your fasting today is not such as to make your voice heard on high</i>” [58:4]. That is to say, you do not fast when it properly breaks your heart, for then the Holy One would accept your voice.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Isaiah, 58:4.</i>
“<i>Is such the fast, etc.</i>” [58:5]. That is to say, is this called fasting, to torment your body, bow <i>Modim</i> deeply, and wear a sack, and ashes on his head? You think that you have fasted properly? God does not desire this. Rather, “<i>to unlock fetters of wickedness and unite the cords of the yoke</i>” [58:6]. That is to say, open the buttons of your heart and the things you have against your friend and make peace with him. Help the poor and lend him money before he falls very low. It is a very meritorious thing to lend the pauper, more than to give him charity. When you have a servant of the children of Israel, do not torment them with heavy labor.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Isaiah, 58:5.</i>
“<i>Share your bread with the hungry</i>” [58:7]. Honor guests who are poor. There are many people who, when they see a rich guest, pull on his sleeve and tear at his sleeve and his garment until he must go and eat with them. However, he does not look at the poor person. Therefore, it says, “<i>share your bread.</i>” Give your bread to eat, to the poor person who is hungry. Do not think about honoring those who are sated. Therefore, it says in two ways, “<i>Share your bread with the hungry</i>” [58:7]. This means, you should put aside a portion to send to those who are hungry, to their homes. Afterwards it says, “<i>take the wretched poor into your house</i>” [58:7]. This means that you should take the poor into your house to feed them. “<i>When you see the naked to clothe them</i>” [58:7]. This means that when you see poor people with torn clothes; make them clothes. “<i>Not to ignore your own kin</i>” [58:7]. You should not ignore your <i>relatives.</i> You want to disown them because they are poor.
“<i>Then shall your light burst through like the dawn</i>” [58:8]. This means that his fortune will shine like the morning star.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Isaiah, 58:8.</i>
“<i>And your vindicator will go before you</i>” [58:8]. This means that your charity will go before you in the <i>world to come</i> and will speak on your behalf.
“<i>The glory of the Lord will be your rear guard</i>” [58:8]. You will be incorporated with honor among the <i>righteous in the world to come.</i>
“<i>Then when you shall call, the Lord will answer</i>” [58:9]. This means that the Holy One will reward your desires that you desire.
“<i>And you offer your compassion to the hungry</i>” [58:10]. You should honor the poor person with a good heart. Then the Holy One will illumine the darkness for you. That is to say, when you will have troubles, the Holy One will rescue you.
“<i>The Lord will guide you always</i>” [58:11]. The Holy One’s thoughts will be positive for you. From the haftorah we can learn that fasting alone does not help, but giving charity does. This is because all the sins come through money. Therefore, it is correct that he should give charity from his money. Through this, he will remove himself from the evil deeds that come from money. Since this is a day on which we cannot enjoy delights, like all the other holidays. Therefore, our sages learned from the <i>haftorah</i>, “<i>the Lord</i>’<i>s holy day honored</i>” [58:13]. This means, sanctify the day by wearing beautiful clothes. Therefore, each person should also take to heart if he committed a sin by thinking about a woman. Many people commit sins with their thoughts. The Evil Inclination is particularly strong with regard to women. Therefore, we read the Torah <i>portion concerning illicit sex</i> in the synagogue, that one should not sleep with strange women and have no thoughts about them.
We will write about <i>customs</i> of <i>Yom Kippur.</i> Every person should know how to behave when he recites the <i>Ashamnu</i> prayer. He should stand and when he has recited it by himself, she should recite it again together with the cantor. If a person had committed a sin in a previous year and had prayed about it and had previously repented on a previous <i>Yom Kippur</i>, yet he should remember it every Yom Kippur and should pray about it, even if he did not commit this sin in this year.
One <i>immerses</i> in the <i>mikvah</i> on the <i>eve of Yom Kippur</i> because of <i>seminal emissions.</i> He does not have to immerse himself more than one time, without a blessing. If someone had a relative die between <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> and <i>Yom Kippur</i>, he is still allowed to <i>immerse</i> himself on the <i>eve of Yom Kippur.</i> Even though one is not supposed wash oneself in the first <i>thirty days</i> of mourning, he is allowed to <i>immerse</i> himself to fulfill a commandment on the <i>eve of Yom Kippur.</i>
On the eve of <i>Yom Kippur</i> he should eat a light meal that he can easily digest and should not overeat. He should not eat <i>spicy</i> foods, so that he should not allow himself to be overheated and have a <i>seminal emission</i>, <i>heaven forbid</i>, on <i>Yom Kippur.</i> He should not eat dairy on <i>Yom Kippur</i>, which contains semen, but on the morning of the <i>eve of Yom Kippur</i> it is the custom to eat dairy foods.
If someone has extinguished a light, he should not ask a gentile to light it, but he should light it after the end of <i>Yom Kippur</i> and allow it to burn to the end.
A woman who has recently given birth is allowed to wear shoes in the first four weeks, since it is a <i>danger</i> to go barefoot. If it rains, one is allowed to wear shoes to the synagogue. A woman who has given birth within the last three days, then she is certainly allowed to eat on <i>Yom Kippur.</i> If she had a child on the seventh day of <i>Tishrei</i>, in the evening, then she is allowed to eat on <i>Yom Kippur</i>, just like a sick person who is told by a physician that it is a <i>danger</i> if they do not eat. Then, it is permitted to feed him. If the sick person says that he does not need to eat and the physician says that he needs to eat, then he is fed. If the person says that he needs to eat and even if a hundred physicians say that he does not need to be fed, then we follow the sick person. If a physician says that the person needs to be fed and if someone says that he does not need to be fed then follow the person who says that he should be fed. One should be warned that if one feeds the mother or the sick person, one should not give them too much to eat at one time.
We will again write about repentance to people. Has the Holy One given us only one day to forgive the sins? Therefore, he should reflect on it before he dies. The <i>Sefer Pirke de Rabbi Eliezer</i> writes. <i>Rabbi Simeon the son of Lakish,</i> with two friends, stole much and did many evil deeds. <i>Rabbi Simeon</i> did a great act of repentance through fasting, prayer and Torah study, for the evil things that he had done. He and his two friends died on the same day. <i>Rabbi Simeon</i> came to the <i>Garden of Eden</i> and his friends came to <i>Gehenna.</i> His two friends said: Lord of the Universe, is there injustice in heaven <i>Rabbi Simeon</i> came to the Garden of Eden and we to Gehenna? The Holy One responded: <i>Rabbi Simeon repented</i> and you did not <i>repent.</i> They said: we would have also <i>repented.</i> The Holy One said: one does not repent after death.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Pirke de Rabbi Eliezer</i>, chap. 43.</i> A parable. A person travels on the sea, but if he does not buy bread on the dry land, then he will not have what to eat on the sea. Similarly, whoever does not repent during his lifetime, he cannot do it later. The person who dies without repenting, that he did not reflect on his sins before his death, he would be punished severely in the next world.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer ha-Musar</i>, ch. 2, p. 37. The passage from <i>Pirke de Rabbi Eliezer</i> immediately preceding this also immediately precedes the parable in the <i>Sefer ha-Musar.</i></i>
It is written in the <i>Sefer Ha-Musar.</i> The person dies without repenting is like a king who has many ministers he loves and considers to be honest. These ministers made an agreement to steal the best silver and gold vessels and <i>precious stones</i> from the king’s <i>treasury.</i> They broke into the treasury at night and stole the best things. One day, the king came into the treasury and saw that all the best vessels have been stolen. The king inquired and investigated. The king was told that his most beloved ministers did this. The king was very despondent, but out of great love he was not concerned with the precious vessels. The king said that the ministers are honest and they would not do this. The king said that it is a lie. The ministers are honest and they would not do this. The people said to the king. You will find the stolen items with the ministers. The king reflected; what should I do? If they have the stolen items, they will be put to death. I will not be able to save them. The king had to order that they be brought to trial, and see if they had the stolen items. On the way, before one reached the king, there was a body of water. The king secretly sent a message to the ministers who had the stolen items. He informed them that they should throw the stolen items into the water. He would pardon them for the theft and they would remain alive. Do not despair about the gold and precious stones. The ministers threw the vessels and the gold into the water, but one of them kept the stolen goods. They came before the king and they did not find anything. They searched the one and found the <i>precious stones</i> on him. The king became angry and said: why did you not throw the stolen goods into the water like the other <i>ministers?</i> He could not answer. The king said: you must die. Your second sin is worse than your first sin. The first sin, that you stole the goods, came from your Evil Inclination. However, I told you that you should throw it away in the hope that you would be protected from death. In particular, you saw your colleagues throw it into the water and you did not follow them. Since you trivialized my command and did not reflect on it, therefore you must suffer the bitter death. The king commanded that he be put to death with a bitter death. The king sent for his friends, the other ministers; honored them and was very happy with them. So too is the king, the Holy One, who commands that we repent in the hope we will not die, as the verse says, “<i>turn back from your evil ways that you may not die</i>” [Ezekiel, 33:11]. This means, repent from your evil ways. Therefore, <i>penance, charity and prayer</i> because you will die. Repentance means that one should fast, prayer through praying, charity through giving money to the poor. This is best, since charity atones for sins and makes the person rich.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer ha-Musar</i>, ch. 2, p. 49.</i>
We find a story about two brothers in [Midrash] <i>Rabbati</i>, <i>parshat Behukotai.</i> One was very charitable and the other one gave no charity at all. One sold his house and everything that he had and gave it to the poor as charity. One time, on <i>Hoshanah Rabbah</i>, his wife gave him ten gulden to buy something for his children. He encountered a <i>communal official</i> collecting money to have a dress made for a bride who was an orphan. The official said: give me your <i>portion for the orphan.</i> He took the ten gulden that his wife had given him and gave it to the official. He was ashamed to go home, so he went to the synagogue. Youths had thrown the <i>etrogs</i> into the synagogue. The custom was that the youths played with the <i>etrogs</i> on <i>Hoshanah Rabbah.</i> The one who had given the charity took the <i>etrogs</i> and filled a sack with them and traveled overseas. He came to a city where the king of the land had a stomach ailment. He had a dream about what would cure him. He must eat <i>etrogs</i> that the Jews had blessed on <i>Sukkot</i> in the synagogue. The king authorized a search, but nobody could find them. They searched in all the cities and all the ships at sea. They asked him: do you have something to sell? He answered: I am a poor man. They inspected his sack and found the <i>etrogs.</i> They asked him: what is this? He said: they are <i>etrogs</i> that the Jews blessed on <i>Sukkot.</i> They took the sack with the <i>etrogs</i> and brought them before the king. He ate them and the king became healthy from them. The king had the sack filled with gold gulden and said to the Jew. What do you desire? He said: I should be given back my house and everything that I sold and I want to give the money again and the whole city should welcome me. The king said that it would be done. As soon as he came to his city, it was announced that he should be welcomed. They went to welcome him and his brother, wife and children also went to welcome him. There was a body of water on the way and his brother along with his whole household drowned and the one who had given charity inherited all the goods and money belonging to his brother. Concerning this, the verse says, “<i>for He pays a man according to his actions</i>” [Job 34:11]. This means, as the person earns, so does God pay him. Therefore, see what charity is.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Leviticus Rabbah,</i> 37.2.</i>

Minchah of Yom Kippur

<b>[Jonah, 1:1–4:11]</b>
“<i>The word of the Lord came to Jonah son of Amittai</i>” [1:1]. The Holy One said to <i>Jonah</i> the prophet that he should go to the city of <i>Nineveh</i>, which was completely gentile, that they should repent. The story was written because, even though they were gentiles, as soon as the prophet punished them they did a great act of repentance. Israel, who have a great many prophets among them, yet they do not want to listen and repent. This informs us of the great miracle that the prophet was in the fish for three days and remained alive. Afterwards, the fish spat him out on the <i>dry land.</i> It also informs us that the Holy One forgives the whole world, whether it is Israel or the other nations. The Holy One said to Jonah the prophet: go and announce in the great city of Nineveh and tell them that they have committed great sins.
“<i>Jonah set out</i>” [1:3]. Jonah set out and ran away to the city of <i>Tarshish</i>, to flee before the Holy One. That is, he thought to himself. I will run <i>outside the land of Israel</i> and the <i>Shekhinah</i> will no longer rest on me. This, I will no longer have to go and punish the city of Nineveh. Jonah said: were I to punish the gentiles, they would immediately repent. The Holy One would say: the gentile serpent immediately and my people Israel, I let them be punished every day and they do not turn back, though they have many <i>prophets.</i> The Holy One will, <i>heaven forbid</i>, punish Israel with troubles because of that. Therefore, Jonah did not want to punish the gentiles of the city of <i>Nineveh.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Jonah, 1:3.</i>
“<i>He went down to Joppa</i>” [1:3]. He came to a city called <i>Joppa</i> and found there a ship that was going to the city of <i>Tarshish.</i> He paid the crew their fee that they took from all the <i>merchants.</i> He said: don’t wait for the other <i>merchants.</i> I will pay what the <i>merchants</i> would give you.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Jonah, 1:3.</i> He was very rich.

He said to them: I am a prophet and the Holy One wants that I should punish the people of Nineveh. Therefore, I have fled <i>outside the land of Israel</i>, where there is no prophecy.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Jonah, 1:10.</i> They said to Jonah: what should we do to calm the sea? Jonah said: throw me into the sea and it will become calm. This is because of me and because of my sin. They tried to reach the port, but they could not find it. They called again to God, a great outcry, and said, let us not be destroyed because of this person. They took Jonah and threw him into the sea. The sea ceased to storm.
“<i>The Lord provided a huge fish</i>” [2:1]. The Holy One had prepared a huge fish to swallow Jonah. The fish had been prepared since the <i>six days of creation.</i> He went into the fish like one goes through the large gate of a synagogue. The mouth of the fish glowed with a light. <i>Rabbi Meir</i> said that there was a <i>precious stone</i> in the fish that provided illumination for Jonah who saw everything that was in the sea. The fish said to Jonah: do you not know that my day is coming that the great fish, the <i>Leviathan</i> who is the king over all fish, will eat me? Every day the <i>Leviathan</i> eats up fish. Jonah said: take me to the <i>Leviathan</i> and I will save you and me from death. The fish took him to the Leviathan. He came to the Leviathan and said to him. I have come to you and want to see your home in the sea. Know that in the days of the Messiah, I am the one who will catch you with a large fishhook to make a large banquet out of you for the righteous. He showed him the <i>seal of Abraham our Patriarch</i>, which is the circumcision. Immediately, the Leviathan fell back several miles from the fish in which Jonah lay. Jonah said: I have protected you from death. Show me everything that is found in the sea. He showed him the great <i>sea Oceanus</i> that surrounds the whole world and also showed him the place where the sea had split when the Israelites had left Egypt. He also showed him the pillars on which the world stands. He showed him Gehenna and showed him the place where the children of <i>Korah</i> stood. They were swal- lowed up by the earth and they prayed. Jonah spent three days and three nights in the fish and he did not pray. The Holy One said: because I have put him into a spacious fish, therefore he does not pray. I will send him into a fish that is <i>female</i> and carries within her bowels many thousands of small fish. It will be tight for him and he will pray to the Holy One. He desires that we should pray to Him, particularly the prayers of the righteous, which He keeps. The Holy One immediately sent a pregnant fish to the fish and let it say: the <i>prophet</i> that is within you, give him into my bowels. Thus has the Holy One commanded: if you want to give him over with good will, then it is good. If you do not want to, I will swallow both of you. The fish responded: who says that the Holy One commanded this? The <i>female</i> responded: the Leviathan knows this well. They went to the Leviathan. The female fish said to the Leviathan: do you not know that the Holy One sent to the fish where Jonah is and I should take Jonah within me? The Leviathan responded affirmatively. Then the fish in whom Jonah was, asked: in which hour did the Holy One command this? The Leviathan responded: in the last three hours of the day when the Holy One would play with me. I heard the Holy One say this. The fish immediately spit out Jonah and the female fish swallowed him. It was very tight for the prophet and it stank greatly. He immediately began to pray and said: <i>Lord of the Universe</i>, where should I go or to where should I flee? Your throne is in heaven and You are king over all the angels and the earth is Your footstool under Your feet. All the works of the world are open to You. You examine the footsteps of man. I ask you, answer me out of the belly of the abyss and help me in the depths. You God, You sit far from me. Answer me soon, You kill and bring to life. The Holy One immediately told the fish to spit out the prophet. The fish spit out the prophet a distance of nine hundred and sixty-five miles to the <i>dry land.</i> The ship’s crew saw the great wonder that the Holy One had done with the prophet. They immediately converted and went to Jerusalem and became Jews. Their wives and children also converted. Concerning this, the verse says, “<i>and for the righteous converts.</i>”<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">This “verse” is not found in the Bible. It is a continuation of Psalms, 75:11, quoted in B. <i>Hagigah,</i> 17b. The whole paragraph is from <i>Pirke de Rabbi Eliezer</i>, chap. 10.</i>
“<i>The word of the Lord came to Jonah a second time</i>” [3:1]. God said to Jonah a second time. Go to the great city of <i>Nineveh</i> and tell them that they should repent before they will be destroyed in forty days. The city of Nineveh was as large as a three days walk. Jonah went one day’s journey in the city and called out, repent or you will be destroyed in forty days if you do not repent. They immediately believed the prophet. There were people in the city similar to those in the ship with Jonah. They fasted and each one clothed themselves only in sack, from great to small. The king learned of this and he stood up from his throne and took off his robes, put on a sack and sat on the ashes. He asked that nobody should eat and the animals not be fed. The king was Pharaoh, who remained alive in the sea and was not drowned with his people. He became king in the city of Nineveh. The Holy One allowed him to live so that he would tell the wonders that the Holy One did for Israel in Egypt and at the sea. The city of Nineveh was very evil. They committed robbery and engaged in <i>homosexuality.</i> Therefore, the king announced that they should fast for three days and he separated the men and women. He also had the animals separated, and the calves were also separated. The children saw their mothers and cried that they wanted to be suckled. The mothers also cried, all one hundred and twenty-three thousand and they lifted their children heavenward. They said: <i>Lord of the universe</i>, do this for the sake of the children who have not sinned. On the third day, they did a great act of repentance. Whoever had stolen something from his friend returned it to his friend. Even someone else’s beam from their house, was broken out and returned it to the original owner. Similarly, they broke out a stone from their wall and returned it.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Pirke de Rabbi Eliezer</i>, chap. 43; <i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Jonah, <i>Remez</i>, 550.</i>
“<i>Who knows but that God may turn and relent?</i>” [3:9]. Whoever knows how we should repent should come and tell us and we will gladly learn. Then the Holy One will have mercy on us so that we will not be destroyed. Soon, God saw their good deeds, had mercy and they remained alive. The <i>prophet Jonah</i> was very despondent that his prophecy did not continue, that he remained a <i>false prophet.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Jonah, 3:9.</i> He said to the Holy One: that is why I did not want to go. I know well that You are a God who is compassionate and will forgive them. I have remained a <i>false prophet.</i> Therefore, <i>Lord of the Universe</i> let me rather not see the suffering of Israel because they did not repent and the gentiles did repent. The Holy One responded: the good is more in your eyes than the evil. I have done good to have mercy on the people. Jonah went out of the city and made himself a booth to live in, at a distance. He wanted to see what would happen with the city. What did the Holy One do? He caused a large gourd to grow over his head to protect him from the heat and the flies, since the trees and branches had withered. The heat hurt him very much and therefore the Holy One caused a large gourd to grow overnight. He was very happy about the gourd and the Holy One sent a worm to the gourd and caused the gourd to wither. The sun beat down on Jonah and he was very anguished. He cried and was faint. Jonah asked the Holy One to kill him. The Holy One said to the prophet. You are anguished over the gourd, that it was destroyed. You care for the gourd, since you were saved from the sun by the gourd. So too, I, even though the city of Nineveh was full of gentiles, yet I have created them and all of creation is My glory. Therefore, I desired that they should repent and remain alive. Jonah, you had compassion on the gourd that you did not exert yourself to make. You did not plow and did not sow it. It is customary that when a person exerts himself with something and it disappears, the he misses it. The gourd grew in one night and existed for one day. You are anguished about it, so how should I not be anguished over the great city of Nineveh with many thousands of people that I created. There are many thousands of children who committed no sins. Should they suffer because of the sins of their parents? However, now the parents have repented and the children have no sins over them.

First Day of Sukkot

<b>[Zechariah, 14:1–21]</b>
“<i>Lo a day of the Lord is coming when your spoil shall be divided in your very midst</i>” [14:1]. The prophet said: a day will come when the glory and greatness of the Holy One will be shown. When Gog and Magog will come to the land of Israel and they will divide the goods and gold into shares for each other, that they will take from the nations.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Zechariah, 14:1.</i>
“<i>For I will gather all the nations, etc.</i>” [14:2]. The Holy One said: I will gather all the nations in the city of Jerusalem. They will war against Jerusalem and they will besiege Jerusalem. They will destroy their houses and sleep with their wives. Half the city will run away into exile and half the city will remain. The people of Jerusalem will be captured by the nations and imprisoned in their tents before the city of Jerusalem. They will remain in exile until the other half of the city of Jerusalem will go out to do battle and to take away Israel that were imprisoned before the city of Jerusalem. The Holy One will go into battle with them and they will win the war.
“<i>On that day, He will set His foot, etc.</i>” [14:4]. The feet of the Holy One will stand on the Mount of Olives which stands to the east of Jerusalem. This mountain will be split into two parts, half will run to the north and half will run to the south. There will be a great valley and field between the two parts of the mountain.
“<i>And the valley in the hills, etc.</i>” [14:5]. You will flee and run away when the mountains will be split apart, and you will flee through the valley of the mountains, since the valley will reach until the city of <i>Azal.</i> There will be a great outcry, and as a result of the great storms you will flee like they fled from the earthquakes in the days of <i>Uzziah, king of Judah.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Amos, 1:1.</i> However, the Holy One will come with all of His holy angels and take revenge.
The <i>Tanhuma</i> writes: “<i>Then the Lord will come forth and make war on those nations</i>” [14:3]. Rabbi Levi said: the evildoers will be smart in plotting against Israel. Each one will say: I am smarter than you are. <i>Esau</i> said: <i>Cain</i> was a fool. He killed his brother <i>Abel</i> while his father was still alive. He did not think that his father would have many more children and <i>be fruitful and multiply.</i> What did it help that he killed his brother Abel? He thought that he would inherit the world alone. Indeed, when his father had more children, what did it help him that he killed his brother Abel? Therefore, Esau said: I will be smarter and will behave more intelligently. I will wait until my father Isaac will die and then I will kill my brother Jacob. Pharaoh said that Esau was a fool. I am smarter than Esau who waited until Isaac, his father, would die. Esau did not know that Jacob would have many children before Isaac, his father, would die. What would it help if he killed Jacob when his children would remain alive? Therefore, Pharaoh said: I will be smarter than Esau. I will kill the children as soon as their mothers will give birth to them. They should be immediately strangled. <i>Haman</i> said that Pharaoh was a fool. He ordered that the sons be killed and allowed the daughters to live. He did not think that they would have husbands and have many children. Therefore, Haman said: I will be smarter. I will kill men, women, and small children and grown ones, so that nobody would remain. When <i>Gog and Magog</i> will come and say: all the nations were fools. They did not see that Israel had a protector and a king over Israel in heaven. Therefore, I will first wage war with their Lord in heaven, that is to say, the Holy One, and then I will wage war with Israel. Thus, the Holy One responds: you want to wage war against Me? I will gladly wage war with you, as the verse says, “<i>The Lord goes forth like a warrior</i>” [Isaiah, 42:13], “<i>On that day, He will set His feet on the Mount of Olives</i>” [14:4].<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanhuma</i>, <i>Emor</i>, 13. ; <i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Zechariah, <i>Remez</i>, 583.</i>
“<i>In that day, there shall be neither sunlight nor cold moonlight</i>” [14:6]. There will come a day when there won’t be light after nightfall. That is, the day will be neither for troubles nor for redemption. That day will be to proclaim the wonders and signs of the Holy One, which He will do on that day.
“<i>At evening time there will be light, etc.</i>” [14:7]. That is to say, when Israel will be in their greatest troubles, just like the night which is dark. This is compared to the exile and when Israel will go out of the city of Jerusalem and will be captives in the hands of the nations of the world, it will be very dark for Israel. The Holy One will go forth and wage war with the nations, but the Holy One caused Israel to be tested if they would believe in the Holy One. That is why they were taken captive from the city of Jerusalem. This is the meaning of the verse here, “<i>At evening time there will be light, etc.</i>” [14:7]. When it will be dark for Israel in exile, the Holy One will make a light for Israel to redeem them.
“<i>On that day living waters shall flow from Jerusalem</i>” [14:8]. On that day, a spring of water will flow from Jerusalem. Half will go to the <i>east</i> to the sea and half to the <i>west</i> to the lowest sea. In summer and in winter the water will not cease flowing. That is to say, the cold will not harm it in the winter or the heat in the summer.
<i>Ibn Shuaib</i> writes in <i>parshat Phinehas</i> about this verse that the water that will go out of Jerusalem will drown the water of the river Shittim, that Israel engaged in illicit sex there.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers, 25:1–9.</i> The waters that will go out of <i>Jerusalem</i> will drown the waters of Shittim. This may be interpreted by the verse “<i>I will sprinkle clean water on you</i>” [Ezekiel, 36:25]. That is to say, I will sprinkle water on you so that you will not follow the Evil Inclination, after adultery, as the verse says, “<i>He will destroy death forever</i>” [Isaiah, 25:8]. That is to say, the Evil Inclination will no longer exist. There are bodies of water that and the one who sits and drinks from these waters must engage in illicit sexual relations. It was so at the river of <i>Shittim.</i> When Israel were sitting at the river Shittim, they engaged in illicit sexual relations, because the water flowed over vegetation, and some herbs have within them the ability to cause a person to engage in illicit sexual relations. In contrast, there are some herbs that cause the person to refrain from sexual relations. Therefore, the Holy One promises to give us the river that causes us to refrain from illicit sexual relations and this river will feed other rivers whose <i>nature</i> was to incite illicit sexual relations, like the river Shittim. The hope is that Israel will not sin anymore, as the verse promised, “<i>I will drive the northerners far from you</i>” [Joel, 2:20]. That is to say, I will remove the Evil Inclination from Israel when the Messiah will come, in the expectation that they will be free of sins, as the verse said here, “<i>living waters shall flow from Jerusalem</i>” [14:8].<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Ibn Shuaib, <i>Derashot</i>, II: 398.</i>
“<i>And the Lord shall be king over all the earth, etc.</i>” [14:9]. They will recognize on that day that God is God alone and there is no other and His name is eternal.
“<i>The whole country shall become like the Arabah</i>” [14:10]. There were many mountains in Jerusalem, but when the Messiah will come, the Holy One will remove the mountains and the area around Jerusalem will be like a plain. Jerusalem will still be seen as high as before because the surrounding mountains will be removed and Israel will dwell there. They will no longer be expelled from there.
“<i>There will be a plague with which the Lord will smite, etc.</i>” [14:12]. The Holy One will smite the nations that waged war against Jerusalem. Their limbs will fall off while they are still alive and standing on their feet. Their eyes will drain out and a hole will be left in their heads where their eyes were. Their tongues will dissolve in their mouths.
“<i>In that day, there will be, etc.</i>” [14:13]. It will be in that day that the nations will be crazy. They will kill each other, a man and his friend. The horses, donkeys, camels, and all the cattle of these nations will also be killed.
“<i>All those who survived of all these nations</i>” [14:16]. All the nations that will remain after this war will go every year to Jerusalem on <i>Sukkot</i> to bow down to God. The war of Gog and Magog will be during <i>Sukkot.</i> Therefore, the nations will make a memorial that they were protected from the war on Sukkot.
“<i>Those who do not go up, etc.</i>” [14:17]. Those of the nations who will not go up on <i>Sukkot</i> to Jerusalem, will have no rain. That is to say, they will die of hunger.
“<i>If the community of Egypt does not ascend, etc.</i>” [14:18]. That is, when the Egyptians will not go up to Jerusalem on <i>Sukkot</i>, what kind of travails should I impose on them when they never need rain? Their grain grows without rain. Therefore, I will punish them because they did not go up to Jerusalem and so will it happen to all the nations.
“<i>On that day even the bells of the horses shall be inscribed, holy to the Lord, etc.</i>” [14:20]. Everything will be <i>holy</i> to God, even the bells that hang from the necks of the horses will be inscribed, holy to God. They will make pots for the Temple from them, since they will need many pots in the Temple because they will bring many sacrifices on that day.
“<i>Indeed, very metal pot in Jerusalem and in Judah shall be holy</i>” [14:21]. There will be so many sacrifices on <i>Sukkot</i> that they will no have enough pots to cook and bring the sacrifices. Therefore, they will have to take pots instead from the houses of Jerusalem.
“<i>In that day, there shall be no more traders in the House of the Lord of Hosts</i>” [14:21]. That is to say, they will have to hire <i>craftsmen</i> to make pots in the Temple and people would donate many pots to offer sacrifices. Another explanation is that there would no longer be the <i>nation of Gibeonites.</i> They used to serve the priests in the Temple, to chop wood and draw water. However, nobles will come and chop wood and draw water for the priests, in the days of the Messiah.
<i>Amen.</i>

Second Day of Sukkot

<b>[I Kings, 7:51–8:21]</b>
“<i>When all the work was completed</i>” [7:51]. When the work of the Temple was completed and King Solomon brought all the gold, silver and vessels of his father David into the <i>Temple.</i> He did not use it for the Temple, but he placed it all in the treasury. Some sages say that he placed it in the treasury because he did not want to use it. Solomon knew that the Temple would be destroyed and the nations would say that it was destroyed because David had taken much of the silver and gold through force and robbery and allowed the Temple to be built from it. Some other sages say that <i>King Solomon</i> said that there was a great famine in the days of David and he had much silver and gold and he did not feed the poor. That is why Solomon did not want to have that silver and gold. He would rather let poor people live from that silver and gold.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, I Kings, <i>Remez,</i> 186; <i>Pesikta Rabbati</i>, <i>Piska</i> 6.</i> From here we learn that it is a greater mitzvah to give charity to the poor and to feed them when they are hungry rather than to have sacred objects in the synagogue. There are many people who give beautiful metal or silver [objects] in the synagogue and they do not know that it is more important to feed <i>poor people.</i>
It is written in <i>Midrash Pesikta Rabbati.</i> Scripture says here, “<i>from his work</i>” [Genesis, 2:2]. All the labors were completed. This teaches us that God created the world, but the work of creation was not completed until the Temple was finished. Another explanation of this verse teaches us that there was great peace when the Temple was built. All the <i>artisans</i> who built the Temple were healthy and fresh. None of them had headaches and none of them died. No ax broke nor did any tool that they used to work on the <i>Temple. Rabbi Eliezer</i> says that this was nothing new. The Holy One allowed each one to live while working on the Temple for the sake of His glory. I want to show you that even for the sake of Jacob’s honor; those Egyptians who accompanied him to his burial in the <i>land of Israel</i>, there were thousands of them, and nobody became sick, much less died. They all came home in peace.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, I Kings, <i>Remez,</i> 186; <i>Pesikta Rabbati</i>, <i>Piska</i> 6.</i>
“<i>Then Solomon assembled</i>” [8:1]. Solomon assembled the elders and the leaders to bring up the <i>Holy Ark</i> from the City of David. The <i>Seder Olam</i> writes that the Shekhinah only rests in the midst of a community, or where there is a synagogue.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Seder Olam Rabbah</i>, chap. 16.</i> Therefore, everyone should be warned to go to pray with a minyan. That is why King Solomon assembled all of Israel to bring up the <i>Holy Ark.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, I Kings, <i>Remez,</i> 187.</i>
“<i>In the month of Ethanim</i>” [8:2]. <i>King Solomon</i> assembled <i>Israel</i> in the month of <i>Tishrei.</i> It is called <i>Ethanim</i> because it is heavy with much grain. Another explanation of why it is called <i>Ethanim</i> is that the Patriarchs were born in Tishrei. Another explanation of why it is called <i>Ethanim</i> is because the month of <i>Tishrei</i> is heavy with commandments, and many <i>holidays</i> that were in <i>Tishrei.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, I Kings, <i>Remez,</i> 184.</i>
“<i>And King Solomon</i>” [8:5]. King Solomon and all of Israel brought so many sacrifices that they could not be counted.
“<i>And the priests brought</i>” [8:6]. And the priests brought the Ark into the innermost place in the <i>Temple</i>, under the wings of the birds that Solomon had made. Solomon made great birds from the ground until they reached over the Ark.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, I Kings, 8:6.</i>
“<i>The poles were so long</i>” [8:8]. The poles of the Ark with which the Ark was carried were very long and they always remained with the Ark. The Talmud writes in [tractate] Yoma that when the <i>Temple</i> was destroyed, the nations did not take the Ark with the poles, but they sank into the earth and they could not be found.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Yoma,</i> 53b; <i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, I Kings, <i>Remez,</i> 184.</i>
“<i>There was nothing in the Ark</i>” [8:9]. There were only the two Tablets that Moses had received on Mount Sinai, when Israel left Egypt.
“<i>When the priests went out</i>” [8:10]. When the priests went out of the Temple, the cloud was full of smoke and the priests could not stand in the Temple because of the great amount of smoke.
“<i>Then Solomon said</i>” [8:12]. When Solomon saw in the Temple, he said that the Holy One has kept His word when He promised to let His Shekhinah rest in the Temple. Now, with the cloud, it was shown that the Shekhinah was resting in the Temple.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, I Kings, 8:12.</i>
“<i>I have built</i>” [8:13]. Solomon said: I have built a house for God to rest in, to sit in forever, unlike the other houses that the Holy One had, which were not eternal.
“<i>And the king turned</i>” [8:14]. King Solomon tuned around and blessed all of Israel while all of Israel stood.
“<i>He said, blessed</i>” [8:15]. He blessed and praised God. Praised be God who kept His word that he promised my father David.
“<i>From the day</i>” [8:16]. God said: from the day that I took Israel from Egypt, I have not chosen a city from all the tribes of Israel to build My house that My name should be on it. However, I have chosen David to be a king over Israel.
“<i>He had in mind</i>” [8:17]. Solomon said: my father David had the idea in his heart to build a house for the Holy One. God said to David: you did properly to have in your heart to build the Temple. However, I do not want to have you build the Temple, but your son Solomon should build the Temple. Now the Holy One has kept his word and I, Solomon the son of David, have sat on the throne of Israel and have built the house for the God of Israel.
“<i>And I placed there</i>” [8:21]. I have made a dwelling for the Ark in the Temple, to place there the Tablets of God. God made a covenant with Israel to take Israel out of Egypt.

Intermediate Shabbat of Sukkot

<b>[Ezekiel, 38:18–39:16]</b>
“<i>On that day, when Gog sets foot on the soil of Israel</i>” [38:18]. It will be on that day that <i>Gog and Magog</i> will come to the land of Israel. My wrath will rise up, so says God. With fire I will settle accounts and on that day there will be a great trembling in the whole land of Israel. The fish in the water will tremble before Me, and the birds in the sky, and the animals of the land. When he will be split the Mount of <i>Olives</i>, the mountains will be displaced and they will collapse. The mighty gates and all the walls will collapse. The sword of one friend will be against his friend. That is to say, the Holy One will bring confusion on them so that one will kill his friend among the nations.
“<i>I will punish him with pestilence and with blood</i>” [38:22]. I will judge and will punish him with pestilence so that they will die, with blood and with great rain, like during the Flood. The hail will be large and it will fall from heaven like stones.
Our sages say that in the time of Moses our Teacher, when he punished Pharaoh with hail, there were large stones in the hail. Moses prayed that the hail should cease because Pharaoh had asked him that he should pray. Moses immediately prayed and the hail remained hanging in the air over the people and did not fall to the ground. In the days of Pharaoh, when Moses shouted at the hail, the Holy One hid the same hail until Gog and Magog will come. This same hail will fall on Gog and Magog and their people. The Holy One will allow fire and sulfur to rain on them and on many nations.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Exodus Rabbah,</i> 12.7.</i>
“<i>Thus will I manifest My greatness</i>” [38:23]. The Holy One said: I will be very great, honest and holy in the eyes of the nations and they will know that I am God.
“<i>And you, O mortal, prophesy against Gog</i>” [39:1]. You prophet, say to <i>Gog and Magog</i> that I am God to you, Lord of the nations and I will punish you and break you.
“<i>I will turn you around and drive you one</i>” [39:2]. I will destroy you and I will kill many of your people. There will only remain a sixth part. I will also judge you with six <i>judgments</i> with <i>pestilence</i>, with <i>blood</i>, with great rain and hail that was left over from <i>Moses our Teacher</i>, and with fire and sulfur. These are six and this is the meaning of the verse “<i>I will drive you on.</i>”<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">It is a pun on the Hebrew term that has six (<i>shesh</i>) as part of the word.</i> I will punish you with six <i>judgments</i> and I will bring you from the ends of the earth, from the north, and I will bring you to the city of Jerusalem and I will destroy your bow from your left hand and your arrows from your right hand.
“<i>On the mountains, etc.</i>” [39:4]. Gog and Magog, you will fall on the mountains of Israel with all of your people. The birds and animals of the field will eat your flesh. God has said this and so will it be.
“<i>And I will send a fire</i>” [39:6]. I will send a fire to Gog and Magog eternally, that they should know that I am God.
“<i>I will make My holy name known</i>” [39:7]. I will make my Holy name known to the nations. I will not profane My name further. When Israel are humiliated in exile, the nations say that their God does not have the power to redeem them and to protect them from our hands. Therefore, the Holy One said: the day has come that I have spoken of.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ezekiel, 39:7</i>
“<i>Then the inhabitants of the cities of Israel will go out, etc.</i>” [39:9]. The Israelites will go out of their cities where they dwell and will take the bows, arrows, spears, shields and clubs, and will take their armor and will heat their ovens and will cook with them for seven years. There were many people among the nations who had many spears, arrows and bows. They will not need to chop wood in the forest. They will take their money and goods, thus said God.
“<i>On that day I will assign to Gog, etc.</i>” [39:11]. It will be on that day that I will give in the city that those of Gog and Magog who were killed at that time will be buried where the path goes from all the people. Why were they worthy to be <i>buried?</i> The explanation is that <i>Noah</i> was drunk from wine and he lay uncovered in his tent. His son, <i>Shem</i>, came and covered him with a sheet. His son, <i>Japhet</i>, also helped to take the sheet to cover their father, Noah. They walked backwards and did not want to see the shame of their father. Therefore, his son, Shem, was worthy that his descendants would have zizit on their garments, since Shem immediately was prepared to cover his father, much more than Japhet. Therefore, God gave a good reward to his descendants that they have zizit on their garments. Since Japhet, his son, also helped to cover his father, therefore he had the merit that his descendants were buried in the incident of Gog and Magog. Gog was a descendant of Japhet. The Israelites, who had the zizit, were descended from Shem. The Holy One repaid each one, <i>measure for measure.</i> That is, they both remembered their father and therefore the Holy One also covered the descendants of <i>Shem</i>, who were worthy to have garments to cover themselves with, with zizit. The children of Japhet were covered by the earth.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Genesis Rabbah,</i> 36.6.</i>
Therefore, our sages also said, whoever is wearing zizit will be protected from illicit sexual relations. A story occurred with a <i>rabbi</i> who wanted to sleep with a prostitute who took four hundred gulden as the price to sleep with her. The rabbi came to sleep with her. The rabbi’s zizit came up and slapped him in the face. The rabbi immediately left the prostitute and did not want to sleep with her.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Menahot,</i> 44a.</i>
This was also the intention of Tamar. She said to her father-in-law, Judah, who wanted to sleep with her. She said to him: give me your talit with the zizit as a pledge, if you want to sleep with me. That is, she thought to herself. Perhaps when Judah will sleep with me in his zizit, the zizit will not allow him to sleep with her, as happened in the story we have written about above. Tamar thought: I will hide Judah’s zizit so that he will not see them.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">I have not found the source of this story. However, Ramban in his commentary on Genesis 38:18 identifies the “cord [<i>petil</i>]” with the <i>zizit.</i></i>
If one would ask, how is it that the commandment of zizit protects from illicit sexual relations more than other commandments? The explanation is that the <i>commandment of zizit</i> came because Shem did not want to see his father’s shame. Therefore, the zizit were given that the person should not look at any shame, to come to illicit sexual relations. That is, <i>measure for measure.</i> The zizit protect the person from illicit sexual relations because Shem did not want to see his father’s shame.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Genesis Rabbah,</i> 36.6.</i>
Concerning this, the Talmud says in [tractate] <i>Shabbat</i>, <i>chapter two.</i> A person’s children will die as a result of not properly observing the commandment of zizit, as the verse says, “<i>moreover, on your garments is found the lifeblood of the innocent</i>” [Jeremiah, 2:34]. That is to say, because of the zizit that one makes on the four corners, that one does not properly observe, it happens that your children will die. That is to say, zizit were given so that one should not pursue illicit sexual relations. When a person is not properly warned by the zizit, he ends up in illicit sexual relations. Therefore, the Holy One punishes him that his children will die. That is to say, <i>measure for measure.</i> He wants to pursue illicit sexual relations to have many children. That is why the Holy One takes away his legitimate children.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Shabbat,</i> 32b.</i>
We find concerning the <i>Sotah</i> that when she was found innocent, that she had not engaged in illicit sexual relations, the water that she had been given by the priest to drink will be for a blessing. If she did not have any children, then the Holy One will give her many children, from the time that she drank from the priest in the Temple. If she previously had a daughter, the Holy One will now also bless her that she will only have sons.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Sotah,</i> 26a.</i> From here we learn that whoever is warned about illicit sexual relations, the Holy One gives him children. However, whoever pursues illicit sexual relations, the Holy One takes away his children. Therefore, also the one who is warned, is without zizit, he can come to illicit sexual relations. Therefore, the Talmud also says that whoever does not properly observe the commandment of zizit, it can happen that his children might die.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Sotah,</i> 26a.</i>
“<i>It shall block the path of travelers</i>” [39:11]. There will be so many people who were killed that there will be a great stench in the land. They will have to block their nostrils and the way will be blocked because people will not want to go there. Therefore, people will assemble to bury them.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Ezekiel, 39:11.</i>
“<i>The house of Israel will bury them in order to cleanse, etc.</i>” [39:12]. Israel will bury them in the hope that it will cleanse the land. They worked for seven months to bury them. Israel had a very <i>good name.</i> All the nations saw that even though the nation of Gog and Magog were the enemies of Israel, yet they did a great act of kindness and buried them with honor.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Ezekiel, 39:12.</i>

“<i>As those who traverse the country and they see a human bone, etc.</i>” [39:15]. The people who will find a bone of one of those of <i>Gog and Magog who were killed</i> will place a sign there that there is a bone there. They should not go there so that the person who passes there does not become ritually impure.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ezekiel, 39:15.</i>
“<i>There shall also be a city named Multitude. And thus the land shall be cleansed</i>” [39:16]. It was so good that they gave a name to the field where Gog and Magog and their nation were killed. It was called “<i>Multitude.</i>” That is to say, the <i>multitude of Gog.</i> The sound of a multitude of people; that is how the city was called. Also, the sound of a multitude of Gog and Magog’s people. That is to say, they would always remember the sign that the Holy One killed many people of Gog and Magog and the land had been completely cleansed.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ezekiel, 39:16.</i>

Shemini Azeret

<b>[I Kings, 8:54–66]</b>
“<i>When Solomon finished offering to the Lord all this prayer</i>” [8:54]. When Solomon had finished praying to God and he was kneeling on his knees and his hands were spread toward heaven. From here we learn that when the king bowed down once in this prayer, he did not straighten up until he had finished the prayer.
“<i>He stood and blessed the whole congregation of Israel</i>” [8:55]. The king stood up and blessed all of Israel. He said: believe that the One who has given rest to Israel his people, and He kept His word which He had promised through Moses our Teacher that Israel will have rest. So too should God also be with us as he was with our ancestors. He should not leave us.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, I Kings, 8:55.</i>
“<i>May He incline our hearts to Him, etc.</i>” [8:58]. The Holy One should incline our hearts to serve Him and to go in His paths and to keep His commandments.
“<i>And may these words of mine, which I have offered in supplication before the Lord, etc.</i>” [8:59]. The words and the prayer that I have prayed to Him should be near to Him. He should feed us and provide all of our needs.
“<i>To the end that all the people of the earth may know, etc.</i>” [8:60]. In the expectation that the entire world will know that You are God alone. You provide each person their needs and protect them from all evil. The hearts of Israel should be toward God, to keep his commandments.
“<i>The king and all Israel with him, offered sacrifices</i>” [8:62]. King Solomon offered sacrifices to God and Israel also offered sacrifices. Solomon slaughtered twenty-two thousand oxen, one hundred-twenty thousand sheep and they made a <i>dedication of the altar.</i>
“<i>On that day, the king consecrated</i>” [8:64]. On that day, the king consecrated the courtyard where the sacrifices were brought. The bronze altar was too small to offer the sacrifices on it.
“<i>Solomon made the festival, etc.</i>” [8:65]. Solomon <i>consecrated the Temple, together with all of Israel</i>, with a great multitude, for seven days and seven days, fourteen consecutive days. That is to say, seven days before <i>Sukkot</i> and the seven days of <i>Sukkot.</i>
Some sages say that they ate the sacrifices on Yom Kippur. Some other sages say: how is it possible to eat on Yom Kippur? However, they offered sacrifices on Yom Kippur, but they did not eat on Yom Kippur.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, I Kings, 8:65.</i>

Our sages do not say that they left on the festival of <i>Shemini Azeret</i>, but they received permission from the king on <i>Shemini Azeret.</i> They left after <i>Shemini Azeret</i> and they left joyfully and with grateful hearts for all the good that the Holy One had done for His servant David and His people Israel. It was for the building of God’s house, as Solomon had desired from God.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, I Kings, 8:66.</i>

Shabbat of Chanukkah

<b>[Zechariah, 2:14–4:7]</b>
“<i>Shout for joy, fair Zion, etc.</i>” [2:14]. When the Messiah will come, the Holy One will say to the city of <i>Zion</i>, sing and rejoice you city of Zion, since I will come and will rest among you. Many nations will attach themselves to the Holy One on that day and they will become one people and I will rest among them.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Zechariah, 2:14.</i>
“<i>The Lord will take Judah as His portion</i>” [2:16]. Each Israelite will inherit his share in the Holy Land and He will choose <i>Jerusalem.</i>
“<i>Be silent, all flesh, before the Lord</i>” [2:17]. All of creation should be silent. God will awaken from His heaven.
<i>Genesis Rabbah</i> writes: <i>Rabbi Phinehas</i> said in the name of <i>Rabbi Reuben. King David</i> said to the Holy One, arise, five times in the <i>book of Psalms.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms, 3:8, 7:7, 9:20, 10:12, 17:13.</i> The Holy One responded: my dear son David, if you would say “<i>Arise O Lord</i>” a thousand times. That is to say, arise God, yet I will not arise. When will I arise? When I will see that the poor are treated unjustly and the <i>paupers</i> will cry out, as the verse says, “<i>because of the groans of the plundered poor and needy, I will now act, says the Lord</i>” [Psalms, 12:6]. This is the meaning of the verse “<i>Be silent, all flesh.</i>” That is to say, when the Holy One awakes and arises, for the sake of the poor, then every person should be afraid of God and should be silent.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Genesis Rabbah,</i> 75.1; <i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Zechariah, <i>Remez</i>, 569.</i>
“<i>He further showed me Joshua the high priest</i>” [3:1]. He showed me <i>Joshua the high priest</i> standing before the <i>angel</i> of God. The <i>angel of death</i> stood at his right hand and he wanted to speak evil about <i>Joshua the high priest.</i> The angel said: God should rebuke you, <i>Satan.</i> Joshua is worthy to be the <i>high priest.</i> He has been separated from the fire.
A similar story is found in the Talmud, [<i>Sanhedrin</i>] <i>in chapter 10.</i> There were two <i>false prophets.</i> One was called <i>Zedekiah</i> and another one was called <i>Ahab. Zedekiah</i> went to the daughter of <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i> and told her <i>false prophecies.</i> He said to her that God had ordered that she should sleep with <i>Ahab the prophet</i> and <i>Ahab</i> said the same thing about <i>Zedekiah</i> that the daughter of <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i> should sleep with Zedekiah. The daughter went to her father and told him the news. Her father said: when they come to you, send them to me. She sent both of them to her father. Nebuchadnezzar, her father, said: why has the Holy One commanded you to do this and not <i>Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah?</i> They respond- ed: <i>Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah</i> are not prophets and we are prophets. Nebuchadnezzar said: I will test you like I have tested <i>Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah.</i> I tested them in the furnace with fire. The false prophets answered that they were three and we are only two. Their merit was greater. The king answered: take another one so that you will also be three and I will throw you into the fire. They chose <i>Joshua the high priest</i> who is mentioned in the <i>haftorah.</i> They said that perhaps we would also be protected from the fire by the merit of the high priest. They were thrown into the fire. The two <i>false prophets</i> were burned and <i>Joshua the high priest</i> only had his clothes singed by the fire. Nebuchadnezzar asked him, I know very well that you are righteous. Why were your clothes singed by the fire, and <i>Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah</i> were not singed by the fire? Joshua answered that they were three and I was alone. He said that Abraham was also alone in the furnace and his clothes were not singed. Joshua responded that the fire was not given permission to burn people in Abraham’s oven. However, here in my case, the fire was given permission to burn Zedekiah and Ahab. That is why the fire came up to my clothes. Further, if there are two pieces of dry wood, then the third log of wood must also be singed, even if it is wet and damp. What sin did Joshua commit? The explanation is that he allowed his children to marry <i>divorcees</i>, which is forbidden.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Sanhedrin,</i> 93a.</i>
“<i>A brand plucked from the fire</i>” [3:2]. That is to say, Joshua was separated from the fire.
“<i>Joshua was clothed in filthy garments</i>” [3:3]. Joshua had filthy clothes. That is to say, transgressions that are like stains on the person. Joshua did not warn his children about not marrying <i>divorcees.</i> The angel shouted at Joshua that he should remove the garments. God will forgive your transgressions and you will don beautiful garments.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Zechariah, 3:3.</i>
“<i>Thus said the Lord of Hosts</i>” [3:7]. Thus has God said to Joshua: if you will follow in My ways, you will rule My house. You will be a lord over My house and Temple.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Zechariah, 3:7.</i>
“<i>I will permit you to move about among these attendants</i>” [3:7].

“<i>Hearken well, O High Priest Joshua</i>” [3:8]. The angel said: you Joshua and your friends are people for whom the Holy One does wonders. They are Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Zechariah, 3:8.</i> I will bring the Messiah, who is called Zemach.
“<i>Here is the stone that I have placed before Joshua, etc.</i>” [3:9]. The angel said to <i>Joshua. Zerubbabel</i> who is building the Temple that will continue to exist. The evildoers will not be able to prevent it from being built. Each stone will have great supervision from the Holy One that it should not be moved, just like seven eyes would be watching and guarding the stones of the <i>Temple.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Zechariah, 3:9.</i>
“<i>I will execute its engraving</i>” [3:9]. The angel said: I will disrupt the ideas of the evildoers who want to prevent the building of the Temple and I will remove the sins of the land in one day. There will be great peace in the country, and they will live in freedom under their fig tree and vines.
“<i>The angel who talked to me came back and woke me</i>” [4:1]. The angel woke me, just like someone wakes up from sleep, and said to me. What do you see? I said, I see a golden candelabrum and over the candelabrum there was a large bowl in which they used to put oil. The candelabrum had seven branches. From the bowl there were seven small pipes through which oil poured into each branch of the candelabrum from the bowl. Afterwards, I saw two olive trees from which olive oil is made, one tree on the right side of the bowl and one tree on the left side of the bowl. That is to say, oil should never be depleted. This is the meaning of the verse “<i>two olive trees near it</i>” [4:3].
“<i>I, in turn asked the angel who talked to me, etc.</i>” [4:4]. I asked the angel, what is this that the olive tree produces oil by itself which flows into the bowl and from this bowl the oil flows into each branch of the candelabrum and no person is involved in it.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Zechariah, 4:4.</i>
“<i>Not by might, nor by power, but through My spirit, says the Lord</i>” [4:6]. The angel responded: I will tell you what this means. Just like you see that the tree making oil run from itself into the bowl and the bowl causes the oil to flow by itself into the candelabrum, into each branch, so too, the Temple will be built by God himself, and not through the hands of the people. The tree and the candelabrum signify this.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Zechariah, 4:6.</i>
“<i>Whoever you are, O great mountain, etc.</i>” [4:7]. He says: when it will be before the evildoers who want to prevent the building of the Temple, it will be like a great mountain that one cannot conquer. The evildoers will think that it is not possible to build the Temple. However, for Zerubbabel the righteous one, the building will be very easy, just like it is easy to build on a fine smooth field.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Zechariah, 4:7.</i>
“<i>He shall produce the excellent stone, etc.</i>” [4:7]. Just like they laid the first stone to build the Temple, so will they build the whole Temple.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Zechariah, 4:7.</i>
“<i>Beautiful, Beautiful</i>” [4:7]. Just like many people shouted and roared, “<i>beautiful</i>, <i>beautiful</i>,” when the first stone was laid, and the Blessed Lord gave it beauty. So too will it be with the building of the whole Temple.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Radak, Zechariah, 4:7.</i>
The Talmud writes in [tractate] <i>Berakhot</i>, concerning the verse “<i>the Lord said to the Accuser</i>” [3:2]. <i>Rabbi Joshua the son of Levi</i> said: The <i>Angel of Death</i> told me that you should not stand in front of the women when they walk past a deceased person. That is to say, when they are leaving the <i>cemetery</i>, since I, the <i>Angel of Death</i>, dance and jump before the women and I have permission to kill and harm anyone I encounter. If someone does encounter him, they should say, “<i>The Lord said to the Accuser, the Lord rebuke you</i>” [3:2].<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Berakhot,</i> 51a.</i>
The Talmud writes all this and the <i>Angel of Death</i> dances before the women, for if the women had not sinned through Eve, people would have lived forever. The <i>Angel of Death</i> would not have been able to kill people and he would not have had his <i>work.</i> That is why he dances before the women when there is a corpse.
The <i>Pardes Rimmonim</i> writes that women used to cry very quickly in the presence of a corpse. The women had red faces from crying. When the men would walk near them and see the women’s red faces, the Evil Inclination would jump on the men and incite them to have thoughts about the women.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">I could not find the source in the <i>Pardes Rimmonim</i>, but the earlier source is <i>Zohar</i>, II: 196ab.</i>
Our sages said that the Angel of Death is also the Evil Inclination.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">B. <i>Baba Bathra,</i> 16a.</i> However, when the Messiah will come, the Angel of Death will be destroyed, as Scripture says, “<i>He will destroy death forever</i>” [Isaiah, 25:8].

Second Shabbat of Chanukkah

<b>[I Kings 7:40–50]</b>
“<i>Hiram made the lavers</i>” [7:40]. Hiram made a hand laver and shovels and four hundred pomegranates and ten hand lavers and the basin placed on twelve oxen. All the utensils were poured in earthen forms dug out of copper. There were so many of them that they could not be weighed. Solomon made a table out of gold on which the <i>showbread</i> was placed. He made five candelabrums on the right side and five on the left side, out of pure gold.
The Midrash writes: Why did <i>Moses Our Teacher</i> only make one table in the Temple? The answer is that the Temple and Tabernacle in the desert where there was manna and there was no need to grow grain, since the <i>manna</i> was given from heaven. However, with Solomon, the Temple was in the land of Israel and they needed great quantities of grain. Therefore, there were many tables. Thus said Solomon: Because of the merit of the five on the right side, the Holy One should send dew and good rain. Through the merit of the five that stand on the left side, on the north side, they should stop the evil that used to come into the world. There were ten golden candelabrums for the <i>Ten Statements.</i> On each candelabrum seven lights burned, for the seventy nations. As long as the lights burned in the Temple, the nations had no power over Israel. However, when the lights were extinguished, the nations had <i>power</i> over Israel. Solomon first put the showbread on the table that Moses had made in the wilderness, since Solomon had Moses’ table. Also, when the lights were lit, the candelabrum of Moses was the first one that was lit. Then all the other candelabrums were lit. The twelve oxen on which the basin stood symbolized the twelve constellations that are in the heavens and rule the whole world.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, I Kings, <i>Remez,</i> 185.</i>
