... The reason is because of "he who speaks untruth shall not stand before my eyes" (Psalms 101:7). As so long as a priest has not availed himself to him, it is not [legally] a blemish; so could he say, "A blemish has appeared on my house?"

Verse 31

<b>And they will not die.</b> There is a difference between ‘being cut off’ and ‘death at the hands of Heaven.’ Death by Heavenly hands means the transgressor alone will die, but ‘being cut off’ means he and his progeny will die. Nevertheless, we find here that the excision of the one who defiles the Mikdash is called death.<br> The explanation for this is that it is also dealing with women, and both a woman and her progeny are not cut off, for the sons will not die because of their mother.<br> Therefore, the main warning here is regarding the death of the transgressor himself.

Verse 1

... It is difficult... Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah should not have said, "There is a parable about two physicians." Rather, he should have said, "It is a greater warning when someone warns a sick person that he should not die like x, than if he just says not to [do x] and die."...

Verse 22

That all who give leket, shich'cha and pe'ah etc. The reason is known, that bringing a sacrifice is giving his money to Hashem, and so too one who gives leket, shich'cha and pe'ah to the poor gives his money to the poor, for that is like a sacrifice to Hashem, that also the gifts to the poor - is considered for Hashem, that behold it is written (Mishlei 19:17) "He who is generous to the poor lends to Hashem," and therefore it is as if he built the Beit HaMikdash and brought a sacrifice in it. And this is not similar to tzedakah, even though the Torah obligates a person to give tzedakah, (Devarim 15:11), at the end he gives it as a way of grace, because he has mercy on the poor. But the gifts that he is obligated the Torah demands of him to give after they are in his hand, there is no doubt that that mitzvah is greater in level. That everything that a person is more commanded - it is a higher level, as the rabbis said (Kiddushin 31a) "Greater is the one who is commanded and does than he who is not commanded and does." And the reason is that the mitzvah fulfils the will of Hashem. 
To what is the matter compared? Two people, one who built the king a house and the second planted him a garden. There is no doubt, that the one who built the house (because he built him something he needs and is obligated to have) is closer to him and is doing his will more than the one who is planting him a garden, that he only needs in order to walk around. And so too this one that is obligated because Hashem obligated him, that mitzvah is more the will of Hashem, that this person is obligated in this mitzvah from Hashem with an obligation, and (He) commanded him to do it. And when he does His command, he raises what (Hashem) wants up from every perspective, more closely than one who is not commanded and does it - because since that is not a mitzvah, it proves that he doesn't desire it as much. For the king, when he really wants something he decrees it to be done, and if he doesn't want it as much, he doesn't decree it. 
And so this, that He commanded to give the poor the gifts because a person is obligated in them, and in any case wants them - behold giving it to the poor is giving it to Hashem, and this is as if he had brought a sacrifice, that it is giving to him. And therefore one who gives teh gifts that are obligated to the poor, it is as if he gives a sacrifice to Hashem. And this is what it says "He who is generous to the poor lends to Hashem"  - because the one that gives him by way of grace, without obligation, is lending to Hashem, and this is not giving to him. But the one who gives to the poor out of obligation and compulsion, is giving it completely to Hashem. The general rule is that after Hashem obligates him to give these gifts to the poor, it is completely the will of Hashem, and therefore it is as if he gave a sacrifice to Hashem.
