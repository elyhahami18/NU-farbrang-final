Genesis

Verse 2



Verse 3

<b><i>God said, "You shall not eat of it or touch it"</i>:</b> Rashi explained: She added to the command; therefore she came to diminish from it, etc. [The snake] pushed her until she touched it. He then said to her, "Just as there is no death in touching, so too there is no death in eating." To here are his [words]. But the matter is difficult — if she added touching, how was she seduced by the snake, who said to her,  "Just as there is no death in touching, etc." — behold, the woman knew that touching was an addition that she added! And the rabbi [author of] Kli Yakar explained that Eve did not hear [the command] from the mouth of the Omnipotent. Rather, Adam the first man commanded her, and [he] added touching as a fence. But he did not tell her that touching was a fence. So Eve thought that touching was also [God's] command, may He be blessed. And it was because of this that [the snake] went to Eve and not to Adam the first man, since Adam the first man knew that touching was a fence. See there at length. And likewise did the rabbi [author of] Torat Chaim write in his approach to Sanhedrin 29, see there. But it escaped the rabbi [author of] Kli Yakar that there is a teaching like them in Avot DeRabbi Natan, Chapter 1, that Adam the first man made a fence for the thing, and he added touching for Eve. And later in that same chapter, it said that a mishap came out of it. From this, they said, "A person should not add upon the things that he hears." See there. And the thing is clear, that the intention is that one needs to make a fence, as it is taught in the first part. However, one must say the command of God according to its law [with exactitude], saying afterward that he is making a fence, not like Adam the first man did, since he added without distinguishing. So Eve thought that God also commanded about the touching, and a mishap came out from it. But the rabbis mentioned did not remember this from Avot DeRabbi Natan. And it is also a difficulty about Rashi. Since from the simple understanding of his words, it is implicit that Eve is the one who added [it] on her own. And besides that the matter itself does not sit well, it is difficult because of [what was cited above] from Avot DeRabbi Natan. And that which is written in Sanhedrin 29, "Anyone who adds, detracts, etc." — the intention is from what Adam the first man added to Eve without distinguishing and he did not explain that it was a fence. And that is like the rabbi [author of] Torat Chaim wrote. And be exacting and you will find it simple, as I have been short.

<b>For Reuven, Eliżur the son of Shede'ur.</b> Just as a rock can bear all that is in the house, so too did God bear the sins of Reuven and forgave him when he repented. From whom did he learn this? From Judah, when he said, 'Bring her out and let her be burned,' which is 'Shaddai-Or'—throwing [her] into the fire. Then he confessed, and so did Reuven. <b>For Shimon, Shelumiel the son of Tsurishaddai</b>—even though he sinned at Shittim, God made peace for him by placing him next to Reuven in the camps. <b>For Judah, Nachshon</b>—named for descending into the sea's waves, and the nun is interchangeable with lamed as in 'lashon' and 'neshikot.' The son of Amminadav—he became generous (nediv) for God's people, and from this Judah merited kingship. <b>For Issachar, Nethaneel</b>—named because the Torah was given in their hearts; the son of Zuar—because they accepted the burden and pain (tzar) of all Israel, answering their questions. <b>For Zebulun, Eliab</b>—named for the blessing 'Zebulun shall dwell at the shore of the sea.' 'Eli' refers to the great trees (Elonim) of Bashan used for their oars, and 'ab' refers to the ship, as it is written, 'They pass like ships of reed.' The son of Helon—named for the blessing of Moses, 'and the treasures hidden in the sand.' <b>For Ephraim, because of Joseph</b>—'Eli heard but did not listen to his mistress.' It is possible to say, as our Sages explained, that without God's help, etc., so too with Joseph; God helped him because he initiated the effort to abstain, and God completed and strengthened him. Nevertheless, He gave him his full reward, and this is hinted at by 'Eli heard but did not listen to his mistress.' This is why 'Ammi' (my people) was added to give him the splendor of royalty, and he merited to be a king. <b>For Manasseh, Gamliel</b>—because God rewarded him with all good, even though he was not truly redeemed by the Rock. God still redeemed him due to his own initiative and thoughts, and God rewarded him as if he alone had conquered his evil inclination. And see what I wrote earlier in Parashat Beha'alotcha, with God's help.... <b>Ammi'hud: Ammi-hod (my people is glorious)</b> because the Ark of the living eternal one carries with it the Ark of Joseph. For Manasseh, Gamliel: God rewarded him with good, made him king, and redeemed him from the punishment of Gehenna. <b>For Benjamin, Abidan</b>: When his mother gave birth to him, she thought he would die, and his father called him Benjamin because he was born to live through all his days and not die. Therefore, he was called Abidan because his father judged (dan) between his mother's words and his own. The son of Gid'oni: He is destined to cut off the foundation of Amalek, and they are Saul and Mordechai. <b>For Dan, Ahiezer</b>: He became a brother to Judah to assist him in the work of the Tabernacle, and 'assistance' refers to Judah, as it is said, 'And assistance shall come from his enemies,' and also concerning David who came from Judah, as it is said, 'I have provided help upon a mighty one.' The son of Ammishaddai: He judged his people like Judah, who said, 'Throw her into the furnace.' <b>For Asher, Pagiel the son of Ochran</b>: The daughters of Asher were beautiful and good-looking and married kings. Anyone who was condemned and guilty to the king, his daughter would plead with the king and he would forgive. Pagiel is a term of prayer. <b>For Gad, Eliasaph the son of Deuel</b>: God increased their wealth because they kept their vow to go before their brothers to war. The son of Deuel: They knew God's commandments. <b>For Naphtali, Ahira</b>: 'Ahira' means 'land of lush pasture,' as in 'and they will graze in lush pasture.' 'Ahira' also means 'desire,' as in 'ratzon,' because the land of Naphtali produced fruits according to the will of its owner. The son of Enan: Clouds watered his land, and there were many springs in his land, as it is said, 'and the blessing of the Lord is full.' Rabbi Eleazar of Worms wrote in his manuscript commentary. Later, I saw some of what is said in the book 'Imrei Noam' and in the words of our Sages. I saw that the holy Rabbi Shlomo Estrok wrote in his manuscript commentary that I heard that in each middle tribe of the four banners, the name ends with 'El.' In the banner of Judah, the middle one is Nethaneel; in the banner of Reuben, the middle one is Shelumiel; in the banner of Ephraim, the middle one is Gamliel; in the banner of Dan, the middle one is Pagiel, to fulfill what is said, 'I am the Lord who dwells among them.' This is also reflected in the offerings of the princes during their dedication: Nethaneel on the second day, Shelumiel on the fifth day, Gamliel on the eighth day, and Pagiel on the eleventh day. When you combine the letters 'He,' 'Het,' 'Yud,' 'Alef,' it totals twenty-six, which is the numerical value of God's holy name
