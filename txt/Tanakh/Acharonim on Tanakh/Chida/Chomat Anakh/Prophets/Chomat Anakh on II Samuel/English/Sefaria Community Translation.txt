Verse 51

"[God] magnifies the salvations of [God's] king." It is possible that the matter [i.e., the story] of Bat Sheva had been going on and [began to] produce a good addition, one that gradually grew. In the beginning, he had married her [as indicated in II Samuel 11:27, though the story had been going on for some time], and she was [conjugally] permitted to him, according to the Sanhedrin [the {albeit anachronistic} rabbinic court]. And afterwards, Shelomoh [i.e., Solomon] was born [as indicated in II Samuel 12:24], and he sent forth [the prophet Natan],  and he [perhaps Natan or perhaps David] called him, [after] God, Yedideyah ("A friend of Yah"). And afterwards, Shelomoh ruled. And afterwards, God appeared to him [i.e., Shelomoh] and granted him wisdom and knowledge and wealth and kavod ('substance' or 'glory'). And, afterwards, he [that is, Shelomoh] built the Temple and merited that, in his [life's] days, the moon was full. But, just as there were the haters of David who said, "There is no salvation for him" (Psalm 3:3)--except that he [in his lineage contained someone who] was "righteous and saved" (Zechariah 9:9). Continually, this salvation would gradually slowly, slowly increase upwards [and] upwards, and that is [the meaning of] "[God] magnifies the salvation of God's king," for the salvation would increase and supplement many [further] salvations and become a migdol ("A great tower"). So the ketiv [the written Masoretic Text] states magdil ("[God] magnifies"), for [the salvation] was slowly, slowly, gradually [increasing], but we read [in the keri, the recited Masoretic Text], migdol ("[God is] a great tower of") "the salvations of God's king and performs lovingkindness for that one's anointed one [i.e., 'messiah']," for from there the messiah will come, and the salvation will increase "for David and his seed forever and for eternity."
