Chomat Anakh on Joshua



Chapter 1



Chapter 2



Verse 1




<b>Rahab:</b> In the Responsa of the Geonim manuscript, Paragraph 23: They asked before the Master, Rabbi Yehudai Gaon, may his memory be blessed, "[Since] Rahab was from the seven [Canaanite] nations, how did Joshua marry her?" And he said, "[The prohibition] is after the Jewish people entered the land of Israel. Rahab converted when Joshua's spies came in, and the Jewish people had not yet entered the land. To here are its [words]. And Tosafot in Sotah 35b wrote similarly. However, Tosafot in the first chapter of Megillah wrote that Rahab was not from the seven nations, see there. But this is a wonder, since [the sages] said in Sifrei, Parashat Behaalotecha, that she was from the seven nations, like the Gaon said, may his memory be blessed.
