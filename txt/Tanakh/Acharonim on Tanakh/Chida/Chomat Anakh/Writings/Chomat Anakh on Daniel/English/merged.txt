Chomat Anakh on Daniel



Chapter 1



Verse 1



Verse 2



Verse 3



Verse 4

Children who have no blemish, are good-looking, and are intelligent in all wisdom. It is possible to say, as mentioned in Masechet Ta'anit, that wisdom is esteemed in vessels that are unattractive, and this is the greatness of Jerusalem because its sons were beautiful and wise, which was not found in other countries. This is explained by Rabbi Peri Chadash z"l in Masechet Kiddushin, that ten kavim of wisdom descended to the world, nine were taken by other places, and Jerusalem took one. Similarly, ten kavim of beauty descended to the world, nine were taken by other places, and Jerusalem took one, as we say in Masechet Ta'anit: If they were hated, they were learned, even more than this. Rabbi Yehoshua says: Jerusalem had two hidden treasures, nine kavim of beauty and nine kavim of wisdom. The Gemara asks: What is the reason? If they were hated, they would have been learned even more. And this is why Nebuchadnezzar asked to bring those who were good-looking and intelligent in all wisdom, as it was difficult to match them together, and it is inevitable that those who hate beauty would also hate wisdom. So according to their nature, they hate beauty and wisdom, and furthermore, they hate beauty. And behold, they are in a threesome.
"And those who have strength to stand in the king's palace, to overcome nature such as laughter, sleep, and the like, and after it becomes clear that they have strength, they should be taught the language and literature of the Chaldeans. Because if they are taught initially and later it is known that they do not have the strength to stand, the king's desire will not be fulfilled in them. What benefit is there in teaching them? Therefore, it says, 'And those who have strength in them,' and so on, to teach them."

Verse 8

And Daniel set upon his heart that he would not defile himself, etc." "A good intention, the Holy One, blessed be He, attaches to the action, and it ascends to be favorable before the Lord.

Verse 9


"And God granted Daniel kindness and compassion before the chief of the eunuchs. It is possible that even the attribute of judgment turned into mercy, and thus it was kindness and compassion before the chief of the eunuchs. After I mentioned in my writings, I saw in the book 'Korban Mincha,' section 188, where it is written that God is judgment, and when it says 'God,' there are also mercy. And behold, he wrote that even though his request was not fulfilled, they granted him kindness by not rebuking him, not revealing his secret to the king, and also because he felt for the steward and hid his eye. Commentators explain."

Verse 12



Verse 13

And let our appearance and the appearance of the children be pleasing before you. He did not say that they should only have a pleasing appearance, nor did he say that they should be healthier in flesh than those who eat the king's food. For regarding appearance, it depends on the joy of the heart, as stated in Nedarim, page 49b, concerning Rabbi Yehuda, who had radiant countenance even though he was under duress at the time, and also they, in their joy, not to defile themselves, their appearance would be good. However, regarding being healthier in flesh, naturally, vegetarian food does not cause bloating or fattening, and he did not want to rely on miracles. But God, in His mercy, made their appearance better and their flesh healthier than all the children of their age. So wrote from there our Rabbi, Rabbi Moshe Alshich.

Verse 17

And Daniel understood in every vision, etc." Meaning, besides being complete in all wisdom like his peers, he additionally understood every vision and dream:

Chapter 2



Verse 1



Verse 2

To tell the king his dreams." Some interpret this language as mere expression, while others understand that what he wants is the interpretation of the dream. And it does not explain that he forgot the dream because then they could flee or hide themselves:

Verse 5



Verse 6



Verse 7

The wise men answered and said to the king." It is possible that they feared that he might remember the dream but wanted to know if their interpretation is true. Therefore, he said that they should tell him the dream. And when he sees that they tell him the dream, from this he knows that they are wise and the interpretation is true. And therefore, they reiterated that he should tell them the dream, hinting to him that if he relies solely on the interpretation, there is a better correction to say the interpretation, and they would swear to him that they interpreted well according to the rules and secrets of interpretation that they received from their knowledgeable predecessors.

And the meal offerings and pleasantness," he said to the libation for it. But Daniel did not accept and said, "I did not make a deal," as our Sages said. Nevertheless, the sages of Babylon were fulfilled thus. Even though he was angry that they advised him to destroy the Temple, the king's wrath was such, and he remembered that this was the will of the Lord. And why was he troubled by the dream? The Lord already desired it and revealed the secret to Daniel.

Chapter 3



Verse 1


"The image of gold" etc. Our Sages said that because Daniel interpreted the dream, which spoke of the Messiah, and Israel would inherit the kingdom forever, for this reason the image was made to cause Israel to stumble into idolatry, and the kingdom would be annulled from Israel, God forbid.

You have lifted my eyes to Heaven, and from my knowledge it will return upon me." It is said in the Zohar Chadash that to gaze at the heavens brings great benefit, and likewise our Rabbi, the Ari, of blessed memory, warned to always gaze at the heavens.
