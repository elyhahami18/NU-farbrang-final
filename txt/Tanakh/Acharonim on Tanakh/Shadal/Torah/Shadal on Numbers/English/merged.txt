Shadal on Numbers



Chapter 1



Verse 1

<b>In the wilderness of Sinai:</b> Every time it says "at Mount Sinai," it refers to the period before the Tabernacle was erected. But once the Tent of Meeting was built, it only says "in the wilderness of Sinai" (Rashbam), because from then on, the Lord did not speak to Moses on the mountain, but in the Tabernacle, wherever in the wilderness they camped and set up the Tabernacle.

Verse 20

"I have forgiven as you have spoken": The forgiveness was complete, because each person lived out their days, but despite that they would not see (yir'u) the land, because that is a gift, and they were not deserving (re'uim) of it.

"And take to you" - [This means "bring".] Like (Genesis 48:9), "Take them to me", (Numbers 23:27) "I will take you to another place", (I Samuel 20:31) "Send and take him to me."
"Perfect, without blemish in it" - The language is repetitious, like (Leviticus 22:21) "It must be perfect to be acceptable, it should have no blemish in it."

"And it shall be impure seven days" - The opinion of Abraham Ibn Ezra that this is past tense, is void. For if seven days had already passed, it could no longer say that he will sin on the third day.

And the correct [understanding] is like the words of Sforno. And it is [also] possible to say like the author of Mincha Belulah, "[that it is] in order that the high priest will be beloved to the people, and that the joy of his establishment will be increased, since the exiles were return to their land"...
