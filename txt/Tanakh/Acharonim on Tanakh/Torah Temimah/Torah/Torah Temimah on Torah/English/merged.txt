<b>I am unworthy, etc.</b> - (Shabbat 32a): [Rabbi Yannai] said, "A person should never stand in a place of danger saying that they [on High] will perform a miracle for him, lest they do not perform a miracle for him. And [even] if they do perform a miracle for him, they will deduct it from his merits." Rabbi Ḥanin said, "What is the verse [that alludes to this]? When Jacob said, '<i>Katonti</i> (I am not worthy) of all the mercies, and of all the truth, which You have shown unto Your servant'" (Genesis 32:11). <sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"> He explains "<i>katonti</i>," as my merits have become small. But ostensibly, this requires [further] study - as note that Ya'akov [only] used this expression out of modesty. So there is no hint here to the diminution of merits. And see Ramban and Maharsha, who have [already] pointed this out. But it appears to me that [its understanding] is according to that which is written in Bava Kamma 50b, "Anyone who says that the Holy One, blessed be He, is a Relinquisher will have his life relinquished." And if so, once Ya'akov said that he was not worthy of all the goodnesses; if so, they could not be done for him for free, but rather his merits [must have been] diminished.</i>

Paragraph 6

From where do we derive that we drink four cups of wine at the Pesach [seder]? Rabbi Yohanan said: It  corresponds to the four redemptions: 'I will  take you out;'  'I will save you;' 'I will redeem you;' 'I will take you to me.' Three of these are found in this  verse, and one in the verse immediately following. In all of the decisors and commentators and books of legends that bring this saying, it is brought using the language, "It corresponds to the four languages of redemption." But if we look in the Palestinian Talmud from which the phrase is quoted, the word "languages" is missing. Rather it says, "four redemptions." In my view, this is a very significant distinction. For if we understand it according to its plain meaning, the notion of four languages of redemption is not a reason to establish four cups of thanksgiving, since there is but one redemption, whether we speak of it using one word or four.  But if there are four redemptions, then that explains the matter much better, for when we examine it well we find that there are four different ideas expressed in these four terms, and each one  is its own complete idea unto itself and deserving of its own thanksgiving. In the first statement ("I will take you out"), we see that the Holy Blessed One took them out from under the labors of the Egyptians, which is to say that God lightened their labors--but they were not freed completely. Then God added to this, "And I will save you from their servitude," which means that they did not serve them at all. But even after these two promises, they were still servants to Pharaoh and had not achieved full redemption.  Thus God added, "And I will redeem you," but even so they were not yet made a special acquisition of the Holy Blessed One, and so God added, "And I will take you to me to be a people, and I will be God to  you." We see that within these sayings are included  separate notions of redemption. The verses continue in a "not only this, but also this" fashion--that is to say, not only will I do this, but I will also do this, and not only that, but also this, etc. As such, the simple meaning is revealed: We are obligated to give thanks for each individual act that increased the redemption. And that is why [the Sages] established the four cups of thanksgiving. And why did they not establish a cup for the phrase "and I will bring you to the land?" We cannot say that it is because that language is unrelated to the redemption, since they  established a cup for "and I will take you to me to be a people," which is likewise not specifically an aspect of redemption. Rather, the simple answer is that since we are still in exile, and the land is in the hands of foreigners, it is impossible to raise a glass of wine for this. And perhaps, in recognition of this, they established a special cup in the name of Elijah, as a remembrance and hint that we hope for his coming and for the resurrection of the nation and the land speedily in our days.

Paragraph 2

“Speak, please, (Na):
They said in R. Yannai’s school: “Na” is nothing other than a term of request. The Holy, Blessed One said to Moshe: “Please, go and say to Israel: ‘Please, request from Egypt items of silver and items of gold, so that that Righteous One does not say that God fulfilled the verse, “and shall serve them, and they shall abuse them” (Gen. 15:13) upon them, but did not fulfill the verse, “afterward shall they come out with significant property” (Gen. 15:14) for them. 
What he said, "so that the Righteous One does not say..." hints at Avraham, whom the Holy, Blessed One promised about the exodus that there would be much property, and that Israel had to be asked for this, and that it wasn't aroused in them independently, one should say that this was hinted at in the gemara, that Israel said, “We’d prefer to just go by ourselves.” A parable: to a person who was incarcerated in prison and people would tell them, “Tomorrow, we will bring you out from prison and give you a lot of money”, and [the incarcerated person] says to them: “Please, bring me out today, and I ask for nothing.” One should say that the upshot is that that was Israel’s state: due to the difficulty of slavery, they were lowly of spirit, such that they lost any feeling of desire for silver and gold, and their appetite was just to leave and go free; therefore, they did not find the proper spirit to deal with requests of their neighbors.
And know that we have in Berakhot 32a: 
"From the School of Yannai, they said: At the time that Israel made the calf, Moshe argued on their behalf before the Holy, Blessed One, saying: Master of the Universe, it was the silver and gold that you loaded on Israel that caused them to make the Calf."...

Avot d'Rebbe Natan:
Rabbi Tarfon says: Great is creative labor melakhah), for the Holy Blessed One Did not cause the Shechinah to dwell within Israel until they did melakhah, as it says, "make for me a sanctuary and I shall dwell in their midst."
Torah Temimah adds:
And it could be that this midrash is based on a close read of the verse. It should have said "I will dwell inside it" and not "inside them." Therefore, the midrash says that in truth there is no relevance for a building to house the Holy Blessed One, as it says in Isaiah "the Heavens are my throne and the Earth is my  footstool, what home could you build for me?" Rather, the matter is that the Holy Blessed One wanted Israel to be involved in the creative labor for God's sake and commanded them to build the sanctuary and on account of God's favor in their work, the Shechinah would dwell among them in all places where they were. And this explains the greatness of creative labor such that in exchange for it, the Holy  Blessed One graced Israel with the dwelling of God's blessed Shechinah.

Paragraph 1


<b>And this is the thing:</b> Rabbi Anani bar Sasson said, "Why was the section about the sacrifices juxtaposed to the section about the garments of the priesthood? To tell you, just like the sacrifices atone, so too do the garments of the priesthood atone."<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi explained, Why in Parshat Tzav was, "This is the law of the burnt-offering, etc.," juxtaposed to what it goes to, "Take Aharon [etc.] and the garments." To here are his [words]. But in Arakhin 15a, it explains that the intention is about this section, which is the section of the inauguration, and it is juxtaposed to the section of the garments earlier. And it seems like the main approach is like the explanation in Arakhin. For the main section about the priestly garments is here. And I have also carefully noted in several place that when the Sages, may their memory be blessed, said, "Why was this section juxtaposed to that section," they always first took the passage that is written later in the Torah. For example, in Berakhot 10a, "Why was the section about Avshalom juxtaposed to the section about Gog and Magog (Psalms 2,3)?" And behold that the section of Avshalom is written after the section of Gog and Magog... And likewise in Moed Katan 28a, "Why was the the death of Miriam juxtaposed to the section about the heiffer?"... In all of them, they are arranged that the later is placed first. And here too, if it was like Rashi wrote here, that it is intending Parsaht Tzav, in which it is written, "This is the law of the burnt-offering," and then, "Take Aharon [etc.] and the garments," it should have said, "Why is the section about the garments of the priesthood juxtaposed to the section of the sacrifices." Examine this and you will find it simple.<br>And the simple understanding of the matter indicates that the garments of the priesthood themselves atone. But according to that, there is a need to investigate Rashi in Yoma 72b at the top, in his explanation of, "Were it not for the garments of the priesthood, nothing would have remained of [the Jewish people], etc." He wrote: Were it not for the garments of the priesthood, with which they would offer sacrifices that atone for the Jewish people. To here are his [words]. But why did he not explain more simply that the garments of the priesthood themselves atone, like the simple reading here? And it must be said that he holds that the garments only atone then when they are doing the holy service with them, the enactment of the sacrifices; and not with their being worn itself.</i> The tunic atoned for the spilling of blood, as it is stated (Parsaht Vayeshev, Genesis 37:31), "and they slaughtered a goat, and immersed the coat in the blood."<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">This is a hint to the future when the atonement for the spilling of blood would be with the tunic of the garments of the priesthood. And immersion means atonement. And it is explained in the Gemara that this atonement is only with a murderer that is impossible to judge, such as if they did not warn him. But a murderer who is liable for death is not atoned towards the congregation so long as they have not judged him, as it is written (at the end of Parshat Maasei, "and for the land there can be no atonement for the blood that was spilled in it, except through the blood of the one who spilled it." And see what I have written at the beginning of Parshat Haazinu on the verse, "Let my instruction flow like rainfall" (Deuteronomy 32:2). But in the Yerushalmi, Yoma7:3, it is found that the tunic atones for those who have worn forbidden mixtures. And so is it in the Midrash Rabbah, Parshat Tzav; and Shir HaShirim [Rabbah] 4:7. However the reason of this thing, [that] the tunic atones for those who have worn forbidden mixtures, is not explained. And in the glosses of the Radal (R. David Luria) on the Midrash Rabbah, Parshat Tzav, he writes there it is because the tunic consisted of forbidden mixtures. And it is a great wonder about such an unusual genius as he, that he erred about something well known and simple: For in all of the garments of the priesthood, only the belt, the breastplate and the apron were [from forbidden mixtures;] (unless we say it was a copier's mistake in his words, and it should say, because the tunic did not consist of forbidden mixtures. Meaning that since there were no forbidden mixtures in it, that is why it atones for the iniquity of forbidden mixtures. However according to this, it is not clear why specifically the tunic, and not the other garments of the priesthood that did not have forbidden mixtures? And that requires investigation.) And I wonder about that which the Maharil wrote (Laws of Yom Kippur 3:2), that the custom in Mainz on Yom Kippur is not to recite the penitential prayer, "But we are guilty," because it has fixed in it that the tunic of the high priest would atone for the iniquity of forbidden mixtures. And the Ravah (R. Wolf Heidenheim) explained his words: It is because this is against the opinion of the Sages, may their memory be blessed, in Zevachim 88b, that the tunic atones for the spilling of blood; and not as it is written in the formula of [this] prayer, that it atones for the iniquity of forbidden mixtures. To here are his [words]. And this is a wonderous thing! For behold this opinion is explicitly expressed in the Yerushalmi and in two places in the Midrash Rabbah! And that which the writer of the penitential prayer chose this opinion against that which is expressed in the Babylonian Talmud (and in general, we hold that the Babylonian Talmud is the main one) - that is nothing new with the liturgical poets. And the Tosafot in Chagigah 13a already wrote that the liturgical poets are accustomed in several places to put aside the the position of the Babylonian Talmud and to grasp on to the Yerushalmi. And see Tosafot on Chullin 109b, and these are their [words]: And [the liturgical poet] did everything according to the Yerushalmi. To here are their [words]. And the same is true here. However there is certainly no reason and logic at all to prevent the saying of the penitential prayer on account of this.</i> And the pants atone for sexual prohibitions, as it is stated (Exodus 28:42), "Make for them linen pants to cover the nakedness of their flesh." The turban atones for those who are haughty, let something high come and atone for haughtiness. The belt atones for the thoughts of the heart, where it is.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">As they would tie it across from the underarms, meaning across from the heart. And see Tosafot on Arakhin 15b.</i> The breastplate atones for [incorrect] judgments, as it is stated (Exodus 28:15), "And you shall make a breastplate of judgment." The apron atones for idol worship, as it is stated (Hosea 3:4), "and without breastplate or oracle idols."<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi explained: When there is no apron, there is the iniquity of oracle idols. To here are his [words]. And I did not know where he found a hint to expound like this. And is not the simple understanding that there is no apron and also no oracle idols? And maybe he found a hint in the rest of the wording of that verse, "without a king, without officials, without sacrifice, without cult pillars and without an apron and oracle idols." And behold in every detail, it attached the word, without (<i>ein</i>), even though it could have written, "without king, or officials, without sacrifice or cult pillars." But since it wrote, "without," for each detail; and it only left out writing, "without," with the oracle gods; that is why he expounded, "without an apron (meaning, when there is no apron), there are oracle idols.</i>The robe atones for evil speech. Let something with noise (<i>kol</i>) come and atone for an evil noise.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">"Let something with noise come," means the bells in the robe, which give off a noise. And that which it describes evil speech with the word, noise, even though it is possible to also be muted - is because we learn the main matter of evil speech from the verse in Proverbs (27:14), "He who greets his fellow loudly," as it is explained in the discussion in Arakhin 16a. Indeed, it is the incense that actually atones for muted evil speech, as will be explained ahead in Parashat Korach, on the verse (Number 17:12), "and he put on incense and atoned for the people." And they said [about this], "Let something that is muted come (since the incense is done in a muted way, as it is written about this, 'No man shall be present in the Tent of Meeting'), and atone for something muted." See there ahead.</i> And the frontplate of the High Priest atones for brazenness. With the frontplate, it is written (Exodus 28:38), "And it shall be upon Aaron’s forehead"; and with brazenness it is written (Jeremiah 3:3), "and you had a harlot’s forehead."<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">And the end of the verse is, "you refused to be ashamed." And it is the way of the brazen not to be ashamed. And see the Yerushalmi, Yoma 7:3; and in the Midrash Rabbah on Shir HaShirim 4 - there are different variants about this homily. </i> (Zevachim 88b)

"You will see my back." Said Rav Chana bar Bizna, what [is the point] of writing, "you will see my back?" It teaches that the Holy Blessed One showed Moses the knot of His tefillin. (Paraphrasing BT Berakhot 7a:33)
Comment of the Torah Temimah:
It is possible to explain the matter in approximate accord with the simple meaning, for the entire matter is difficult at first glance: how is it relevant (appropriate?) to depict the Holy Blessed One with corporeal images, the likeness of face and back, as the Rambam wrote in Hilkhot Teshuvah that one mustn't, God forbid, think in such manner; so therefore, one must say that the intended [meaning] is that the Holy Blessed One appeared to [Moses] in a [mere] fraction of the [true] appearance of His sanctity. However, since in a spiritual matter it is impossible to imagine dividing into a whole or a part, it is consequently impossible that Moses knew whether he saw [God] in whole or in part, but the Holy Blessed One wanted to show him quickly such that he did not see the appearance of sanctity in its fullness. Therefore the Gemara gives a description and explanation of what [God] showed [Moses] as approximately comparable to the knot of [God's] tefillin, and the explanation is that as one who see the tefillin knot, even one who sees the knot alone, nevertheless necessarily knows that the knot also has a grip on the face side [of the head]; by such a method, the Holy Blessed One showed him the appearance of His blessed sanctity for him to see and be convinced that the vision that he saw was continually disembodied (or, possibly, expanding) also on the face side. Consequently, the meaning of the expression "He showed him the tefillin knot" is [something] analogous to a tefillin knot - study my words closely and you will find it simple. Indeed, the essence of the matter is that the [form of the] tefillin knot is a "halakhah l'Moshe miSinai" (lit. a law from Moses at Sinai, a Talmudic expression meaning that the rabbis assert this is authentic law, without a textual source) as explained in BT Menachot 35b:7 but our sages of blessed memory (nevertheless) supported it with a verse; see further on, end of Parashat Ki Tisa. 
(N.B. Possibly, the verse referred to in the last remark is Ex. 34:27, which the sages use to support the idea that some law is to be written, while some is to be oral, including halakhot l'Moshe miSinai. Epstein seems to be suggesting simultaneously that the tefillin knot is a metaphor, and that Moses literally learned to tie the head-knot of tefillin by examining the knot in this experience.)

Leviticus

Paragraph 1



Paragraph 2

But the offerings themselves, the women do indeed bring them. The explanation is not that women may not, but rather that they are not obligated, as is explained in Chagiga 15b that women would indeed lay their hands on [Rambam 3:8 Laws of Offerings does not make this point explicit]. But as emissaries of their husbands they indeed would be prohibited, as will be explained in verse 4, on the phrase "he lays his hand", and see Tosafot on Mas. Rosh Hashana 33a. Similarly, the gemara exempts women from all of the various actions of the offering - the waving, approaching, kamitza, incense offering, slitting, blood-receing, and springkling - since for all of these the verse states "the sons of Israel/Aaron" and the sages extrapolate this to mean, "and not the daughters of Israel/Aaron." Tosafot question this, and ask why the sages needed to exclude women from all of these [based on these verses]; they should already be excluded based on the broad principle of "positive time-bound commandments", as these actions only take place during the day, as we learn in the verse at the end of Parshat Tzav. But I do not understand this; what did Tosafot see to ask such a question?! The essential act of bringing an offering itself only happens during the day, and yet once we have seen that the Torah empowers women to bring offerings like men, then clearly the Torah has obligated them in the mitzvah of offerings even though it is a time-bound mitzvah! And therefore, one in fact would've assumed that they are similarly obligated in all of the constituitive elements of the offering, and there would not have been a logical reason to exempt them from the details when they are obligated in the general action....     And as for the general principle that women are obligated in offerings like men: the source is in Torat Cohanim, Parshat Emor (22:18) -  איש איש מבית ישראל ומן הגר בישראל אשר יקריב קרבנו לכל נדריהם וגו', בישראל לרבות נשים ועבדים - And similarly explains the Rambam in Hil. Korbanot, 3:2. "Men, women, and slaves all bring offerings." The Kessef Mishna writes by way of finding a source for the Rambam, "It is obvious that the Torah equates men and women for every rule of the Torah, and we've already said that women do not lay their hands, nor perform the wave-offerings, etc - only men do these things - this implies that women do, however, bring offerings, and every mitzvah that a women is obligated in, so too are slaves." Behold, according to the source in Torah Cohanim that we cited - it is shocking to see the lenghty description [of the Kessef Mishna], who is trying to find a source for the words of the Rambam based on talmudic inferences. But the source is plain, obvious, and well understood! He should have simply noted the citation in the Torat Cohanim, and nothing further.

Sifrei Agaddah and Musar have long been perplexed as to how a Talmid Chacham can be associated with as ugly a characteristic as this... It seems to me that this characteristic is rightly described as being that of a snake, whose poison is weakened by its strike. That is also the intended message in our context.  Even though it is appropriate for a Talmid Chacham to begrudge and take vengeance on those who molest him, for the sake of the honor and standing of the Torah, such acts need to be in the style of the snake, whose effect weakens over time.

<b>The sons of Aharon.</b> And not the daughters of Aharon. Rambam wrote in Hilchos Aveil that this is the reason why women are not obligated to become impure for the dead. [Only] the males are commanded to become impure for them. Since they are not included in the prohibition of “let him not defile himself with the dead,” therefore they are not subject to the commandment of becoming impure …

We rely on a prophet for clarifying the reality, just not for the ruling in halachah.

Paragraph 6

It was taught: Rabbi Shimon ben Gamliel said, "On the fifteenth of Av, the tribes were permitted to intermarry with each other without concern for the inheritance. This is explained in the portion (Parashat) [of the Torah]." What is the interpretation of the verse "This is the thing"? It means that this practice was applicable only in that specific generation, as the reason for this interpretation is that we find the phrase "this is the thing" primarily used in relation to the specific time, as seen in Parashat Beshalach (Exodus 16:16) and in Parashat Tetzaveh (Exodus 30:23), regarding matters that were only relevant for their respective times. However, it is not explicitly stated where they derived the authority and foundation to suspend a commandment from the Torah. Indeed, it is difficult to establish a foundation to suspend an explicit commandment based solely on the precision of the phrase "this is the thing" without further clarification in the Torah.It is possible to say that they had received a tradition that the main instruction regarding the inheritance issue was applicable only during the division of the land, in order for each tribe's portion to be known and clarified. But afterwards, in generations where the portions were already determined and assigned, there was no longer a need to be concerned about intermarriage and inheritance issues. In that case, the commandment was not nullified until a known time when they realized that it was impossible to fulfill it without intertribal marriages, and they then permitted it. They found a hint to this in the Torah through the phrase "this is the thing," as explained. This is my opinion, and one should further consult the depths of the Ramban's commentary. (Ta'anit 30b)
It was taught: There is a difference between fathers and sons. In the case of fathers, it is stated (in Parashat Chelek): "Every daughter who inherits." But in the case of sons, it is not so. This means that the prohibition of intertribal inheritance applies only to that specific generation and is not a commandment for future generations, as explained previously. What does it imply? Rava said, "This is the thing" - this matter applies only to this generation. This has already been clarified in the previous interpretation. May it be well understood. (Bava Batra 120a)
<b>For their own benefit...</b> Rav Yehuda said in the name of Shmuel: The daughters of Tzelafchad were permitted to marry men from any tribe, as it is stated: "For their own benefit they may marry." However, how do I fulfill the phrase "only within the family of their father's tribe shall they marry"? It is a good advice that the verse provides, stating that they should marry only within their tribe, but not limiting them to their own family. This principle is not explicitly clarified in the text. Why did Shmuel find it necessary to extract the intention of the verses from their literal meaning? Because the commandment is indeed that they may marry only within the family of their father's tribe. Perhaps the reason it was difficult to state explicitly is that if it were explicitly commanded, it would not have been necessary to say "for their own benefit they may marry," as it is possible that other tribes would be preferable in their eyes. And if the commandment had been stated as "only within the family of their father's tribe," it would have been understood that it is for their own benefit within that tribe, as after the inheritance was given to them, there would be no limitation on whom they could marry.(Bava Batra 121a)
–
It can also be said with a necessary reason that this interpretation, that they were permitted to marry men from all the tribes, is based on the opinion of Rabbi, as stated in Bava Batra 109b. In every portion regarding inheritance, it is stated that it shall be given to them, as it is stated: "And you shall give [the inheritance]" (Numbers 36:4). In the case of a daughter, it is specifically stated: "And you shall cause his inheritance to pass to his daughter" (Numbers 27:8), because you can transfer inheritance from one tribe to another only through a daughter. This is because when she builds her own family and marries, her sons inherit from her, and her husband also inherits from her. For example, Serach, the daughter of Asher, married Chanoch, the son of Reuben, and he died without male children. Serach, his daughter, inherited from him, and when Serach died, her son or her husband, who were from the tribe of Reuben, inherited her portion. Thus, the inheritance of the tribe that belonged to the tribe of Reuben was transferred. Therefore, in the case of the daughters of Tzelafchad, it is also written using the language of transfer: "And you shall cause the inheritance of their father to pass to them" (Numbers 27:7). It is explicitly stated that their inheritance shall be transferred from one tribe to another, according to the meaning and indication of the language of transfer, as explained. Therefore, it is necessary to understand that when it says here "only within the family of their father's tribe shall they marry," it is merely a good advice, as explained, because it is impossible for the inheritance to pass from one tribe to another at all. And the reason why this interpretation relies on the phrase "for their own benefit they may marry" and not on the phrase "and you shall cause to pass," is because it intends to clarify the matter and the order of the verses in its place, and its significance in this portion. This needs further analysis. In the Gemara, it explains that even though it is written "every daughter who possesses an inheritance from the tribe of her father's family shall marry a man from the tribe of her father" (Numbers 36:8), all this applies to other women and not to the daughters of Tzelafchad. Perhaps the reason is that they were important, as explained in the portion of Pinchas, so they were considered under special circumstances. (Bava Batra 120a)

Regarding that which we have previously written that the essence of the Mitzvah not to take the mother bird with its offspring is not to be cruel, do not challenge me using the Mishnah from Berachot 33b on which the Gemara says [the prayer leader is to be silenced] because he implied God's commandments come from mercy while they are Ordinances, from which one it would seem that the reason for [the Mitzvah] has nothing to do with "mercy".  This conclusion does not present a difficulty because the intent for which are obligated to observe God's Mitzvoth is only as they are "Royal Ordinances" and not because of the reason deduced [from them].  Were that the case, it would be [too] possible to stray from the true path by relying on the reasoning and inclination of each individual, as it is written in Tractate Sanhedrin (21b), "Why are the reason for Mitzvoth of the Torah not revealed? Because the two instances in which the reasons were revealed led the Gadol Haolam (King Solomon) to stumble".

... <i>And it means to say that the "evils" are many and also troubling for one another. And it appears that it is good for [Rav in the Talmud] to expound like this and not to leave it, such that "troubles" is a noun, like "evils." For if so, it should have been written, "raot vetsarot rabot." But that it interrupted in the middle with the word, rabot, implied to him that just like the word, "many," describes the word, "evils," so too does the word, "troubling."</i>
