1.	<b>Simeon and Levi are a pair; etc., for in their anger they slew a man, and in their self-will, they lamed an ox.</b> Ramban explained, <i>they slew a man</i>, is all the men of Shekhem; <i>an ox</i>, is the dynasty of Shekhem and Chamor. And behold all of the brothers answered with deception in front of Jacob, that [the people of Shekhem] should circumcise themselves. However, Ramban wrote that their intention was [only] to kill Shekhem and Chamor, who sinned, and to release Dinah from the house of Shekhem and [then] to go on their way. However, Simeon and Levi alone took counsel to kill the whole city, which had not sinned. But behold Jacob testified about Simeon and Levi, that, God forbid, that they went for three days with [this] evil counsel. Rather, their opinion was like all of the [other] brothers. However, at the last minute, when they approached to release Dinah and to kill Shekhem, their rage flared and they killed all the people of the city like a single man. So <i>in their self-will</i> – when they were not <i>in their anger</i> but rather with their own will, all of the three days – they only <i>slew an ox</i>, meaning Shekhem and Chamor. Hence their sin was not so great. Therefore, their blessing is <i> To their council, may my soul never come</i>. Its explanation is that since it is from this sin that the sin of Korah’s company gets its spark, from Levi; and Zimri, the son of Salu from Simeon, Jacob prayed about them, that their punishment should nevertheless not reach so far that it would reach Jacob’s sould, God forbid. And it is like my teacher, the Haflaah wrote, <i>And Korah took</i> (Numbers 16:1) the holy flow from Yitzhar and Kehat and Levi [all of whom are mentioned in the verse as his ancestors], but it did not reach Jacob [who is not mentioned]. And likewise, <i>Zimri the son of Salu, the chieftain of a paternal house of the Simeonites</i> (Numbers 25:14), but it did not reach Jacob. For then, God forbid, there would be no rectification for them. It then comes out that this was a blessing for them.

Moses took the men who were designated by name. This is because they were already the princes of the congregation from the first of Nisan, when they offered sacrifices, and God did not need to mention their names. 'And these are the names of the men'—it is similar to what was said about the spies: 'each one a prince among them,' and there God did not mention their names. However, here they were designated by name in the manner of 'greater than the title is the name,' to say that their name itself is significant, even if they are not appointed as a prince or leader, they are worthy in their own right. Therefore, it says, 'Moses took the men who were designated by name.'

<b>"And they travelled from Charada, and they camped in Makhelot, and they travelled from Makhelot, and they camped in Tachat"</b> (Bamidbar 33:24-5). This is an allusion to a saying of Chaza"l regarding the verse <b>"Efrayim is joined to idols; let him be"</b> (Hoshea 4:17) - that if there is togetherness and peace to the Jews, even if they serve idolatry, no evil will rule them. And this is why the generation of the Flood was punished more than the generation of the Dispersal [i.e. tower of Babel], even though the sin of the generation of the Dispersal was great (for they denied the main principle) - since they were in togetherness until God mixed up their languages. This is <b>"they travelled from Charada [חרדה]"</b> - they had no need to be afraid [<i>lehachrid</i> להחריד], since <b>"they camped in Makhelot"</b> [can also mean "in communities"] - in togetherness. But after this, <b>"they travelled from Makhelot, and they camped in Tachat" [תחת]</b> - in the lowest [<i>tachtonah</i> תחתונה] floor, until they returned and camped - and after this, in <b>"Mitka" [מתקה]</b> (Bamidbar 33:28) and in <b>"Yotvata" [יטבתה]</b> (Bamidbar 33:34) - sweet [<i>matok</i> מתוק] and good [<i>tov</i> טוב]. And this is easy to understand. (From there it is told).








<b>"To be good in their eyes, they should be for wives. However, concerning the family..."</b> From the beginning, one should pay attention. It first says, "To be good in their eyes, they should be for wives," and afterwards it says, "However, concerning the family of their father's tribe..." This requires clarification. For the daughters of Zelophehad were not fit to give birth, as they married after forty years, as mentioned in Bava Batra 119a. Rather, a miracle occurred for them afterward. And if the inheritance of the husband is not from the Torah, they would be allowed to marry from any tribe they desired since they had no sons, and the husband does not inherit them. It was only because the Holy One, blessed be He, gave them good advice to marry from their own tribe so that a miracle could happen for them. Thus, the verse is meticulously clarified.

“who is the man…” A house, a vineyard, and a woman. The Rambam (Hilchot De’ot 5:11) put (the verse about) a vineyard before (the verse about) a house (whereas the Torah put house first) because in the rebuke it is written “…a woman you will betroth, a house you will build, a vineyard…” (Deuteronomy 28:30) because in the curse everything is reversed, from which we learn it would have been appropriate to put the vineyard for his livelihood before the house, and the verse here presents a difficulty, see Rashi. (Rashi says that the verse refers to the fourth year’s produce - that is, he may well have planted it before building a house.) Behold, we rely on Rabbi Nehorai at the end of Kiddushin who said, “I set aside all the trades in the world, and I teach my son only Torah,” which is like Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai in Brachot 35b; and Rabbi Yishmael challenged this from the verse “you will gather your grain.” It seems to me that when Israel is settled on their Land, it is a mitzvah to gather your grain, not for the need of making a livelihood, because the words of Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai and Rabbi Nehorai are correct, but rather because of the mitzvah of developing the Land of Israel, and because of this Boaz winnowed barley in the threshing room and Elisha the prophet plowed with twelve yoke of oxen before him. And not only agricultural work, but study of all the professions because of (the mitzvah of) developing and honoring the Land of Israel, so that people will not say there is no shoemaker in all of the Land of Israel, or a builder, and the like, and bring them far distant lands. Therefore, study of all the professions is a mitzvah, and Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai and Rabbi Nehorai were referring to when we are dispersed amongst the nations who have many professionals and do not need us, and one who occupies himself with them - it is in order to find a livelihood; therefore, “I set aside all the trades in the world, and I teach my son only Torah.” And when they do the will of the Omnipresent, planting is not for making a livelihood, but rather is for the mitzvah; therefore,  a house precedes a vineyard, but in the rebuke, when they are not acting according to Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai, and the vineyard is for making a livelihood, it would be appropriate to place the vineyard before the house, but when acting from madness (see Deuteronomy 28:28) everything is turned upside down.
