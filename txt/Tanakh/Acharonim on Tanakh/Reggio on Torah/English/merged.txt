Genesis



Chapter 1



Verse 1

<b>In the beginning, God created:</b> The verse is telling that when it went up into His will, may He be blessed, to create the world, He created the material of all of the creation in one instant; as the heavens that are mentioned here includes all of the existence of the upper world, and the earth includes all of the existence of the lower world. Except, given that all of the things were mixed up together and without order, the Creator decreed to refine all of the offspring of the heaven and the offspring of the earth in six days; in order that everything should be in its place that is fitting for it, and that it should act according to its law. For example, He commanded that the waters should gather and the dry land should be revealed; He commanded the earth that is should bring forth grasses and that it should bring forth living souls; he commanded the waters that they should swarm living souls; and so [too] with everything. Behold that all of these commandments were refinements, not new creations - since they were made and completed from material [already] created on the first day; however that material was created <i>ex nihilo</i>. And hence, the verse here did not say, "God said, 'let there be heavens, 'let there be earth;'" to teach us that the first creation was from absolute nothingness - since it is not possible to have the expression of speaking [to something] before the creation of [that] something. As behold, there was not yet material or anything that God, may be blessed, could command to bring out the heavens and the earth. But with the other creations that [emerged] from something else - even though they were miraculous and similar to <i>ex nihilo</i>, nonetheless, there was already material that they could emerge from - about them, it is fitting to say "And God said;" which is to say that He commanded to that in existence to bring forth something else. Still, in spite of this, even the heavens and the earth were created with His proclamation and through His will, may He be blessed, as it states (Psalms 33:6), "With the word of God were the Heavens made," and so [too] our Sages, of blessed memory, stated, "'In the beginning' is also a proclamation." 
<b>In the beginning:</b> [It is] like 'at the start.' And the intention is 'at the start of the being of all that exists;' since before then, there was nothing in existence besides the Creator, may He be blessed, alone. And also from the expression, "In the beginning," we learn the truth of creation of the world [<i>ex nihilo</i>]. 
<b>Created:</b> The expression of creation relates to new existence and also the expansion of something. And there is no difference between the term, 'creation' (<i>briah</i>) and the term [in the phrase], 'healthy (<i>briot</i>) and good;' except that one is natural and the other is miraculous. Since the essence of the word is about the going form nothing to something like in this verse, and it is [borrowed] also for the addition to what exists and the extension of a being's power.

And the Canaanites and Perizittes were dwelling in the land. Earlier, only the Canaanites were mentioned. It also didn't mention there that they were dwelling in the land, rather, it only said 'and the Canaanites were in the land'. The reason is when when Avraham passed Shechem the first time, it was still the beginning of the Canaanite conquest of the land of Israel and they were simply traversing the country. As time continued, while Avram was in Egypt, the Perizzites joined the Canaanites, and their hands prevailed. It remained like this until Avram returned from Egypt, when they had already joined together, and they dwelled in the land. Therefore, the dread of Avraham was great. However, even so, they still hadn't conquered the entire land of Canaan for it was soon after mentioned that Melchizedek was the king of Shalem, which is Jerusalem.

Verse 2


And behold, 3 men: From what was recounted later, we clearly know that they were angels of the Most High, for one of them said 'I will surely return to you this time next year' - and there is no man that is able to trust that he will come the next year, for maybe he will die within the year. And furthermore, it is clearly said ‘And the Lord sent them to destroy it,’ and 2 humans alone aren't able to destroy a large city. Rather, they were angels that appeared to Avraham in the form of humans, and they 'wore' physical clothes, like the angel that appeared to Manoach and Gideon. And our Sages z"l said that one came to heal Avraham and save Lot, the second - to inform Sarah, and the third to destroy the cities of the plain.

And she said 'if this is so, why am I thus?": this is a brief expression, and the explanation - "If my suffering during pregnancy is so great" - more than the distress of other women - "then why did I desire or long for this pregnancy at all?"

<b>the altar:</b> That is the altar of burnt offering which was in front of the Tent of Meeting, such that [the basin] did not intervene between the Tent of Meeting and the altar, on account of its being stated (Exodus 40:29), "At the entrance of the Tabernacle of the Tent of Meeting he placed the altar of burnt offering." So how was this? It was pulled back a little towards the south and stood across from the space between the altar and the Tabernacle.

Numbers



Chapter 1



Verse 1

<b>On the first day of the second month,</b> because now they needed to be ready for their journeys to the Land of Israel, as the cloud lifted on the twentieth of this month, He commanded to count them on the first day of this month. Only those twenty years old and above, who are fit for military service, were to be counted. Additionally, the land would be divided among them according to their numbers, and they would know how many portions of the conquered land would fall to them. If not for the incident with the spies, they would have entered immediately. After this, He commanded to arrange them by the order of their banners, so that each tribe would have a designated place when traveling and when camping.

<b>So that he will not return the people to Egypt in order to acquire an abundance of horses:</b> This is a separate negative commandment, but there is [also] a reason in this for what preceded. For they would export horses from Egypt in those days - as it is written about Solomon (I Kings 10:29), "a chariot exported from Egypt." And it is not the intention of the text to forbid going to Egypt completely. As behold, the prohibition is only not to live there. Rather the explanation of, "not return," is that the king should not be the cause of Israelite merchants going to Egypt to dwell there, in order to do business in horses.
