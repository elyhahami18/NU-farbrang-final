Verse 3

As the dew of Hermon – Like the dew which descends from Mount Hermon onto the mountains of Zion which are lower than it, so comes the influx by way of the king to the rest of the people. 
for there in Zion the Lord commanded the blessing, life forever. That is to say that the inflow comes to Zion and rests first on the king who rules there, and from there it is poured out on the rest of the people. Therefore it is good that they be united.
