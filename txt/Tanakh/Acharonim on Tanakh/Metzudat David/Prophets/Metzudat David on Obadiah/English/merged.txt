Metzudat David on Obadiah



Chapter 1



Verse 1



Verse 2



Verse 3

זדון לבך השיאך "Your arrogant heart has turned you" meaning that now that you have become great and a mighty ruler when you came to the Mt Seir, therefore, the arrogance in your heart has turned you to become too prideful.
שוכני"dwelling" as if to say you dwell in the clefts of the rock meaning that nobody can come close to you. It is as if his dwelling place was in a high place and therefore he thinks in his heart who will be able to bring me down to the lowliness on the land.
