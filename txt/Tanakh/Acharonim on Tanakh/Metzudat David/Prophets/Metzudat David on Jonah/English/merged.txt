Metzudat David on Jonah



Chapter 1



Chapter 2



Chapter 3



Verse 1



Verse 2

what I tell you: and that is what Jonah later said, that in forty days Nineveh would be overturned. It wasn't necessary to spell that out here, because it is obvious.

Verse 3



Verse 4

started out: when he started his way into the city one day's walk, he proclaimed, "There is still forty days' time", and after that Nineveh will be overturned. That is, like the overturning of Sodom and Gemorrah from existence into nothingness.
