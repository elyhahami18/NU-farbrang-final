Kli Yakar on Leviticus



Chapter 1



Verse 1



Verse 2

“Should any person from you bring forward to the Lord an offering” - It begins in singular and finishes in plural “you shall bring forward your offering.”  Rashi’s interpretation that two people may donate an elevation offering in partnership does not satisfactorily address this verse and its neighbor, nor the beginning and the end, for we don’t know the limits of this idea [of partnership]. And it seems to me that the text wanted to warn all those bringing an offering to God not to stumble in the two ways that Cain and Abel stumbled, who were the first people to offer an offering.  For Cain stumbled in that he brought from the lesser and tawdry crops though he planted grain.  Those who err mortally needed to bring the life of an animal in exchange for their life.  And for [cases of] distress, the Holy One Blessed be He allowed for a poor person to bring a grain offering lacking life and offer it as if that person was offering an animal, as Rashi explains on the verse, “Should a person bring forward a grain offering” (Leviticus 2:1). Abel, even though he brought an offering from the choicest of his sheep, nevertheless, he did not do well either for the offering did not emerge from himself and he did not move quickly to do this commandment on his own accord.  Only after he saw Cain offer an offering did he become jealous of him and Abel from an offering as well to match him.

Verse 11

<b>And this is the law of the sacrifice of peace-offerings which one shall offer to the Lord:</b> It does not state <i>which one shall offer to the Lord</i> with any of the sacrifices besides the peace-offerings, which are desired without iniquity (alluding to Psalms 59:5) — since they are closer to the Lord than all of the sacrifices that come for a sin. And for that reason, it is written adjacently, <i>Whoever shall bring the sacrifice of his peace-offering to the Lord, he shall bring his offering to the Lord [...]. His hands shall bring the fire-offerings of the Lord</i> (Leviticus 7:29–-30). It mentioned, <i>to the Lord</i>, in all of [these verses], since, "These are what I have desired," said the Lord (alluding to Jeremiah 9:23). And look to the right and see (alluding to Psalms 142:5) that it did not mention that the owner should bring the portion for the High One with his hands with any [other] sacrifice. Only [here] with the peace-offerings, his hands shall bring it. That is because anyone who bears the king's anger and wants to atone and to wipe away the anger from his face sends a gift before him with a messenger; in the way that Jacob said , <i>I will appease him with the gift that goes before me, and afterward I will see his face</i> (Genesis 32:20). But someone who brings the king a present as a favor and a show of honor would then bring his gift in his hands, by himself and not with a messenger. And that is the difference between the sin- and guilt-offerings that come from a sinful act, the burnt-offering that comes from a sinful thought, and the peace-offerings. For it is not fitting that his hands should bring those sacrifices which come to remove God's face of anger, may He be blessed, as it appears like brazenness towards the Heavens. Hence he sends them through the priests. But his hands do bring the peace-offerings, which are a favor and a present.
<b>And some explain the verse,</b> <i>Whoever shall bring the sacrifice of his peace-offering to the Lord, he shall bring his offering to the Lord from his peace-offering</i> — that it is fitting that they should bless him and say, "May it be [God's] will that all of his sacrifices that He bring to the Lord should be from his peace-offerings; not from sin-, guilt- and burnt-offerings." But with the burnt-offering, it states, <i>This is the law of the burnt-offering; it is the burnt-offering</i> (Leviticus 6:2). That is to say, it alone should he bring and not repeat his foolishness, to bring another burnt-offering for a sinful thought. Rather, he should only bring peace-offerings that contain peace between him and his Creator.
<b>And from the angle of hinting (remez), it can certainly be explained as the five times that, "This is the law," is mentioned in this parashah are</b> corresponding to the five books of the Torah. For one who occupies himself with them is as if he offered these five types of sacrifices: The burnt-offering, the meal-offering; the sin-offering; the guilt-offering and the peace-offerings. However the induction-offerings were only temporary and not for [all] the generations. And we find in the same way, five [mentions of], "This is the law," in Parashat Metzora. For there too did our Rabbis, may their memory be blessed, say, "What is the remedy for evil speech? If he is a Torah scholar, he should occupy himself with Torah, etc." (Arakhin 15b). And if so, the Torah rescues one from evil speech, which causes these five types of tzaraat. So one who occupies himself with the five books of the Torah is rescued from them. In the way that [Yitzchak Arama] explained in the Akeidah, that in each book, the punishment of the sin of speech is mentioned; so too is it with these sacrifices - one who occupies himself with it is similar to one who has offered these five types of sacrifices:
<b>As one who occupies himself with the book of Genesis is similar to someone who offers a burnt-offering.</b> And that is, "This is the law of the burnt-offering," since the law of the burnt-offering is explained there. As Abel offered a burnt-offering from the firstborn of his flock (Genesis 4:4). And likewise with Noah, it is written, <i>and he brought up burnt-offerings on the altar</i> (Genesis 8:20). And likewise, Abraham, <i>and he took the ram and sacrificed it as a burnt-offering instead of his son</i> (Genesis 22:13).  And likewise, Jacob, <i>and he offered sacrifices to the God of his father Isaac</i> (Genesis 46:1).
<b>And one who occupies himself with the book of Exodus is as if he offers a meal-offering.</b> As all of the meal-offerings come as matzah (unleavened). And in this book, all the laws of matzah, its instruction and its connection to the Passover sacrifice – such that it is eaten with matzah – are all explained. And it is written, <i>You shall not offer the blood of My sacrifice with anything leavened</i> (Exodus 34:25). 
<b>And one who occupies himself with the book of Leviticus is as if he offers a sin-offering.</b> Even though all of the sacrifices are explained in this book, the essence of the book is nevertheless the law of the sin-offering. For once the Jewish people sinned with the [golden] calf, which was the beginning of all the sins, God made space for sinners to be able to come to atonement by way of the sacrifice. And alongside this, all of the sacrifices were mentioned since there is an angle of sin in all of them except for the peace-offerings.
<b>And one who occupies himself with the book of Numbers is as if he offers a guilt-offering.</b> As the entire law of the guilt-offering is stated in Parashat Nasso – <i>When a man or woman commits any wrong toward a fellow man, [...] and that person realizes his guilt, etc.</i> And even though the law of the guilt-offering was already stated in Parashat Vayikra (5:14), it is nevertheless repeated there for a matter that is added there, as Rashi explains there. If so, by way of learning this section with the thing that was added, the whole law of the guilt-offering is completed there.
And one who occupies himself with the book of Deuteronomy is as if he offers a peace-offering. As in Parashat Ki Tavo, it states, You are to slaughter peace-offerings and eat there, etc. (Deuteronomy 27:7). And likewise in Parashat Re’eh – all of the laws of the peace-offerings, of lighter holiness, are stated there. As it is stated, and the blood of your sacrifices shall be spilled on the altar of the Lord your God and you shall eat the flesh (Deuteronomy 12:27). And the laws of the peace-offerings were completed there on account of the few things that were added to them. That is why these five [mentions of], "This is the law of," are stated. Since one who occupies himself with each book has a great particular reward, as if he offered that type of sacrifice that is explained in that book. And the knowledgeable among the people will make the many understand (alluding to Daniel 11:33) this precious matter. For it is clear and correct.

<b>And this is [the meaning of] that which is written, "This shall be the law of the one with <i>tzaraat</i> on the day of his purification":</b> Since on the day when he rejuvenates a good heart within himself and takes on to repent - on that very day he will be brought against his will to the priest, to learn the path of the Lord from him. And the wording, "and he shall be brought," is not talking about moving from one place to another, but is rather speaking about his heart moving from the evil path that he [was on] to the good path. And that is when he takes upon himself to approach the priest and to 'seek Torah from his mouth.' And about this, it stated, "This shall be the law." And afterwards, once he has taken on to have pure thoughts and to be pure of eyes, not to see evilly; then (in the next verse), "And the priest shall go out beyond the camp; and behold the scab has healed" - [this refers to] that iniquity that caused him to have <i>tzaraat</i> - "the <i>tzaraat</i>, from the one with <i>tzaraat</i>," from someone else (as he is no longer ill with it). So it cannot state, "from the one struck." For behold, it is the iniquity that caused him [to do] his deeds. So it must say, "from the one with <i>tzaraat</i>" - to teach that the spiritual cure came to him from the angle that he had <i>tzaraat</i>. For it is the <i>tzaraat</i> that forced him to repentance. But the Holy One, blessed be He, nevertheless accepts his repentance, even though it was done out of necessity. And you will find the lack attached to such a repentance explained later [in] Parashat Vayelekh on the verse, "and many evils and troubles will happen to them" (Deuteronomy 31:17), see there.

<b>And our rabbis, may their memory be blessed, expounded</b>, it is specifically sins that are <i>before the Lord</i>, meaning between man and the Omnipresent, for which Yom Kippur atones, but not those between man and his fellow. That is why it is stated, <i>and for all the people of the congregation, he is to effect atonement</i> (Leviticus 16:33). That is to say, specifically when they become one grouping to serve God, shoulder to shoulder. Then the Holy One, blessed be He, accepts their repentance. But not at a time when their hearts are divided. And since it is the way of the world that they request forgiveness on Yom Kippur from one another but on the next day, they go back to their rebelliousness, that is why it stated, <i>And Moses congregated</i> (Exodus 35:1). On the day after Yom Kippur, he made them into a congregation, so that they should be like this all the days of the year. And since all matters of arguments come out of business affairs between a man and his fellow, that is why he judged the people on the day after Yom Kippur. And it was through this that they would be one congregation, such that each person come to his place in peace [alluding to Exodus 18:23]. And it is for that reason that this day is called the Sabbath of Sabbaths [<i>Shabbat Shabbaton</i>]. For the neutralization of business affairs and stillness is a great cause of peace. And it doubled the stillness [here], because every person has emotions and actions that are both external and internal. The external occur by way of the creative tools for each type of work, whereas the internal occur as a result of the fat and the blood that are excited by the wants of the desires. And on the Sabbath day, one only rests from the external. But on this holy day, he rests from both of them, since there is also no eating or drinking. That is why it is called the Sabbath of Sabbaths.

<b>And you shall love your fellow:</b> Our Sages, may their memory be blessed, said that this is a great general principle in the Torah. And in Tractate Shabbat (31a), there is a story about a certain proselyte who said, "Teach me the entire Torah while I stand on one foot." So Hillel taught him the verse, "you shall love your fellow as yourself" - what is hated to you, do not do to your fellow, and the rest is commentary, go and learn. And it would appear that this proselyte was a righteous convert and he was not mocking in jest to say that he teach him the entire Torah while he literally stood on one foot. Rather, he was certainly requesting that he truly organize all of the Torah’s commandments upon one foundation which is the one foot upon which all of the commandments stand. [This was] so that he not come to forgetfulness, which is common for a convert who did not learn anything about the Torah’s commandments from his youth. Hence he requested from him, that he give him a general principle that encompasses all of the Torah. And by way of a metaphor, he said, "while I stand on one foot." And his intention was that he give him something said quickly in a brief expression - and this is both a foundation and one foot. So by remembering this general principle, he would remember all the commandments of God.

<b>And there was chametz in the two breads, which is compared to the evil impulse.</b> For in the wording of our Rabbis, may their memory be blessed, [this impulse] is called the leavening in the dough (Berakhot 17a:2). For when the Torah is present, the evil impulse is not able to cause damage - as the Rabbis, may their memory be blessed, said (Kiddushin 30b), "The Holy One, blessed be He, said, 'I have created the evil impulse, I have created an antidote for it" which is the Torah. And were it not for the evil impulse, the Holy One, blessed be He, would not have brought down the Torah from the elevated beings to the lower beings. For it is with this argument that our teacher, Moshe, defeated the angels, when they said in front of the Holy One, blessed be He, "You have a hidden treasure, etc. and you seek to give it to flesh and blood?" So Moshe answered them, "Is there an evil impulse among you, etc." (Shabbat 88b-89a). And he meant to say that there was a need to give the Torah to the lower beings, in order to give them an antidote for the evil impulse that is enmeshed in them, to fill their lackings. That is why, it is stated (Leviticus 23:17),  "You shall bake them leavened."

Verse 1

God said to Moses on Mt. Sinai: What is the connection between Shemittah and Mt. Sinai? etc. The meaning is that when Moses went up Mount Sinai after seven weeks, that Israel counted 49 days from Pesach to Shavuot, then that mountain was sanctified, and forbidden from ploughing and sowing on the 50th day, on which the Torah was given. And this is the length of time of the Jubilee, to call for liberty and freedom to all of Israel, freedom on the tablets, by means of the voice of the shofar of the giving of the Torah. At that moment God told Moses the matter of Shemittah and the Jubilee, saying that through the number 7 and the number 49 I am giving this holiness to all the land of Israel. For this has a similarity and connection with Mt. Sinai from the side of there being an air that makes people wise (B. Baba Batra 158b). And the Torah [in general] is not like the Torah of the land of Israel and Mt. Sinai. Therefore it was appropriate to give also to that land the holiness of Mount Sinai after the number 49 years, and thus with the number 7. Or in order to make a memorial of the standing at Sinai through the calling of liberty and the blowing of the shofar. This joins to all the other reasons that there is to this mitzvah. Therefore it was said on Mount Sinai, and this is the correct meaning.

That which it says, "Do not take from him," implies that it is permitted to take from the wealthy. Likewise in Parshat Mishpatim (Exodus 22:24), it states, "If you lend money to My people, to the poor among you... exact no interest from him." Hence the Torah wrote in Deuteronomy 23:21, "Do not take interest from your brother" - do not take interest from anyone who is your brother, and even though the borrower profits from it. For the main reason for the prohibition of interest is because it erodes the trait of trust [in God]. As anyone engaged in business has his eyes lifted towards God, since he is in doubt whether he will make a profit or not. But one who gives with interest has his profit known and designated. So he will rely on his surety and remove his heart from God. And that which the borrower also transgresses the negative commandment is because he causes the creditor to sin and erodes his trait of trust. This is known from [observing] those that lend with interest. As most of them have little faith, and are 'stubborn-hearted and distant from charity' because of their lack of trust in God. This is the reason for the prohibition of interest in every place...
And it mentioned the word, "interest (literally, bite)," [as well as] "increase"; as it is called, "bite," to the borrower, since it is is similar to [the bite of] a snake - in the way that if it bites his heel, it results in a small scratch; but it [then] proceeds to rise and swell to his skull. At first, it is not noticeable until its fever rises and cannot be cured. But to the creditor, it is called increase, as it increases his wealth and property...

Verse 12

(1) And I will walk among you - the explanation of Rashi "I will walk with you in Gan Eden" - his idea is to remove from our holy Torah any and every claimant who says "I have a place to rest" by stating that there is no point in our Torah that affirms a reward for the soul, if so, the only force of mitzvot is to make one inherit the reward for a soul in the world to come, and the practical reality of doing mitzvot is to receive rewards in this world, this world tied up in disgrace. And many were already aroused to doubt - but here are seven different ideas of our sages, and I come to summarize and organize their opinions so as to stop up the mouths that say untruths about our holy Torah.
The first opinion, Ramba"m's, is that all these promises aren't (considered) the main reward, rather all that is mentioned here are things which remove challenges and obstacles that would prevent a person from serving the Holy One, meaning, if you observe My mitzvot I will remove from you everything that prevents, such as wars, sicknesses, hunger, grief so you will be ablt to serve God without any obstacle, but the essence of the reward is of the world to Come and it is not mentioned so a person would serve the Creator for its own sake, and not because of desire of reward or fear of punishment, see Sevefr Hamada (Mishneh Torah, Laws of Teshuvah 9:1)
The second opinion is from Rabbi Avraham ben Ezra, in his commentary to parashat haazinu, and these are his words: "according to my opinion the Torah was given to all and not to one individual, and the things about the World to Come cannot be understood even in its one thousandth, because it is very deep." And in his opinion, since it is hard to picture such a reward, since what is physical cannot grasp what is spiritual, the Torah concealed this very deep issue from the many due to their limited awareness.
The third opinion is Rabbeinu Bechaye's. It is the same of the Ramban's, and this is that all the promises of the Torah are above Nature, since it is not a natural thing for rain to fall at the time when we do a mitzvah, and that rain should cease from the earth when we do not do the will of the Place, Blessed be. However, the soul going up to the place from which it was hewn is a natural thing to the soul and this is not a miracle, and the punishment of excision [karet] in the Torah is that it will be excised from the place it was hewn, and from this we can learn that if the soul does not sin, she returns to her lodge, to the place where her tent was at the beginning (Gen. 13:3) and it seems that on this it is written "Look to the LORD and keep to His way, and He will raise you high that you may inherit the land; when the wicked are cut off, you shall see it" (Ps. 37:34). Meaning, in that excision of the wicked, promised in the Torah, you will see that there is spiritual reward that God will raise you to inherit the land of the living, when the soul goes up to the place from which was hewn, since it is needed to cut off the souls of the evil ones from there.
The fourth opinion - since in those days everyone was lying regarding the Holy Name's Providence, and were contending that everything that happens in the world is of necessity, and not of the will of the Creator, the Holy One wanted to prove that part of Providence is true through those promises, that eyes could see, that those who do the will of their Creator received good with all those goodnesses, and if the promise was spiritual they would still remain in this denial since the one who wants to lie could distance [oneself] from the end, and the essence of this opinion comes from Rabbeinu Nissim's commentary in the parsha of Bereshit and its root is in the Sefer Kuzari (Kuzari 1:110-112): "The anticipations of other religions are grosser and more sensuous than yours" and the friend explained "But none of them are realized till after death, whilst during this life nothing points to them. The Kuzari: May be; I have never seen any one who believed in these promises desire their speedy fulfillment. On the contrary, if he could delay them a thousand years, and remain in the bonds of this life in spite of the hardship of this world, he would prefer it." And this is, in truth, the best explanation, that the Torah is promising something that a person really wants.
The fifth opinion is that before receiving the Torah they were all idolaters and they did all sorts of specific rituals so as to continue the blessings for produce and bring rain on their time and all other bodily success, and when the Holy One of Blessing gave the Torah and prohibited those rituals, God wanted to assure them that through the keeping of the Torah they would receive those promises, and that through the idolatrous rituals they would lack all those, but the life in the world to come was not included in the promises because it was not assured through those rituals either. And this is the opinion of Rav Saadia Gaon, in the Book of Beliefs and Opinions, and also in the Guide for the Perplexed, third part.
The sixth opinion is that after it says "I will walk about in your midst"(Lev. 26:12) and "I will place My Mishkan among you" (Lev. 26:11) this is the clinging of the Shechina on Israel, even in this world where the soul is entangled in the material, that the soul should cling to the Shechina after she is separated from the material, behold, every promise of the fake religions regarding what happens after death the Torah has promised us also in this life of this world, and the prophecy found with us also proves that, and this opinion you will find in the responses of the Friend to the King Kuzari at the end of the first dialogue in his book, and Rabbeinu Nissim also supported this opinion in a new explanation.
The seventh opinion is that all the promises written in the Torah are for the nation in general, since the world is judged according to the majority, and the promise of rain, produce and peace and so on is for the whole people Israel as one, but the reward of the soul in the world to come is not included in the promises for the people in general, rather, it is to every individual, who will be judged according to that individual's deeds, and this is hinted in the mitzvot of honoring parents and in the sending away the mother bird, and this opinion is found in the Book of Principles (R. Joseph Albo) and in the commentary of the Ramban on parashat Ekev (Ramban on Deuteronomy 11:13) on the verse "with all your heart and all your soul" see there. And on those seven ways great words were said regarding our holy Torah, and so our own eyes see the greatness of the love of the Holy One for our patriarchs Avraham, Itzchak and Yaakov. And were their success in this world the end of their success, what would be the difference between Avraham and the evil Nimrod, who was a king in a domed castle, and Avraham just a wanderer from tent to tent and people to people, and also Yitzchak and Yaakov we have no idea what happened to them regarding the real reward, since this reward promised to their descendants is the end of their reward, what is the profit to the master that after their deaths their children will inherit the land, and they would take leave of this world empty despite all their efforts? What profit would be to them, even in a peaceful time in which all kings were successful and reigned in this world, and some even more than others, only if a great goodness comes to the righteous , which is their portion and the inheritance of the patriarchs, and of all their descendants, since there is only one Torah to all.
