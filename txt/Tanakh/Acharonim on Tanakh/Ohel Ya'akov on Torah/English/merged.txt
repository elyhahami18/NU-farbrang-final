<b>Likewise,</b> the wealthy appear to be in their situation like those reclining and sitting up front at the table that is before the Lord [alluding to Ezekiel 41:22], which the Lord distributed and they eat [from] His inheritance [alluding to Deuteronomy 18:1], whereas the poor stand for away and are only nourished from that which remains from the mouth of the wealthy. That is why David said that they all sit close to the table to get portions from their Father in heaven. And this is [the meaning of] that which they explained, "Let Your world be settled in peace, etc." As when we examine the topography of the ground that we are upon, is it not also uneven? Rather, it has mountains and hills; it has valleys and clefts. And the intellect concludes that what is lacking here is made up in another place, and what is lacking in the valley is made up on the mountain. And in the future, it shall be said, <i>Let every valley be raised, Every mountain and hill made low</i>, and everything will be even. Exactly like this does the intellect determine that what is lacking of their needs from the poor is added to the wealthy. As to give to the wealthy what he does not need — God forbid from the Holy One, blessed be He, to do a wasteful act! Is it not that He gives to the wealthy exactly what is missing from the poor? And the Holy One, blessed be He, does this on account of the reason that He said to David, His servant, <i>kindness and truth, that they might preserve him</i> (Psalms 61:8). And it is like we found with the dream of Pharaoh, that he saw that the mangy cows swallowed the healthy ones because the bounty that was added in the years of plenty is what was lacking in the years of famine. That is why he commanded to make piles to leave over the excess for the years of famine.
