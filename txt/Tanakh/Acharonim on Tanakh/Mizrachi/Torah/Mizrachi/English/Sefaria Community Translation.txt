... And it appears to me that they derived this from that which it is written,  vayigal, which is an expression of revealing (gilui), and not vayigalgel, which is an expression of rolling (gilgul).

Some commentators explain: Because it is written et (a preposition indicating action upon the object,) Pithom and et Raamses," it implies that they were already in the world before the Israelites built them. As if you say that they were named Pithom and Raamses after they built them, it should have written, "And they built for Pharaoh store-cities, Pithom and Raamses..." But this is not correct. For behold, we find (Genesis 10:11), "and he built et Nineveh and et Rechoboth the city and et Kalach," the explanation of which is Nineveh and Rechoboth the city, that exist in the world now. Here too [it means], Pithom and Raamses that are now in the world; and like (Genesis 2:14), "it is the one that flows east of Assyria," today - and not in those days. Rather the correct understanding of this is...

You shall not make with Me. You shall not make an image of My attendants etc. And in the Mekhilta, you shall not make an image of those who serve before Me in the heavens…Not the image of the angels of God, and not the image of the cherubim, and not the image of the Ophanim (heavenly beings). And if so, the letter "kaf" is missing from the word "eti", as if it says "like those with Me". Like those who are with Me. And similarly, "rebellion is like the sin of divination", like the sin of divination, rebellion. "A gold ring in the snout of a pig", like a gold ring in the snout of a pig. And many others like this. 
Gods of silver come to warn about the cherubim that you make to stand with Me, that they should not be of silver, because if you change them to be made of silver, they are before Me as deities. In the Mekhilta, the phrase "to stand with Me" is not taught there. It appears to me that Rashi of blessed memory intended with this to inform us that this Baraita holds that the explanation of the word "with Me" refers to that which you make to stand with Me, that they are the cherubim, and it is interpreted both before and after it: you shall not make like those with Me, which are the angels, cherubim, and Ophanim, and with Me, which are the cherubim that you make to stand with Me, should not be made of silver, and not four, even of gold. And "you shall not make for yourselves" means in your synagogues like them.

Chapter 21



Verse 1

..."Why was the section of the laws made adjacent to the [section about the] altar": And is it not the case that Rashi only cited those that expounded about the adjacency of sections when they are not written in [chronological] order - when they [expounded in a manner] that was close to the simple meaning of Scripture? But not those sections that are not understood as being out of order - as there is no need to give a reason for their adjacency...

<b>I might have inferred that mere smiting without resultant death [is subject to the death penalty]:</b> It is a wonder how it could come to one's mind that he would be killed for hitting without [killing] - and behold, it is written (verses 18-19), "and he struck his neighbor with a stone... and he did not die, and the one who struck is cleared, yet he must give his rest, etc." And Rashi himself wrote there, s.v. "And the one who struck is cleared," "And would it come to one's mind that this one who did not kill would be killed?"

... As even though Moses did not need to say this, since He already promised that He, Himself, would go with them; he nonetheless wanted to make known Israel's love of His going with them. So he said that if, God forbid, He had not agreed to go with them, they would not have gone up from there until they died - them, their wives, their children, their infants and all that they had. And the wonder is about Ramban, who argued and said, "God forbid that Moses should say, "If your presence does not go," once He promised, "My presence will go!"

...On account of proper behavior, such that a man should not say even about something that is clear to him, "[It is] certain," but rather, "[There is] a doubt." And this is what the Sages, may their memory be blessed, said (Berakhot 4a), "Teach your tongue to say, "I don't know.'"

...And I have not known what forced the Sages, may their memory be blessed, that they should say that this section is connected with the distant section of inheritances (27:7); and not to "Go up to the mountain..." (27:12-15), which is adjacent to it - meaning to say that once Moses heard that the decree upon him was in force, and he gave up asking for himself, he requested to appoint someone else in his place?...

...And the word, "him/it," is to make known that "your brother" is an object; as if it had said, "until you investigate your brother." And at the outset, it appears that that "your brother" is the subject, and "him/it" refers to the lost item. And therefore, [Rashi] raised the difficulty, "But would it ever enter your mind that one could give it back before [the claimant] inquires about it?" So he answered, that "your brother" is the object, and "him/it" [refers to] your brother. And he [hence] comes to clarify that it is an object; and that the subject is the one who has the lost object in his hand, such that he should investigate the claimant of the lost object, that he is not a swindler...
