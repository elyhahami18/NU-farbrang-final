Paragraph 14

After Abraham had the bitter experience of breaking with his brother's son, i.e. the surviving second generation, on whom he, the childless man, could have placed his next hope for the continuation of his spiritual mission, yet for the sake of the external material temptations he [Lot] would rather be in community stepping with Sedom and Amora, God said to him: Not to a man like Lot, but precisely to you - a man not primarily striving for material prosperity - this land with all its fullness falls to you; I give it to you and the descendants from you. You should not go out and, as a missionary, win other people over to your mission. What is to belong to you must be sown by you, begotten and brought up by your pure spirit. Jews want to be born Jews, not just educated Jews. — לך אתננה ולזרעך עד עולם. It does not say that they will always have it. It will always belong to them, they and it will always have the destiny for each other, just as it was given to Abraham here, without him ever receiving it personally. —

Paragraph 1

(1) אחר הדברים. As in Ch. 15, 1 above (see there), these words introduce a crisis, a reversal of all that went before. Avraham had already proclaimed God as א׳ עולם, Yitzchak was born to him, the eldest son sent away for his sake, ביצחק in Yitzchak the seed of the future was to be carried on, and this future was already recognized in the present, the king had already concluded a treaty embracing not only Yitzchak himself but with his further descendants so that Yitzchak's promised future had already taken root in the present - and now comes the behest to break off everything that has happened so far!  . הָאלקי׳, the same God who had revealed himself to Abraham by then, and had made Yitzchak the combination of the whole aim of Avraham's life. - נִסָה, related to נסע - moving on, נסח - flinging away, נשא - raising up, all three having the concept of bringing something to a further or higher position. Likewise נסה regarding physical or moral forces: to test, i.e. to give it such tasks to do which, up till now, it has not proved in its ability to accomplish.
Hence every test is therefore a step forward, is a strengthening of the powers which exist already, but which have not yet been proved in this further or higher task. A rope that has already carried fifty pounds is put to the test as soon as it is given the fifty-first pound to carry, but moral and spiritual powers are thereby strengthened and raised.

Paragraph 6

V. 6. On the meaning of האלהים as a judge, see Genesis 1:1. There, we have demonstrated the connection of the word with the fundamental concept אלה as a pronoun demonstrative plural. Accordingly, justice is understood as the moment that brings the unity of a principle that governs all together, and the judgment as its executor and representative. The judges referred to by אלהים must be experts (מומחין) and qualified (סמוכין), meaning their legal knowledge must be tested and recognized, and they must have been authorized to represent the law by representatives of the law. This authorization (סמיכה) must extend in transmission to the first representative of Jewish law, to Moses, and can only occur in the Jewish land on the basis of Jewish law, where "the plurality of all visible relations are subject to the rule of the one divine law, and must be subjected to it" (see Rambam IV Sanhedrin Halacha).
By repeating והגישו, it is clear that leading the servant to judgment must have a specific purpose. In the Mechilta, it is stated: שימלך במוכריו, "so that he consults with his sellers." It is doubtful whether the servant or the master should be understood as the subject here; the servant, so that the judgment advises against him, or the master, so that he exercises the further retention of the servant and his רציעה only with the authorization of the court. Rashi adds the words: שמכרוהו — .לו, and thus seems to indicate the latter interpretation.
From Deuteronomy 15:17 ונתת באזנו ובדלת, we know that the piercing should only be done at the door and not on the doorpost, and from ורצע אדניו את אזנו, that only the ear should be pierced up to the door. (Mechilta, Kiddushin 22b).
ועבדו, here it is not like V. 2 ועבד but ועבדו. The עבד נרצע (pierced servant) is only obligated to serve the master and not, after the master's death, the son. The ועבדו לעולם (and his servitude shall be forever) can only mean: as far as it depends on him, he must always remain in his service. He has lost the ability to obtain his release. Until then, his duty of service was limited, not extending beyond the sixth year, and even within that period, he could free himself at any time by repaying the purchase money, minus the already served time. The redemption (גירעון כסף) and the redemption (והפדה) granted in the following law of the אמה עבריה (Hebrew maidservant) also applied to him (Kiddushin 14b). However, from now on, he has no legal authority to free himself. "He must serve him forever," and he gains his freedom only with the death of the master or with the "Jubilee year," the "יובל," which "returns everyone to his inheritance and everyone to his family," ושבתם איש אל אחזתו ואיש אל משפחתו תשובו (Leviticus 25:10).
If we consider this law, which places the divine word at the forefront of its legal provisions, there is probably no other law that is so well suited to provide insight into the tendency and the character of divine legal institutions that are fundamentally different from all others. This is absolutely the only case in which divine law dictates a penalty of imprisonment (we will see that this is not to be understood as a "penalty")—and how does it dictate it? It stipulates the placement of the criminal in a family, as we would place a boy in need of improvement, and surrounds this placement with precautions so that the moral consciousness of the criminal is not crushed, so that, despite his humiliation, he still feels respected and treated as a brother, can earn and give love. It connects him with his family, ensuring that his family is not exposed to misery due to his crime and its consequences! By depriving him of freedom and thus the ability to care for his own, it imposes this responsibility on those for whom his abilities will be useful during his period of unfreedom.
Divine law does not know penalties of imprisonment, with all the despair and moral deterioration that reside behind prison walls, with all the misery and suffering it brings to the prisoner's wife and children. In the realm of its dominion, the sad prison abodes of crime are foreign. It only knows pretrial detention, and even that, after the entire prescribed judicial procedure, especially with the complete rejection of any circumstantial evidence, could only be of shorter duration.
However, even this single case in which it dictates a loss of freedom due to a crime cannot be understood as a "penalty." By sentencing the thief to six years of servitude only for the replacement of the stolen value, but not for the payment of the fine imposed on theft (כפל, payment of double value), the motive of this provision cannot possibly be punishment. It is nothing but a simple consequence of the obligation to make restitution. However, the obligation to make restitution is not a punishment; it is rather the restoration of the crime, which continues as long as the property damage caused by criminal or illegal acts is not rectified. Whoever violates someone's property is, at that moment, even if not sentenced by a court, obligated by his act, with his property, or, if not available, with the source of his property: his labor, to compensate for the damage he caused. So, it requires an explanation why the law allows the court to exploit the labor force of the perpetrator not only in this one case of inability to pay restitution but also in other cases where the restitution can be satisfied, a limitation that might find its motive in the consideration that theft is the direct mockery of the concept of property, precisely at the moment when the owner entrusts his property to the legal respect of every human being (see V. 37). With the concept of property, the world position of man begins, and his respect for it reflects the personality of man as a human being. We understand how only in the case of theft is the entire personality of the thief made subject to the obligation of restitution.
But this condemnation to servitude results so much from the obligation to make restitution, the law is so far from wanting to dictate it as a punishment, and the personal freedom is such a sacred good to it, that only when the value to be replaced is equivalent to or exceeds the value of six years of the thief's labor can the court carry out his sale. Because only in this case, at the moment of the act, the entire personality of the offender is subject to these consequences of his act. If the value of his labor exceeds the value to be replaced, the court, as it were, encroaches on a proportional part of the personality that is not subject to unfreedom (Kiddushin 18a). Moreover, according to the Mechilta, the victim can altogether waive the sale of the perpetrator and be content with a promissory note until his financial situation improves.
The only relationship in which the humiliation of the offender sold to replace the property damage he committed is truly brought to his consciousness is the provision that allows the master to give him a female slave as a wife for the duration of his service, whose children then remain with the master. Since such a marriage is forbidden to a free Jew, bearing only a physical, not a moral character (— אין קידושין תופסין —), and the woman given to him is only temporary, only for the duration of his service, this should indeed make him aware of the fact of his moral degradation. A motivation that may also underlie the determination of a six-year service and the liberating power of the seventh year. By his crime, he has fallen back into the circle of the "Six" of the sensuous world of creation, has not been held back by the thought of the "Seven," the one invisible presence above all that is sensually visible, from interfering with the visible. The "fear of God" has been lost to him, and he has thereby sinned against his own "Godly nobility": he has, with the use of his entire sensuous bodily existence, to achieve the restitution of his offense, to work himself up again by subordinating his "Six" to "Seven." He is a servant for six years due to his crime, the seventh sets him free, and throughout his life, the admonition accompanies him: "Six" puts in bondage, "Seven" liberates. The deification of the sensual makes us slaves; the homage to God makes us free and unites our "Six" with the One, lifting our entire bodily sensual being up into the realm of morally free, divine human nobility!
The servant who prefers the comfort of free but worrisome work of independent family self-sufficiency over the comfort of servitude, is led by the master to the door or the doorpost of a house, and his ear is pierced by the master with an awl, not on the doorpost, but at the door. מזוזות (doorposts) are the representatives of the independent house. They appear in the moment of redemption when God raised the Egyptian slaves to free men, giving them the right, and thus the duty, to establish their own independent households. The offering of the blood from the Passover sacrifice, in which all "souls" were counted, to the house's "doorposts," gave every Jewish soul the high destiny to contribute to the construction of free houses for God. דלת (door), however, the loose "lever" of the house, which lets in and out the members of the house, represents servitude to the house. The Jewish man who scorns to be a "doorpost," to independently bear the burdens of a house, and sells his freedom for the comfort of "servitude" and does not lend his ear to God's call, which calls him to freedom and independence, his ear will be pierced in front of a "doorpost," and thus the stamp of servitude will be imposed on him. — Similar to Kiddushin 22b: מה נשתנה דלת ומזוזה מכל הכלים שבבית אמר הב׳׳ה דלת ומזוזה שהיו עדי במצרים בשעה שפסחתי על המשקוף ועל שתי המזוזות ואמרתי לי בני ישראל עבדים ולא עבדים לעבדים והוצאתים מעבדות לחירות והלך זה וקנה אדון לעצמו ירצע בפניהם.
But just as the servant, so above all, the master, and all masters, brothers who have fallen into dependence on them, are reminded by the liberating power of the seventh year: to remain mindful of the invisible, sole, and only true Lord above lords and servants, to look at Him, the one above all lords and servants, and not to misuse their higher power position based on money and prestige to hold their dependent brothers in unlawful servitude. Even in the very last stage of the Jewish state, Jeremiah (34:13 ff.) had to proclaim the disregard of the principle expressed in the liberating power of the seventh year as the ultimate reason for the downfall of the state. According to Yerushalmi Rosh Hashanah 3b, the first law that Moses and Aaron (above Chapter 6, 13 ויצום אל בני ישראל) had to bring as a basic condition for their redemption was the law of the release of slaves. We said that Jeremiah points to the principle expressed in the law, not to the application of the law. According to the received Halacha in Kiddushin 14b, the service of one selling himself out of necessity is not limited to six years but must last for the contractually specified time, which can only be shortened by the death of the master or his son or the arrival of the Jubilee. Accordingly, Jeremiah's reproach can only be formulated thus: even the one sold judicially because of theft should be freed in the seventh year of his service, let alone that you have to release your voluntarily selling brothers out of necessity when their time is up or in the Jubilee! According to Ritzba, Rashi, however, understands the statement המוכר עצמו נמכר לשש ויתר על שש :ברייתא to mean that even the one selling himself out of necessity must only serve for six years and become free in the seventh, and only contractually could a longer service be established. Accordingly, the passage in Jeremiah would speak of the application of the law in normal cases, and the wording of this passage would support Rashi's explanation. Acharin 33a, however, seems to understand: מקץ שבע שנים תשלחו, as referring to the Jubilee that occurs after every seven sabbatical years.

Paragraph 6


The phrase "ולא תסב נחלה וגו׳" cannot be meant in an absolute sense. Such a transfer of inheritance from tribe to tribe inevitably occurs in every case where the brothers die after their daughters are married into another tribe. Therefore, its intention must be to prevent the alienation of inheritances from the original tribe as much as possible. By establishing the העברת נחלה (transfer of inheritance) in the conditional inheritance granted to daughters in the general laws of inheritance (Chapter 27), and with the introductory words זה הדבר אשר צוה ד׳ (This is the thing that the Lord has commanded), this prevention of alienation of inheritances is only the subject of this legal measure for the duration of that particular generation. If we consider the interests that this temporary measure was intended to serve, we would find its legal justification.

Deuteronomy



Chapter 1



Paragraph 1

אלה הדברים refers to the entire content of this fifth book. Just as the last chapters of the fourth book report what God decreed and ordered in connection with the imminent possession of the land by Moshe, so this fifth book contains what Moshe spoke to the people from whose midst he was about to depart and who — without his guidance — were about to accomplish their task in the land to be taken possession of. The following definitions of places seem to want to determine the location exactly according to its geographical position, where Moshe lived his last weeks among his people, where the people last saw their leader in their midst, where they last heard the living word of Moshe. The more each word of these last speeches of our God-sent leader bears the imprint of the entire intimacy of his soul — which was attached to his people and their future of salvation — the more it expresses the ardent desire to give his spirit and his soul to his people for the testing future that awaits them. And the less this place in the desert itself was recognisable by any characteristic of its own, the more understandable is the desire to preserve it in memory through its location and limitation. After all, our Moshe passed away and no monument, no column of honour, no earthly sign of remembrance remained of him; not even his grave was to become an external means of remembrance for his descendants. The entire bodily personality of our Moshe disappears with his death. Only the place where his faithful word to his people was last heard will be handed down to memory with the greatest possible precision, so that when a later descendent of his people enters this place, the locality may bring him the echo of Moshe's faithful word and inspire him to faithfully follow his people and serve their cause.
מול סוף, it is unlikely that ים סוף is to be implied here, as it does not occur without the collective noun ים. Rather, it seems to be a place name. After all, תפל and לבן do not occur elsewhere either. If, according to one view in the ספרי, all these place names are reminiscent of sins that the people had been guilty of during their long wanderings through the desert, then it is not impossible that Moshe and the people were referring to certain places that surrounded the plain, on which Moshe spent the last weeks of his earthly pilgrimage for instruction and admonishing speeches, these very names, testifying to the national aberrations, were given by Moshe and the people in order to awaken, as it were, the most earnest intentions for a purer, more faithful future by bringing such a past to mind.
