Rashi s.v. The Chasida (bird that is not Kosher): "That it performs kindness with her friends with food." This does not come from Rashi's wisdom in the ways of nature, but rather it is from a Gemara in the words of Rav Yehuda (Chullin 63a). And the fact that she is impure (unkosher) even because of her kindness, I heard those who say that it is because she only performs kindness to her friends. And the source for these words is in the Chiddushei HaRim on the Torah.

A case came before me about a gentile young woman who became a righteous convert (she did not join our people because she had set her eyes on someone). Afterward, she met a Jewish young man from a secular background who had no knowledge of Judaism. She brought him back to Judaism, and they became matched up.
He decided to seek out the footsteps of his ancestors. As a result, he visited the cemetery and his grandfather's grave. There, he saw a strange symbol on the tombstone — ten fingers with the thumbs and forefingers creating a type of triangle. He began to look into it, thinking that this was a mystical symbol, and found out that he was a kohen (priest).
What can we do? This is the law — a kohen is forbidden to marry a convert. We submit to the will of the One above everything, may His name be blessed forever.
However, to say that Jewish law is not sensitive to problems or that it does not answer people's needs would be a total lie! The law answers the needs of both the community and the individual. Yet the law has its own path. It moves at its own set pace, has its own model of responsiveness to challenges, and has its own criteria and principles. 
With sadness in my heart, I shared in the poor woman's suffering, she who had been the means for his return to the Jewish fold and then lost him. She got up and went on her way. (This was shown to me by R. Shamir Sheintof, may he have a long life.) See also in HaHar HaTov HaZeh, p. 410, about Rabbi Shlomo Zalman Min-HaHar. (That was shown to me by R. Gershon Bass, may he have a long life.)

Verse 1

... E depois da peste. A escritura considera a praga mencionada no final da Parashat Belk (a praga que se seguiu ao pecado de Baal Peor, e o número de infectados foi de vinte e quatro mil) como um importante ponto histórico no tempo e, portanto, aparentemente difícil para os habitantes de Jerusalém ( Sinédrio Sharashi alude a ele acima (Kha, 5). Afinal, se é verdade de acordo com as palavras de Yerushalmi, além daqueles que morreram na praga, mais de um quarto dos homens que caminharam no deserto foram condenados à morte. ali junto aos átrios de Israel, sete vezes mais do que morreram na praga (cento e cinqüenta e sete mil e duzentos). E a escritura não os menciona de forma alguma, e veja o que eu escrevi lá. E é porque estes morreram nas mãos de Adão e estes - em suas mãos ele será abençoado? E veja abaixo (versículo 9), que nem o tempo da praga nem as mortes do beit din afetaram o número de veteranos do exército israelense imediatamente depois. (P. Pinchas 5633) See More

Verse 12

RaShY on "This before the eyes of all of Israel" says: That they carried his heart towards breaking the tablets before their eyes, etc. Is it not that this act of Mosheh was considered positively, as in "May God strengthen you for breaking" (Babylonian Talmud, Shabbat 87a)? Behold, on its own, it is a depressing act. Those tablets the reception of which they anticipated for 49 days (plus another 40 days when Mosheh our teacher was on Mount Sinai) from their time of leaving Egypt were broken before their eyes--without it being pleasing that they would receive others in their stead, and it is curious therefore that RaShY would conclude his commentary on the Torah with mentioning this event. But perhaps it is possible that here there is some sort of connection from the end of the Torah to its beginning. There is creation, and there is deconstruction in which there is some kind of creation, in the sense of "deconstructing the old is construction" (Babylonian Talmud, Megillah 31b). Is it not possible that the golden calf and the tablets could have come into being folded into a single moment--and that therefore in the breaking of the tablets there was a sort of construction of a proper reality. (The night after Shemini Atzeret 5749 A.M. [1988 C.E.].)

I saw that in RaShY's commentary, his commentary to the Torah began with an Alef (on Genesis 1:1) and completed it with the letter Tav (on Deuteronomy 34:12), and this was not for nought.
