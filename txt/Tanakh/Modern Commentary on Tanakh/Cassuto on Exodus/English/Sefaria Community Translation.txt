Verse 6

<b>So the Children of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments from Mount Chorev:</b> (Parallel to verse 4: "and no man wore his ornaments.") They took off the ornaments from upon themselves, which they had adorned themselves with when they had prepared for the stand at Mount Sinai and wore beautiful washed clothes for this purpose (Exodus 19:10, 14). However, there is no hint to the the ornaments in the biblical story of the stand at Mount Sinai. Rather this seems to be one of the details recounted in early epic poetry [about it]. But the Torah skipped over it in silence because it was not important for its purpose [here]. Yet its impression remained and is still noticeable. And it is possible that the specific poetic expression "their ornaments from Mount Chorev," in this form, was found in epic poetry.  And in the word, "stripped themselves," there is a possible hint to, "and they stripped the Egyptians" (Exodus 12:36, and compare Exodus 3:22): These ornaments were at least partially from the silver and gold vessels that the Children of Israel received from the Egyptians. And since they used some of the gold ornaments improperly when they gave them to make the [golden] calf, it would have been correct to strip themselves of what was still left in their hands of what they stripped from others. And it is also possible to see yet another intention in the matter of the ornaments: These ornaments (<i>adaim</i>) with which the Children of Israel adorned themselves at the stand on Mount Sinai were like witnesses (<i>edim</i>, as a play on words) in their eyes. They were a type of testimony and souvenir of that sublime event and the making of the covenant between them and God. But now that they rescinded the covenant, they are no longer fit to carry the sign of the rescinded covenant - the removal of the ornaments is parallel to the breaking of the tablets by Moshe. 

Verse 7

<b>The Seventh Section: The Tent of Meeting (33:7-11):</b> This section is different from those around it in its verb forms. They appear here in the future or the conversive past to future, in place of the common style of biblical stories, in the conversive future to past or the simple past. Because of this, and because of the difference between the Tent of Meeting mentioned here and the Tabernacle, or the Tent of Meeting, described in the previous parsha and the next parsha, many felt that there is a difference in sources here: The sections speaking about the Tabernacle belong to Source P, whereas this here is a piece from a different source, where it is speaking about the sanctified tent of the generation of the desert. This is different from the Tabernacle (imagined by this approach) in Source P. So the form of the verbs indicates continuous actions that would reoccur from time to time with each stop of the Children of Israel in the desert. 
However, one who takes this approach does not understand the verses clearly. We will [now] try to arrive at their correct understanding.
Since Moshe saw that God would not allow the building of the Tabernacle according to the original theoretical plan now, since the Children of Israel were not fitting for this, he thought of the idea of preparing something temporary in place of the Tabernacle, until the anger passed. It was impossible for him to seclude himself with the Divine Presence in the Camp of Israel because the camp had been defiled by the sin of idolatry, so that God did not want to have His Divine Presence rest there. Hence Moshe took his tent and planted it outside the camp to serve him as a meeting place between himself and God. That is the main content of this section. And as for the verbs and their form, it is impossible that they all indicate a continuing action at each stop. At the beginning of verse 7, it is speaking about the <b>taking away</b> of the tent, about its planting outside of the camp - that is to say, about its removal from the camp where it was up to now - and its being named; and these are certainly only one-time actions. (And even from what is written in Numbers 11:24-30, it does not imply that the Tent of Meeting was outside the camp then. The intent there is only to distinguish between the camp of Israel and the camp of the Divine Presence in its midst.) The verbs in the continuation of the section, after the first ones, without a doubt do indicate actions that continued until the Tabernacle was erected. But the first ones, <b>will take, will plant, will call</b> are nothing but additional examples of the use of verb forms that accord to a poetical style, like the form of the verb, <b>will be destroyed</b>, that we already dealt with in [Exodus] 8:20. This whole section is phrased in a poetic style and a poetic rhythm. Traces of the footprints of ancient epic poetry are noticeable in it. The verbs stated in verse 7 remained - so it would seem - like their form in the poem, specifically because similar forms are found widely in the rest of the section. [There] it was also fitting for prose, given that they are about continuing actions. 
The subject, <b>Moshe</b>, comes before the verb, <b>will take</b> (took), according to the approach that we already dealt with (see above on Exodus 9:20-21), which has the subject come before the predicate (as opposed to the more common structure of Biblical Hebrew in which the verb of the predicate precedes the subject) for the sake of contrast or parallel to the action of a different subject. In the previous verse, it is said what the people did when they heard about the decree of God not to have His Divine Presence dwell among them. And now it is said that which, for his sake, Moshe did: The people did this, and Moshe did that. He took his <b>tent</b> (compare Exodus 18:7), and <b>planted for himself</b> this tent <b>outside the camp</b>, which was no longer fit for the revelation of God. And not only was it outside the camp but also <b>a distance from the camp</b>. (There is no way to understand this distancing except as being on account of the camp's excommunication, since it was defiled on account of the sin of the calf). <b>And he called it the Tent of Meeting</b>: He called it this name because the true Tent of Meeting - meaning the Tabernacle - which was already referred to as the Tent of Meeting several times in what preceded [this], was not yet in existence and temporarily could not be made. People are accustomed to this, to refer to a replacement with the name of the thing it is replacing. Moshe was hoping that God would want to meet with him in this Tent of Meeting, and his hope was not disappointed. And it is fitting that all of this would be said here. Since if it were not here, we would not have been able to understand where the words that God spoke to Moshe starting from verse 12 were spoken, for it is not written there that Moshe went up on Mount Sinai, nor anything else that indicates Moshe's sequestering himself to hear the words of God.  
After it is said that Moshe called his tent the Tent of Meeting, the verse continues, <b>and it was</b> from that day onward until the Tabernacle was established that <b>every</b> member of the Children of Israel who <b>sought the Lord</b> - meaning that he wanted to hear Torah from Moshe's mouth in the name of the Lord, <b>went out to the Tent of Meeting</b>, he would go out of the camp and turn to that tent - <b>which was outside the camp</b>, emphasizing once again even more that the camp was not fitting for this. And all the more so is it understood that when Moshe himself sought God, he would go out to there. In verses 8 to 10, the behavior of the Children of Israel is described; that they would honor Moshe greatly and would relate to God's revelation with veneration and submission. That is a sign that they were suffused with a spirit of repentance and complete faith in the Lord, their God, and His servant, Moshe. And it was worthwhile that this description be brought here, to explain to us that because of this inclination towards repentance of theirs, the Children of Israel merited complete forgiveness, as it is further recounted.
