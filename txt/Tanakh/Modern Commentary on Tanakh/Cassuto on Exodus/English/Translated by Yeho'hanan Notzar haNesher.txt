Verse 11

<b>Fourteenth section: The Half-Shekel</b> (Exodus 30:11–16) <b>Order of Ki Tisa</b>
This section discusses the contribution of the half-shekel, which is imposed on every man of Israel at the time of the general census. It is arranged among the sections related to the service in the Tabernacle in order to prepare from now what will be said later (Exodus 36:25–28) regarding the use of these shekels in the construction of the Tabernacle. And specifically, it is placed here, after the section of the incense altar, because of the proximity of the words 'atonement,' 'to atone,' 'the atonements,' 'to atone,' found in it, and between the words 'and he shall atone,' 'the atonements,' 'he will be atoned for,' at the end of the previous section.
Since the connection to the main subject of the section is not as strong here as the connection of the previous section to that main subject, the standard formula preceding a distinct law by itself is introduced here: <b>'And the Lord spoke to Moshe, saying.'</b> And similar to this in the following sections, each of which encompasses a special matter. Regarding the methods of the census in the ancient East, we today have clear evidence in documents in Akkadian that were found in Mari (18th century BCE), and from them, one can learn much for the purpose of clarifying the details of the censuses mentioned in the Bible. We will bring here what is appropriate to explain this section, and we will return to the matter later, in our commentary on Exodus 38:25 and onwards, when we address the issue of the atonement money and its use for making the sockets.

Verse 12

It is said here: <b>'When thou takest the sum of the heads,'</b> meaning: When you count the total number (also in Akkadian qaqqadu, 'head') <b>of the number of the children of Israel for their census</b>, according to the census that you conduct with them (the term <b>'censuses'</b> means a census; and also in Akkadian, this root paqâdu is used in this sense), <b>then shall they give every man a ransom for his soul to the Lord, when thou numberest them.</b> In Mesopotamia, the actions of the census were connected with a religious purification ceremony, and this ceremony was considered so important that the entire census was named after it tebêbtu, meaning purification. And this is probably because the census was regarded as a kind of sin of lack of faith in the deity, and therefore it was appropriate to accompany it with a ceremony of atonement and purification from sin. On the actions of the census in Mesopotamia see: J.–R. Kupper, Le recensement dans les textes de Mari, Studia Mariana, Leiden 1950, pp. 99–110. The Israeli view is similar, and therefore it speaks here of a ransom that must be given at the time of the census, and it is said again <b>'that there be no plague among them, when thou numberest them,'</b> meaning that by giving this ransom, the children of Israel will be saved from the punishment that could be inflicted upon them because of the sin involved in conducting the census.
