The Torah; A Women's Commentary

Foreword

W<small>OMEN OF</small> R<small>EFORM</small> J<small>UDAISM</small> (WRJ) is immensely proud to have nurtured the creation of <i>The Torah: A Women’s Commentary.</i> This book began when one woman, Cantor Sarah Sager, challenged WRJ to produce a Torah commentary that would help women re-claim Torah by gathering together the scholarship and insights of women across the Jewish spectrum and around the world. When Cantor Sager served in 1992 as Scholar-in-Residence at the biennial convention of District 3 of the WRJ (then called NFTS, National Federation of Temple Sisterhoods), she planted a seed, claiming that women could create a Torah commentary that would incorporate women’s experiences and women’s history into the living memory of our people.
One year later, at the 1993 NFTS Biennial Assembly in San Francisco, Cantor Sager challenged the entire national delegate assembly to “imagine…women being permitted, for the first time, feeling able, feeling legitimate in their study of Torah…and imagine Sisterhood as the empowering agent for this transformation of what <i>is</i> into what <i>should be.”</i>
The Board of Directors of Women of Reform Judaism responded enthusiastically to Cantor Sager’s challenge. Then-president Judith Rosenkranz asked past-president Judith Hertz and board member Elaine Merians to chair a committee that would assess the feasibility of creating a women’s Torah commentary. Dr. Sherry Blumberg and other scholars worked with various WRJ districts over the following years, leading women in Torah study and helping to spark an interest in this project. In the spring of 1995, WRJ convened a gathering in Elizabeth, New Jersey, that brought together WRJ lay leaders, scholars, and clergy to begin to envision what this sort of commentary might look like. Enthusiasm for the project was contagious. Less than one month later, WRJ Board member Davna Brook put forth a motion to the WRJ Board of Directors that WRJ should publish a Torah commentary authored by women. The motion passed unanimously amidst tears of joy and celebration.
From that point on, WRJ was committed to funding fully the publication of this commentary, which aimed to bring new insights to the Torah, hopefully engaging thousands of women and men in study. We recognized the extraordinary promise this project held, for it would be an opportunity to bring representations of women, in ancient Israel as well as in our modern world, into the public arena. It would offer a way into Torah study for women who previously felt excluded or marginalized. And it would provide an opportunity to highlight the outstanding work of Jewish women scholars and community leaders. In its distinguished 94-year history, WRJ has been involved in countless important projects; but this is certainly one of its most ambitious and most historically significant.
Many conversations and meetings followed in which the content and form of the commentary began to take shape. We explored many far-reaching questions: What would be the look and tone of the book? Who would be invited to participate? How would the commentary handle gender issues in Hebrew and English? How could we meet the high standards of scholarly integrity yet also succeed in engaging students just beginning Torah study? And, of primary importance, who could possibly gather together and lead the dynamic women who would make these critical decisions?
Understanding that leadership for the project held the key to its success, WRJ invited Dr. Tamara Cohn Eskenazi (Professor of Bible at HUC-JIR) to serve as Editor. Dr. Eskenazi, whose expertise, contacts, and academic standing are widely recognized and respected, possessed a clear vision of the book’s promise; and she approached collaboration with WRJ with open arms. In an early meeting with WRJ leaders, Dr. Eskenazi commented, “Women of Reform Judaism brings a sophistication of judgment and commitment to learning.…Partnering together will allow us to put Torah back into the hands of the community, especially the women.”
Dr. Eskenazi immediately went to work assembling an editorial board of leading women scholars and clergy: Dr. Rachel Adler, Dr. Judith Baskin, Dr. Sherry Blumberg, Dr. Tikva Frymer-Kensky ז״ל, Rabbi Sue Levi Elwell, Ph.D., Dr. Carol Meyers, Dr. Carol Ochs, Dr. Judith Plaskow, Cantor Sarah Sager, Rabbi Judith Schindler, Rabbi Ruth H. Sohn, Dr. Ellen Umansky, and Rabbi Andrea L. Weiss, Ph.D., who later took on the role of Associate Editor.
This volume is a testament to the generous spirit of women working together and supporting each other. Each step toward publishing the commentary was the result of determination and diligent teamwork on many different levels. Over the years, hundreds of women—lay leaders as well as Jewish professionals and scholars—collectively labored to birth <i>The Torah: A Women’s Commentary.</i> Rabbi Emily Feigenson edited an early pilot edition entitled <i>Beginning the Journey: Toward a Women’s Commentary on Torah,</i> which was released at the 1997 WRJ Assembly. A sample parashah, <i>Parashat Pinchas,</i> edited by Dr. Eskenazi, followed in 2003. Both of these early samples stimulated feedback from readers that was crucial in determining the final content and design of the book. Further refinement came in 2006 after nearly 15,000 women and men around the world took part in the opportunity to study from <i>Parashat Chayei Sarah</i> sample booklets.
Members of WRJ hosted commentary salons in order to raise the significant funds required to publish this book. A very special thank you is due to WRJ Board member Joanne Fried for her generous gift that initiated our successful fundraising campaign. To all the women and men whose solicitations and contributions enabled WRJ to publish <i>The Torah: A Women’s Commentary,</i> I say a heartfelt thank you.
Special acknowledgment must be given to WRJ Honorary President Norma U. Levitt and Past Presidents Betty Benjamin, Constance Kreshtool, Dolores K. Wilkenfeld, Judith M. Hertz, Judith O. Rosenkranz, Judith Silverman, and Helene Waranch. Their commitment to the <i>Commentary</i> kept the project on the WRJ agenda.
Several former staff members deserve recognition for their important roles in the genesis of this project. These include Executive Director Emeritae Dr. Jane Evans ז״ל, Eleanor Schwartz, and Ellen Y. Rosenberg, under whose leadership the project began. Eve Roshevsky and Alison Lee were also instrumental in advancing the <i>Commentary</i> in its early days.
WRJ Executive Director Shelley Lindauer shepherded this project to its conclusion and deserves unlimited thanks. WRJ Manager of Development and Special Projects Lindsay Bellows kept accurate donor records. I leave it to the Acknowledgments to formally recognize the contributions of the many individuals involved in the actual production of the present book.
May God bless us as we inaugurate a new era of Torah study.

Preface

T<small>HE INVITATION CAME</small> during the week of <i>parashat Vayeira.</i> At the time, I had been struggling with a <i>d’var Torah</i> I was preparing for the monthly board of trustees meeting at my synagogue. The central story of that portion is <i>Akedat Yitzchak,</i> the binding and near sacrifice of Isaac (Genesis 22:1-19). As I thought about the horrifying image of Abraham with arm uplifted against his son, I suddenly thought about Sarah. For the very first time, it occurred to me that Sarah was part of this story, that her feelings and her reactions mattered, that if she had been asked to sacrifice her child, the story might have ended right there. I realized that in her absence and her silence there was room for commentary; therefore, I accepted the invitation to be the Scholar-in-Residence for the 1992 District 3 National Federation of Temple Sisterhoods (NFTS; now Women of Reform Judaism) biennial convention as a way to further explore Sarah’s experience.
As I began my research, I soon found that I was not the first to think about the silent women of our tradition. I discovered that there were women—and men—at work in diverse fields of study who were uncovering and recovering a far more complex understanding of the ancient world than the Torah narrative suggests. Their work was opening the door to restoring a sense of women’s presence at the most important moments of our history and in our most sacred text. In various settings and circumstances, these individuals were beginning to add to and expand Torah.
I was awed and overwhelmed by the scholarship and creative work going on in all parts of the Jewish world. However, I realized that there was no organized, cohesive way in which to access this groundbreaking work. It occurred to me that the time had come to gather the best minds of our generation, to apply all that they had researched and discovered, all that they could now interpret and imagine, to create an egalitarian commentary to the Torah, a volume that would allow women, as well as men, to find themselves in the pages of the sacred text of our people.
I first issued the charge at the 1992 District 3 NFTS convention and repeated it at the NFTS National Biennial Assembly in San Francisco in 1993. The <i>Commentary</i> you now hold in your hands is WRJ’s response to that challenge. What follows is an excerpt from my presentation, “Sarah’s Hidden Voice: Recovering and Discovering Women’s Spirituality”:
“In every generation, our people have turned to the Torah to seek answers to their needs, their problems, their contemporary challenges. We are here today, in large measure, because the Torah has yielded meaning and truth to every generation that has sought its wisdom. We can do no less. It is our responsibility to make this book live for us. As men have done throughout the centuries, we must stretch the words, we must invest them with our needs and our imagination. We must struggle with the plain sense of stories, laws, and attitudes that exclude, de-value, and indict women. We must incorporate women’s history and women’s experience as part of the living memory of the Jewish people.
“The past fifteen years have seen an explosion of scholarship and creative work that will help us do this.…The work that feminist scholars are doing is changing our assumptions and conceptions of the world out of which Judaism emerged.…What is so important about this understanding is that it gives us a sense that there is much to uncover and recover in our history that speaks to us directly as women and restores to us a sense of our presence in and at the most important moments in our history. This insight also encourages us to proceed with this process of adding to and expanding Torah, of building upon the intimations that peek through the patriarchal gloss of the text, of prodding our communal memory and inventing what we have forgotten, of remembering and inventing together in order to recover the hidden half of Torah, reshape Jewish memory, and allow women to speak. [See Judith Plaskow, <i>Standing Again at Sinai,</i> 1990, p. 56, who quotes Monique Wittig’s novel <i>Les Guerilleres:</i> “You say you have lost all recollection of it, remember.…Make an effort to remember. Or, failing that, invent.”]…
“I present this final charge to you not as a theoretical proposal of something women ideally ought to do and somehow will be accomplished ‘out there’ by women rabbis and scholars. I present this idea of re-claiming Torah as a very specific proposal to this great gathering of Jewish women, to this unique organization dedicated to the spiritual life and religious empowerment of Reform Jewish women. If we are really serious about women’s spirituality, about re-claiming our history and our voices, about liberating the concepts of God and community, of integrating the Torah of our tradition into the Torah of our lives [a concept that I learned from Rabbi Laura Geller], then there is something very concrete that we can do. We can commission the creation of the first women’s commentary to the Torah!”
Since my first encounter with Women of Reform Judaism in 1979 (when they were still NFTS), I have been awed by the power of this organization and the ability of the women who lead it. I am profoundly grateful to every member of WRJ for undertaking this project with courage and resolve, with an understanding of its potential to transform our tradition, with willingness to embrace a dream and make it a reality. Working together, women have funded, designed, researched, written, edited, and critiqued this unprecedented volume. We have done all of this in historic fashion: a woman’s voice inspired a community of women to undertake this project in which women scholars, rabbis, cantors, teachers and poets bring their voices, their unique perspective to the ancient text of our overwhelmingly patriarchal tradition. This extraordinary volume, the result of the efforts of so many, is a veritable symphony of women’s voices—beautiful, powerful, inspirational, transformative.
As we open these pages, with excitement and anticipation, we hear the sound of Sarah’s laughter, triumphant: “My daughters have discovered me, my children have given me new life and new hope. I am reborn for a future as infinite and as radiant as the stars in the heavens of God’s promise to Abraham and me, to Isaac and Rebecca, to Jacob, Rachel, and Leah, and to <i>all</i> of our descendants.”
<i>Kein y’hi ratzon</i>—may this be God’s desire!
<i>—Sarah Sager</i>

Introduction

T<small>HE BOOK OF</small> P<small>ROVERBS</small>, a collection of wisdom texts ascribed to King Solomon, instructs its audience: “Keep your father’s commandments, / And do not forsake your mother’s <i>torah</i> (teaching, wisdom)” (6:20; similarly 1:8). From the biblical period onward, women have played important roles in transmitting Jewish teachings, values, and practices; however, until recently, little of this wisdom has been preserved in written form. <i>The Torah: A Women’s Commentary</i> collects and showcases the teachings of Jewish women in the first comprehensive commentary on the Torah written entirely by women.
This <i>Commentary</i> examines the entirety of the Torah, yet it focuses most sharply on women in the Torah and on texts particularly relevant to women’s lives. In this volume, biblical scholars illustrate what the Torah probably meant in its own cultural milieu and literary context. Then, scholars of rabbinic Judaism, Jewish thought, and other academic disciplines, along with clergy and other Jewish professionals, augment the exegesis (interpretation) of the biblical text to show how the Torah continues to have new meanings for later generations.
<i><b>Our Guiding Principles</b></i>
From its inception, <i>The Torah: A Women’s Commentary</i> was envisioned as a contemporary Torah commentary written by Jewish women. Three words reflect our guiding principles: contemporary, Jewish, and women.
<i>Contemporary:</i> In this <i>Commentary,</i> distinguished women scholars, clergy, and poets illumine the meanings of the Torah by using both traditional tools and innovative approaches. Our authors bring new insights and new questions to our sacred tradition, all the while placing their words within the ongoing stream of Jewish interpretation. Our scholars apply contemporary scholarly approaches—such as literary analysis, historical criticism, comparative linguistics, philology, archeology, anthropology, and sociology—to clarify and interpret the Torah, thus helping to show what the text meant to its own early audience and what it can teach us today. Particularly in the “Contemporary Reflection” and “Voices” sections, our contributors regularly address issues of concern in the 21st century and explore how this ancient text connects to our modern lives.
<i><b>"Do not forsake your mother’s torah. —Proverbs</b> 6:20</i>
<i>Jewish:</i> Judaism can be seen as an ongoing dialogue between ever-changing circumstances and Jewish texts invested with enduring authority. This is especially true with respect to our most sacred text, the Torah. The Torah has always been central to the life of the Jewish people. It is embedded within a wide web of interpretations, written and oral, that provided guidance for how to understand it in new contexts. As the Rabbis of the Talmud wisely note, each generation produces its own interpreters (BT <i>Avodah Zarah</i> 5a). We have brought together interpreters for the 21st century, so that the voices of the entire Jewish people at last would be fully represented.
One of the many things that make this book a distinctly Jewish commentary is that it follows the centuries-old liturgical division of the Torah into 54 portions. Long before computers and the Internet, Jews were connected through a World Wide Web of sorts, based on the division of the Torah into weekly readings so that the complete Torah—Genesis through Deuteronomy—is read sequentially each year. To this day, Jews in Melbourne, Manhattan, or Marrakech share the same story by reading the same weekly Torah portion (<i>parashah</i> in Hebrew) in the synagogue. Jewish communities may differ as to which sections of the parashah they read or discuss, what they say about it, or how they apply the Torah to their lives, but this sacred text unites us.
One of the hallmarks of Jewish interpretation is that it embraces a range of approaches and viewpoints, preserving a diversity of voices. Our <i>Commentary</i> emulates the style of the <i>Mikraot G’dolot</i> (also called the Rabbinic Bible), a popular format for Jewish Bible commentary since the 16th century. In such a work, the text of the entire Torah is accompanied by a translation and by running commentaries from a variety of sages who interpreted the text for their own generation. In our <i>Commentary,</i> however, we have replaced the classic Aramaic translation with an English translation (described below), and the sages are all women.
Another feature that makes this a Jewish commentary is that our contributors represent the full spectrum of the Jewish community: in addition to Reform, we include Conservative, Orthodox, and Reconstructionist scholars as well as unaffiliated and secular ones. We invited clergy and academics from diverse streams of Jewish life so that the work can speak on behalf of <i>klal Israel,</i> “the entirety of the Jewish people.” Our writers span the globe, hailing from North America, South America, Europe, and Israel.
<i>Women:</i> The distinguishing feature of this commentary is that it is written entirely by women. In the past, commentaries by learned men spoke on behalf of our people, even when they did not represent the insights of women. By providing commentary authored by women, we expect to represent the wider community, with qualified women interpreters who illuminate much that has been overlooked. In doing so, we are bringing women out of the shadows—the women in the text as well as the women in the Jewish world.
We deliberately sought to cast as wide a net as possible to show how women trained in various aspects of Bible and Jewish studies are thinking about the Torah on the basis of their professional training. Our commentators include academics, rabbis, cantors, educators, and poets, all of whom offer different lenses though which to view the biblical text. Their commentaries show how women’s experiences can shed light both on the text of the Torah and the <i>torah</i> of our lives.
This book could not have been written fifty or even twenty years ago. We are fortunate to have in the present generation, at last, hundreds of qualified women whose teaching and insights are having a profound influence on our evolving understanding of the Torah. While we bring together the work of one hundred writers (not including the Voices sections), we are fully aware of the many gifted women who are not included in this volume.
In the course of compiling and editing this <i>Commentary,</i> we were repeatedly asked why we include only women commentators. Even after much deliberation, we could not see a way of inviting male colleagues without having their voices be mere tokens. We concluded that this would not adequately represent men’s scholarship, and also it would detract from giving women a full representation. Although we invited only women contributors, we draw upon the work of all scholars—women and men, Jewish and non-Jewish—many of whom do not appear in these pages by name but who are indispensable to any study of the Torah.
<i><b>Gender and the Translation of the Torah</b></i>
One issue about which there was unanimous agreement from the start was the importance of including both the complete Hebrew text of the Torah and an English translation. But which translation would we use? The endeavor of translating the Bible into one’s everyday language began centuries before the Common Era. Jewish communities of the time used and transmitted versions of the Torah in Greek (referred to as the Septuagint) and in Aramaic (referred to as Targum), which are still studied today. The best known early English translation of the Bible (the King James Version), which relied at times upon rabbinic commentaries, dates to the 17th century and in turn it has influenced a variety of Jewish translations. Today the most widely used translation in liberal circles is the New Jewish Publication Society (NJPS) version.
The art of translation has always been challenging. For us, gendered language posed yet an additional challenge. Although some Christian “gender sensitive” or “gender neutral” Bibles have been published since the mid-1980s, the only comparable Jewish translation first appeared in 2005, when the URJ Press published a revised edition of <i>The Torah: A Modern Commentary</i> (edited by W. Gunther Plaut). We have incorporated the 2006 version of that URJ translation, with some minor modifications, in <i>The Torah: A Women’s Commentary.</i>
The URJ translation combines the work of two translators. The late Rabbi Chaim Stern prepared a fresh translation of Genesis. Following his death in 2001, Rabbi David Stein stepped in as revising translator for Exodus through Deuteronomy, creating an updated and “gender-accurate” version of the NJPS translation.
The most innovative aspect of Stern’s translation is its gender-neutral treatment of language for God. Consider first the divine name composed of four Hebrew consonants (י–ה–ו–ה) and referred to as the tetragrammaton (see at Genesis 2:4 and Exodus 3:15). It has been typically translated since antiquity as forms of the word “Lord” (becoming “the L<small>ORD</small>” in the King James Version and elsewhere, such as NJPS). In Jewish circles, God’s name has been read aloud in the synagogue using the substitution <i>Adonai,</i> the Hebrew word for “Lord” or “Lords”; some Jewish translations substitute the word <i>“Hashem”</i> (meaning “the Name”) instead. However, Stern rendered God’s name as “the Eternal,” a choice that dates back to Moses Mendelssohn’s 1783 translation of the Torah into German, and one that reflects a biblical understanding of this divine name as related to the Hebrew verb “to be.”
In the present translation, we decided not to translate God’s name at all, but to preserve it the way the Torah itself does, using the same four Hebrew letters. Every instance of the ineffable name thus poses a challenge; in this way, we encourage our readers to share in the struggle with how we address the Divine.
The Hebrew Bible typically uses masculine verb forms, adjectives, and pronouns when referring to God; and customarily such language is mechanically reproduced in English. Therefore, speaking about God in a gender-neutral way requires making adjustments not only to God’s name, but also to all related wording. In his translation, Stern resorted to a variety of techniques, such as recasting sentences to avoid the need for pronouns, replacing “He” with “[God]” and “His” with “[God’s],” and the like. Like German and French—but unlike English—Hebrew is a gender-inflected language. That is, all Hebrew nouns grammatically are either masculine or feminine; no neutral form exists. Even inanimate objects (like a chair or a table) are assigned a grammatical gender; however, there is no fixed correlation between the grammatical gender of a noun and its social gender (or biological reality). In the Bible, God is referred to in masculine language. This raises the question: Does this grammatically masculine language mean that the Torah depicts God as a male deity? While some scholars answer this question in the affirmative, others argue that the God of the Torah is implicitly beyond the biological categories that distinguish female and male; God is “beyond gender” (see at Deuteronomy 33:5).
Even if ancient Israelites imagined Israel’s God primarily as male, the Torah and the rest of the Hebrew Bible do enable readers to understand God in gender-inclusive terms. Support for thinking about God not only in masculine terms comes in part from the metaphors that depict Israel’s God. The biblical writers sometimes refer to God using male imagery: for example, as a warrior (see at Exodus 15:3), father (see at Deuteronomy 32:6), or king (see at Deuteronomy 33:5). But biblical texts also portray God with female imagery, as one who gives birth (see at Numbers 11:12; Deuteronomy 32:13, 18; Exodus 15:22–17:16; 15:26). In addition, they utilize animals and inanimate objects to characterize God as, for instance, an eagle (see at Exodus 19:4; Deuteronomy 32:11) or a rock (see at Deuteronomy 32:4)—none of which is to be taken literally. We find an even greater array of divine metaphors outside of the Torah, which suggests that the gender of a particular image does not correlate to the perceptions of Israel’s God.
Different questions emerge when translating the Torah’s references to human beings. When a verse uses masculine language, is it exclusively addressing or speaking about men? When does that grammatical form refer to women and men alike? Furthermore, when do Hebrew personal nouns like <i>ish</i> or <i>adam,</i> often rendered as “man” in older translations, refer specifically to men, or to both men and women?
As Stein set about adapting the NJPS translation of Exodus through Deuteronomy, he needed to interpret how certain grammatical forms and vocabulary were operating in each instance. Stein examined the text methodically in light of the most up-to-date conclusions about the way the Hebrew language operates in the Torah, and about the roles that women and men played in ancient Israel. He did so by drawing on published research as well as by conducting extensive correspondence with leading biblical scholars. Readers of <i>The Torah: A Women’s Commentary</i> will become more familiar with how the resulting translation functions when they read the Central Commentary, for numerous comments explain—and sometimes challenge—Stein’s impressive achievement in biblical translation and biblical scholarship.
The URJ calls its translation a “gender accurate” translation, not a “gender neutral” or “gender sensitive” version. In other words, it does not render all grammatically masculine language in gender-inclusive terms but instead attempts to convey what was meant in a given context. For example, it sometimes translates the word <i>avot</i> as “fathers” and sometimes as “ancestors,” depending whether that Hebrew noun functions inclusively or not in that particular passage (for instance, see at Deuteronomy 7:12). Likewise in regard to personal nouns such as <i>ish:</i> sometimes the translation construes this noun in a gender-inclusive sense (see at Exodus 21:7), but elsewhere as referring specifically to a man (see at Deuteronomy 8:5).
For more on the URJ’s Torah translation, see Stein, “Preface to the Revised Edition,” in <i>The Torah: A Modern Commentary,</i> 2005, p. xxv-xxxi; and “Preface,” <i>The Contemporary Torah,</i> 2006, pp. v-xxxv.
<i><b>The Five Components of the Commentary</b></i>
In selecting the more than one hundred contributors for the <i>Commentary,</i> the Editorial Board resisted the temptation to let a single type of voice dominate the interpretation of the Torah. The editors, in turn, aimed to achieve consistency only insofar as it would facilitate readers’ use of the commentary; the particular ideas and styles remain those of the individual authors. On occasion, the editors have inserted a note in square brackets (like this: [—<i>Ed</i>.]) either to supplement the commentator’s work or to juxtapose a different opinion. We consider the act of preserving a multiplicity of voices not only a defining feature of the Jewish interpretive tradition, but also an explicit feminist endeavor.
The multi-vocal nature of this commentary is also evident from the five elements that address each Torah portion in turn:
<i>Central Commentary.</i> Written by a scholar of Bible, this section begins with an introduction and outline that provide an overview of the Torah portion. The commentary then accompanies the Hebrew text and the English translation, providing a running exegesis (explanation) of the parashah. Its main objective is to help readers understand the plain sense of the text in its own cultural context as well as in ours.
<i>Another View.</i> This short essay, also by a biblical scholar, focuses on a specific aspect of the parashah, in a way that supplements or challenges the Central Commentary.
<i>Post-biblical Interpretations.</i> In this section, a scholar of rabbinic literature discusses a selection of past responses to the Torah—typically, rabbinic teachings and classical commentaries. (See Women and Post-biblical Commentary.)
<i>Contemporary Reflection.</i> In this section, an author—a scholar of contemporary Jewish thought and life, rabbi, cantor, or educator—reflects on the parashah and what meanings it holds for Jews today. (See Women and Contemporary Revelation.)
<i>Voices.</i> This section contains creative responses to the parashah, mainly in the form of poetry. (See The Poetry of Torah and the Torah of Poetry.)
At times different parts of the <i>Commentary</i> treat similar topics, or they approach the same topic from divergent standpoints—just as various biblical verses interrelate. Therefore the commentary frequently includes cross-references that enable the reader to engage more deeply in the study of the Torah. By looking up a cross-reference, a reader can examine how related biblical passages compare and contrast, and explore texts in other parts of the Bible. The reader can also trace the evidence that leads an interpreter to draw a certain conclusion, and weigh the author’s opinion against divergent views elsewhere in the book. When the notation “see” precedes a biblical citation, it points to a passage in the text itself, whereas the notation “see at” refers to the commentary on that cited passage.
Another convention in the commentary similarly reflects the many levels on which it treats the text: the occasional use of a vertical line (|) between sentences. This indicates the start of a new thought that is still based on the same lemma (the biblical passage being commented upon).
For more about this book, see its Web page online via www.ccarpress.org.
Space constraints required our contributors and editors to be highly selective. In general, the <i>Commentary</i> focuses on three aspects of the text: that which relates to women, that which is obscure to contemporary readers (at least at first glance), and that which remains particularly significant for Jews today. Inevitably this means that not everything that flows from the inexhaustible fountain of wisdom we call Torah is included in this <i>Commentary.</i> We trust that what we have included will guide new as well as seasoned readers of the Torah as they explore the sacred texts of our tradition.

Women and Interpretation of the Torah

T<small>HE WORD</small> <i>torah,</i> or “teaching,” can mean different things in different contexts. In Proverbs 6:20, which states “do not forsake your mother’s <i>torah,”</i> the term denotes human wisdom in general. Elsewhere in the Bible, the word refers to particular divine precepts (see Exodus 13:9), certain priestly instructions (see at Leviticus 6:2), or the core of the book of Deuteronomy (see at Deuteronomy 31:9).
While in the Bible the word <i>torah</i> (translated variously as “Teaching,” “Instruction,” “ritual,” or “Law”) refers to a number of different kinds of teachings, in time “<i>the</i> Torah” came to mean the books of Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy (in Hebrew: <i>B’reishit, Sh’mot, Vayikra, B’midbar,</i> and <i>D’varim</i>). Together, those five books constitute the first of the three parts of the Jewish Scriptures, or the Hebrew Bible, namely: Torah, Prophets, and Writings (or <i>Torah, N’viim,</i> and <i>K’tuvim,</i> which combine to produce an acronym that is pronounced <i>Tanach).</i> A common Jewish name for any published volume of the Torah is <i>Chumash,</i> which is related to the Hebrew word for “five.” The term “Pentateuch” (from the Greek word for “five”) is commonly used as well, especially in scholarly circles.
The word “Torah,” then, refers to the foundation of authoritative teachings in Judaism and the repository of God’s teachings for Israel. From antiquity, Jewish (and subsequently Christian) traditions typically considered the Torah—in the sense of the first five books of the Bible—to have been written by Moses and to represent a record of God’s words to Moses; hence the customary reference to “the Five Books of Moses.” However, this title is misleading, because nothing in the Torah claims that Moses wrote the entire collection. Genesis and Exodus mention no author; and although most of Leviticus and major parts of Exodus and Numbers purport to represent God’s words to Moses or Israel, only Deuteronomy claims to quote Moses extensively and states that he wrote those sections.
Some Rabbis noted early on that certain statements in the Torah could not have been written by Moses (such as the report about his death in Deuteronomy 34). Nevertheless, a widespread presumption that Moses wrote the whole Torah at God’s dictation prevailed until the modern era.
In the modern era, academic scholars began to challenge the view of the Torah as the unified work of Moses. The theory that became most widely accepted in scholarly circles, beginning in the 19th century, claims that the Torah is composed of four major sources that were combined gradually over many centuries. In general, this “Documentary Hypothesis” (associated with the German biblical scholar Julius Wellhausen) posits that the source labeled “J” (or “Yahwist,” marked by the prominence of God’s name, <i>YHVH)</i> was the earliest (10th or 9th century <small>B.C.E.)</small> and represented the interests and traditions of the kingdom of Judah. (Prior to that time traditions were transmitted orally.) Source “E” (or “Elohist,” distinguished by its preference for referring to God as Elohim) represented northern traditions, that is, the kingdom of Israel, from about a century later. Source “D” (or “Deuteronomist”) refers primarily to the book of Deuteronomy, a work that becomes influential in the 7th century <small>B.C.E.</small> Finally, the “P” (or “Priestly”) source represented the concerns of the priests from the period when Israel was exiled in Babylon or shortly after, in the post-exilic period of the 6th to 5th centuries <small>B.C.E.</small>
Proponents of the Documentary Hypothesis describe the particular literary characteristics and concerns of each source; and some have sought to identify the actual authors as well. Harold Bloom and David Rosenberg speculated that the author of J was in fact a woman living in King David’s court <i>(The Book of J,</i> 1990), an idea that Richard Friedman first proposed in <i>Who Wrote the Bible?</i> (1987, p. 86). However, the speculation that J was a woman has not been widely accepted for a number of reasons. First, while the idea that women had a role in the composition of the Torah (or other parts of the Bible) remains theoretically possible, the very notion of a single individual author of J is no longer accepted. Second, Bloom’s criteria for what he identifies as a woman’s voice are highly flawed (even sexist). Third, as scholars in a variety of fields demonstrate, identifying the gender of an author even in a modern setting is extremely difficult; how much more so in an ancient setting when we have no supporting evidence! Therefore, most scholars question our ability to recover such precise information about the origins of the sources.
The Documentary Hypothesis maintains that the entire Torah as we know it only came into being in the 5th century <small>B.C.E.</small> with the work of Ezra the priest and scribe. Nehemiah 8 depicts the dramatic moment when Ezra reads the book of the Torah (<i>sefer ha-torah</i>) in Jerusalem in the presence of all the people, “men and women and all who could listen with understanding” (8:2). Some regard the enthusiastic affirmation of the Torah by the entire community at the time of Ezra as a “second Sinai.” For many scholars, this moment represents the time that the Torah was finally complete.
Many aspects of the Documentary Hypothesis no longer represent scholarly consensus; others remain influential. Its enduring contribution is the claim that the Torah is the fruit of a long process and contains diverse sources, often shaped by responses to new crises. This conclusion continues to be important and often guides scholarly interpretation, but along lines that differ from the Documentary Hypothesis itself. Moreover, two of the sources, J and E, no longer seem to be widely recognized. References to P, the distinctive priestly traditions, remain useful insofar as such material has a coherent world view (as in Genesis 1) and often focuses on the sanctuary and its personnel, as well as on genealogies. But some scholars now distinguish between two types of priestly writings: one priestly school labeled “P” and another whose work is referred to as “H” (for the Holiness Code; see the introduction to Leviticus 19:1–37.
Deuteronomy seems to have a separate history. For the purpose of this <i>Commentary</i> the discovery of the “book of the Torah,” which scholars equate with Deuteronomy, is particularly relevant. According to II Kings 22:8–20 (also II Chronicles 34:14–30), a book of the <i>torah</i> (<i>sefer ha-torah</i>) is found in the Temple during the course of renovations (at about 622 <small>B.C.E.</small>). When the king hears the book’s messages, he instructs his highest officials: “Go, inquire of יהוה…concerning the words of this scroll that has been found” (II Kings 22:13). The commissioned leaders then go to the prophet Huldah, wife of Shallum, who is sitting at the Mishneh section in Jerusalem. (The so-called Huldah Gates at the Temple’s southern wall excavation in today’s Jerusalem are named after her, probably because of a tradition that placed her in this location.) Huldah responds to the delegation by confirming the authenticity of the book’s messages. Her authority goes unchallenged. According to II Kings, her authentication of the book leads King Josiah to undertake major reforms. Since these reforms conform to Deuteronomy’s laws and not other biblical texts, many scholars maintain that the “book of the <i>torah”</i> found and implemented is actually a version of Deuteronomy. References in Deuteronomy to a <i>torah</i> written by Moses further strengthen this conclusion. If so, then this major book of the Torah assumed a prominent place in Israel’s sacred tradition because Huldah affirmed its reliability.
* * *
For most of its history, Jewish interpretation of sacred texts did not represent the knowledge and insights of women, for authoritative interpretation long remained the domain of men. (See “Women and Post-biblical Commentary”) A notable change—a landmark, really—can be found with the work of the English writer Grace Aguilar (1816-1847). Prior to her death at age 31, she wrote and published essays, novels, and poetry. Her magisterial book on women in the Bible and the Talmud (576 pages) was published in 1845, preceding by fifty years the celebrated <i>Woman’s Bible</i> of Elizabeth Cady Stanton, a work usually credited as the first feminist interpretation of the Bible. The full title of Aguilar’s book amply describes her goals: <i>The Women of Israel or Characters and Sketches from the Holy Scriptures and Jewish History Illustrative of the Past History, Present Duty, and Future Destiny of the Hebrew Females, as Based on the Word of God.</i>
An English Jew of Converso/Spanish descent, Aguilar considered it her special task to encourage Jews, especially women, to go back to the Bible for sources of Jewish identity. She explicitly wanted to counter two troublesome issues: first, the view expressed in her time that “Christianity was the sole source of female excellence”; and second, the allegations that the Hebrew Bible shows how “the law of Moses sunk the Hebrew female to the lowest state of degradation.” Although Aguilar’s book is not technically a commentary, it examines all the major women in the Bible and also lingers on minor characters and obscure references to women. She hardly misses a note. For instance, she discusses the female workers of the Tabernacle (Exodus 38:8), Caleb’s daughter Achsah (Joshua 15:16–19; Judges 1:10–15), and laws concerning wives, widows, and female servants.
Aguilar cites the story about the Israelite slave girl who directs the foreigner Naaman to the prophet Elisha (II Kings 5) to advocate the training of Jewish women of all classes. After all, she argues, even lower-class women, such as this Israelite servant, were obviously educated religiously in ancient Israel! In her discussion of this episode as well as others, Aguilar’s attention to issues of class, religion, and gender is impressive and comports well with insights that are rediscovered today.
<i><b>In the last forty years, Jewish women have become truly visible as biblical interpreters.</b></i>
Aguilar was probably not the first Jewish woman to engage in the study of the Bible in a publicly influential way. From the Middle Ages, there is evidence of women scribes who copied biblical manuscripts, and some interpreters have suggested that Rashi’s daughters were important transmitters of his teachings. In addition, we know that in 1288, Paula Dei Mansi of Verona translated her father’s Bible commentaries from Hebrew into Italian, adding her own explanations as well (see <i>JPS Guide to Jewish Women,</i> 2003, p. III). But Aguilar is the first whose work is fully preserved and boldly made an impact.
In recent years, a book in Yiddish known as <i>Tzenah U-r’enah</i> (alternatively transliterated as <i>Tsenerene,</i> “Go Out and See”) has been touted as the first “feminist” Bible. The title alludes to the charge to women to go out and see (Song of Songs 3:11), thus suggesting that the intended audience was female; moreover the interpretations focus heavily on women. The book is a retelling of biblical tales. However, although the book frequently highlights stories concerning women, it cannot be claimed as an early feminist work or a “women’s Bible.” It aims to transmit and popularize selected traditional rabbinic teachings, and its author-compiler-translator was Rabbi Yaakov son of Isaac Ashkenazi, not a woman interpreter. Still, first published in the 16th century, this book became the most popular written source of Bible stories for the next two centuries, and it brought female characters in the Bible to the attention of generations of women and men who did not have access to texts in Hebrew.
Also from the Middle Ages there is evidence that Jewishly educated women in some prominent, learned families led other women in prayer and taught them songs and biblical passages; some wrote commentaries that were circulated privately among the family members but for reasons of modesty were not published.
Only since the last third of the 20th century, however, have Jewish women become truly visible in both the academic arena of biblical scholarship and in specifically Jewish circles. One need mention only Nehama Leibowitz and Sara Japhet—two Israeli scholars of unrivaled international reputation—to realize the great contribution that Jewish women have began to make to biblical studies. The late Nehama Leibowitz, widely acclaimed as one of the foremost Bible teachers in Israel, brought together classical rabbinic sources and traditional Jewish commentaries to help her students delve into Torah study (see her <i>Studies in Bereshit—Devarim,</i> 1976–1993). Sara Japhet’s impeccable biblical scholarship, especially her work on Chronicles and the Restoration Period, proved a milestone in the field of biblical studies, as recognized by the prestigious Israel Prize she was awarded in 2004. The impact of their work demonstrated the unquestionable quality and value of women’s contribution biblical studies and thereby opened the door for subsequent women scholars.
Neither Leibowitz nor Japhet identifies herself—or her approach—explicitly as feminist. Other scholars, such as the Israeli scholar Athalya Brenner, who edited 19 volumes of the <i>Feminist Companion to the Bible</i> (1993–2001), write as feminists but do not typically identify a specific Jewish agenda. Some, like the late Tikva Frymer-Kensky, explicitly combine both feminist and Jewish perspectives. The contributors to this <i>Commentary</i> reflect these different approaches and others as well.
Feminist scholars also vary in their perception of the Bible’s presentation of women and women’s interests. The first influential feminist study of the Bible in the late 20th century was “Depatriarchalizing in Biblical Interpretation” by the Protestant scholar Phyllis Trible (1973). Trible argues that key biblical texts do not promote patriarchal subordination of women but that later (mis)interpretations of them imposed such meanings on the Bible. She uses a literary approach that has since become widespread in biblical scholarship as a whole, influencing Jewish and feminist studies. The Jewish scholar Carol Meyers has employed a different approach to feminist scholarship, using her expertise in Bible and in archeology. Her groundbreaking work (which began in 1978 with “Roots of Restriction” and includes <i>Discovering Eve: Israelite Woman in Context,</i> 1988) incorporates social-scientific methodologies in order to uncover the roles and status of women in ancient Israel (see her introduction “Women in Ancient Israel—An Overview”). Her research suggests that in many respects the Bible reflects a high regard for women. Indeed, some interpreters argue that the Bible should be lauded as a resource for feminism and for women in general. In contrast, others argue that the Bible is detrimental to women and is best disregarded or opposed as a resource for women. In between these two perspectives, one finds a spectrum of views that acknowledge some problems in the Bible when it comes to the depiction and treatment of women and offer an array of responses for addressing those problems. (For a good survey of such positions, see Alice Ogden Bellis, <i>Helpmates, Harlots, and Heroes: Women’s Stories in the Hebrew Bible,</i> 1994.)
Interpreters of the Bible for whom this text carries defining authority, Jews and non-Jews alike, have developed a number of ways of responding to the seeming tension between feminist concerns and the Bible. In facing certain problematic passages, some interpreters hold the major messages of the Bible as key for determining the text’s authority; that is, central teachings are given greater weight over peripheral ones. For example, the story of the Exodus illustrates that God opposes the oppression of Israelites. Given that the Exodus story is foundational to Israel’s identity, those biblical teachings that conflict with the message of the Exodus by calling for the oppression of members of society are considered less authoritative. Thus, the command to love the resident alien because of the experience of slavery in Egypt (Leviticus 19:33–34) is used to challenge teachings elsewhere that disadvantage non-Israelites.
When confronting various troubling texts, some interpreters place the Bible in its own historical context and evaluate its perspectives in light of the ancient world to which the Bible responds. This approach thus distances those teachings from contemporary circumstances in which they may no longer seem to make sense. For instance, comparisons with other ancient Near Eastern legal collections provide perspective on the numerous laws about slavery in the Bible (see at Exodus 21:2–11). Likewise, evidence about surrogate motherhood in the ancient Near East helps the reader understand Sarah’s attempt to have a child through her handmaid and her subsequent treatment of Hagar (see at Genesis 16:1–6).
Others use contemporary modern or postmodern values to prioritize women’s experiences as a criterion to adjudicate between teachings that deserve allegiance and those that do not. Such an approach means that the interpreter refuses to grant authority to teachings that appear to degrade women or other persons. (See, for example, how Judith Plaskow responds to certain laws about sexuality and sanctity in her Contemporary Reflection on <i>parashat Acharei Mot</i>.)
In reproducing the variety of Torah interpretations, past and present, we envision our readers joining the centuries-old dialogue through their own personal and communal study. We hope that <i>The Torah: A Women’s Commentary</i> will inspire and invigorate a lifelong exploration that will go beyond these pages and will shape women and men in our communities well into the future. In this way, all of us will rightly pay tribute, at last, to the <i>torah</i> of our mothers and fathers.

Women in Ancient Israel; An Overview

 B<small>ECAUSE THE</small> T<small>ORAH</small>—the first five books of the Bible—is the center of Jewish liturgical life, our perception of Israelite women tends to be determined largely by what we read in the synagogue.* Yet women are mentioned throughout the Bible, and many passages in Prophets and Writings provide additional information about their lives. Still, the Bible alone is not a sufficient or adequate source for recovering the lives of Israelite women in the biblical period. For one thing, it deals more with national concerns and leaders than the lives of ordinary people; and even when addressing individuals, it focuses on the responsibilities and (mis)deeds of the male heads of the households in which most people lived. Men are thus mentioned far more often than are women. Moreover, much of the Bible originated in and reflects the urban setting of Jerusalem, whereas most Israelites lived in agrarian households in small villages or walled towns that were not true cities.
Fortunately, modern scholarship has been able to overcome many of these difficulties by using extra-biblical sources in addition to the biblical text. Archeological materials from Israelite sites—including dwellings, remnants of foodstuffs, tools and implements, tombs, jewelry, and ancient art—provide important data. Ethnographic studies of traditional cultures in the Middle East and elsewhere help us relate the archeological materials to various aspects of daily life in biblical antiquity. And anthropological models dealing with gender dynamics in premodern cultures allow us to understand the interactions of Israelite men and women and also the significance of women’s roles. In addition, texts from other ancient Near Eastern cultures can supplement or illumine the information in biblical texts. All together, these sources provide a fuller and more accurate view of the women of ancient Israel than could be obtained by using the Bible alone.
<i><b>Evidence negates the stereotype that women were confined to the household.</b></i>
<i><b>Marriage and Children</b></i>
The Hebrew noun <i>ishah</i> means both “woman” and “wife.” This signals the fact that a woman’s identity was virtually inseparable from her status as a married woman. It was inconceivable that a woman might willingly live on her own apart from a family; widows and divorcées often led precarious lives. Marriage was the norm for both women and men, but it was not usually the kind of love-based companionate relationship that is the ideal in the modern world (and in some biblical stories such as Rachel and Jacob in Genesis 29). Rather, it was a heterosexual pairing meant to provide offspring and thus assure generational continuity in the ownership of family land. The conjugal pair with their children would also constitute a work force sufficient to meet household needs in an agrarian society. In addition, adult children would be the ones to care for aging parents. Having children was a non-negotiable necessity.
The Bible does not have a term for “marriage” as such. The term <i>chatan,</i> translated “groom,” denotes a man with a father-in-law, thus indicating the conception of marriage as a union of two families. The Bible typically indicates the formation of a marital bond by saying that a man “takes” a woman. The courtship narrative of Rebekah, for example, culminates in the statement that Isaac “took Rebekah and she became his wife” (Genesis 24:67). This expression reflects the patrilocality of Israelite households. That is, a bride would move to the household of the groom, who usually continued to reside in the same household where he was raised. An extended family would thus be formed, although each constituent nuclear family might have its own abode within a family compound.
Financial arrangements generally accompanied marriage except among the poorest families. Although there are no “marriage laws” as such in the Bible, information in narratives indicates that a bride’s family typically provided a dowry, usually consisting of moveable property such as jewelry, clothing, and household utensils. In wealthier families, livestock and servants might also be included (see Genesis 24:59; 29:24, 29); and the groom and his family could supplement it (Genesis 24:53). The dowry theoretically remained the possession of the woman for the duration of the marriage, although her husband sometimes may have had access to it.
Another marital payment was made by the groom’s family to that of the bride. This betrothal gift, sometimes erroneously called “bride-price” (<i>mohar;</i> see Genesis 34:12; Exodus 22:15–16; I Samuel 18:25), has often been interpreted as evidence that a man purchased a woman. The fact that a word sometimes used for “husband” is <i>baal,</i> which can (but does not always) mean “master,” has also been adduced to claim that a woman was the property of her husband. And the use of the verb <i>kanah,</i> which can mean “to buy” but more generally “to acquire,” to describe Boaz’s marriage to Ruth (Ruth 4:10) has been similarly interpreted.
However, anthropological analysis of these exchanges shows that such assertions are flawed. Instead, the dowry and betrothal gift are understood to function in overlapping ways to maintain the viability of a family. The betrothal gift would provide some compensation to a woman’s family, which would lose the labor of a daughter upon her marriage. The dowry would constitute a woman’s economic safety net in the event of widowhood or divorce, especially if she had no sons or if her father was deceased. Moreover, the two payments together served to establish and solidify alliances between a woman’s natal family and her marital one. Such connections were important in agrarian communities; they increased the likelihood of mutual aid in the event of economic or other difficulties, not unusual in Israelite households living in marginal environments. Thus betrothal and dowry payments together had important economic, social, and legal functions.
To say that a husband did not own his wife is not to claim that there was equality between spouses. Perhaps the greatest gender asymmetry was in the area of sexuality. The patrilineal nature of Israelite society, with land and property transferred across generations via the male line, is likely the reason for the stringency of biblical legal precepts dealing with female sexuality. A woman’s fiancé and then her husband had exclusive rights to her sexuality; and her parents guarded it before betrothal. Her virginity at marriage was valued, at least in part, as a means of assuring the groom of his paternity of his bride’s first child. For similar reasons, women and men are treated differently in biblical adultery laws (Leviticus 20:10; Deuteronomy 22:22–28), where sex between a married man and an unmarried woman is discouraged but not proscribed. Concern for heirs is also a factor in the institution known as levirate marriage, in which a childless widow would marry her deceased husband’s brother, with the first child (or son, according to some interpreters) produced by that liaison considered the dead man’s heir (Deuteronomy 25:5–10; see the narrative of Tamar in Genesis 38). The case of the daughters of Zelophehad (Numbers 26:33; 27:1–11; 36:1–12) would seem to modulate the absolute nature of Israelite patrilineal inheritance; note, however, that in that case, inheritance of land by daughters is accompanied subsequently by provisions that the land would remain within the clan (Numbers 36).
The existence of polygyny (more than one wife) in ancient Israel, as in other Near Eastern lands, must also be understood in light of powerful communal interest in stabilizing households by transmitting property to biological heirs. The multiple wives of a monarch (such as David and Solomon) signified his high status and his ability to establish political alliances with diplomatic marriages, and wealthy individuals had several wives as a sign of affluence. But in most instances a man took a second wife or a concubine when the first wife failed to produce offspring. The Genesis narratives give the impression that polygyny was common. However, shorter life spans for women than for men, which meant a shortage of women of childbearing age, and the fact that most people probably lived near the poverty level, would have precluded polygyny for all but the wealthy. Indeed, many biblical texts, such as Genesis 2:24, the Song of Songs, several passages in wisdom literature, and even legal rulings such as Exodus 21:4–5, reflect a monogamous norm.
Although dissolution of a marriage was sometimes unavoidable, very little is known about provisions for divorce. Malachi 2:14 refers to a marriage contract, and Isaiah 50:1 mentions a bill of divorce, indicating that formal documents were used for establishing and dissolving a marriage, although probably only for people of means. The sole biblical text with divorce rulings, Deuteronomy 24:1–4, addresses a particular situation, the case of a man seeking to remarry a woman to whom he had once been married. Unfortunately, it gives the impression that only men could initiate divorce in the biblical period. However, that notion can be contested in light of the narrative of a Levite’s secondary wife leaving him (Judges 19:2) and because the Elephantine papyri, which are documents from a community founded by Judeans in Egypt in the 6th century <small>B.C.E.,</small> mention a woman divorcing her husband.
<i><b>Women in Household Life</b></i>
It would be incorrect to assume, on the basis of gender asymmetry in matters of sexuality, that women were subordinate to and dominated by men in all other aspects of life. Indeed, with few resources available from outside the household, the relationship between a woman and her husband was one of interdependence and complementarity in most household functions. As the primary social and economic unit, the family household was the locus of all the activities, in addition to procreation, that were necessary for the maintenance and continuity of life. Family life was task-oriented; without the labor of both women and men, and also children, survival in the marginal habitat of the Israelite highlands would not have been possible. But in meeting a household’s economic, educational, and religious needs, the responsibilities of all family members were not the same. The division of labor by gender, albeit with some overlap, was the most efficient way to accomplish the myriad household tasks.
In the contemporary world we tend to think of households as private realms, distinct from the public, male-dominated arena. However, this private-public dichotomy is based on the structure of large, industrialized societies and is not an accurate characterization of small, premodern agrarian communities, where the boundaries between households and the larger communities in which they were enmeshed were blurred. Both men and women, although probably in different ways, took part in the discussions and decisions affecting community life that took place within most households. Realizing this, along with recognizing the significant household roles of women as described below, helps us understand the folly of referring to Israelite women as “only wives and mothers.”
<i>Economic Roles.</i> Women’s economic roles were manifold and complex. Women sometimes participated in the male-dominated tasks of growing grains and tending orchards and vineyards, especially in labor-intensive harvest periods (see Ruth 2:2–9). They also had their own agricultural activities, especially the cultivation of garden vegetables and herbs. Both genders shared in the care of livestock and of work animals. However, women’s major contributions to the household economy were the time-consuming food- and fiber-processing jobs. They transformed agricultural products into edible and wearable forms through their expertise and labor.
Cereal crops, the most important food source in the biblical period, provided an estimated 50% of a person’s daily calories. A series of arduous processes, including grinding and kneading, were necessary to make grains edible. It is estimated that three hours of work would have been required each day to produce enough bread or gruel for an average family of six. Women, with the help of older children, not only produced bread but also processed and prepared many other foodstuffs, mainly fruits, vegetables, legumes, and dairy products. Some of these were eaten raw; but many were variously churned, pressed, pickled, roasted, or dried on a seasonal basis. Meat would have been eaten rarely, probably only at festivals.
Several positive features offset the onerous nature of women’s food preparation responsibilities. Unlike male crop-growing tasks, in which yields could be drastically affected by periodic droughts or infestations of insects, food preparation always yielded a finished product. Thus, women would have experienced a consistent sense of accomplishment from their daily work. Another source of gratification lay in a woman’s mastery of the considerable technical skills required by the diverse food-processing procedures.
Social and political aspects added to the individual benefits, for women, of food preparation. Archeologists often find grinding tools in clusters in Israelite dwellings. This indicates that women from neighboring households gathered together, undoubtedly to chat and sing during the long hours spent preparing grains and other foods. The time spent together helped forge women into informal social networks in a way that the more solitary tasks performed by men did not. These networks constituted a social safety net—women would know of an illness or emergency in a neighboring household and would find ways to help. These networks also operated on a political level; women gained and shared information that influenced community decisions made by male officials. Such indirect female political power is typically unrecognized but nonetheless real.
Women had other economic roles. They concocted potions and salves from wild or homegrown herbs and plants to use in folk remedies. Although rural households did procure sophisticated terracotta vessels and metal implements from urban workshops, some village women likely produced simple ceramic pots and stone grinding tools for everyday use. However, the most important household activity besides food processing was textile production, perhaps because of its potential for commercial activity beyond the household (see Proverbs 31:13, 24).
Archeologists have discovered tools—spindle whorls, loom weights, weaving shuttles, and needles—that testify to the production of fabrics in Israelite households. Like the steps involved in grain processing, the procedures for making textiles were often time-consuming and tedious. It takes several hours of spinning, for example, to produce the amount of yarn or thread needed for an hour of weaving. Women in pre-modern cultures typically do textile work together; indeed, some of the tasks are done most efficiently by women working in tandem. The personal, social, and political benefits accruing to women as food-producers were intensified by their experience of working together to make garments and coverings for their families and perhaps also for barter or sale.
<i>Educational and Managerial Roles.</i> The primary care of young children was the mother’s responsibility. Child care was integrated into a woman’s daily routines, no doubt with the assistance of older children and elderly parents. Women were assisted in most household tasks by their children; and they supervised offspring of both genders until boys were old enough to accompany their fathers into the fields. Fathers surely taught sons the tasks and activities performed mainly by men. Because there were no schools in the biblical period, except perhaps for a small number of upper-class urban youth, women were the chief educators and socializers of both boys and girls in their early years, and for girls into adolescence.
Women as educators are not very visible in the Bible, where the mention of sages and elders gives the impression of a male monopoly in teaching skills and inculcating traditional practices and beliefs. However, an understanding of the dynamics of an agrarian household indicates the prominence of women in this role, which involved instruction in the technologies of household life, in appropriate behavior, and also in the transmission of culture and values more generally. The frequent parallelism of “mother” and “father” in the book of Proverbs (1:8; 4:3; 6:20; 15:20; 19:26; 20:20; 23:22, 25; 28:24; 30:11, 17) indicates that both parents taught their children. Proverbs 31:1 singles out King Lemuel’s mother as the source of his instruction.
Because women had more contact hours with children, their interactions with offspring were essential for transmitting many aspects of Israelite culture from one generation to the next. The very notion of “wisdom,” which includes technical expertise as well as social sagacity, has important female aspects, arguably rooted in the broad role of women in caring for and socializing their children. Note that the wisdom is frequently personified as a woman in Proverbs (1:20–33; 3:13–18; 4:5–9; 7:4–5; 8:1–36; 9:1–6; 14:1). Also, the “strong woman” <i>(eshet chayil</i>) of Proverbs 31 is characterized as speaking wisdom and teaching kindness (v. 26). And two narratives feature an <i>ishah chachamah</i> (“wise woman”; II Samuel 14:1–20; 20:14–22).
A woman’s educative role involved more than the instruction of children. In the complex, multigenerational Israelite households, older women served as household managers, instructing (depending upon the household’s particular composition) daughters, daughters-in-law, nieces, slaves, servants, and other dependents in the array of women’s tasks, as well as in appropriate behavior. The fifth commandment (Exodus 20:12; Deuteronomy 5:16) and the parent laws of Exodus 21:15, 17 and Leviticus 20:9, which were likely concerned with the behavior of adult children in multi-generational households, underscore the authority of both parents over both female and male offspring. In contrast, other ancient Near Eastern societies apparently favored men over women in assigning parental authority. Another indication of female authority in household life is the fact that mothers predominate in the Bible as the ones who name their children.
In light of women’s extensive educative and managerial roles, the appearance of the phrase “mother’s household” <i>(beit eim)</i> rather than the usual “father’s household” (<i>beit av)</i> several times in the Bible is noteworthy. “Mother’s household” appears in several women-centered texts (Genesis 24:28; Ruth 1:8; Songs 3:4; 8:2; see also Proverbs 14:1) and suggests that women controlled most internal household activities (as does Rebekah, Genesis 27:5–17; and the woman of Shunem, II Kings 4:8–37; 8:1–6), whereas men dealt with suprahousehold, lineage-related matters. Near Eastern documents attest to the managerial authority of royal women over certain aspects of palace life; women in ordinary households would likely have had similar control on a smaller scale, especially if there were slaves or servants in their households. Thus a senior woman would have had some authority over male servitors as well as over children, as when the woman of Shunem gives instructions to “her [male] servant” (II Kings 4:24).
<i>Religious Roles.</i> Women also had major roles in household religious life. Biblical texts focus on national and communal practices yet reveal that family celebrations punctuated the annual religious calendar. For example, Passover in its origins was likely a home-based spring festival involving specific kinds of food preparation; the other major festivals, similarly grounded in the agricultural calendar, no doubt involved family feasting. Household Sabbath traditions are difficult to trace back to the biblical period; but the story of the manna provisions for the seventh day (Exodus 16:21–30), as well as post-biblical sources, indicate festal meals on the seventh day. The food component of festivals and Sabbath is inconceivable without female culinary expertise and labor.
Women also participated in celebrations at shrines near their homes and even initiated cultic activity. The Hannah narrative (I Samuel 1–2) is instructive in this regard. The childless Hannah journeys regularly with her family to the cultic center of Shiloh to share in an annual sacrificial offering; she comes “before יהוה” to make a vow in the hope of ending her barrenness; and later, having given birth to Samuel, she fulfills her vow by bringing sacrificial offerings to Shiloh. Also, several passages in Deuteronomy (12:12; 16:11, 14; 31:10–12) are gender inclusive in their instructions for bringing sacrifices and celebrating at the central shrine, although in other texts (Exodus 23:17; Deuteronomy 16:16) only men are specifically required to do so. Finally, dozens of priestly passages use the common-gender term <i>nefesh,</i> indicating that both women and men were commanded to offer certain sacrifices (see Leviticus 2:1 and Numbers 5:6–10).
In addition to family festivals and communal celebrations and sacrifices mentioned in the Bible, certain household religious activities—carried out <i>only</i> by women—are known from archeological and ethnographic evidence. These practices, which are related to childbearing, may well have been the most important part of women’s religious lives. Women in pre-modern cultures typically cope with the many problems related to reproduction, which today would be handled by medicine, through behaviors that might now be considered “magic” but were clearly religious in nature. Facing the possibility of barrenness, childbirth complications, difficulty in lactation, and high infant mortality rates (for as many as one in two infants did not survive to the age of five), Israelite women carried out various practices meant not only to keep away the evil spirits thought to cause problems but also to attract benevolent ones believed to bring reproductive success. Many of these practices—such as wearing amulets to avert the “evil eye,” tying a red thread around the limb of a newborn, keeping a light burning in a birthing or sleeping room, salting and swaddling a newborn (see Ezekiel 16:4)—continued into the post-biblical period and are found in Jewish, Christian, and Muslim families well into the 20th century.
These household religious activities, which focused on the welfare of their families and dealt with life-and-death matters, would have been empowering. Women were ritual experts in household practice much as priests were at the Temple, for they possessed the requisite knowledge to perform rituals in a prescribed and, they believed, efficacious way. Moreover, household rituals dealing with childbirth were carried out <i>for</i> women <i>by</i> women, including neighbors, relatives, and sometimes midwives (I Samuel 4:20; see also Ruth 4:13–17) in intimate settings that further contributed to female bonding and solidarity. Women’s religious practices were profoundly important components of their adult lives.
<i><b>Professional Women</b></i>
Women in the Bible appear in nearly twenty different community roles beyond those we often associate with the household. These particular roles correspond in a large measure to what we know about women’s lives from extra-biblical sources. These professional activities are noteworthy because they show that some Israelite women did hold professional positions that served their communities directly, thus negating the notion that women were confined to the household (a stereotype itself in that it often conjures the household in contemporary terms rather than a household as a pre-modern locus of economic and social power).
The role mentioned most frequently is prostitution, perhaps a recourse for marginalized women unable to support themselves in any other way. This occupation is condemned in priestly texts but viewed matter-of-factly in the narratives about Rahab, the heroic prostitute of Jericho (Joshua 2, 5), and about the two women who brought their dispute to Solomon (I Kings 3:16–28).
Other roles were much less controversial and contributed in important ways to Israelite communities. Women practiced trades or crafts, working in palace workshops to produce items (perfume, food, baked goods) for the royal family or state events (I Samuel 8:13) and to produce fabrics for religious shrines (Exodus 35:25; II Kings 23:7). Some women marketed textiles produced at home (Proverbs 31:24); and the archeological discovery of women’s stamp seals, which were used for commercial transactions, attests to female activity in the business world. According to Nehemiah 3:12, women were construction workers in the post-exilic effort to rebuild the walls of Jerusalem. Women served in the communication arena as couriers, usually carrying dispatches from women to other women (Proverbs 9:3–4) but occasionally bearing messages between men (II Samuel 17:17); and they were heralds, making announcements to the wider public (Isaiah 40:9; Psalm 68:12). Women served as midwives; they assist Rachel and Tamar in childbirth, and the midwives Shiphrah and Puah are heroes of the Exodus narrative. Wet-nurses are also mentioned, usually only for elites; Rebekah has one, as probably did most princes (II Kings 11:2–3), with Moses’ own mother (Jochebed) hired to nurse him.
Midwives were also religious specialists, since prayers and potions are part of the culture of childbirth in traditional societies. Other female religious specialists included minor temple servitors (Exodus 38:8; I Samuel 2:22). Some female religious specialists are condemned, as in the gender-inclusive denunciations of various kinds of divination (including consulting the dead) in Leviticus (19:31; 20:6, 27) and Deuteronomy (18:10–11), a sure sign that women’s divinatory services were being utilized. Although necromancy is condemned, I Samuel 28:7–25 depicts a female medium consulting the dead Samuel for King Saul effectively and without the narrator’s criticism. Women also in some cases were perceived as sorcerers and are specifically censured as such (Exodus 22:17; see also Isaiah 57:3). The prophet Ezekiel reviles women performing a Temple ritual (8:14–15) as well as a group of female prophets engaged in divination (13:17–23). But other women prophets are heroic figures. Two of the most prominent women in the Bible, Miriam and Deborah, are called prophets (Exodus 15:20; Judges 4:4), as are Huldah, the first person to rule on the authenticity of a text as God’s word (II Kings 22:14–20), and Noadiah, a leader of the postexilic community (Nehemiah 6:14).
Other female professionals, less explicitly religious, include Deborah in her role as a resolver of disputes and as a charismatic military leader (“judge”), and the “wise women” of Tekoa and Abel, who help resolve national crises. The wives of kings managed palace-related tasks; and a few also exercised political power, some even bearing a title (<i>g’virah</i>) signifying that they were royal functionaries (see I Kings 15:13 and II Kings 10:13). Female musicians led the celebrations for military victories attributed to divine intervention (Exodus 15:21; I Samuel 18:6–7; Psalm 68:26; Jeremiah 31:4, 13); their performances reflect a women’s musical genre that involved drumming, dancing, and singing. Other women are mentioned as professional singers (II Samuel 19:36; Ezra 2:65; Nehemiah 7:67; Ecclesiastes 2:8) and perhaps even Temple singers (I Chronicles 25:5–6). Also, as in many traditional societies, women more than men were experts in mourning rituals (Jeremiah 9:16–19; Ezekiel 32:16).
Recognizing women’s community roles has important implications for understanding the lives of the women engaged in these occupations. Many of these professional specialists, including musicians and singers, mourning women, “wise women,” and even midwives and prophets, functioned in groups or were connected to each other in guild-like associations. The “daughters” learning dirges in Jeremiah 9:19 and wailing over Saul in II Samuel 1:24 are analogous to “sons” in the phrase “sons [or: company, disciples] of the prophets” (as in II Kings 5:22; 6:1); they constituted a guild (loosely speaking) of professional mourning women. The existence of other such groups can safely be assumed; informal organizations of women with technical expertise in certain areas, such as birthing or healing, are widely found in pre-modern cultures, including Israel’s neighbors. These women would have gathered occasionally to share knowledge, train new members, and, in the case of musical professions, compose songs and rehearse in preparation for performances.
Membership in such groups, which typically are organized hierarchically with senior or more talented members earning the respect of the others, provided women with opportunities to experience prestige and status. Also, whether they functioned in groups or as individuals, female professionals provided services to their communities, thereby reaping the benefits of contributing to the public weal. It is noteworthy that societies in which women have rich opportunities for extra-household association with each other are generally considered the least repressive with respect to gender.
Finally, the existence of such groups, with their own hierarchies, calls into question the very notion (held by some readers today) of ancient Israel as completely patriarchal, with women dominated by men. As in every society, there were multiple loci of power in ancient Israel. Women’s professional services and groups, along with the informal networks of women in neighboring households (described above) and the senior wife’s managerial authority within the household (described above), cut across the maledominated hierarchies that prevailed in other aspects of family and community life. Recognizing these three aspects of ancient Israelite society allows a more nuanced reading of Israelite women’s lives.

Women and Postbiblical Commentary

J<small>EWS HAVE TRADITIONALLY BELIEVED</small> that each of the books that comprise the Hebrew Bible reflects God’s word in some way. As a “religion of the book,” Judaism has looked to these revealed writings for guidance in every aspect of human life. Yet a religion based upon static texts, however holy, cannot easily adjust to the ever-varying conditions of human life. That Judaism has endured is due, in large part, to our traditions of biblical interpretation. In every generation, expositors of the divine message have discovered new meanings in the Hebrew Scriptures and demonstrated their relevance to an ever-evolving Jewish community.
For each parashah, <i>The Torah: A Women’s Commentary</i> includes a section titled Post-biblical Interpretations. Rabbinic biblical commentaries, written from the 3rd through the 19th centuries, have played a central role in shaping how Jews have understood the Torah. Like <i>The Torah: A Women’s Commentary,</i> these interpretations endeavored to keep biblical teachings alive, relevant, and compelling. The authors of our Post-biblical Interpretations have chosen from this vast treasury those passages that they believe will illuminate our contemporary understandings of biblical texts. Wherever possible, these selections focus on female characters and larger issues concerning women in Jewish law and Jewish life.
This essay presents an historical overview of the Jewish commentaries and commentators cited in the Post-biblical Interpretations sections.
<i><b>Written Torah and Oral Torah</b></i>
Jewish biblical interpretation is already present in the Bible, since later biblical books often (directly or indirectly) interpret earlier writings. Following the destruction of the Second Temple (70 <small>C.E.</small>), textual scholars and interpreters, generally referred to as “the Rabbis,” emerged as Jewish spiritual leaders. During the rabbinic period (from the beginning of the Common Era to the end of the 6th century), much of their intellectual endeavors concentrated on recording, preserving, and expanding the biblical interpretations that they deemed essential for the conduct of day-to-day Jewish life.
<i><b>The Rabbis adapted the Bible to their own world—a society oriented toward men.</b></i>
The word “<i>torah</i>” can be understood broadly as “teaching” or “revelation.” Rabbinic teachers enlarged the meaning of Torah itself to include the entire body of rabbinic interpretive literature. Thus, “Written Torah” came to refer to the Bible, and “Oral Torah” became a designation for the voluminous rabbinic texts that grew up around the Bible. The oral tradition of Torah interpretation assumed the sanctity and inviolability of the written word. The Rabbis taught that both components of divine revelation were delivered to the people of Israel at Mt. Sinai and subsequently passed down through later prophets and other recognized authoritative figures (Mishnah <i>Avot</i> 1).
Rabbinic interpretation begins with the premise that Torah in all of its parts, both written and oral, is of divine origin and authority. Sometimes God’s will is evident in the plain sense of the words, what is called the <i>p’shat.</i> This term refers to the contextual meaning of a biblical passage that is evident through a straightforward reading of a text. More frequently, the Rabbis believed, the actual import of biblical words can be discerned only by those who know how to penetrate to the <i>d’rash,</i> the deeper sense that lies beneath the surface. They sought to discover and elucidate those inner meanings, and in this way they maintained continuity with the past while adapting law to the changing conditions of the present and the needs of the future.
<i><b>Rabbinic Literature</b></i>
The rabbinic method of biblical interpretation is called <i>midrash,</i> frequently translated as “exposition” or “elucidation.” There are two types of midrash, legal and non-legal. Legal midrash contains a composite of ceremonial ordinances, ritual teachings, ethical rulings, and civil, criminal, and domestic laws that generally find their origin in a biblical statement or commandment. Since biblical laws are often vague or incomplete, rabbinic elaboration provides the details to allow for their implementation in a variety of particular situations. As later generations sought to follow the laws and teaching of the Bible, many topics required elucidation, such as the proper way of keeping Shabbat or how to solemnize a marriage or write a bill of divorce. Thus, rabbinic law enlarged and clarified the biblical text, applying scriptural principles and contemporary practices to an ever-broader variety of cases, while also considering a greater number of contingencies.
The other type of rabbinic biblical interpretation is non-legal in nature and includes expansions of biblical narratives, folktales, and anecdotes about the Rabbis themselves. These rabbinic writings also contain homilies (sermons) that teach religious beliefs and ethical behavior, and that comfort the downcast of Israel with promises of future redemption. Convinced that biblical texts contained neither contradiction nor repetition, the Rabbis creatively exercised their interpretive powers to demonstrate that this was so. Most of the “Post-biblical Interpretations” in this volume focus on this second type of interpretation, known as <i>midrash aggadah.</i>
Eventually, the Rabbis collected what is known as the “Oral Torah” into compilations that preserve competing interpretations and opinions; while majority views are generally honored, minority opinions are recorded as well. These complex texts interweave traditions, motifs, and influences from a variety of sources, time periods, and diverse environments, reflective of the extended duration of their composition and editing. Those texts from the Land of Israel incorporated and responded to Greco-Roman and early Christian cultural influences. Other texts were shaped in the very different world of mostly pre-Islamic Iraq, known in Jewish tradition as Babylon. The main collections are the Mishnah and the Talmud (usually cited as BT or JT, see below for details).
<i><b>Women in Rabbinic Writings</b></i>
The shapers and expositors of rabbinic Judaism were men, and the ideal human society that they imagined was decidedly oriented towards men. Nevertheless, women were a part of these men’s lives and a number of rabbinic writings address issues involving women. An entire division of the key rabbinic texts, the Mishnah and Talmuds, is entitled <i>Nashim</i> (“Women”), and its seven tractates deal with women in their legal relationships to men in matters of betrothal, marriage, levirate marriage, divorce, suspected adultery, and women’s limited ability to make vows of various kinds. Another section, <i>Niddah</i> (“The Menstruating Woman”), one of the twelve tractates in the division <i>Tohorot</i> (“Ritual Purity”), is mainly concerned with strict definitions of female impurity during and after menstruation and following childbirth, in order to prevent communication of this ritual impurity to men.
With few exceptions, female voices are not heard in rabbinic literature. When they are, they are usually mediated through rabbinic assumptions about women’s lesser intellectual, spiritual, and moral capacities, reflecting set views of women’s appropriate roles in life, which were believed to differ from those of men. Rabbinic texts do not grant women a significant role in any aspect of rabbinic Judaism’s communal life of leadership, study, and worship. Neither women’s religious rituals—which undoubtedly existed—nor female understandings of their lives, experiences, and spirituality are retrievable in any significant way from rabbinic Judaism’s androcentric writings that became so central to a millennium-and-a-half of Jewish existence. From rabbinic literature alone, a reader would never know, for example, that in various parts of the Roman Empire, some Jewish women held leadership roles in synagogue life and other public arenas. (Archeological evidence shows that such was the case in the first six or seven centuries of the Common Era. Some of the women involved, who appear to have been independent and wealthy, may have been converts to Judaism. See Bernadette Brooten, <i>Women Leaders in the Ancient Synagogue,</i> 1982.)
In their interpretive writings, the Rabbis praised biblical women who played central roles in the destiny of the people of Israel, including the matriarchs (<i>imahot</i>). According to the Babylonian Talmud (abbreviated as BT), Sarah, Miriam, Deborah, Hannah, Abigail, Huldah, and Esther have the status of prophets <i>(M'gillah</i> 14a); and the midrash collection <i>B’reishit Rabbah</i> declared that all four mothers of Israel were prophets (67.9 and 72.6). The Rabbis also lauded the women whose supportive roles in the domestic realm enabled husbands and sons to participate in public worship and communal study. For example, they extol Rachel, wife of Rabbi Akiva, as an exemplary woman who sacrificed her own comfort for her husband’s scholarship (Judith Baskin, <i>Midrashic Women,</i> 2002, pp. 101–3). On the other hand, the Rabbis condemned as immodest women who appeared unveiled in public or gathered in groups with other women, or those whose voices the Rabbis considered too strident. Similarly, some sages criticized women who asserted themselves as public leaders. Thus, the Babylonian Talmud goes on to denigrate the judge Deborah as a hornet and the prophet Hulda as a weasel (the meaning of their respective names), since they held powerful positions usually associated with men (<i>M’gillah</i> 14b; Baskin, <i>Midrashic Women,</i> 2002, pp. 31–32, 109–14, 140–54).
The <i>midrash</i> about Rahab the harlot is a good example of the creative and transformative powers of rabbinic commentary when applied positively to a biblical woman. Rahab appears in Joshua 2 as a prostitute who lived independently in the city of Jericho. She is a righteous woman who hides Joshua’s two spies in her house and saves them from capture. According to Joshua 2:9–11, Rahab recognizes the overwhelming power of God and foresees the future victory of Israel.
The Rabbis taught that Rahab became a convert to Judaism; and her statement of faith in Joshua 2:11 earned her the highest place among all biblical proselytes (<i>M’chilta Amalek</i> 3; <i>D’varim Rabbah</i> 2.26–27). A midrash recounts that she became the ancestor of priests and prophets in Israel (<i>B’midbar Rabbah</i> 8.9). According to the Rabbis, Joshua himself married her. Thus, his illustrious descendants were also hers (BT <i>M’gillah</i> 14b). (On how priests and prophets could be descended from a non-Israelite prostitute, see <i>Sifrei B’midbar</i> 78 and the discussion in Baskin, <i>Midrashic Women,</i> 2002, pp. 154–60.) Her rabbinic rehabilitation as a wife and mother demonstrates how the Rabbis preferred to imagine women, even as it provides a firm precedent for our own contemporary reconstructions of biblical women and men in ways that reveal meanings from the ancient text that speak to our own lives and concerns.
Rabbinic literature also preserves anecdotes about contemporaneous admirable women. These include Imma Shalom (1st century <small>C.E.),</small> whose husband was Rabbi Eliezer ben Hyrcanus and whose brother was the Patriarch Gamliel II (BT <i>Shabbat</i> 116a, BT <i>Bava M’tzia</i> 59b); she mediated a bitter quarrel between those two men. Traditions associated with Beruriah (2nd century <small>C.E.),</small> whose father and husband were rabbis, acknowledge the possibility of a learned female. A number of passages depict Beruriah as having a profound knowledge of rabbinic biblical exegesis and outstanding intelligence (for instance, BT <i>P’sachim</i> 62b, BT <i>B’rachot</i> 10a, and BT <i>Eiruvin</i> 53b–54a). However, beyond one very early attribution, which is repeated nowhere else, no actual legal rulings are ever credited to her (Tosefta <i>Keilim, Bava M’tzia</i> 1:6). Moreover, Beruriah’s reputed scholarly expertise became a problem for rabbinic Judaism. In a medieval reference, which may reflect earlier sources, she reaps the tragic consequences of the “light-mindedness” supposedly inherent in women. Rashi (see below) relates a tradition that Beruriah was seduced by one of her husband’s students and subsequently committed suicide (Rashi’s commentary on BT <i>Avodah Zarah</i> 18b; Baskin, <i>Midrashic Women</i>, 2002, pp. 81–83).
Seven aggadic narratives in the Babylonian Talmud discuss Yalta, an aristocratic Jewish woman of notable learning who exercised significant communal authority in the Jewish community in Babylon. Clearly, the Rabbis were aware of women like Yalta whose strong personalities, control of significant financial resources, and exalted lineage afforded them far more communal respect and power than ordinary women could imagine. While several of the stories about Yalta report her ability to act independently against Jewish rabbinic and political rulings when necessary, at least two of the anecdotes (BT <i>Kiddushin</i> 70a–b and BT <i>B’rachot</i> 51b) demonstrate a rabbinic desire to curtail such female pretensions to independence and power (Baskin, <i>Midrashic Women,</i> 2002, pp. 83–87).
<i><b>Why Rabbinic Literature Is Included Here</b></i>
The Rabbis adapted the Hebrew Bible to their own circumstances and attitudes, but always with the conviction that they were proceeding with divine authority. The traditions they established about the inappropriateness of women’s presence in the communal domains of worship, study, and leadership were continued, with few exceptions, in medieval and early modern Judaism. They persist in some Jewish communities up to the present day. Although the patriarchal approach toward women that is typical of rabbinic and medieval biblical commentary was never unique to the Jewish community, the consequences of this attitude have been long lasting in stifling female intellectual, spiritual, and leadership roles in Judaism. Contemporary women may well ask what this androcentric literature, written and transmitted by men, has to offer and why they should read it. Why have we included “Post-biblical Interpretations” in this volume at all?
For one thing, this complex and multifaceted literature is a rich part of our Jewish heritage. The Rabbis and later exegetes were profoundly immersed in biblical literature and had considered deeply its wide range of meanings and possible applications. The many dimensions they read into and out of the biblical text over the centuries have shaped the course of Jewish intellectual and spiritual history—and continue to amaze and enlighten us today. Moreover, rabbinic exegesis has always been sensitive to the multilayered and multivocal qualities of the Hebrew Scriptures. While the majority of exegetical teachings about women’s intellectual capacities and public roles tend to be negative, differing points of view have also been preserved. One example that acknowledges the injustice of arbitrary limitations on female roles appears in the midrash collection <i>Sifrei Numbers</i> 133, in a discussion of the redoubtable daughters of Zelophehad (Numbers 26): “The compassion of God is not like human compassion. Human rulers favor males over females but the One who spoke and brought the world into being is not like that. Rather, God shows mercy to every living thing” (see <i>parashat Pinchas</i>). Thus, our commentary includes “Post-biblical Interpretations” because they are part of our legacy of Oral Torah, because they have a great deal to teach us about biblical writings, and because they represent the diverse points of view that have always been a part of the way Jews read the Torah.
When thinking about women, it is especially important that we pay attention to this immense body of post-biblical interpretive literature which is a central part of Jewish tradition. Contemporary interpretations of Jewish texts have played a leading role in bringing about positive changes in women’s status in Judaism and in the larger world, and in enlarging women’s access to the realms of Jewish learning. Indeed, the many scholars who have contributed “Post-biblical Interepretations” to this volume demonstrate that women are now expert in rabbinic writings. As educated women and men advocate for a Judaism that is egalitarian and forward looking, it is essential that we become knowledgeable about all aspects of our heritage and build on those teachings of the past.
<i><b>Documents of Rabbinic Judaism</b></i>
The Mishnah is the earliest written document of rabbinic Judaism. It is a legal compilation based on biblical law, actual practice, and spiritual vision. This work, edited in the early 3rd century <small>C.E.</small>, is written in Hebrew and is organized according to six subject divisions, which are further separated into a total of sixty-three tractates. The Tosefta, generally held to be a slightly later collection of legal rulings, follows the order of the Mishnah and supplements it. These works are attributed to the rabbinic sages from the 1st to 3rd centuries <small>C.E.</small> In the following centuries, rabbinic scholars in the land of Israel and in Babylonia (today’s Iraq) produced extensive commentaries on the Mishnah, known as Gemara. Much of the Gemara is written in Aramaic, a language close to Hebrew that was dominant in Western Asia in that period. In the 6th century <small>C.E.,</small> the Mishnah and this more extensive Gemara were combined and edited by several generations of Rabbis to form the Babylonian Talmud (cited here as BT). This work became the definitive compilation of Jewish law and tradition for many centuries to come. The Talmud of the Land of Israel (cited here as JT), completed at the end of the 4th century <small>C.E.,</small> although less comprehensive than the Babylonian Talmud, also became an important part of the larger body of rabbinic literature.
Parallel to the Mishnah, Tosefta, and Talmuds are midrash collections that either provide a running commentary on a specific biblical book or are organized according to cycles of scriptural readings. These midrash compilations, typically named after biblical books (for example, <i>B’reishit Rabbah,</i> also known as <i>Genesis Rabbah),</i> are mainly in Hebrew and share numerous interpretations and rulings in common with the Mishnah and Talmuds. The dates of composition for these midrashic documents extend from the period of the Mishnah into the early Middle Ages and are often difficult to determine with any exactitude.
<i><b>Medieval Biblical Interpretation</b></i>
During the medieval period (from 600 <small>C.E.</small> to 1500 <small>C.E.</small>), many important biblical commentaries were written by scholars throughout the Jewish world. Several of these exegetes are cited in the “Post-biblical Interpretations” entries in this volume. The most famous medieval commentator is Rabbi Solomon ben Isaac (known by the acronym Rashi), who lived in France between 1040 and 1105. Best known for his commentaries on both the Babylonian Talmud and most of the biblical books, Rashi’s exegesis has long been admired for its clarity and for his attention to the <i>p’shat</i> or contextual meaning of a biblical passage. Only after he had explicated the plain sense of a text as he understood it, did Rashi turn to <i>d’rash,</i> using <i>midrash aggadah</i> to expand his readers’ understanding of the Bible. Rashi had only daughters and they were apparently well educated. Most of his grandsons became important interpreters of Jewish texts.
Rabbi Abraham Ibn Ezra (died 1165), a native of Spain whose first language was Arabic, is often considered the most original of medieval Jewish biblical interpreters. He composed commentaries on all the biblical books, as well as Hebrew poetry and works on astronomy and science. As a scientist and philosopher, Ibn Ezra used his knowledge of Hebrew and Arabic grammar to demonstrate the contextual meaning (<i>p’shat</i>) of biblical words and phrases; he had little interest in the elaborations of <i>midrash aggadah</i> that appealed so much to Rashi. His approach to the Bible is in many ways a precursor to modern biblical scholarship. Another important Spanish exegete was Rabbi Moses ben Nachman (1194–1270), also known as Nachmanides or by his acronym, Ramban. He lived most of his life near Barcelona, spending his final days in the Land of Israel. He is well known for his commentary on the five books of the Torah and for the strong influence from Jewish mysticism that infuses his interpretation.
The <i>Mikraot G’dolot</i> (“Rabbinic Bible”) became a popular repository of medieval biblical commentary for later generations. Published with the vocalized text of the Bible, an Aramaic translation, and selected Masoretic notes, the typical volume of <i>Mikraot G’dolot</i> contains the commentaries of Rashi; Rabbi Samuel ben Meir (1085–1158), one of Rashi’s grandsons who is also known as Rashbam; Abraham ibn Ezra; Nachmanides; and Obadiah Sforno (1475–1550), an Italian rabbi, physician, and commentator.
<i><b>Pre-modern Jewish Women and Hebrew Scriptures</b></i>
Most Jewish women in rabbinic and medieval times lacked access to the Torah and interpretive writings, since very few women learned to read Hebrew. The greatest Jewish philosopher of the Middle Ages, Moses Maimonides (1135–1204), who was born in Spain and spent most of his life in Cairo, discouraged girls’ education in traditional texts, on the grounds that women had no halachic obligation to study. He also believed that women were deficient in the mental skills required for serious Torah learning. In his famous law code the <i>Mishneh Torah,</i> Maimonides wrote, “Our sages said: ‘Whoever teaches his daughter Torah, it is as if he taught her frivolity [or: lasciviousness]’ (Mishnah <i>Sotah</i> 3:4). This all refers to the Oral Torah. However, regarding the Written Torah he should not set out to teach her; but, if he does teach her, it is not considered as if he taught her frivolity” (<i>Mishneh Torah,</i> Study of Torah 1:13). The French scholar Moses of Coucy (early 13th century) explained that although “a woman is exempt from both the commandment to learn Torah and to teach her son, even so, if she aids her son and husband in their efforts to learn [by supporting them financially], she shares their reward for the fulfillment of that commandment” <i>(Sefer Mitzvot Gadol,</i> Positive Commandment 12).
The invention of printing in the 15th century and the spread of printed works in vernacular languages transformed Jewish women’s educational opportunities. Most rabbinic leaders agreed with Maimonides that the rabbinic injunctions against female study applied to the Talmud but not to the Bible or the legal rulings necessary for women’s everyday activities. It is no accident that translations and paraphrases of portions of the Bible into Yiddish were among the first printed Jewish books intended for a female audience. (These were also important works for the large number of Jewish men who also lacked a good understanding of Hebrew.) Particularly popular were the <i>Taytsh-khumesh</i> (“Yiddish Five Books of Moses”) by Sheftl Hurwitz of Prague and first published in 1590, and the <i>Tsenerene</i> (or <i>Tzenah U’renah,</i> “Go Out and See”), by Rabbi Yaakov son of Isaac Ashkenazi. Both of these biblical paraphrases included homilies on the weekly biblical readings from the Torah and Prophets, as well as stories, legends, and parables from rabbinic literature, the <i>Zohar,</i> and other mystical texts. The <i>Tsenerene</i> was particularly popular and appeared in more than three hundred editions. As Chava Weissler has written, “Women read it for inspiration and catharsis, often weeping over the text, as a regular part of their Sabbath afternoon activities” (<i>Voices of the Matriarchs,</i> 1998, p. 6). In this way, for the first time, large numbers of women became familiar with the Torah and haftarah portions of the week, a wide variety of <i>midrash aggadah,</i> and the teachings of the best-known commentators. Aspects of this knowledge, particularly about biblical women, was also incorporated contemporaneously into women’s vernacular supplicatory prayers <i>(tkhines),</i> at least some of which were composed by women (see <i>Voices of the Matriarchs).</i> Thus, a new technology in the larger culture (namely, printing) transformed the piety and possibilities of Jewish women, just as the technological and social changes of the past hundred years have profoundly altered the opportunities available for Jewish women at the beginning of the 21st century.

Women and Contemporary Revelation

 I<small>N THE SECTION FOR EACH PARASHAH</small> titled “Contemporary Reflection,” Jewish thinkers, rabbis, cantors, educators, and other Jewish interpreters respond to the Torah through a personal or professional lens in order to articulate an ongoing encounter with God. In Hebrew, there is no single word for revelation. Rather, revelation is described as both <i>matan Torah</i> (the giving of Torah) and <i>kabbalat Torah</i> (the receiving of Torah). Revelation occurs when these two intersect and the voice of God is heard, directly or indirectly. Drawing on Deuteronomy 30:12 (in which Moses states that the Torah is “not in the heavens that you should say: ‘Who among us can go up can go up to the heavens and get it for us and impart it for us…”’), later rabbinic sages asserted that the will of God, as represented in the Torah, was no longer in Heaven but is entrusted to human interpreters (BT <i>Bava M’tzia</i> 59b). In the rabbinic context this meant that the community could discern God’s voice by wrestling with the text, that is, by intensely engaging with Torah. Thus, Torah study replaced prophecy as the source of revelation.
Even when women were exempt (or excluded) from Torah study, the Rabbis did not exclude women as bearers of revelation. They acknowledged that in ancient Israel, God spoke to female prophets as well as male prophets, who consequently served as divine messengers. Indeed, whereas the Bible identifies by name only four female prophets (see at Deuteronomy 13:2), the Rabbis expand this list considerably. According to one source, seven women were prophets. Acknowledging Miriam (Exodus 15:20), Deborah (Judges 4:4), and Huldah (II Kings 22:14), but ignoring Noadiah (Nehemiah 6:14), rabbinic sages add Sarah (Genesis 11–25), Hannah (I Samuel 1–2), Abigail (I Samuel 25), and Esther (BT <i>M’gillah</i> 14a). The Midrash also emphasizes the prophetic qualities of all four matriarchs (Sarah, Rebecca, Rachel, and Leah; <i>B’reishit Rabbah</i> 67.9; 72.6) and maintains that “just as sixty myriads of male prophets arose for Israel, so there arose for them sixty myriads of female prophets” <i>(Shir HaShirim Rabbah</i> 4.11).
<i><b>God continues to speak to each generation; in this one, we hear women’s voices.</b></i>
Who hears the divine voice? The rabbinic sages did not understand one’s relationship to God as connected primarily to gender, but rather, as Barry Holtz notes, to “talent, inclination and strength” (<i>Finding Our Way,</i> 1990, p. 102). For example, one midrash enjoins its readers, “Come and see how the voice [of God] went forth [at Sinai]—coming to each Israelite according to his individual strength— to the old, according to their strength; to the young according to their strength; to the children according to their strength; to the infants according to their strength; <i>and to the women according to their strength” (Sh’mot Rabbah</i> 5.9, emphasis added).
New and challenging scholarly theories in the 19th century about the historical formation of the Bible led Reform Jews, and later Conservative and Reconstructionist Jews, to rethink the concept of divine revelation and to reevaluate women’s religious roles. This created new opportunities for women to see themselves as bearers of revelation. Reform Judaism’s notion of progressive revelation particularly encouraged women and men to recognize the many ways in which one could hear God’s voice. In a sermon delivered in 1918, Lily Montagu, founder of the Liberal Jewish movement in England and of the World Union for Progressive Judaism, maintained that “we [Liberal Jews] are no longer worried by the claims of tradition when these clash with our conception of truth. We have boldly enunciated our belief in progressive revelation, and this faith has quickened our hope for the future and intensified our reverence for the past” (“Kinship With God,” in Ellen M. Umansky, ed., <i>Lily H. Montagu,</i> 1985, p. 113).
In line with this new understanding, Reform Judaism made religious education equally available to girls and boys, and the ceremony of confirmation, which initially replaced bar mitzvah, marked the end of one’s formal Jewish studies. Unlike the celebration of one’s becoming a bar or bat mitzvah, which is usually held on or soon after one’s 13th birthday, confirmation is held on Shavuot, the holiday traditionally marking the revelation at Sinai. Confirmation was at first an individual or small group ceremony, with girls confirmed at a temple in Berlin as early as 1817. In the U.S., confirmation became a group or class celebration, taking place at the end of 10th grade. Becoming a confirmand on Shavuot serves as a reminder of the centrality of the Torah (whether equated with God’s moral teachings or including ritual observance as well); it also reenacts symbolically for each person the receiving of the Torah and living in covenantal relationship with God. By the 20th century, the notion of continuing revelation—the idea that God continues to speak to each and every generation—was largely accepted. Indeed, for many if not most Jews today, the concept of Torah has expanded to mean Jewish learning or learning in general.
In his 1955 book <i>God in Search of Man,</i> Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel asked, “How did Israel know that what their eye and ear perceived in the desert of Sinai was not a phantom?” Was it truly a moment of revelation, or was such a perception only an illusion? “<i>What</i> we see,” he concluded, “may be an illusion; <i>that</i> we see can never be questioned” (p. 196). Speaking before members of the Central Conference of American Rabbis in 1986, Reform rabbi Laura Geller similarly emphasized the importance of lived experience. Describing revelation as a moment of connection with God, she, like Heschel, emphasized the transformative nature of this moment. Yet moving beyond what he identified as Torah, she came to realize that although she had not noticed, God is always present. She asserted:
I wasn’t looking, or perhaps I was looking in the wrong places.…I needed to listen to the gentle whisper, the still small voice, the Presence one encounters by diving deep and surfacing.…I suddenly realized that my experience is Jewish experience. There is a Torah of our lives as well as the Torah that was written down. Both need to be listened to and wrestled with: both unfold through interactive commentary <i>(Four Centuries of Jewish Women’s Spirituality: A Sourcebook,</i> 1992, pp. 244–45).
Like Geller, Judith Plaskow advocates expanding our understanding of Torah to include not just the first five books of the Hebrew Bible and traditional Jewish learning, “but women’s words, teachings, and actions hitherto unseen.” Plaskow asserts that Jewish feminists must “reclaim Torah as our own” in order to make visible the “presence, experience, and deeds of women erased in traditional sources,” telling the “stories of women’s encounters with God and captur[ing] the texture of their religious experience.” She also insists upon reconstructing history to include women’s history, not by changing the past, but by altering the shape of Jewish memory (<i>Standing Again at Sinai: Judaism from a Feminist Perspective,</i> 1990, p. 28).
Rachel Adler has identified such efforts as “engendering Judaism.” She also calls for models of thinking about and practicing Judaism in a way that enables both women and men to “recreate and renew together as equals” (<i>Engendering Judaism: An Inclusive Theology and Ethics,</i> 1998, p. xiv). In so doing, Adler draws heavily on narrative as a tool of critique and vision, while advocating among liberal or progressive Jews the re-appropriation of halachah (the traditional authoritative legal tradition) as a source of meaning, rather than one of power. This means, among other things, retaining those laws that remain grounded in the practice of the progressive Jewish community while adding new laws, grounded in new stories, that reflect new communal practices.
In “We All Stood Together,” poet Merle Feld reenvisions both women and men at Mt. Sinai, ready to receive the words of God. In her creative remembering, her brother kept a journal of what he saw and heard while she, always holding a baby, was never able to write anything down. Consequently, she came to forget the particulars of this revelatory moment, until she was left with nothing but the feeling that something important had occurred. At the poem’s conclusion, she writes that if Jews could somehow remember that moment at Sinai as it was experienced by men <i>and women,</i> that sacred moment could be recreated (see <i>Yitro,</i> Voices).
In this <i>Commentary,</i> the section called Contemporary Reflection contains responses by women who, in a variety of ways, explore the continuing meanings of the revelation of Torah. Written by Jewish professionals from a variety of fields, these pieces represent new, individual wrestlings with the biblical text. Explicitly or implicitly revealing an awareness of both biblical and post-biblical interpretations, the brief essays reflect a contemporary, often feminist, perspective. They not only focus on women’s roles and concerns, but also attempt to draw on women’s lived experiences (what Geller describes as “the Torah of our lives”) in order to create to recreate Jewish memory (as articulated by Plaskow and Feld) and, in the process, engender Judaism (as suggested by Adler).
Many of the topics explored in these reflections are identical to those found in other sections of this <i>Commentary,</i> including notions of covenant, peoplehood, religious leadership, free will, social justice, purity, pollution, sacrifice, forgiveness, and mercy. Yet instead of reading the text within a post-biblical or early rabbinic context, these reflections offer readings that are clearly in the present and have implications for the future. Some underscore the contemporary relevance of the Torah’s teachings, like Noa Kushner’s reflection on <i>parashat P’kudei</i> and God’s earthly presence, and Alice Shalvi’s on <i>parashat Ki Tavo</i> and the Israelites’ settling in the land of Israel. Others, like Suzanne Singer’s reflection on the hardening of Pharaoh’s heart in <i>parashat Bo,</i> suggest reading against the text—creating counter-narratives that provoke new theological questions and problems. Many of the pieces move beyond the text altogether, using words, phrases, or concepts within a particular parashah as a means of exploring issues and ideas that are of particular interest to contemporary readers, including women. Judith Plaskow, for example, draws on the priestly evaluation of sexual behavior in <i>parashat Acharei Mot</i> to discuss the persistence of homophobia as well as sexual and family violence in today’s society; in my reflection on <i>parashat Haazinu,</i> I reject the text’s imagery of God as Rock and Warrior, and instead offer new images that, in my view, better convey the love and justice of God. Writing more personally, Zoë Klein, in her reflection on <i>parashat Ki Tisa,</i> draws upon similarities to her husband’s proposing marriage to her at Mount Sinai and God’s continual revelation to Israel there, using one to view the other as moments of “eternal, loving joining,” while Blu Greenberg explores the impact of sudden loss, as she grapples with <i>parashat Sh’mini.</i>
The importance of the Contemporary Reflection sections of this <i>Commentary</i> is that they enable us to hear women’s voices that reckon with divine revelation. The reflections in this <i>Commentary</i> represent different attitudes toward the Torah and the many ways in which its teachings can be appropriated into our lives. While some authors defend its teachings, others challenge them. Yet each essay shows the significance of Torah as a record of God’s revelation to Israel: it is a repository of Jewish memory, however incomplete, from which we, as individuals and as members of contemporary Jewish communities, can attempt to hear and understand the voice of God.

The Poetry of Torah and the Torah of Poetry

 T<small>HIS COMMENTARY INVITES</small> the reader to meet the Torah text on new terms and to read the text through new eyes. In addition to more traditional modes of interpretation, this <i>Commentary</i> includes poetry, an innovative mode of expanding and extending the Torah text. In the Voices section at the conclusion of each parashah, we have collected poetry, along with selected prose pieces, to invite you to consider how issues and themes in each Torah portion reflect and illuminate women’s lives and experiences. This essay will explore the intention and the process of collecting the poems included in this volume.
<i><b>Poetry and the Oral Tradition</b></i>
The Torah is a living document. While some contemporary Jews may think of the Torah as a static, fixed “book,” the Torah has always been read aloud or chanted as an essential part of weekly, Shabbat, and holiday synagogue ritual. This declamatory aspect of Torah reading invites response, and the rich history of Torah commentary has developed from and continues to depend upon listeners’ familiarity with the oral text. Public reading brings together the intensely personal encounter with sacred text with the shared experience of hearing the text chanted or read aloud. Mirroring the communal experience of prayer, which, for Jews, always frames the public reading of Torah, each person is challenged to listen with concentrated attention: both as a member of the community and as an individual, hearing the words each time as if for the first time.
Poetry, too, demands oral recitation. By complementing each Torah portion with poetry, we are continuing the oral tradition of intentional listening and of challenging the “listener” to make connections between the text and your own life through the medium of commentary—in this case, in the form of poetry. As the poet Adrienne Rich writes, “What poetry is made of is so old, so familiar, that it’s easy to forget that it’s not just the words.” Rather, “every poem breaks a silence that had to be overcome.” Furthermore, “in the wash of poetry, the old, beaten, worn stones of language take on colors.” But these “colors,” or meanings, may also “disappear when you sieve them up out of the streambed and try to sort them out” <i>(What Is Found There: Notebooks on Poetry and Politics,</i> 1993, p. 84). This is the challenge of poetry.
<i><b>We invite you to meet the Torah text on new terms and to read it through new eyes.</b></i>
<i><b>The Challenges and Pleasures of Poetry</b></i>
For many readers, poetry is a particularly demanding medium. Whether deprived of teachers who welcomed us into the rich and exciting world of poetic language, or bored as children by memorizing poetry that seemed to have no meaning or relevance, some of us draw away from a poem that meets us on the page, hesitating, perhaps even ashamed of what we misinterpret as our lack of skills to approach or unpack the poem. Perhaps we hesitate to approach poetry because we feel the poem beckoning and we are unsure how to respond. The poet Muriel Rukeyser writes, “A poem does invite, it does require. What does it invite? A poem invites you to feel. More than that: it invites you to respond. And better than that: a poem invites a total response” (<i>The Life of Poetry,</i> 1996, p. 11). When we move beyond our fears, we can begin to respond to the poem—and to the Torah.
The Voices section invites you to give poetry a chance, to open your heart to the invitation to feel, to hear, to respond. We invite you to read each poem once, and then again, silently and aloud. Each reading will reveal new sounds, new meanings, new insights. Share your reading, and your interpretations with others. How does the poem illuminate the Torah text? How does the Torah text illuminate the poem? How does the poem serve as midrash, providing a deeper or broader reading of the text? If a poem is not immediately clear or understood, return to it at a later point. Read it again. Discuss the poem with your study partner, your friends, your teachers. In most cases we include references to verses in the Torah that we consider relevant to the poem; elsewhere we omit these because the poem relates to the parashah as a whole. Give each poem an opportunity to speak to you, opening a powerful and fresh perspective into the timeless Torah text. You may be surprised and delighted with your response.
<i><b>Poetry and Women’s Experience</b></i>
Since ancient times, women have collected and recorded their stories, their dreams, their fears, and their hopes. While their fathers and brothers may have bent over sacred texts, women composed songs and poems to welcome new life, to celebrate weddings, to mourn the dead. Some of these works were passed down from mother to daughter, orally or in writing. While some compositions were preserved, other writings—like many precious belongings—were lost as our people wandered from continent to continent, changing location, language, and worldview.
Women’s poetry begins in the Torah, with the Song of Miriam (Exodus 15:20-21), perhaps even the Song at the Sea (see at Exodus 15:1–19). Several other biblical poems are associated with women, namely the Song of Deborah (Judges 5), the Song of Hannah (I Samuel 2) and most of Song of Songs; and women were known to compose and perform victory songs and laments (see the introduction to <i>parashat Haazinu</i>). However, we know of few writings by Jewish women between ancient times and the 16th century, when Deborah Ascarelli composed and translated liturgy for her community in Rome. In the next century, Gluckel of Hameln composed her memoirs and Sarah Copio Sullam wrote poetry for her family and friends in Venice. Another kind of poetic text that has been preserved are numerous <i>tkhines,</i> petitionary prayers, some of which were written by women, including Rebecca Tiktiner of Prague (16th century) and Sarah daughter of Tovim of Podolia, Ukraine (18th century). For many years, these prayers served as a primary liturgical resource for many women, particularly for those whose language skills did not include Hebrew. In the wake of the Haskalah (the so-called Jewish Enlightenment, beginning in the late 18th century), we begin to see published works and essays by women, including poetry, first by Rachel Morpurgo in Trieste (1790–1871; see <i>Balak,</i> Voices), Grace Aguilar (1816–1847) in Britain, and Penina Moise (1797–1880) and Emma Lazarus (1849–1887) in the United States, among others. These poets made their voices heard by a wider audience, writing primarily in their native tongues. (See <i>The JPS Guide to Jewish Women: 600 BCE—1900 CE,</i> edited by Emily Taitz, Sondra Henry, and Cheryl Tallan, 2003.) Although considerably limited in quantity, women’s diaries, <i>tkhines,</i> memoirs, and poetry form a parallel tradition to the rich body of codes, commentary, and discursive literature composed by Jewish men throughout the ages.
The poetry collected in this <i>Commentary’s</i> Voices section reflects the writings of Jewish women across a wide chronological and geographical span. Whereas some poems date back as far as the 17th century, the majority were written in the last half century, largely by American, Israeli, and European poets. Although all the poetry in this volume appears in English, many poems have been translated from Hebrew, Yiddish, German, Russian, and other languages. The poets include both well-known, award-winning poets, as well as new, emerging poets. While a number of the poems were written as responses to specific parts of the Torah, others were not. In fact, many of the poets included in this volume were surprised and delighted to discover their work being juxtaposed as Torah commentary. A poem is the poet’s gift to the world; once released from the pen, the words enter hearts and minds in ways that the poet might never have dreamed or imagined. The wide range of poetry in this volume reflects the elasticity, the expansiveness, and the timelessness of a Torah that is open to continued and continual interpretation.
<i><b>The Process</b></i>
In keeping with the larger goals of this <i>Commentary,</i> the Voices section contains poems that, in some way, illuminate the experience of Jewish women as participants in, readers of, and heirs to the Torah and biblical history. The poems in Voices add depth to the four other types of commentary in each parashah by complementing, strengthening, and opening new readings of each portion. The poems fill in some of the lacunae of the biblical text by considering questions such as: Who were the women of the Bible? What might have they thought about and felt? What were the nature and the boundaries of their relationships with other women, with the men in their lives, with their children, and with their neighbors? When no women are mentioned in a story, where <i>are</i> the women? Who might they have been? While some of the poems give voice to the experiences and emotions of women mentioned in the Torah, others address broader topics and themes raised explicitly or implicitly in a given parashah, such as approaching the holy, sexual awakening, risk taking, creating and sustaining families and communities, pregnancy and childbirth, infertility, loss and mourning, and more.
For the other four sections that accompany each parashah, contributors were invited to write for this volume. In contrast, the Voices section was assembled by a small working group made up of the Editors (Tamara Cohn Eskenazi and Andrea L. Weiss), two members of the Editorial Board (Sherry Blumberg and Sue Levi Elwell), the Managing Editor (Hara Person), the Project Coordinator (Barbara Koppel), and our Rabbinic Student Interns (Jocelyn Hudson and Leah Berkowitz). Because our group included women who lived across the United States, we conducted our work on the telephone through conference calls, often meeting once a week for two hours at a time. This diverse group included women of different ages and diverse journeys. We discovered that we brought to our conversations a rich range of Jewish women’s experiences—as daughter, sister, friend, beloved, partner, mother of children by birth and by adoption, grandmother, and widow. The poetry that we considered challenged, comforted, and changed us. We hope you will share those experiences.
As we started gathering potential Voices material, we cast a wide net. We read widely, networking with poets, writers, teachers of literature, and our own friends and colleagues, sharing favorite books and poets, and spending countless hours in the stacks of libraries and bookstores and on the Internet. We found ample material for the narrative portions of the Torah; other genres presented a greater challenge.
As we evaluated material, we asked: How might a woman’s perspective enable us to ask new questions of the Torah? How are our understandings of gender and sexuality challenged by biblical texts, and how might biblical text be challenged by our growing understandings of these topics? What is the message of this poem, and how does it intersect with the biblical text? How far can we push the text, and also push each poem? What happens when we read and interpret familiar signs and symbols in new and powerfully different ways? How does an innovative reading of the text make that text more accessible and meaningful for contemporary readers?
During our phone calls, we read the selections aloud and discussed whether they merited inclusion and, if so, where they might fit. As our process continued, our understanding of our task deepened. We aimed to find, or, when necessary, commission or compose, poems that could act as spotlights on different aspects of each parashah. We hoped that together, these poems would reveal several distinct points of entry into each Torah portion. Additionally, for each parashah we attempted to balance poems that readers might find more accessible with those that might prove more challenging and require greater interpretive effort.
The Torah, which weaves together narrative, law, and song, is our people’s essential poetic expression. It calls to each of us, inviting attention and response. Poetry is a resource for facing challenges. As Muriel Rukeyser writes, “In this moment when we face horizons and conflicts wider than ever before, we want our resources, the ways of strength. We look again to the human wish, its faiths, the means by which the imagination leads us to surpass ourselves. If there is a feeling that something has been lost, it may be because much has not yet been used, much is still to be found and begun” <i>(The Life of Poetry,</i> 1996, p. 8). The time has come for all of us to hear women’s songs that echo, respond to, and challenge the themes of our ancient texts: celebrating the victory of the human spirit, crying out with the pain of loss, reflecting upon the quiet joy, and feeling the ecstasy of standing in the presence of holiness. Rukeyser observes that “much is still to be found and begun.” The Voices sections begin this process of restoring, renewing, and invigorating the study of—and delight in—the Torah of poetry and the poetry of Torah. May these poems open paths of insight and joy.

Parashah Introductions

Bereshit

<b>בראשית ✦ <i>B’reishit</i></b>
<small>GENESIS</small>
G<small>ENESIS IS A BOOK OF</small> beginnings, birthings, and blessings. It depicts the origin of humankind as a family, and then it follows the development of one particular family. Genesis serves as the “prequel” to the Exodus story that the Bible repeatedly presents as Israel’s founding event. Tracing the people’s origin back to its beginning, Genesis identifies who the Israelites are and how they came to be in Egypt.
After a brief yet crucial description of how God creates an orderly world and its inhabitants (1:1–2:3), the book persistently focuses on families. The first part (Genesis 1–11) provides an overview of the human family as a whole, establishing the unity of all people while also accounting for diversity and dispersion. These early chapters depict human development as a series of transgressions and transformations in which both God and humankind discover and develop their relationship. The rest of the book focuses on Israel’s ancestors: Abraham, Sarah and Hagar (Genesis 12–23); Rebekah and Isaac (Genesis 24–26); Jacob, Leah, and Rachel (Genesis 27–35, with a genealogy of Esau in 36); Joseph, Judah, and their brothers (Genesis 37–50)—each generation with its trials, tribulations, and triumphs. In these accounts, women play an active and integral role.
Although many traditional interpreters (both Jewish and non-Jewish) believe that these stories depict the actual lives of our ancestors, most contemporary scholars consider the historical information in Genesis to be more oblique. Such scholars consider Genesis to be a tapestry woven from several sources, sometimes labeled as J, E, and P (see Women and Interpretation of the Torah); they suppose that the book is the work of later generations who retroject into the past the tensions and circumstances of their own time. Thus, a careful reading of Genesis offers insights into how ancient Israel constructed its identity at different points in its history. For example, Jacob’s sons apparently represent clans that at some point banded together and then sought to account for this later unity by constructing a shared genealogy. Likewise, stories such as the tale about Lot’s daughters (Genesis 19) try to account for both affinity and tension with surrounding cultures.
Considering Genesis in its broader ancient Near Eastern and Mediterranean context—where stories of origin feature violent creation and heroic and semi-divine figures—highlights Genesis’ distinctive worldview. Genesis begins with a peaceful creation and then concentrates on an ordinary, aged couple (Sarah and Abraham, who become extraordinary as their story unfolds), with whom God enters into a covenant, and on their somewhat fumbling offspring. Far from promoting fame and fortune through great feats of might, Genesis illustrates how persons walk with God (17:1) dialogue with God (Genesis 18), and also wrestle with God (Genesis 32) in the pursuit of blessings.
The theme of sibling rivalry runs through Genesis from beginning to end (in contrast with Greek mythology, in which intergenerational conflict often occupies center stage). Beginning with the first murder (Abel by Cain; Genesis 4), competition between siblings plagues every generation. Eventually, the persistent, murderous impulse is channeled into repentance and reconciliation when Joseph unites tearfully with his brothers (see 45:1–15 and 50:18–22). Sibling rivalry and competition also characterize the story of the book’s two prominent sisters, Leah and Rachel (Genesis 29–30 and 35:16–20). Remarkably, however, their competition results in producing children, jointly building the “House of Israel” (as the community affirms in Ruth 4:11).
Beginning with daring Eve, resourceful women are central to the book of Genesis. Women are key, not merely because they give birth, but because they shape their family’s destiny; there would be no “Israel” without the matriarchs. Their stories belie any claim that Genesis privileges males at the expense of females. Rather, the book privileges the ones who secure the continuity of the family and perpetuate God’s blessings. In addition to Eve (Genesis 1–4), Sarah (Genesis 12–23), Hagar (Genesis 16 and 21), Rebekah (Genesis 24–28), Leah, Rachel, and their handmaids Bilhah and Zilpah (Genesis 29–31), Genesis devotes attention to the dilemma of Lot’s daughters (Genesis 19), the tragic fate of Dinah (Genesis 34), the triumph of Tamar (Genesis 38), and the seductive Potiphar’s wife (Genesis 39). Together, these women represent the biblical understanding of humans as God’s partners in maintaining God’s good world.
<i><b>—Tamara Cohn Eskenazi</b></i>
<i>Creation and Transformation</i>
W<small>HO ARE WE</small>? The question is answered in the first portion of Genesis as follows: We are God’s prized creation, inhabiting a good world that God has made. We are a constellation of four relationships: with the earth from whence we came and whither we return (Genesis 2), with each other as women and men equally blessed and jointly commissioned to care for the world (Genesis 1), with the animal world toward which we have responsibility (Genesis 1 and 2), and with God in whose image we are made (Genesis 1) and whose breath animates us (Genesis 2). Human disobedience complicates these relationships but does not destroy them.
Genesis 1 emphasizes the power of language and the reality of goodness. Humankind is embedded in a larger world over which God reigns supreme, but within which human beings can and do play a unique, decisive role.
A wide-angle lens that encompasses the whole world in Genesis 1 is augmented in Genesis 2–3 with a zoom lens that discloses an “up close and personal” relationship with God. This split-screen view characterizes the Torah as a whole and introduces a biblical practice of offering more than one perspective on important events.
The subsequent narratives, through Genesis 11, continue to respond to universal human questions about origins. They account for human suffering and inequality while affirming the sovereignty of a God who deeply cares for the world and its creatures.
Genesis 1–11 depicts God as still discovering the qualities of the material at hand (humankind) and (re)assessing its potential. Despite repeated disappointments, God remains faithful and hopeful, adjusting expectations and offering humankind new tools and guidance.
The parashah concludes at a nadir, with God’s disappointment in humankind when violence corrupts goodness (6:6). However, the text also makes clear the possibility of renewal despite decline (a theme throughout the Bible). Goodness and connectedness persist.
No biblical story has had more influence on women’s lives and identity—and none has been more often reinterpreted through later cultural biases—than the creation of woman in Genesis 2 and the expulsion from the Garden in Genesis 3. The version of creation of humankind in 1:26–28, which portrays equality between the sexes and their shared reflection of God’s image, is typically overlooked in favor the more ambiguous one in Genesis 2, which is typically read as one in which man precedes woman in time. Consequently, the first woman has been cast by later interpreters as an afterthought: second and therefore secondary in value, not essential to God’s plan. She has also been held solely or at least primarily responsible for human suffering.
However, a close reading of Genesis 1–3 indicates that such (mis)readings overlook the context and nuances of the depiction of woman. Suffice it to say here that the first woman is depicted as a discerning, responsible person who despite transgression (Genesis 3) maintains a creative partnership with both God and the first man. She is rightly recognized by her man as a source of life (3:20).
Other named women make cameo appearances: Ada, Zillah, and Naamah (4:19–23). The parashah concludes with a mysterious account about the illegitimate seizing of women, a prelude to the flood story that will follow (see at 6:1–8).

Noach

<i>Beginning Again</i>
P<small>ARASHAT</small> N<small>OACH</small> (Noah), named after the head of the household that survives the Flood, continues the basic themes of Genesis 1–11, accounting for the human condition with its possibilities and perils. The stories express a conviction that God persists—despite repeated disappointments—in (re)adjusting expectations in response to human limitations.
Two individuals, living ten generations apart, frame the parashah: Noah (6:9) and Abram/Abraham (11:27–32). Each becomes a vehicle for God’s persistence in “beginning again.” Between these two looms the devastating flood in response to human transgression, followed by God’s renewed effort to restore harmony through a covenant with Noah and all creation. The covenant redefines the relationship between God and humankind.
The tale of the Tower of Babel (Genesis 11) follows the flood story, as yet another case of human disobedience and divine response. It accounts for linguistic diversity and also demonstrates God’s covenantal restraint when humankind once again seeks to go beyond bounds. Finally, the introduction of Abram and Sarai that concludes the parashah prepares the stage for stories about the ancestral family—and about the descendants, the Israelites, who are the subject of the rest of the Bible.
Women’s presence in this parashah is more implicit than explicit until the very end, when Sarai/Sarah receives more attention than her husband Abram/Abraham (11:29–30). Her condition, that of a barren woman, introduces the challenge that propels the plot of the next several Torah portions, namely: How can God’s promises of progeny be fulfilled? Noah’s wife, the new mother of humankind, is mentioned several times but never named (though some rabbis later identify her as Naamah of Genesis 4:22). The virtual absence of women’s stories and names is all the more striking given the emphasis on women in the previous parashah and the lengthy, patrilineal genealogies in this one. Feminine presence is detected, however, in three basic ways: the (unnamed) wives of Noah and “his” sons; the emphasis on the animals who embark the ark as male and female; and the overwhelming presence of <i>t’hom</i>, “the deep”—a feminine noun evoking the name of the Babylonians’ salt-water goddess, Tiamat. <i>T’hom</i> first appears in Genesis 1:2 as a subdued presence. Riled into action by God, <i>t’hom</i> in this Torah portion unleashes its waters and destroys all that lives on land (see at 7:1).

<i>Covenantal Promise and Cultural Self-Definition</i>
P<small>ARASHAT</small> L<small>ECH</small> L’<small>CHA</small> (“Go forth!”) is about relationships: relationships between God and Israel, relationships among the Israelites, and relationships between Israelites and non-Israelites. The question “Who are we?”—which the first part of Genesis answered in universal terms—now begins to be explored by focusing on one family, the subject of the rest of the Torah.
The ideas are expressed in traditional biblical forms, such as scenes of covenant-making (Genesis 15 and 17); the annunciation to the mother of a future hero (Genesis 16); and the story of the patriarch who tells the foreign ruler that his wife is his sister (12:10–13; a version of such a story recurs in Genesis 20:1–18 and again in 26:1–16). All of these tales contribute to Israelite “founding myths,” that is, stories of the people’s origins, and to the process of self-definition.
As for its gender orientation, on one hand this parashah seems strongly androcentric. Divine conversation is primarily with Abraham, the patriarch. He is the party to the important scenes of covenant-making so central to the people’s identity. Only males can undergo circumcision, the sign of the covenant with God. Much of the parashah’s interest is in the birth of male children who will carry on the line of the patriarch and fulfill divine promises.
On the other hand, the women featured in this parashah, Sarah and Hagar, exhibit a power in the household that is also critical to the identity and development of the people. It is the barren woman—Sarah—who must bear the child in Abraham’s line. The difficulty with which such women conceive further marks their sons’ importance. Sarah is Abraham’s co-trickster in Genesis 12, where he enlists her help in deceiving Pharaoh, thereby saving his life and improving his lot. Sarah, like Abraham, undergoes a name change marking her participation in God’s covenant.
Women are portrayed as essential for men’s livelihood and for procreation, and also as keepers of their children’s futures. To be sure, such roles are circumscribed and betoken a world politically dominated by men, but women do have important roles to play within the contours of this system. The tale of Hagar in Genesis 16 is particularly interesting in this respect. (On women’s role in the covenant with God, see also Contemporary Reflection.)

<i>Between Laughter and Tears</i>
P<small>ARASHAT</small> V<small>AYEIRA</small> (“[he] appeared”) describes several encounters between God and members of Abraham’s household. In one sense, this parashah recounts the birth and survival of the next generation, Isaac and Rebekah: it begins with the announcement of Sarah’s forthcoming pregnancy and Isaac’s forthcoming birth (Genesis 18), continues with the challenges that stand in the way of the future, and concludes with Rebekah, Isaac’s future wife (22:20–24).
Questions of identity and self-definition continue, as covenantal blessings demarcate the distinction between Sarah and Isaac on the one hand, and Hagar and Ishmael on the other. A subtext concerns Abraham’s role in fulfilling God’s plan. But the individual episodes do more than chart the hazards and successes that follow God’s promises of progeny and land (see the previous parashah). Rather, they vividly depict the challenges, anguish, and joy that human beings experience as they create families and discover the complexities of multiple commitments.
The most famous of these episodes is the “Binding of Isaac,” where Abraham is asked to sacrifice his beloved son (Genesis 22). This story has its counterpart in that of a mother with an imperiled child: the heart-wrenching story of Hagar and Ishmael in the wilderness (Genesis 21), in which Hagar despairs of her son’s survival. Women are prominent through-out. At long last Sarah learns that she shall have a son (Genesis 18), and finally becomes a mother (Genesis 21). Tension between two mothers—Sarah and Hagar—each one seeking the welfare of her child, frames the story of Lot’s daughters, who act together (Genesis 19). These tales offer glimpses into women’s world and presumed concerns. The closing report about Rebekah’s birth far from the land of Canaan sets the stage for when she becomes Isaac’s wife (in the next parashah).

<i>From Sarah to Rebekah</i>
P<small>ARASHAT</small> C<small>HAYEI</small> S<small>ARAH</small> (“the life of Sarah”) opens with the death and burial of Sarah. It centers on the introduction of Rebekah as a wife to Isaac and concludes with the deaths of Abraham and of Ishmael. Within this framework, the Torah relates two incidents in detail: how Sarah’s death prompts Abraham’s purchase of a burial plot in the promised land; and how Rebekah agrees to leave her homeland and family in Aram-naharaim in order to marry Isaac.
With these two incidents, Abraham begins to realize the divine promises of land and progeny. It becomes evident that these divine promises are deeply connected to the lives of women, in particular to the matriarchs. To guarantee that Sarah has a permanent resting spot, Abraham purchases the cave of Machpelah. This purchase marks Abraham’s first concrete step toward realizing the divine promise of land, for he acquires legitimate title to the field containing the cave. Second, Abraham achieves his goal that Isaac marry a woman from the land of his birth when Rebekah emerges as a more-than-suitable wife for Isaac. Through that marriage to Isaac, the future of the patriarch’s family will be assured and, by extension, the covenant with God will be renewed.
The longest unit in the parashah, Genesis 24, is devoted to what has been called the Courting of Rebekah. It introduces Rebekah as an energetic young woman who, like Abraham (Genesis 12), embarks on a journey to a distant land.
The closing unit accentuates Isaac’s special standing. Abraham sends away the sons who were born to him through his subsequent wife, Keturah, and through the concubines he had taken (25:1–6). Isaac thus remains his sole heir. This accords both with God’s promise that “My covenant I will maintain with Isaac” (Genesis 17:21) and with Sarah’s demand that Ishmael (and presumably other of Abraham’s sons) not inherit with her son, Isaac (21:10). This separation from Ishmael highlights the continuing question of identity formation in relation to other peoples.

Toldot

<i>Shaping Destiny: The Story of Rebekah</i>
P<small>ARASHAT</small> T<small>OL</small>’<small>DOT</small> (“generations”) begins with Isaac but focuses heavily on Rebekah as the more active member of this family. Rebekah runs the family and undertakes the task of determining the destiny of God’s blessings. As the one who blesses, Isaac has authority; but in determining who gets blessed—seemingly against Isaac’s intentions—Rebekah has the power. She independently seeks God and alone receives God’s answer about the future.
This parashah recounts a family story. A mother gives birth to twins, Esau and Jacob; and from the beginning, the brothers vie for prominence and their parents’ favor. Like other biblical narratives in Genesis, this parashah is also concerned with self-definition—with the identity of the Israelite community in relation to surrounding peoples and cultures. Rebekah’s twins represent two distinct nations: Israel and Edom.
Rebekah occupies center stage in several key scenes. Energetically, Rebekah ensures that the covenantal blessings will be bestowed on the more suitable son. Isaac, eclipsed by his parents, wife, and offspring, simply goes along—passively and gently surviving.
As Alice Bellis observes, interpreters often object to Rebekah’s manipulations of her husband, comparing her unfavorably with Sarah’s treatment of Hagar in Genesis 16 and 21, as if “[abusing] a woman servant is acceptable; deceiving a man, even to achieve God’s mission, is not” (<i>Helpmates</i>, <i>Harlots</i>, <i>and Heroes: Women’s Stories in the Hebrew Bible</i>, 1994, p. 83). The Torah, however, presents Rebekah as a figure without whom the covenant will not continue properly, the necessary link between Abraham’s blessing and Jacob’s.

Vayetzei

<i>The Journey Within</i>
P<small>ARASHAT</small> V<small>AYEITZEI</small> (“he went out”) is the Torah’s greatest love story. In it the lovers—Rachel and Jacob—figure as doubles. Their lives are in many ways parallel. Each of them works as a shepherd, flees from home, steals a father’s legacy, contends with sibling and God alike, tricks others and is in turn tricked, and bargains for the blessing of having children. The stories of Rachel and Jacob illustrate the distinct but intersecting male and female journey cycles that characterize Genesis 12–35. In the male journey cycle a hero departs from home, gains intimacy with God by wandering promised and unpromised lands, has visions while exposed in the outdoors, and struggles to fulfill God’s blessing by engendering children.
For their part, the matriarchal heroines also wander across external terrain. However, their journey toward intimacy with God takes place in the internal terrain of the body. Three of the four matriarchs experience a state of barrenness; two of them (Sarah and Rachel) reverse it by articulating their discontent or taking direct action in order to signal their intentions to create life. The often extreme measures they take in order to give birth alert God to their drive. This leads to a divine encounter that results in conception.
Genesis acknowledges that conception ensues from sexual relations. But the subtext of the female journey cycle indicates that its success requires intimacy not only between a man and a woman but also between a woman and God. Following the birth of a child, the mother encodes the memory of her specific path from barrenness to fertility in the name that she bestows as a legacy to her child. This paradigm is apparent as Rachel and her sister, Leah, compete for the love of both Jacob and God while simultaneously birthing the people of Israel. Their achievement is celebrated in the book of Ruth when the people praise “Rachel and Leah, both of whom built the house of Israel” (Ruth 4:11).

GENESIS 32:4–36:43<i>From Jacob to Israel</i>
P<small>ARASHAT</small> V<small>AYISHLACH</small> (“And he sent”) features Jacob—the third and final patriarch—as he becomes the last individual to receive a personal covenant with God. In a life-transforming event, Jacob meets God face to face, and his name is changed to “Israel,” which may reflect his own struggles with God. After Jacob, all future covenant renewals will be made between God and <i>B’nei Yisrael</i> (literally “the children of [the patriarch] Israel”)—the Israelites as a whole, who will continue the struggle.
All of the women in this parashah (except for those in the genealogy of Esau in Genesis 36) are members of Jacob’s immediate family. What stands out is the troubling story of Dinah and Shechem (Genesis 34), although Dinah’s role in the narrative is revealingly minor. While she functions as a trigger for the event, the tale focuses on the relations between the men of the family of Jacob and the Canaanites among whom they have settled. The major concern in the story as told is not the personal fate of an individual woman (or man) but the political relationship between Israel and the other inhabitants in the land. Dinah becomes a symbol in the exploration of the theme of identity—of self and of other—that began with the story of Abraham.
The other women in Jacob’s household appear in passing in this parashah, with Rachel’s death as a poignant conclusion. In general, these passages enable us to view the women of the story as intermediaries linking together groups of men, while moving about in the social world of the male characters—who have the authority to represent both the women and the subordinate men in their households.

<i>Trials, Tribulations, and Changing Circumstances</i>
P<small>ARASHAT</small> V<small>AYEISHEV</small> (“he settled”) be­gins the so-called “Joseph story cycle,” which goes on until the end of Gene­sis. In this first portion, the personal drama of Jacob and his family incorporates questions of national identity and survival outside the Prom­ised Land. The reader follows Joseph’s external and internal journey as he grows through hard­ships and tribulations from a spoiled son—favored by his father but hated by his brothers—into a wiser youth in an Egyptian jail.
Two stories of a woman and sex stand lit­erally at the center of the parashah. One is the story of Tamar and her father-in-law Judah (Genesis 38), in which she eventually gives birth to two sons, one of whom will be a fore­father of King David; in this episode Tamar takes extraordinary risks to secure the family’s future (if not her own) by getting pregnant by her father-in-law. In the second story, the wife of Potiphar—Joseph’s Egyptian master—attempts to seduce Joseph; he resists, she lies about the circumstances, and he is sent to prison (Genesis 39).
The two stories present the men’s behavior as contrasts: Judah eagerly has sex with the veiled Tamar, whereas Joseph resists Potiphar’s wife. (The contrast displays a bias for Joseph tribes as Genesis retrojects a much later, ongo­ing rivalry between the tribes of Joseph in the north and Judah in the south.) In both cases the text presumes that women can be sexually dangerous to men; but Tamar, unlike Potiphar’s wife, is pronounced righteous for ensuring—by using her body—that Judah’s family is not “written out of history.”
Structurally, the parashah is symmetrical: the first and last episodes portray Joseph in relations to dreams and dream solving. Joseph’s development, the structure suggests, revolves around his dreams, and it is generated by his own actions as well as the behavior of others (his father, brothers, master, Potiphar’s wife). God, though involved, remains in the back­ground.
These themes surround two stories about a woman’s desire and its consequences. In both, the woman uses a garment to deceive. In both, she furthers the education and development of a man. Yet her actions, while advancing the plot—and the divine plan, so it seems—are not transformational; Judah and Joseph will each have to struggle further to transform self-centeredness into leadership. Tamar’s desire and action are rewarded: she becomes a mother of twins—and is invoked in the book of Ruth within a blessing (4:12). In contrast, the desire of Potiphar’s wife remains unfulfilled and she disappears unnamed. (In early Christian in­terpretation, Jewish post-biblical sources, and Islamic re-tellings including the Qur’an [sura 12], she endures as a symbol of the dangerous foreign woman.)

<i>When Dreams Come True</i>
P<small>ARASHAT</small> M<small>IKEITZ</small> (“at the end of”) marks the end of Joseph’s time in prison, traces his rise to power in Pharaoh’s court, and concludes when his brothers stand before him fearful for their fate. Earlier, in Genesis 37, Joseph’s dreams had provoked the envy of his brothers. In this parashah, dreams enable him to leave prison when he uses his gifts to interpret Pharaoh’s dreams. Joseph’s own dreams come true when his brothers—not knowing who he is—bow to him in supplication. How will Joseph respond? Have the brothers changed? The parashah concludes with the key question still unanswered: <i>is this family doomed to relive a violent past, or will it show that transformation and growth are possible?</i> In this parashah, Judah takes the lead as representative of the brothers. His rise to responsibility can be linked to his encounter with Tamar in Genesis 38 (see below).
Favoritism in Jacob’s household continues to propel the narrative. Jacob’s undying love for Rachel has led him to favor her sons, Joseph and Benjamin, over those of Leah, Bilhah, and Zilpah—resulting in virulent sibling rivalry for Jacob’s affection (Genesis 37). Years later, the brothers still must cope with Jacob’s blatant favoritism while he remains oblivious to the effect of his behavior.
In this parashah, women appear mostly indirectly. Unlike Sarah and Rebekah—who actively appeared in the earlier episodes about Abraham, Isaac, and their offspring—Jacob’s wives remain in the background and do not act. Rachel has already died (35:19), and Leah, whose burial is retrospectively recorded later (49:31), goes unmentioned. Nothing further is said about Zilpah or Bilhah. Only Asenath plays a direct role, as Joseph’s Egyptian wife and as mother of his sons. The name of her father, the priest Potiphera, echoes Potiphar’s name—evoking memories of Potiphar’s wife, the cause for Joseph’s incarceration in the previous parashah (Genesis 39).
At the same time, one notes several allusions or connections with the encounter between Tamar and Judah in Genesis 38. For example, in both stories, clothing serves as a disguise, hiding the true identity of Judah’s interlocutor; in both, the same verb (translated as “acknowledge” in 38:25–26 and “recognize” in 42:8) marks a pivotal moment; in both, also, the notion of pledge plays a role (see at 43:9). Possibly, Judah’s rise to prominence in this parashah results from the transformation he had undergone when Tamar quietly called him to account.

<i><b>Another Contemporary Reflection</b></i>
A<small>CCORDING TO</small> <i>parashat Mikeitz</i>, Joseph marries an Egyptian. Their children, Ephraim and Manasseh (41:45–52), subsequently become progenitors of two Israelite tribes. A traditional blessing of children invokes these sons’ names. Around the Sabbath table for many generations, parents of sons have been reciting (as one English translation renders it): “May you be like Ephraim and Manasseh.” This biblical precedent, which recognizes the children of a non-Israelite mother as equal—even distinguished—members of Israel, invites an examination of assumptions as to who is counted as part of the people Israel and on what basis.
Most biblical texts implicitly reflect patrilineal descent: the child’s membership is determined by that of the father, not the mother. A major exception is the book of Ezra, which excludes foreign wives with their children from the community (Ezra 10:3). The implication: these children, like the mother, do not belong to Israel even though their fathers are Israelites.
In the post-biblical era, rabbinic halachah determined what became normative in Judaism: a child of a Jewish mother is a Jew. (For a detailed discussion, see Shaye Cohen, <i>The Beginning of Jewishness,</i> 1999.)
In 1983, the Central Conference of American Rabbis voted to return to patrilineal descent while also retaining matrilineal descent. The resolution required that in the case of intermarriage, a child’s Jewish identity must be confirmed through “acts of identification with the Jewish people” and “the performance of mitzvoth” (if either the mother or father is Jewish). According to this formulation, lineage is not determined by genetics alone but by identification with the Jewish people and by Jewish practice.
Rabbi Alexander Schindler, the visionary behind this effort, viewed this resolution as an extension of his vision of Outreach in response to the growing reality of intermarriage in American Jewish life. But he viewed the return to patrilineality also as an egalitarian issue. At a 1986 conference on Jewish unity he noted, “Why should a movement that from its birth-hour insisted on the full equality of men and women in religious life unquestioningly accept the principle that Jewish lineage is valid through the maternal line alone—all the more so because there is substantial support in our tradition for the validity of Jewish lineage through the paternal line!” (Princeton, New Jersey; March 16, 1986). (The Reconstructionist movement likewise adopted patrilineal descent as valid. The Conservative movement and Orthodox Jews do not accept patrilineal descent as defining who is a Jew.)
While patrilineal descent has been criticized harshly across the greater Jewish world for dividing the Jewish people, its supporters see its inclusion not as a movement away from tradition but as a transition back to certain biblical roots in light of changed circumstances. Thus Rabbi Bernard Zlotowitz writes that “the changes enacted in the Reform movement fall within the traditional parameters of Judaism as a living faith. In times of necessity and for the welfare of the people, halachah was revised and traditions set aside in favor of more adaptive ones” (“Patrilineal Descent,” in <i>The Jewish Condition,</i> ed. Aron Hirt-Manheimer, 1995, p. 265). Zlotowitz notes several examples of adaptive changes that have become part of the halachah: the removal of the laws of the <i>sotah</i> (the wife suspected of adultery as in Numbers 5—see <i>Naso,</i> Contemporary Reflection), and the abolition of the husband’s right to divorce his wife without cause. These examples are similar in that the changed laws aim to provide for the Jewish community’s preservation and continuity in the face of changing circumstances and values.

Vayigash

<i>Reunion and Reconciliation of Joseph, Jacob, and the Brothers</i>
T<small>HE HIGHLIGHT OF</small> <i>parashat Vayigash</i> (“he approached”) is when Joseph reveals his true identity to his brothers. This parashah starts with Judah’s emotional plea to let Benjamin return to Jacob in Canaan. The plea revolves around the effect on Jacob of the brothers’ returning without Benjamin. Unable to contain his feelings any longer, Joseph discloses his identity and sends his brothers home to bring his father to Egypt.
The brothers are both sorry and apprehensive about reprisal for what they did to Joseph long ago. But Jacob is happy to learn that Joseph, his elder son by his favorite wife Rachel, is still alive. He and the entire family move to Egypt. Family matters occupy center stage in <i>parashat Vayigash</i> as father and sons are reconciled with each other and forgive past behavior. The other brothers seem to set aside jealousies stemming from Jacob’s favoring Rachel and her children.
On a deeper level, this parashah explores the dynamics of human growth. Robert Alter sums up the issues beautifully:
What is it like, the biblical writers seek to know through their art, to be a human being with a divided consciousness—intermittently loving your brother but hating him even more; resentful or perhaps contemptuous of your father but also capable of the deepest filial regard; stumbling between disastrous ignorance and imperfect knowledge; fiercely asserting your own independence but caught in a tissue of events divinely contrived; outwardly a definite character and inwardly an unstable vortex of greed, ambition, jealousy, lust, piety, courage, compassion, and much more? (<i>The Art of Biblical Narrative</i>, 1981, p. 176)
The parashah, then, presents a study in the human capacity for lasting change. While not mentioned in this parashah, Tamar has been a pivotal figure in Judah’s own growth. Their encounter in Genesis 38 best accounts for Judah’s new capacity to sympathize with his father.
Women appear infrequently in this parashah. There are references to women in 44:20, 45:19, and among those who went to Egypt (46:5–27). The list of the descendants of Jacob who traveled to Egypt divides the entire family according to their mothers (46:8–27). Of the daughters of Jacob, only Dinah is mentioned by name (46:15). The total number of offspring of Jacob who traveled with him to Egypt does not count the wives of his sons (46:26).

Vayechi

<i>Intimations of the Exodus: the Death of Jacob, the Birth of Israel</i>
P<small>ARASHAT</small> V<small>A-Y’CHI</small> (“he lived,” referring to Jacob’s residing in Egypt) serves as a transition between the stories in Genesis about the patriarchs and Joseph, and the narrative in Exodus of the Egyptian slavery and exodus. It is both a conclusion and a foreshadowing. As the end of Jacob’s life draws near, he wants to ensure the continuity of the family. Consequently, in this parashah the present points to both the past and the future. The past is represented by the patriarchal blessing, which features the divine promises of progeny made to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; the future, by Jacob’s blessings for his own and for Joseph’s sons.
Along with the concern for the family is the concern for the land, since both are part of the patriarchal blessing. In making arrangements for his own burial, Jacob insists that he must be laid to rest in the family plot established by Abraham in Canaan, in the cave of Machpelah purchased from Ephron the Hittite (see Genesis 23). Although the entire family now resides in Egypt, this will not be their final resting-place. The parashah foreshadows the Exodus: Jacob’s burial procession from Egypt to Canaan anticipates the Israelites’ march out of Egypt. But the family’s return to Egypt, and Joseph’s temporary burial there, show that the real exodus is yet to come.
Joseph plays the leading role among the brothers. He has matured, and he now takes responsibility for his family. He is the one first charged with Jacob’s burial instructions, and he is the one who makes sure they are carried out. He also assures his brothers that he bears them no enmity for past deeds. With the death of their father, the brothers are now a reunited family.
The matriarchs are the only women mentioned in this parashah, and only in reference to their place of burial. Jacob recalls Rachel’s death on the way to Canaan (48:7). While instructing that he be buried in the cave of Machpelah, Jacob mentions that Sarah (along with Abraham), Rebekah (along with Isaac), and Leah are already buried there (49:29–32). Rebekah’s and Leah’s deaths have not been mentioned previously, whereas Sarah’s death received close attention (Genesis 23).
In death and burial, the matriarchs and patriarchs represent the uniting of the family in the Promised Land. Eventually, all Israel will reside in the land. But it will remain for the book of Exodus—where women once again will be very much in the foreground—to continue the story.

<small>EXODUS</small>
F<small>ROM HIGH ATOP</small> Mount Sinai, amidst thunder and lightning, comes a voice: “I יהוה am your God who brought you out of the land of Egypt, the house of bondage” (Exodus 20:2). The exodus from Egypt and the revelation at Mount Sinai form the heart of the book of Exodus and the foundation of biblical Israel and subsequent Judaism. This book contains some of the most memorable episodes in the Torah, including Moses’ encounter with God at the Burning Bush, the ten signs and wonders (“plagues”) that convince Pharaoh to free the Israelites, the Decalogue (“Ten Commandments”), and the Golden Calf.
The English name “Exodus,” which derives from an ancient Greek title meaning “departure from Egypt,” summarizes the dramatic events in the first part of the book. The Hebrew name <i>Sh’mot</i> (“names”), taken from the book’s opening line (“These are the names of the sons of Israel who came to Egypt with Jacob…”), reflects the way in which Exodus continues the story that commenced in Genesis. In this second book of the Torah, the children of Israel/Jacob become the people of Israel. In fulfillment of the promises that God makes to the ancestors in Genesis, the patriarch’s descendants substantially increase in number and eventually begin their journey to the land of Canaan, guided by the teachings transmitted at Sinai.
Exodus contains four main sections: <i>(1)</i> the story of the enslavement of the Israelites and the liberation from Egypt (1:1–15:21); <i>(2)</i> the narrative of the journey from the shores of the Reed Sea to the wilderness of Sinai (15:22–18:27); <i>(3)</i> the account of Israel’s entry into a covenant with God, including the precepts contained in the Decalogue and the Covenant Collection (19:1–24:18); and <i>(4)</i> detailed instructions for building the portable shrine (called the Tabernacle or Tent of Meeting), its furnishing, and the priestly vestments (25:1–40:38).
Many readers wrestle with the historical veracity of these events; but the book defies facile answers. While there is some evidence that enslavement and exodus were a core authentic experience, none of the names of the pharaohs are recorded (although the names of the midwives Shiphrah and Puah are preserved), no dates are given, and the biblical text does not correlate easily with archeological finds or extra-biblical evidence. The book itself does not focus on historical facts, but on the teachings derived from the episodes recounted. The main concern is how subsequent generations will answer the questions “What do you mean by this rite?” (12:26) and “What lessons can be derived from these narrative details?” (See also <i>Sh’mot,</i> Contemporary Reflection.)
Women play a pivotal role in the Exodus account, especially in <i>parashat Sh’mot,</i> which records the heroic deeds of six women who take action to save Moses and the people Israel: the midwives Shiphrah and Puah (1:15–21), Moses’ mother Jochebed and sister Miriam (2:1–10), Pharaoh’s daughter (2:5–10), and Zipporah, Moses’ wife (2:16–22; 4:24–26). Following the miraculous escape from Egypt, Miriam the prophet leads the women in a celebratory song and dance (15:20–21). (Some scholars consider her the probable author of the Song at the Sea as well; see pp. 386–87, 392.) Women figure prominently in the laws of Exodus and four women are even mentioned in a Levite genealogy (6:14–25).
Yet in other parts of the book, women play a more elusive role. Moses’ command before the revelation at Sinai not to go near a woman (19:15) and the grammatically masculine language of the laws have prompted questions about the extent to which women were included in the covenant between God and Israel, questions explored throughout this <i>Commentary</i> (see, in particular, <i>parashat Yitro).</i> Likewise, the account of the construction of the Tabernacle initially seems to largely exclude women. However, a close reading of the text reveals that women contributed directly to this sacred structure through their donations and their labor.
Thus, in various ways, women take part in the drama of the Exodus and in the people’s striving to maintain a connection and covenant with God.

<i>The Birth of a Nation</i>
P<small>ARASHAT</small> S<small>H’MOT</small> (“names of…”) is both a new beginning and a continuation of the book of Genesis. In that first book, God made a twofold promise to Abraham of progeny and land (12:2–3, 7; 15:1–7, 18–21; 17:1–8). This second book amplifies the passing notice in Genesis (47:27) that part of the promise has been realized: the family of Jacob has “multiplied and increased very greatly” (1:7). Now the Torah turns to the acquisition of the Promised Land, which can begin only with an exodus from Egypt.
Four prominent themes appear in this parashah: the fertility of Israel; the oppression they suffer; God’s decision to intervene; and the role of women in saving the nation. Israel’s oppression is directly linked to Israel’s fertility, for as the family of Jacob grows into the nation of Israel, Pharaoh becomes concerned that Israel will become too numerous and thereby too strong. Although he tries various ways to limit the population increase, he cannot stem Israel’s growth. Thus begins the contest between God and Pharaoh that will play out in the story of the signs and wonders (in English parlance, commonly called “plagues”) in the subsequent Torah portions.
Also intertwined with the theme of fertility is a more pervasive theme in the Bible: women save the nation. This conclusion emerges clearly from the stories of the matriarchs (Genesis 12–35) and the account of Tamar (Genesis 38), as well as in the book of Ruth: women ensure the continuity of the family—and ultimately the nation—through the birth or protection of a son through whom the line will continue. The beginning of Exodus explores this theme in unusual ways, through unnamed Israelite women and the agency of non-Israelite women. The fertile Israelite women increase the strength of the nation, fulfilling God’s promise and threatening the pharaoh. The midwives Shiphrah and Puah disobey Pharaoh’s command to kill the newborn boys. Moses’ mother and sister (whose names are not yet disclosed), and later Pharaoh’s own daughter, ensure that he is rescued and raised for future greatness. Finally, his wife, Zipporah, averts disaster by circumcising her son. Thus, while Moses and Aaron serve as the explicitly chosen instruments of God’s deliverance, these heroic women are nevertheless pivotal in Israel’s eventual salvation.
This parashah also marks a new stage in the national religion. In Genesis, the patriarchs had a personal relationship with God; in Exodus, the Israelites will enter into a communal relationship with the Divine. Previously, God was known to the patriarchs, and known in reference to them, as “the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob” (Exodus 3:6, 16; 4:5). Now, as God hears the cries of the Israelites and resolves to rescue them, God’s “official” or personal name, יהוה, will be revealed.

Vaera

<i>Marvelous Signs and Destructive Wonders</i>
P<small>ARASHAT</small> V<small>A-EIRA</small> (“I appeared”) recounts how God, with the help of Moses and Aaron, endeavors to persuade the pharaoh to release his Hebrew slaves. Here we encounter a stubborn, resistant king not willing to concede an inch of ground to the beleaguered Israelites. This parashah begins the tale—continued in the two subsequent Torah portions—of how a reluctant, underdog prophet triumphs over a recalcitrant tyrant. The suspense-filled drama of the liberation from servitude is central to the Bible and to Judaism. This story is recalled with gratitude through the Passover seder, daily prayers, and identification with the oppressed. The exodus from Egypt has inspired resistance movements throughout the ages, as the downtrodden of many lands and faiths have invoked the potent phrase of self-determination: “Let my people go!”
The divine acts recounted in this parashah are commonly called “plagues,” yet this term is used only rarely in the exodus narrative (see at 9:14). Instead, words like “signs” <i>(otot),</i> “marvels” <i>(moftim</i>), and “wonders” <i>(nifle’ot)</i> describe the events that devastate the land and attack the routine affairs of ordinary Egyptians. We read about the first seven signs in this parashah: bloody water, frogs, lice, swarms of insects, pestilence, boils, and hail. These episodes are intended to engender a specific kind of knowledge, teaching the Israelites that “I, יהוה, am your God” (6:7) and the Egyptian king “that there is none like יהוה” (8:6) and that “I יהוה am in the midst of the land” (8:18; see also 7:17; 9:14, 29).
Women figure far less prominently in this Torah portion than in the previous parashah, yet the genealogy in 6:14–24 preserves the memory of four women: Moses’ mother, Jochebed; Simeon’s unnamed Canaanite wife; and two priestly wives, Elisheba and Putiel’s daughter. The political clash that unfolds in <i>parashat Va-eira</i> is more destructive than the non-confrontational, non-violent resistance of the women in <i>parashat Sh’mot.</i> The events in this portion remind us that the movement of a people from slavery to liberation has wide-reaching consequences.

Bo

<i>Power, Plagues, Passover</i>
P<small>ARASHAT</small> Bo (“go”) features three final signs from God (locusts, darkness, and the slaying of the first-born), following directly after the first seven signs in the previous parashah. (Although in English parlance this series of events is commonly called “the Ten Plagues,” the Hebrew text refers to them mainly as “signs,” “marvels,” or “wonders”; see further at 11:1.) Then the narrative from which this book takes its English name reaches its climax as the Israelites’ exodus from Egypt begins. Framing the account of the last sign and the hurried flight from Egypt are instructions for the (annual) passover sacrifice and the Festival of Matzot (Unleavened Bread).
An overriding theme in this Torah portion is God’s omnipotence. The signs are meant to prove to Pharaoh, all Egypt, and the burgeoning people of Israel that Israel’s God reigns supreme. Because of Pharaoh’s stubborn willfulness, God’s determination to respond to the outcry of the oppressed Israelites (3:7) ultimately leads to a loud cry in Egypt as the anguish of the death of every first-born male echoes in the night (11:6; 12:30).
The theme of remembrance also recurs throughout this parashah. Several passages emphasize the importance of teaching future generations about how God saved the Israelites (10:2; 12:26–27; 13:14–15). Also, a number of apparently existing rites—including the Festival of Matzot (12:14; 13:3), <i>t’fillin</i> (13:9, 16), and the redemption of the first-born (13:14–15)—are linked to the Exodus to institutionalize its memory.
Many readers of this parashah wonder about the historicity of the Exodus story. It is important to remember that these events are not recounted as verifiable history. Rather, the narrative describes a people’s collective memory of their past. As such, the historical accuracy of the account is unimportant, for it has no bearing on the story’s core message or themes. (See <i>Sh’mot</i>, Contemporary Reflection.)
We find a few scattered references to women throughout this parashah. When Moses negotiates with Pharaoh, he insists that every Israelite—including the women—be permitted to leave Egypt to worship God (10:9). Further on, as the Israelites prepare to leave, women are instructed to “borrow” objects of silver and gold from their female Egyptian neighbors (11:2). (They will later donate such materials for the Tabernacle; 35:22–29.) In addition, Moses warns the people that every Egyptian first-born male will die—even the oldest child of “the slave girl who is behind the millstones” (11:5). The image of her grinding grain into flour reflects the role women played in the complex production of bread (see at 11:5 and 12:8). Although we repeatedly read about unleavened bread in this parashah (12:8, 14–20, 39; 13:3–8), the text does not mention who makes the matzah. Textual and archeological evidence suggests that women would have baked the unleavened cakes of dough that are part of the story of the Israelites’ fleeing from Egypt. As an integral part of each Israelite “family” and “household” (12:3), women experience the long-awaited Exodus, the unprecedented redemptive act that becomes the foundation for the relationship between God and Israel.

Beshalach

<i>Crossing the Sea and Crises in the Wilderness</i>
P<small>ARASHAT</small> B<small>’SHALACH</small> (“when [Pharaoh] let [the people] go”) recounts the crossing of the sea, the culmination of the story of the Israelite sojourn in Egypt. From the beginning of the book of Exodus, the goal of leaving Egypt is part of the narrative thread describing the oppressive measures that Pharaoh uses to keep the Israelites in Egypt. That goal is finally realized once the Israelites traverse the Sea of Reeds. This climactic event is related in two versions: a prose account in 14:1–31, followed by a poetic account (called in rabbinic literature <i>Shirat HaYam</i>, “Song at the Sea”) in 15:1–22. The latter is more of a celebratory or victory hymn than a record of the Exodus event. Without the prose version, the sequence and details of the crossing would be unclear. However, without the poetic one—which may be a female composition—the soaring emotion of escape and the realization of God’s role in deliverance would be lost.
Fleeing from Egypt does not end the Israelites’ woes. They are far from the Promised Land, and they must cross the uninviting Sinai Peninsula. The crises they face in the wilderness—military threats and shortages of food and water—are the focus of 15:22–17:16. These predicaments foreshadow the challenges they must deal with as an agrarian people living in the highlands of the land of Israel.
Just as women and water began the story of the liberation from Egypt (Exodus 2), so too they bring it to its fulfillment. Miriam, the sister who first stood by the water (the Nile River) to watch over her baby brother, now, as a prophet, leads the women in interpreting what crossing the water (the Sea of Reeds) means. Thus, women and water frame the story of Israel’s beginnings, from servitude to freedom.

Yitro

<i>The Birth of a Nation: Israel Becomes a Covenanted People</i>
P<small>ARASHAT</small> Y<small>ITRO</small> (“Jethro”) records the transformative encounter between God and Israel at Mount Sinai, the moment when God and the people Israel become wedded in an exclusive covenantal relationship. After experiencing how God bore them “on eagles’ wings” (19:4) from Egypt, the people willingly accept God’s proposal: If they listen to God’s voice and obey the covenant, they will become God’s “treasured possession,” a “kingdom of priests and a holy nation” (19:5–6). The blare of a ram’s horn and a spectacular display of smoke, thunder, and lightning herald the appearance of the Divine. Then, the revelation of the commandments stipulate what it means to walk in God’s ways.
The teachings of the Decalogue, also known popularly as the Ten Commandments, guide the Israelites in their relationships with God and other human beings. The first four commandments charge the Israelites to worship God faithfully and to observe the Sabbath. The last five prohibit taking what is not yours: a human life, another man’s wife, or someone else’s property, either directly through stealing or indirectly through false testimony or coveting another’s belongings. The fifth commandment—a bridge between the precepts focused on the Divine and those concerned with humans—mandates reverence of one’s mother and father.
In the Decalogue, women are mentioned as mothers, wives, daughters, and servants. Elsewhere in the parashah, women play a more elusive role. Zipporah appears in the beginning of the portion, when Moses’ father-in-law, Jethro, travels to the wilderness of Sinai in order to reunite Moses with his wife, Zipporah, and their two sons. What is puzzling about this scene is that an earlier passage in Exodus suggests that Moses brought his family with him to Egypt (4:20, 24–26). When and why had she “been sent home” (18:2) to Midian?
Even more perplexing and disturbing for many contemporary readers is the question of whether women were included in, or excluded from, the revelation at Sinai. How should we interpret Moses’ command to “not go near a woman” (19:15)? Does the masculine language of the laws address women? These issues are explored at 19:8, 15; introduction to 20:1–14; 20:10, 14, as well as in Another View and Contemporary Reflection.

Mishpatim

<i>Rules for Life in a Covenant Community</i>
P<small>ARASHAT</small> M<small>ISHPATIM</small> (“rules”) presents the culmination of the covenant process that began with the preparations for the revelation on Mount Sinai (Exodus 19). While the so-called Ten Commandments articulate the general principles of the covenant between God and Israel (20:1–14), this parashah presents specific stipulations. This collection of case rulings and rules, referred to as the “Book of the Covenant” (24:7), the “Covenant Code,” or the “Covenant Collection,” covers a range of topics—from criminal and civil matters like murder, assault, and theft, to moral and religious precepts, such as treatment of the stranger and observance of the festivals. Although the stipulations in this parashah address an array of subjects, they do not constitute a comprehensive legal code. Many essential aspects of life in biblical times, like marriage, adoption, or inheritance, do not appear here.
The contents of the Book of the Covenant can be divided into two groups of laws. The rules in the first group (21:2–22:16) are formulated mainly as case laws, meaning that the text describes a specific scenario and its legal consequences: “When an ox gores a man or a woman to death, the ox shall be stoned” (21:28).
As for the second group (22:17–23:19), many of its regulations are phrased as unconditional imperatives, similar to language of the Decalogue: “You shall not boil a kid in its mother’s milk” (23:19).
<i>Parashat Mishpatim</i> refers to a remarkable number of women; however, like the men in this parashah, they are not named characters but rather different types of female figures who warranted legal consideration in certain situations. We read about the wife of the Hebrew slave (21:3–5), the daughter sold into slavery (21:7–11), the mother verbally or physically abused (21:15, 17), the female slave beaten by her master (21:20–21, 26–27), the pregnant woman who suffers a miscarriage and possible death because of a brawl (21:22–25), the woman gored by an ox (21:28–32), the unbetrothed young woman (22:15–16), the sorceress condemned to death (22:17), and the vulnerable widow (22:21–23). Furthermore, Exodus 21 repeatedly equates females and males regarding compensation for assault and injury (vv. 15, 16, 20, 26, 28, 29, 31, 32). This collection also treats other types of women implicitly, such as the slave owner (21:2, 10, and elsewhere), the debtor mother (21:7), the impudent daughter (21:15), the brawler (21:18, 22), the fatherless daughter (22:21), and more.
After Moses communicates these stipulations to the people, they voice their enthusiastic acceptance of the terms of the covenant: “All that יהוה has spoken we will faithfully do! (<i>naaseh v’nishma</i>)” (24:7). The parashah ends with Moses’ ascent of the mountain to receive two stone tablets, the physical symbol of the new legal relationship wedding God and Israel.

Terumah

<i>A Place for God: Instructions for Building the Tabernacle</i>
A<small>LTHOUGH GOD</small> is theoretically everywhere, the Israelites needed assurance of God’s constant accessibility and availability. They accomplished this—as did the other peoples of the ancient Near East—by constructing an earthly residence for God, one that would mirror the heavenly prototype in which God was presumed to dwell. With God in their midst in an earthly shrine, God’s power to protect the people and provide for their well-being would be guaranteed. Beginning with <i>parashat T’rumah</i> (“gifts”), virtually all of the rest of Exodus focuses on the portable shrine known variously as the Tabernacle (<i>Mishkan</i>) or Tent of Meeting (<i>Ohel Mo’ed</i>). Even though some of its structure and objects are reflected in today’s synagogue furnishings, the Tabernacle should not be compared to a synagogue. It was not a house of worship; and it was off limits to all but the upper echelons of the priesthood. Instead of being a place of communal worship, it was conceived of as an elaborate and costly residence for the divine presence. The word <i>Mishkan</i> comes from the root meaning “to dwell” (<i>sh-k-n</i>), which gave rise also to the well-known term <i>Shechinah</i> (see at 25:8).
The wealth of seemingly exact details in the instructions for the Tabernacle belies the fact that such a structure probably never existed. The early Israelites may have had a relatively simple tent shrine—perhaps the Tent of Meeting—that was later incorporated into the Jerusalem Temple during the monarchy. Memories of the original shrine likely were expanded as the Exodus Tabernacle account took shape centuries later, influenced by knowledge of the First and Second Temples. This is a highly constructed account, and very little of it seems to be historical.
The Tabernacle texts in Exodus—much like the sacred building texts of other ancient peoples—begin with elaborate instructions for making the <i>Mishkan</i>, its furnishings, and the priestly vestments (Exodus 25–31); some Bible scholars call these instructions the <i>prescriptive</i> Tabernacle texts. Much of this information is repeated in another lengthy section relating how the instructions were implemented (Exodus 35–40); its passages are called the <i>descriptive</i> Tabernacle texts. The Golden Calf cepisode (Exodus 32–34) separates these two pieces. It is helpful to remember that behind the mass of arcane details lies a yearning for God’s presence and an attempt to establish a relationship between divine immanence and transcendence, in other words, between God’s abilities to be “right here” and “everywhere” at the same time.
Aside from God and Moses, the only other actors in this parashah are the “people” who collectively provide the building materials. While women are not explicitly mentioned in this Torah portion, <i>parashat Vayak’heil</i> specifies that both women and men donated their possessions for the construction of the <i>Mishkan</i> (35:22, 29; 36:6) and that women were involved in producing textiles (35:25–26) and performing tasks at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting (38:8). Such passages challenge the popular impression that this holy edifice is the result of exclusively male efforts.

Tetzaveh

<i>Further Instructions: Consecration of Priests and Tabernacle</i>
P<small>ARASHAT</small> T’<small>TZAVEH</small> (“you shall instruct”) adds to the previous parashah’s elaborate instructions for constructing the Tabernacle complex and furnishings, by giving detailed information about the vestments for the priests (28:1–43). Most of this information concerns the sacral garments for the chief priestly official, Aaron. As the one whose priestly functions bring him closest to the invisible presence of God in the Holy of Holies, his apparel must be of the same order of sanctity as the materials used for the holiest areas of the tent shrine.
The next order of business concerns the consecration service (29:1–37). An investiture (or ordination) ceremony will be necessary to confer upon Aaron and his subordinates the requisite sanctity for approaching God and performing their priestly tasks. A supplement (29:38–46) gives advance information about the regular sacrifices that will take place at the Tabernacle, and about God’s availability there once the whole complex and its priests are sanctified.
Flanking the lengthy materials about vestments and consecration are two brief passages: one involves the oil for the daily ritual of lighting the lamps in the sacred tent (27:20–21), and the other the incense altar (30:1–10); both items are functionally related to the priests’ role.
The wealth of detail about Aaron and his sons provides a stark portrayal of how males dominated the communal sacred lives of the ancient Israelites. Only later, in <i>parashat Vayak’heil</i>, will the minor presence of some female personnel at the communal religious shrine become apparent. There, we read about the women who are experts in making textiles (35:25–26) and “the women who performed tasks at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting” (38:8).
In contrast to the seemingly limited participation of women in the institutions of the Tabernacle or Temple, women did play a prominent role in household religious life—carrying out religious practices deemed necessary for the well-being and survival of their families, such as rituals to achieve fertility, healthy pregnancy, and safe childbirth. Reproduction in the modern world has been medicalized; but traditional societies—including ancient Israel—addressed barrenness, difficult pregnancies and births, and infant mortality via religious practices carried out in the home. Although this information almost never emerges in the Bible, archeological and ethnographic data now provide strong evidence for these essential functions of Israelite women.

Ki Tisa

<i>Tablets, Calf, and Covenant: Mediating the Relationship with God</i>
P<small>ARASHAT</small> K<small>I</small> T<small>ISA</small> (“when you take”) is the fulcrum of a larger portion of Exodus that is concerned with figuring out how God and Israel will co-exist. The parashah begins with instructions regarding census taking and the Tabernacle furnishings, moves on to the narrative of the Golden Calf, and concludes with a series of covenantal stipulations. While these units do not present a seamless narrative, they do contain a series of thematically related scenes that all negotiate the central issue catalyzed by the Sinai event: How can God and Israel maintain a relationship that takes into account the enormous disparities between the two parties—God, who is utterly holy, and Israel, a “stiffnecked” and back-sliding nation that can achieve holiness but not maintain it?
By the end of the parashah, the text has affirmed three strategies for sustaining the relationship between God and Israel:
1.<i>Tabernacle:</i> The story of the Golden Calf is situated between the instructions for the Tabernacle (25:1–30:10) and the description of its construction (35:1–40:38). This arrangement affirms that the Tabernacle, unlike the calf, is an appropriate response to the people’s needs for a physical location where they can gain access to God.
2.<i>Covenant:</i> The parashah concludes with a reiteration of the covenant, thus providing Israel with laws to help keep its conduct acceptable to God.
3.<i>Moses</i>: While the other two strategies are more permanent, Moses emerges as the most crucial mediating strategy between God and Israel, the go-between who repeatedly pleads to God on behalf of Israel. Although Moses is resoundingly human, the voices of this parashah conspire to identify Moses more and more closely with God until even his physical being is supernaturally transformed (34:29–35).
The parashah refers to women directly in only a few places. In the account of the construction of the calf, Aaron directs the men to remove the jewelry from their wives, sons, and daughters (32:2). The legal section at the end of the parashah prohibits marriages between Israelite men and indigenous Canaanite women (34:16) and includes a polemic against <i>asherim</i> (34:13)—ritual objects probably related to the worship of the goddess Asherah.
Nevertheless, the parashah engages two issues that are central to feminist theology and theory. In wrestling with the question of how close God can be to humanity, the text raises the issue of divine immanence and transcendence, a central concern of contemporary feminist theology (see <i>Vayak’heil,</i> Another View). The parashah also highlights the importance of narrative perspective and point of view. The crucial events of the Exodus and construction of the calf are described differently by different characters. These tellings not only highlight the disparate experiences of the speakers but also serve to articulate multiple perspectives on the text’s central concerns.

Vayakhel

<i>Making a Place for God: The Tabernacle’s Components</i>
P<small>ARASHAT</small> V<small>AYAK’HEIL</small> (“he convoked”) begins the portion of Exodus known as the <i>descriptive</i> Tabernacle texts (Exodus 35–40) because they describe the implementation of the earlier instructions. God gives detailed instructions to Moses about the Tabernacle, its materials, and its personnel in Exodus 25–30, known as the <i>prescriptive</i> Tabernacle texts because they prescribe what is to be done. While the Golden Calf episode in <i>Ki Tisa</i> seems to interrupt the Tabernacle account, its overall message—that the people can sin and still have their covenant with God affirmed—may be an integral part of the Tabernacle concept. The Golden Calf incident indicates that the people seem to doubt God’s presence among them and God’s commitment to them. Only after that incident is resolved, with God and the people reconciled, can they proceed to build the shrine. The people now feel sure that God will be with them even if they do disobey God’s word.
The disobedience that marks the preceding parashah now contrasts sharply with the people’s willing complicity in carrying out the directives for building the Tabernacle. An introductory unit (35:1–36:7) reviews the Sabbath precept, describes the collection of donations, and designates the artisans who are to collect and use the materials. The next three units report the implementation of God’s commands to build the Tabernacle: the tent (36:8–38), its furnishings (37:1–29), and the courtyard with its installations (38:1–20).
Much of the information presented in the elaborate instructions for making the Tabernacle and priestly vestments (the prescriptive texts in Exodus 25–31) is repeated, at times word-for-word, in this parashah and the next. While the content of the accounts is almost identical, the order is significantly different. Instead of presenting the components in order of degree of sanctity—starting with the Ark and the other golden furnishings—the description of their fabrication proceeds according to technological logic: first the structure itself is erected (36:8–38), then the interior furnishings are made (37:1–29), and finally the courtyard and its installations are constructed (38:1–20). The descriptive texts are somewhat briefer because they omit information about how items are to be used, indicating an interest in fabrication rather than function. Another major difference is that in the descriptive texts Moses is much more prominent than Aaron—the dominant figure in the prescriptive passages. It is fitting that Aaron is less important following the Golden Calf episode, since he was considered complicit in the people’s sinfulness.
Although the priestly personnel apparently are all men, as are the chief artisans, women appear in this parashah as significant contributors of materials. They also are the ones who turn the raw materials of textile production into the requisite fabrics. Because woven fabrics are key components of the tent shrine, the skilled labor of female artisans (35:25–26) is integral to the construction of the Tabernacle (see also <i>T’rumah</i>, Another View; <i>P’kudei,</i> Another View). In addition, the surprising mention of “women who performed tasks at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting” (38:8) hints at roles performed by women at the sanctuary.

Pekudei

<i>Completing and Consecrating the Tabernacle</i>
P<small>ARASHAT</small> P<small>’KUDEI</small> (“records [of]”) brings to a conclusion the long Tabernacle narrative and the book of Exodus. In this book, the Israelites have been transformed from slaves building store cities for Pharaoh (1:11–14) into a free people building a “home” for the God who will now dwell among them (25:8). Once the Tabernacle is completed, God’s presence fills the sacred space. Just as God’s cloud and fire led the Israelites from the Sea of Reeds to Sinai and then hovered over the holy mountain, God will now be with them when the wilderness journey resumes, as recounted in the book of Numbers.
As the parashah begins, the Israelites have fabricated all the components of the tent and its enclosure, interior, and courtyard furnishings (see <i>parashat Vayak’heil</i>) now they inventory the collected materials (38:21–31). Only the instructions for the priestly vestments given in <i>parashat T’tzaveh</i> (28:1–43) have not yet been fulfilled. Thus, before the Israelites erect and dedicate the Tabernacle, they must make the garments for Aaron and his descendants (39:1–31). The description of the vestments here is quite similar to that of the earlier instructions. However, there are some differences, most notably the virtual absence of Aaron’s name, even though he serves as the chief priestly official (the “high priest”). Instead, the final part of Exodus returns to highlighting Aaron’s brother, Moses, and his special relationship with God.
After reporting that the vestments are completed, the text presents a final summation of the construction work (39:33–43), after which the actual assembly of the shrine can begin. God gives Moses the orders to set up the Tabernacle and install its furnishings (40:1–8) and then to consecrate them and also the priests (40:9–16). All the pieces now come together under the leadership of Moses, who carries out God’s commandments to erect the shrine and place its furnishings in the proper place (40:17–33). With the Tabernacle complete, God’s presence enters this sumptuous earthly abode (40:34–38). Some of the language here evokes the creation of the world in Genesis 1, reflecting the momentous significance that the text bestows upon this event.
Once everything is complete, Moses reviews the work and blesses the Israelites (39:43). Finally, God’s invisible presence fills the <i>Mishkan</i> (40:34–35). In contrast to the prior Torah portion, where women (and men) are mentioned explicitly as contributors to the Tabernacle and as participants in essential aspects of its construction and service, here neither women nor men are directly visible as such, apart from three specified leaders. Rather, those women (and men) remain in view while their gender recedes into the background. Indirectly—as previously mentioned donors, fabricators, and members of the collective Israelite community—they are included in the final account of the sacred portable structure erected so that God “may dwell among them” (25:8; 29:46).

Vayikra

<b>ויקרא ✦<i>Vayikra</i></b>
<small>LEVITICUS</small>
L<small>EVITICUS AIMS TO</small> shape the Israelites into a holy people and to safeguard the purity that it considers essential for contact with the holy. The Hebrew name, <i>Vayikra</i> (“and [God] called”), refers to God’s summoning Moses and giving him the instructions that constitute most of the book. The English name “Leviticus” refers to Levi, a son of Leah and Jacob and the ancestor of the priests.
Leviticus reflects the perception that God’s created world is fundamentally harmonious, good, and orderly (as in Genesis 1). To preserve God’s orderly world, where everything has an assigned place, Leviticus specifies what must be done whenever boundaries are wrongfully crossed, be they boundaries of the body, time, or space—such as between sacred and non-sacred, or between life and death. In this book’s worldview, anyone who breaks God’s ordained harmony can—and must—repair it. Rituals, including sacrifices, serve to cancel or neutralize damage done to the created order and thereby restore the equilibrium.
In Leviticus, a person’s body, the sanctuary, and the community each constitute a microcosm of the universe in its sacred aspect. Each reflects and has an impact upon the larger, integrated whole. Consequently, holiness and purity are relevant to all aspects of Israelite life; they apply not merely to the sanctuary, but also to the body and the home. Therefore, the book legislates laws about food (Leviticus 11), sexual relations (Leviticus 18 and 20), and ethics (Leviticus 19), in addition to providing extensive instructions about sacrificial offerings (Leviticus 1–7). Although the priests have a unique role, all Israelites must be holy, for God is holy (see at 19:2).
Contemporary scholars ascribe Leviticus to priestly circles also responsible for other portions of the Torah (such as Genesis 1, the Tabernacle accounts in Exodus 25–40, and most of Numbers). Such scholars often differentiate between two priestly writings: the Priestly collection (Leviticus 1–16) that they call “P,” and the Holiness Code (Leviticus 17–26) that they call “H,” with Leviticus 27 as an appendix. While P emphasizes the unique privileges and responsibilities of the priests (defined as Aaron and his sons), H widens the notion of holiness to apply to all Israelites. For P, the priests (<i>kohanim</i>) and the Tabernacle are the exclusive intermediaries (and guardians) with regard to God’s holiness; H, however, focuses on the people themselves as the vehicle for God’s holiness.
Although Leviticus mentions only one woman by name (the otherwise unknown Shelomith; see at 24:11), many of its teachings clearly apply to women as members of the Israelite community. Like the men, women are bound by the book’s various laws and must refrain from actions that may contaminate God’s sanctuary or the community. In addition, Leviticus includes three types of laws uniquely relevant to women:
1.<i>Regulations about the processes by which women regain access to the sanctuary after childbirth and menstruation.</i> These conditions, like other conditions that pertain to the nexus between life and death (such as seminal emission for men), require ritual purification before normal life patterns may be resumed (see at Leviticus 12 and 15).
2.<i>Laws about sexual relations.</i> Regulations about prohibited sexual relationships demarcate for an Israelite male those women whose sexuality belongs to another man and are therefore forbidden to him; they also identify kinship structures that help locate women in the family constellation (see at Leviticus 18 and 20). Laws like these indicate that typically a woman’s sexuality is only partly under her control. For example, as Judith Wegner notes, “an unmarried girl’s biological function belongs legally to her father.” According to Wegner, this does not mean a man could do with his daughter as he pleased. Rather, “the Torah certainly expects a father to protect his daughter’s chastity until she reaches puberty and is married off” (“Leviticus,” 1992, p. 45; but see <i>Acharei Mot,</i> Another View, as well as at 18:10–17 and 20:17).
3.<i>Laws specifically concerning women in priestly families.</i> These include regulations as to whom a priest may marry (see at Leviticus 21), as well as when women may partake of the special holy portions designated for the priests.
Through all of these regulations, Leviticus shows, even when not addressing women, how women contribute to Israel’s quest for a holy life.

<i>A Call to Approach God</i>
P<small>ARASHAT</small> V<small>AYIKRA</small> (“and [God] called”) introduces one of the most challenging texts for contemporary readers. This portion begins the instructions on how to approach God by means of sacrificial offerings. Animal sacrifices are foreign to most modern readers and offensive to many. They were, however, integral to most recorded worship practices in the ancient Near Eastern and Mediterranean regions. Sacrifice continued well into the Common Era as the major way to approach the gods and to thank or appease them. Provisions for animal sacrifice are also included in the Koran, the sacred text of Islam.
Scholars of religion, attempting to understand the practice of animal sacrifice in the ancient world, suggest a number of possible explanations for why the practice endured. The rationale most frequently expressed in extrabiblical sources is that gods need to be fed as well as propitiated. Furthermore, life and fertility are gifts from the gods—gifts for which humans must show appreciation by offering something precious in return. In agricultural societies, the intimate connection between livestock and persons fostered an understanding that certain domestic animals could substitute for a human life. While these suggested explanations pertain to explicit reasons, some scholars link the pervasiveness of sacrifices in antiquity with a community’s unacknowledged desire to reduce violence. Ritual slaughtering of animals as opposed to random killings, the explanation goes, would channel people’s aggression into a socially constructive function and away from other forms of violence.
Israelite religion officially rejected an older idea that God requires sustenance like human beings. Nevertheless, it kept the <i>practice</i> of offering sacrifices as a way of serving God. The Hebrew word usually translated as “sacrifice,” <i>korban</i>, implies coming close to God (the root <i>k-r-b</i> that forms <i>korban</i> also means “to come near”) and is better translated as “near-offering.” One underlying rationale for many biblical sacrifices is to express gratitude for one’s good fortune; another rationale is that it is a means of returning the best to God—much like the payment of rent to a venerable landowner. In addition, certain sacrifices are aimed at helping people deal with the guilt of wrongdoing and with the impurity of sin, so that Israel would be on good terms with their Deity.
Sociologically speaking, sacrificial rites in antiquity served to bind community by providing a common meal that made scarce and costly meat available to many. Certain sacrifices functioned like a neighborhood barbecue celebrating a modern holiday: an opportunity to socialize and to eat well. Leviticus, however, seems to sanction killing an animal and eating its meat only as part of a sacrificial offering.
Although sacrifices form the major focus of this parashah, the concluding section expresses a deep concern with social and economic justice (see 5:20–26). Defrauding another person constitutes a sin against God; yet one must make amends to the injured party before offering a sacrifice to God.
The legislation in this parashah applies equally to Israelite women and men. Its terminology is pointedly gender inclusive, implying that women are expected to bring offerings. A later passage, Leviticus 12:6–8, explicitly addresses a situation in which a woman must bring two of the sacrifices mentioned in this parashah. Other biblical texts also describe women’s participation in sanctuary-centered activities. In I Samuel 1, Elkanah’s wives—Hannah and Peninnah—regularly visit the sanctuary with him, as do his daughters. Moreover, he and Hannah present and slaughter the offering that she has brought there, as payment for a vow. Many scholars hold that women’s religious activities were even more extensive than can be garnered from these texts (see Another View; “Women in Ancient Israel—An Overview.”) Nevertheless, Leviticus authorizes only men from the family of Aaron to serve as priests in the sanctuary (see in the next parashah at 6:2).

Tzav

<i>The Priestly Torah and the Priests’ Ordination</i>
P<small>ARASHAT</small> T<small>ZAV</small> (“issue a command”) continues with instructions about sacrificial offerings that began in Leviticus 1–5. However, whereas 1:1–2 began with instructions to all the people of Israel, 6:1 starts with a command specifically addressed to the priests. The first section of the parashah (Leviticus 6–7) contains instructions about the priests’ portions from the sacrificial rituals. The second section (Leviticus 8) records the ordination of the priests.
In establishing a sacrificial system and a professional priesthood, biblical Israel resembled other ancient cultures. One notes, however, two differences. First, priests in most cultures in the ancient world kept the secrets of their profession away from the public eye and transmitted them privately from generation to generation. In contrast, Leviticus reflects a commitment to keep the rules of the trade, as it were, in public view.
A second difference is that neighboring cultures such as Mesopotamia included women priests (even though they did not perform the same rituals as male priests), whereas the Bible recognizes only male priests. Scholars concur, however, that women played an important role in many facets of popular religion in ancient Israel (as did men), even though the priestly teachings in Leviticus do not acknowledge or discuss such roles.
Although <i>parashat Tzav</i> does not mention women explicitly, it treats three areas that do involve women. The first pertains to the roles and possible privileges of women as members of priests’ families. Such women apparently benefit from the priests’ share of sacrificial foods. There is a question, however, whether they may eat the part of the offering designated as “most holy” (see Another View).
The second area concerning women pertains to the highly valued, formal priestly garments (see Exodus 28 and Leviticus 8). Archeological and biblical evidence shows that women excelled in weaving, spinning, and sewing (see at Exodus 35:25; <i>T’tzaveh</i>, Another View; <i>P’kudei</i>, Another View). Therefore, we may assume that women made the priestly garments. According to the book of Samuel, each year Hannah made and brought a special garment for her son Samuel who served at the sanctuary at Shiloh (1 Samuel 2:19). Plausibly priests’ mothers and wives likewise made clothing for their family members.
The third area to consider is whether women were among those who offered the sacrifices that these passages discuss. Biblical references elsewhere do suggest that Israelite women, like Israelite men, worshipped and sacrificed in the shrines—often as part of their households. For example, according to Leviticus 12:6 and 15:29, women are obligated to offer sacrifices after childbirth and irregular bleeding. Proverbs 7:14 presents a female persona who mentions her need to offer the well-being offerings. And in I Samuel 1, Hannah and her husband present and slaughter the offering that she has brought— together with a portion of flour and a jar of wine—to the shrine in Shiloh as payment for a vow.
(On the widespread ancient practice of offering sacrifices and its rationale, and on the role of sacrifices in ancient Israel, see the introduction to the previous parashah, pp. 569–71.)

Shmini

<i>Purity and Danger in the Sanctuary and the Home</i>
P<small>ARASHAT</small> S<small>H’MINI</small> (“eighth,” referring to the eighth day of ordination) describes the ritual on the day after Aaron’s ordination ceremony. In the previous two parashot, Leviticus 1–7 presented rules for the sacrificial service, while Leviticus 8 described the priestly ordination of Aaron and his sons. In this parashah, Aaron begins to officiate as chief priest.
This parashah includes a strange story of the fire from God which kills Nadab and Abihu, Aaron’s oldest sons (10:1–7). It concludes with dietary laws and with the demand that Israel be holy—for God is holy (11:45). In this parashah, the theme of holiness expands from the sanctuary to the priests and to the people.
Contemporary readers are often troubled by the descriptions of the sacrificial service. Nevertheless, sacrifice was an integral part of society in the ancient Near East. Every major city in antiquity had its temple where specially ordained priests conducted animal sacrifices. As elsewhere in antiquity, Leviticus also demands that no one can eat meat unless a portion of it is offered first as a sacrifice to God. The sacrificial altar is God’s dining table.
This parashah says practically nothing about women. Many temples in the ancient world included women as priests, but ancient Israel seems to have recognized only males in this role (see <i>T’tzaveh</i>, Another View; and at 9:1). Although the priestly laws in the Bible mostly concern men, priests’ daughters—and presumably wives—were able to partake of some of the offerings, as 10:14 indicates (see also 22:12–13).
Of special relevance to women are the dietary laws in Leviticus. These apply to all Israelites. However, because women were responsible for food preparation, they were responsible for applying these laws (see at Leviticus 11).

Tazria

<i>Purity, Birth, and Illness</i>
P<small>RASHAT</small> T<small>AZRIA</small> continues the theme of ritual purity that extends also to <i>parashat M’tzora</i> (Leviticus 14–15). While Leviticus 12 deals with the impurity of the woman who suffers from bleeding after childbirth, Leviticus 15 will concern women and men who experience other kinds of genital discharge, both normal and abnormal. The intervening passage, Leviticus 13–14, concerns <i>tzaraat</i>—certain growths on skin, fabric, or leather. Traditionally the term has been translated as “leprosy,” but in English “leprosy” nowadays refers to something other than the conditions that the Torah describes.
<i>Parashat Tazria</i> thus includes two different subjects: (<i>1</i>) the impurity from childbirth (Leviticus 12); and (<i>2</i>) the diagnosis of and regulations concerning skin, garments, and leather goods with certain kinds of surface eruptions (Leviticus 13). Common to both, however, is the Israelite notion that physical conditions can produce a pollution that affects not only the party afflicted but also the sanctuary—the abode of the divine Presence. Therefore, the individuals affected must not “touch any consecrated thing, nor enter the sanctuary” during prescribed periods (12:4). Being denied access to holiness extends to all whom the Torah considers impure <i>(tamei).</i> Certain sins also result in the pollution of Israel’s holy place (see, for example, 16:16, 18:24–25, 20:3).
The common denominator regarding all the physical conditions that produce impurity is their association with the nexus of life and death. Numbers 12 shows that the Israelites associated <i>tzaraat</i> with death: when Miriam is stricken with it, Aaron pleads, “Let her not be as a stillbirth [literally “a dead person”] which emerges from its mother’s womb with half its flesh eaten away!” (12:12). In the Torah, blood is synonymous with life (Genesis 9:4; Leviticus 17:14). Vaginal blood had an even greater significance for some of the ancients, who thought that it contained the seed that united with the male seed (semen) to produce a human being (Jacob Milgrom, <i>Leviticus 1–16</i>, 1991, pp. 744, 767, 950). As menstrual fluid, it signified a lost opportunity to create life, thus linked with the process of death. This applied as well to the person who suffered from scale disease.
The legislation in Leviticus 12 and its focus upon the menstruating woman have had an enormous impact upon the lives of Jewish women. (For the practical consequences of impurity for women in ancient Israel, see the introduction to <i>parashat M’tzora</i>.) The view that women—via their normal, recurring bodily functions—generate a pollution antagonistic to holiness served as a justification for women’s distance from the sacred throughout Jewish history. Women were disqualified from the Israelite priesthood perhaps because of fear that the sudden onset of menstruation would result in the clash of impurity and holiness, with presumed dire consequences. (For a different perspective, see <i>T’tzaveh,</i> Another View.) After the destruction of the Temple, which was the focus for the laws of ritual purity, women were often prevented from having contact with a Torah scroll, for example, because of the fear of giving affront to God by approaching in an impure state. The basis for many of the restrictions imposed upon the menstruant and the woman who gave birth was found not in Jewish law but rather in popular custom, which triumphed despite the objections of some rabbis. In addition to her participation in public religious life, the private life of the Jewish woman was affected: she and her husband were not allowed to engage in sexual relations during extensive periods of time, which greatly impacted her fertility and married life in general.

Metzora

<i>Restoring Ritual Purity</i>
P<small>ARASHAT</small> M<small>’TZORA</small> (“a person with <i>tzaraat</i>,” that is, a skin affliction) completes the laws in Leviticus about impurity. Along with the preceding parashah, <i>Tazria</i> (Leviticus 12–13), this parashah deals with laws about individuals afflicted with <i>nega tzaraat</i>, sometimes translated as “scaly disease” (the traditional translation as “leprosy” is somewhat misleading; see below) and with genital discharges.
Reflected in this passage is the Torah’s notion that certain actions and physical conditions produce an invisible, airborne pollution that invades the Sanctuary, the dwelling place of the divine Presence. (The Torah’s theology, like that in the extant literature of Israel’s ancient neighbors, imagines that the Deity can simultaneously dwell in a temple and in heaven, and that the earthly sanctuary is a smaller replica of its heavenly counterpart.) If the impurity is not disposed of, the accumulated pollution could cause Israel’s God to abandon the Sanctuary, an event thought to bring about national disaster.
It should be emphasized, however, that in Leviticus <i>tzaraat</i> does not imply any sin on the part of the individual and that God is not depicted as the cause of <i>tzaraat</i> (except when it strikes the house; see at 14:34). For a rationale for Israel’s impurity laws, see the introduction to Leviticus 14.
Leviticus 15 is one among several biblical texts that have played a role in forming the Israelite and Jewish attitudes to menstruation. The perspective in this parashah lacks the stigma attached to menstruation in other biblical passages (see at 15:24). In Leviticus 15, the woman and man are equally impure if they have sexual relations while the woman is menstruating; the purification period and process for each is identical (15:24).
The Hebrew term <i>niddah</i> refers to a menstruant woman or menstruation. <i>Niddah</i> renders a woman impure, just as a man’s seminal ejection renders a man impure, and their impurity contaminates whatever they touch or sit on. The major difference, however, between a male’s ejaculation and female menstruation is the duration of impurity: since menstruation lasts longer, the woman is in the impure state considerably longer than the man.
According to Leviticus, what are the practical consequences for the person who is deemed ritually impure? The impure person may not “touch any consecrated thing, nor enter the sanctuary” (12:4). <i>Parashat M’tzora</i> offers us a detailed account of restrictions placed upon the menstruant as well, but it does not provide a complete picture of the ways that menstruation was viewed in ancient Israel. On the practical impact of menstruation on a woman’s life, see at 15:20.

Achrei Mot

<i>Boundaries of Rituals: The Sanctuary and the Body</i>
A<small>T THE ROOT OF</small> <i>parashat Acharei Mot</i> (“after the death [of]”) is the question of change. How is it that a person undergoes a transformation? What does it mean and how does it change her orientation to the Divine? The priestly writers also wonder how the people of Israel can undergo a collective change. The answer they provide is that change comes about through properly performed ritual. The priestly writers credited with much of Leviticus advocate constant change. According to them, the body itself is an ongoing process of flux.
Fascinated with the body and the body politic, the priests speculate that both have the potential to reach purity and optimal holiness. The converse is also true—the body can become impure and the community tainted by transgression. Neither the state of impurity nor the state of purity is eternal. Both are time bound and set within a spectrum of gradations between purity and impurity. Priestly ritual mediates between these states, and it demarcates them so that individual and community alike can know where they stand in relation to God and to others.
The body is not at fault for entering the state of impurity, which can be reversed through time and water. As it develops, priestly thought comes to consider the states of purity and impurity as larger than the physical body and affected by moral transgressions as well. This parashah combines two strata of priestly thought that modern critical scholars label as “P” for the Priestly School (Leviticus 16) and “H” for the Holiness School (Leviticus 17–18). The holiness of the sanctuary most concerns the P source, whereas the sacred nature of the land most concerns the H source. Both sources grant contaminating and purifying power to blood. Whereas Leviticus 16 attends to transformation, Leviticus 17 stipulates how people should introduce holiness into their diet.
Women must read and write themselves into the holy community presented in the H source. When Leviticus 18 specifically mentions women, it is in terms of the dangerous and potentially contaminating force of their sexuality. They are figures in the household whose bodies require policing. Leviticus 18 circumscribes the bodies of female relatives as forbidden, thus setting up a system of protection within the domestic domain. At the same time, these safeguards designate women as extensions of their husbands, brothers, and grandfathers and thereby restrict them. Such techniques are classic means of limiting women’s freedom.

Kedoshim

<i>A Call to Holiness</i>
P<small>ARASHAT</small> K<small>’DOSHIM</small> (“holy”) stands at the physical center of the Torah, coming roughly at the midway point between Genesis 1 and Deuteronomy 34. We move into this Torah portion on the heels of a series of sexual taboos (Leviticus 18), and we will end the parashah with a parallel list of taboos (Leviticus 20). Between these two sections, we encounter one of the most beautiful and inspiring passages in the Torah, Leviticus 19. This passage contains a series of seemingly disparate laws covering the gamut from ritual, criminal, and civil legislation to commandments addressing attitudes. The laws touch upon what people do in the privacy of their own homes, how they conduct their business, what they are thinking, and how they worship together. The modern distinctions between criminal, civil, and religious law have absolutely no application in this text.
The primary theme that emerges time and again in Leviticus 19 is the preservation of holiness. “You shall be holy, for I, your God יהוה, am holy.” All the commandments are set within the context that God is holy and that we ought to strive toward holiness in every aspect of our lives.
Holiness here differs radically from what we have encountered in previous Torah texts. Leviticus 19 offers a fundamentally new vision of holiness, one that has the potential to bring women and other disenfranchised populations within Israel into the realm of holiness. No longer limited to the male, hereditary priesthood, <i>parashat K’doshim</i> democratizes access to and relationship with the Divine in a new way.
Within the particular laws of this parashah, women figure rather prominently as we hear about mothers, daughters, wives, and slaves. The tendency is to protect the rights of women in particularly vulnerable positions. We might wish for equality, and thus a complete dismantling of the practice of categorizing women only in relation to men in the biblical period. The Holiness Code (Leviticus 17–26) does not go that far; however, it is somewhat progressive given its ancient context.

Emor

<i>Preserving the Holiness of Priests, Times, and Spaces</i>
P<small>RASHAT</small> E<small>MOR</small> (“say”) continues the holiness-centered legislation of the previous parashah. It, too, is part of the Holiness Code—the collection of laws in Leviticus 17–26, which modern critical scholars refer to as “H” and attribute to a specific group of reform-minded priests.
This parashah contains instructions concerning the sanctity of the priests and the sacrificial offerings, the weekly Sabbath and annual festivals, and the maintenance of the Tabernacle lamp and showbread. The parashah ends with a story about the crime and punishment of a blasphemer. It also includes brief legal conclusions about damages governed by the retaliation principle (Latin: <i>lex talionis;</i> sometimes referred to via the biblical expression “eye for an eye”). In discussing the priests, the writers distinguish between three types: the chief priest, other priests who may officiate, and those who may receive some of the benefits but cannot carry out public roles because of disqualifying circumstances.
Several issues related to women arise in <i>parashat Emor.</i> Leviticus 21 provides strict guidelines for priests regarding various areas of family life, including which women in their family they can bury, which women they can marry, and how they must respond to a daughter’s sexual misbehavior. Leviticus 22, discussing who may partake of the priest’s portion of the sacred donations, addresses the question of when a priest’s daughter is considered a part of his household and would thus be entitled to part of her father’s share. Additionally, 24:10-14 mentions Shelomith, daughter of Dibri of the tribe of Dan, one of the few named individuals in all of Leviticus, and the only named woman. Shelomith’s unnamed son, whose father is an unnamed Egyptian, commits an act of blasphemy, and the Israelite judicial system must determine how to respond to this crime. This episode raises the question of who in the community must comply with the divine commandments.

Behar

<i>Proclaiming and Protecting Liberty</i>
P<small>ARASHAT</small> B<small>’HAR</small> (“at the mountain [of]”) contains laws that aim to protect economically disadvantaged members of the community from permanently losing their freedom and means of livelihood. In Israel, as in other parts of the ancient Near East, those households that fell into economically precarious situations risked losing their land; moreover, their members might become indentured servants or slaves. Israel, like its neighbors, developed legislation to prevent the rich from exploiting the poor. This parashah highlights economic and social concerns through a theological lens. In the process, it expresses what it means for the Israelites to be both a holy people and God’s freed servants. Ethics and social justice do not constitute a separate sphere from ritual in the book of Leviticus but are integral to it. See, for example, the laws at the end of <i>parashat Vayikra</i> (5:20–26). <i>Parashat B’har</i> illustrates how the demand for holiness needs to be implemented in socio-economic practices, making it possible for economically disadvantaged Israelites to “come back home” to family and land.
Leviticus 25, like Exodus 21 and Deuteronomy 15, seeks to provide a safety net to preserve and protect land-holdings and economic stability. In other parts of the ancient Near East, kings issued royal edicts in an attempt to restore economic balance by canceling certain debts, especially when the rulers ascended to the throne. The jubilee legislation envisions a permanently regulated system for adjusting economic imbalance every 50 years, independently of the goodwill of rulers. The legislation also serves to protect the land itself from exploitation. The rationale for land protection is theological: the land belongs to God; moreover, the destiny of the land and of the people are intertwined.
The laws include the following: (1) land must lie fallow every seventh year and in the fiftieth (jubilee) year; (2) land holdings must return to their original owners at the jubilee year or be redeemed earlier; (3) indentured servants or slaves must be released at the jubilee year or be redeemed earlier. Leviticus 25 is the only place in the Torah that describes the jubilee laws. Its laws, however, stand in tension with those in Exodus and Deuteronomy that institute release in the seventh year.
The only women explicitly mentioned in this parashah are slaves or servants (the Hebrew <i>amah</i> could mean either; see at v. 44). Leviticus 25:6–7 states that female slaves or servants, like male ones, are to benefit from the land’s Sabbath; vv. 44–46 state that foreign slaves, including women, are to remain slaves in perpetuity (unlike Israelite slaves).
The language of release and redemption in the parashah takes the masculine form but functions inclusively to refer to both women and men. Other biblical texts illuminate how such laws would apply to women. Narratives such as Numbers 27 and 36 describe women inheriting land; II Kings 4, 6, and Nehemiah 5 depict situations in which women are subject to loss of freedom and land due to destitution; Jeremiah 34 refers to the release of female slaves; and Ruth 4 describes the redemption of land sold by Naomi. Clearly, conditions that drive persons into servitude—and the resolutions of those conditions that Leviticus requires—apply to women as well as to men.

<i>Ensuring Obedience to God, and the Sanctuary’s Welfare</i>
P<small>ARASHAT</small> B<small>’CHUKOTAI</small> (“my laws”) concludes Leviticus, a book devoted to instructing the people of Israel how to conduct their lives in keeping with their status as God’s people. The first part of the parashah seeks to ensure obedience to these instructions by providing strong motivation in the form of a series of blessings and curses. God, through Moses, promises the people prosperity and peace if they follow the path laid out by God; and God threatens them with famine, war, and eventually exile, if they choose to spurn God’s laws and commandments (26:3–46). The second part of the parashah (27:1–34) is an appendix that addresses issues related to communal funding, especially of the priesthood and of the sanctuary.
Explicit information about women in these passages, while scant, does shed some additional light on their status and the nature of their household responsibilities in ancient Israel. Especially significant for our understanding of the status of women in this culture is the material in 27:3–7, which lists monetary equivalents for the worth of individuals whose services are vowed to the temple. Leviticus, we learn, bases these assessments and values on a combination of the factors of age and gender (see also Another View).
In addition, the content of 27:1–25, which deals with vows and gifts of property to the temple, touches upon several other issues that relate to the lives of women in ancient Israel, such as whose vows were binding and under what conditions, who could partake in the priests’ portion of sacrificial animals (a major source of food for priests and their households), and who could inherit and possess property. While Leviticus 27 does not directly deal with these issues, all of them are crucial for those wishing to understand the significance of the instruction in this text for women in ancient Israel.
The explicit reference in 26:26 to women who bake bread further highlights the lives of women.

Bamidbar

<b>במדבר ✦<i>B’midbar</i></b>
<small>NUMBERS</small>
T<small>HE BOOK OF</small> N<small>UMBERS</small> records the Israelites’ forty years’ journey from Sinai to the plains (or steppes) of Moab, their last stop before entering the Promised Land. The book begins with a census that numbers the eligible fighting men among the people who left Egypt—hence the English name “Numbers.” Yet it is the Hebrew name of the book, <i>B’midbar</i> (“in the wilderness [of]”), that aptly captures the challenges the book describes. Wilderness is a place—or time—without orienting landmarks or structure. Numbers charts the journey through a wilderness and attempts to create new structures in this intermediary space for future life in the land.
The book is itself a kind of wilderness, a seemingly chaotic combination of narratives, laws, and lists that can be roughly divided into three parts. Numbers’ narrative begins where Exodus 40 left off. The first part describes orderly preparations and departure from Sinai, where the Israelites had camped for two years (Numbers 1–10). The second part describes descent into chaos, with the Israelites’ (mis)-adventures during the journey. This section is marked by “murmurings” and rebellions, and their dire consequences (Numbers 11–25), including God’s decision to doom the generation of the Exodus to die in the wilderness. The third part describes the preparation of the new generation for life in the Promised Land (Numbers 26–37).
The book’s major themes include: conflicts and decisions over leadership, worship and sanctuary, and land inheritance. Numbers reflects competition over legitimate priesthood between the line of Aaron and other members from the tribe of Levi, to which Moses and Miriam also belong. The book grants the priesthood solely to men of the line of Aaron and only secondary responsibilities for the sanctuary to the rest of the men of Levi, known as Levites. Like Leviticus, Numbers is also concerned with ritual purity and thus it likewise prescribes steps to guard the sanctity of the sanctuary as well as the purity of all who approach it. Critical scholars typically question the book’s historical accuracy as a depiction of life in the wilderness; they conclude that Israel’s memory of this period was shaped over a long period of time, and that the laws and narratives in Numbers come primarily from priestly sources (see Women and Interpretation of the Torah).
Women appear more prominently in Numbers than in Leviticus—both as those to whom laws apply and as active figures in narratives; they play a significant role in nine out of thirty-six chapters.
Although most of the laws in Numbers pertain to women and men alike, some specifically concern women. These include the case of the wife suspected of adultery (Numbers 5:11–31), which describes the ordeal she must undergo in such a situation; the laws about vows (Numbers 30) that delineate who determines what vows a woman must honor; and laws of inheritance for when a man dies without a will and has daughters but no sons (Numbers 27 and 36).
Whereas the case of the suspected wife and that of vows have women as their object of concern, the stories about inheritance present women as subjects: women who take action and initiate a new ruling that enables them as well as future women to inherit their ancestral land if their father has no sons. Here, five sisters named Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah (also known as Zelophehad’s daughters) argue their case before Israel’s leaders and the larger community, thereby effecting change. Perhaps most astonishing, their story also depicts a situation in which a Torah law emerges not from Sinai but from the women themselves (for details, see at Numbers 27 and 36).
Other stories include Miriam’s (and Aaron’s) challenge to Moses in Numbers 12 and the stories about dangerous women, especially foreign women (see the case of the Moabite/Midianite women in Numbers 25 and 33 who are depicted as luring Israel away from God). Ultimately, little can be determined from Numbers about the actual lives of women in ancient Israel. Yet one can conclude from this book that women were perceived as a force to contend with, as well as a source for Torah.

<i>The Architecture of a Count and the Architecture of Account</i>
T<small>HE SACRED SPACE</small> described in <i>parashat B’midbar</i> bridges the end of Exodus and the beginning of Numbers. Exodus concludes with a magisterial description of the Tabernacle and the priests—both resplendent in the colorful handiwork of Israelite women. Once God’s presence fills the Tabernacle and not even Moses can enter, a distinction between Divine and human becomes clear. Leviticus follows, with laws concerning how to negotiate this boundary between Divine and human. Numbers then returns to the topic with which Exodus ends. In Numbers the perspective is widened to include the formation in which Israel camps with the Tabernacle at its center. The Tabernacle complex, with its collapsible boundaries and open spaces, creates a sense of order in the unfamiliar chaos of the wilderness. The Tabernacle also helps orient the Israelites in the vast expanse of that wilderness, since they stay or go based on the ascent and descent of the cloud of God’s Presence. In this sense, God lives amidst the Israelites throughout their journey to the Promised Land.
“Numbers,” the English name of the book, alludes to the social organization of the Israelites and the two censuses that frame the book (Numbers 1 and 26); the Hebrew title, <i>B’midbar</i> (from the first distinctive word, meaning “in the wilderness [of]”), highlights the transitory setting of the narrative. The contrast between these two titles reflects a tension between order and chaos, culture and nature, obedience and rebellion that characterizes the book and drives its plot. This type of tension also suffuses the concept of holiness that operates in this book, in which one recognizes both the creative and the destructive power of God. While contact with God makes Israel holy, encountering God without preparation is potentially lethal.
Although the scrupulous detail of this parashah and other parts of the book may not immediately grip the reader, the underlying idea is that the ordering of the community—and by extension, one’s life—creates the space for encounters with the Divine. The power of this book emerges from the image of the encampment’s concentric rectangles radiating inward to a core of supreme holiness. In this geometry of moving from the periphery to the center, the tribes encamp around the Levites, who encircle the high priestly family, who surround the Tabernacle’s curtained walls that enclose the court that buffers the Holy of Holies. This symmetry—constructed on the ground as well as in prose—is a collective act of ordering chaos that emulates the creation of the world in Genesis 1:1–2:4.
<i>Parashat B’midbar</i> illustrates how hierarchies in a given society are “spatialized,” meaning that its power structures are evident in the physical spaces of the society, such as city plans or religious architecture. In Numbers, for example, the arrangement of the camp favors the sons of Aaron as <i>kohanim</i> (priests), whereas the marching order gives prominence to the sons of Judah. Military language and concepts infuse the description of the camp’s arrangement. It is not surprising, therefore, that women do not appear in this parashah; counting conceals the female presence in the community. (For a somewhat different perspective on women’s apparent absence, see Another View.)

Nasso

<i>Suspicion and Sanctity</i>
I<small>N THE OPENING UNITS</small> of the book of Numbers, the Israelites organize themselves for their trek to the Promised Land. Not only must they navigate through the wilderness a group that the Torah claims to include more than two million individuals (600,000 fighting men—plus women, children, and other males), but also they must maintain the proper worship of God throughout their journey.
<i>Parashat Naso</i> (“lift up”) focuses on the Israelite cultic structures throughout the journey. Two detailed administrative accounts frame this parashah: the Levite census (4:21–49) and the record of the tribal chiefs’ gifts for the dedication of the altar (7:1–88). Whereas Leviticus typically focuses on the ritual purity of the sanctuary, Numbers is concerned with maintaining the purity of the camp as a whole.
The Israelites can protect this purity through the service of sanctified individuals like the <i>nazir</i> (6:1–21) or the priests (6:22–27), as well as through responses to threats of perversion, exemplified by the ritual of the wife accused by her husband of adultery (5:11–31). (Rabbinic literature uses the term <i>sotah</i> to refer to aspects of this case, although the word itself —meaning “a woman who strayed”—does not actually appear in the Bible. This commentary will employ the rabbinic term, which has come to be used widely when discussing this passage.)
The structure of this parashah reflects well the role of women within the Israelite community. Women, like most men, could not be cultic officials—neither priests, Levites, nor tribal chiefs—and therefore they remain absent from the administrative framework of the parashah. Yet they occupy a central place within the religion, either as cause for concern, such as the <i>sotah</i>, or, more surprisingly, as devotional exemplars such as the <i>nazir</i>—the individual who dedicates herself or himself to God. (The specifically feminine form is <i>n'zirah</i>, although only the generic form <i>nazir</i> appears in the Bible.)
At first glance, the <i>sotah</i> and the <i>nazir</i> seem to represent mutually exclusive ends of the spectrum for a woman’s place within Israelite society. A woman could either find herself tottering on the margins of society—accused, vulnerable, and at the mercy of her husband or priest—or she could establish her place among the elite of society by dedicating her life to God. Yet the juxtaposition of these figures within the parashah, and the linguistic links between the passages describing them, together suggest an intrinsic relationship between the <i>sotah</i> and the <i>nazir.</i> Read together, these figures inform, challenge, and broaden our perceptions of women’s roles within the religion and society of ancient Israel.

Beha'alotcha

<i>The Journey from Sinai Begins</i>
P<small>ARASHAT</small> B<small>’HAALOT’CHA</small> (“when you bring up”) chronicles, in three major units, the start of the Israelites’ journey from Mount Sinai toward the Promised Land. The first unit (8:1–9:14) concerns the Tabernacle: its rituals, special laws regarding the Levites who serve in it, and the laws concerning the passover offering. It includes the purification and consecration of the Levites. It also addresses the situation of those who, because of being ritually impure, are unable to observe the passover offering at the right time; it institutes a substitute “second Passover” (<i>pesach sheni</i>), observed a month after the original due time of the passover offering (9:9–13).
The second unit (9:15–10:36) concentrates on the instructions for the traveling of the Israelites: the signals for moving ahead in the right direction and for making camp (the cloud and the trumpets). It concludes with the description of the first stage of the journey after leaving Sinai.
The third unit (Numbers 11–12) dramatically illustrates the discontent of certain Israelites who begin to challenge Moses (and, less directly, God) by their complaints on this first leg of the journey, and the divine punishments that follow as a consequence. An outstanding example is when, nostalgic for the plentitude left behind in Egypt, the people complain harshly about the lack of meat. Moses reacts with deep despair—to the point of asking to die rather than bear the burden of leadership. In response to his petition concerning the burden of bearing the people all by himself, God instructs him to gather representative elders of Israel and bestow some of his spirit upon them. This approach both shares the burden and demonstrates Moses’ spiritual superiority. Paradoxically, however, Moses’ authority is challenged by two of those elders (11:26–29) and then by his own siblings, Miriam and Aaron (12:1–2). In each of these episodes, Moses appears as a patient, caring, and extremely modest leader. While the narrator emphasizes his greatness and nobility, the people are presented as rebellious and ungrateful.
With regard to women, the parashah includes the enigmatic and disturbing story about Miriam. Moses’ sibling complains against Moses’ and his (new?) marriage to a “dark-skinned” (or “Cushite”) woman (12:1). In her challenge, Miriam—together with her brother Aaron— attempts to claim equal footing with Moses as a prophet (12:2). God punishes Miriam—not Aaron—with a skin disease because of her complaints, and she recovers only due to Moses’ intercessory prayer. Feminist interpreters often understand this story as an intended rebuke of a woman who aspires to a leadership role equal to a man’s, reading it as prejudicial to women on a number of levels. As we will see below, it is also possible to read this account more sympathetically, as a case in which God sides with one maligned woman (Moses’ wife) against a more powerful one (Miriam).

Sh'lach

<i>Sending Scouts and Challenging Leaders</i>
P<small>ARASHAT</small> S<small>H’LACH</small> L’<small>CHA</small> (“Send for yourself”) continues the theme in Numbers of challenges to Moses’ leadership. In the previous parashah, Miriam and Aaron challenge Moses’ leadership (Numbers 12); here, several tribal leaders—and ultimately the populace—do so. The parashah opens with the Israelites apparently nearing the end of their wilderness trek as they prepare to enter Canaan from the south. In anticipation of the invasion, Moses chooses scouts to reconnoiter Canaan. The goal of the expedition is twofold: to assess the strength of the indigenous populations and the strongholds in which they reside, and also to investigate the productivity of the land. One could argue that the venture is superfluous, since God has already ordained the conquest of Canaan by Israel. Seemingly, the objective is to test the faithfulness of the scouts and the Israelites as a whole.
The theme of rebellion at the heart of this parashah centers on the events in Numbers 13–14: the reconnaissance of Canaan, the scouts’ report, the Israelites’ response, and God’s reaction. The keys to the story and subsequent wilderness accounts are the negativity expressed about the mission by ten of the twelve scouts as well as by the populace, and the consequences of that attitude. Only two scouts, Caleb and Joshua, remain enthusiastic about entering the Promised Land, thereby demonstrating trust in God. The sin of faithlessness, exemplified by the majority, threatens the extermination of all Israel. Only Moses’ intercession, coupled with God’s mercy, saves the people, but not without a heavy price: condemnation to forty years of wandering and certain death for the entire wilderness generation.
The remaining portion of the parashah (15:1–41) focuses on a variety of laws, mostly relating to the sacrificial system. The delineation of laws is interrupted by a case study involving the willful breaking of the law: the desecration of Shabbat. The parashah then ends with the commandment to wear “fringes” <i>(tzitzit)</i> on one’s garment as a reminder to obey God’s laws. Notably, all these laws, even that of the <i>tzitzit</i>, are designated for all Israel—and apparently are inclusive of women. Otherwise, there is no explicit attention to women or to issues specifically relating to them. For implicit issues concerning women, see the comments on the sacrificial food such as the <i>challah</i> (bread dough offering, 15:19–21). Another indirect way to consider the roles of women in this parashah is to compare the story of the scouts in this parashah with the narrative involving Rahab the prostitute and the scouts in Joshua 2 (see introduction to Numbers 13, below).

Korach

<i>Leadership, Rebellions, and Punishments</i>
M<small>OSES</small>’ <small>LEADERSHIP</small> is challenged repeatedly throughout the book of Numbers (see, for example, Numbers 12, 14, and 21). In this parashah, rebels challenge not only Moses’ guidance, but also Aaron’s religious authority. Scholars have long recognized that Numbers 16 combines at least two stories of insurrection: Korah and his company challenge Aaron’s exclusive right to make ritual offerings to God; Dathan and Abiram question Moses’ abilities and authority. Each story has a separate focus and outcome; nevertheless, they share important features in common. Both of them turn on questions of the legitimacy of the current leadership, both demonstrate that the current leadership is divinely ordained, and both are resolved by divine wrath in a way in which the punishment fits the crime.
In these two episodes, the people fail to see that God—not Moses or Aaron—is the one responsible for electing the civil and religious authorities. When the challengers continue to speak against Moses and Aaron, God sends a plague (17:6–15). To demonstrate that Aaron’s post as chief priest is due to divine preference and not human election, God commands each of the tribes to present a staff at the Tabernacle (17:16–26). The miraculous fruit-bearing of only Aaron’s staff proves that God has chosen only the House of Aaron for the priesthood. The different duties, responsibilities, and restrictions associated with Levites and priests then are further specified and detailed at the end of the parashah (18:1–32).
Women do not play much of a role in <i>parashat Korach,</i> with good reason: there is little place for women in a contest for either religious or political leadership. Aside from Miriam, Deborah (Judges 4–5), and Queen Athaliah (II Kings 11), there are hardly any female Israelite leaders recorded as such in the Bible. Miriam is a notable exception to the near absence of female leaders, for she is included in the inner circle of power along with Moses and Aaron. The prophet Micah (8th century <small>B. C.E.</small>) reflects this view when he proclaims in God’s name, “I redeemed you from the house of bondage, and I sent before you Moses, Aaron, and Miriam” (Micah 6:4). Thus, the possibility of a female leader alongside male leaders certainly existed.
It is true that, as Tikva Frymer-Kensky has noted, the book of Samuel depicts an <i>ishah</i> of special status who claimed the authority to represent her town in emergency negotiations with a hostile general who recognized her authority as a matter of course (II Samuel 20:15–22). Apparently it went without saying that she was an elder, because that presumption best accounts for the city elders’ otherwise striking absence in the negotiations (compare Judges 8, 9, 11; <i>Reading the Women of the Bible,</i> 2002, pp. 58–61). And Susan Ackerman has argued that it may have gone without saying that the role of queen mother was an acknowledged position of political and religious leadership <i>(Warrior, Dancer, Seductress, Queen,</i> 1998, pp. 133–141). However, while female leadership may be occasionally discernible in Israelite historical memory, the Bible itself highlights very few women in leadership roles.
Even though the rebels’ wives are not involved in the uprising, they pay the price for their husbands’ actions, as the families of Dathan and Abiram also suffer the fate of God’s wrath. In contrast, the women related to Korah’s company are not punished for their challenge to the priesthood. Perhaps this is because women cannot serve as priests; hence, they may not have been present when their husbands offered incense to God. Unlike in Numbers 12, where both Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses yet only Miriam bore the punishment, in <i>parashat Korach,</i> Dathan’s and Abiram’s families are included in the punishment for political insurrection. This suggests that the punishment would have served as a warning to any contender for power, female or male.

Chukat

<i>Leadership and Loss in the Wilderness</i>
P<small>ARASHAT</small> C<small>HUKAT</small> (“law [that]”) acknowledges the grim reality of death in the wilderness, a necessary succession in leadership, and the approach of the journey’s end. Repeatedly in this parashah, healing and new life follow death. In the face of the chaos and unpredictability of death and its contaminating powers, Numbers 19 responds with a priestly ritual, recording instructions that contain a great deal of regulatory detail, delivered in an orderly, precise tone. Numbers 20 focuses on two significant deaths in the community of Israel, that of Miriam and her brother Aaron. Numbers 21 focuses on new opportunities in spite of deep disappointment, as successful battles mark a positive change in Israel’s fortune. After the loss of his siblings, Moses remains, leading Israel ever closer to the edges of the Promised Land, a land that he himself will never enter.
The deaths of Miriam and Aaron are central to this parashah, providing us an opportunity to consider the role of each within the Israelite camp. Gender politics can be detected in the more elaborate details concerning the punishment and death of Aaron in comparison to the report of Miriam’s death. Nevertheless, the mere fact that the time and place of Miriam’s death are recorded is highly unusual and therefore quite striking. One intriguing detail even places her on a par with Moses: he too is condemned to death in the same literary unit in which Miriam and Aaron die. Could it be mere coincidence that these three siblings are grouped together in this fashion? Indeed, the prophet Micah places Miriam on a par with her brothers: “I brought you up from the land of Egypt, redeemed you from the house of bondage, and sent Moses, Aaron, and Miriam to lead you” (Micah 6:4). Miriam’s death provides an opportunity to reflect on her life and to appreciate the unique features of this biblical leader (see at 20:1).

Balak

<i>Dangerous Foreigners</i>
P<small>ARASHAT</small> B<small>ALAK</small> centers on the actions of the Moabite king Balak and the prophet Balaam son of Beor, whom he hires to curse Israel into oblivion (22:2–24:25). It concludes with a dangerous encounter and worship of Baal-peor, a Canaanite god.
At the close of the previous parashah, the people of Israel were making final preparations to enter Canaan. The story of Balaam is inserted at this juncture because its outcome determines whether Israel will indeed inherit the Promised Land. Actually, it is a contest in the divine realm between the God of Israel and those supernatural elements available to Balak. At times amusing and somewhat mocking of the non-Israelite prophet, the message of the story is quite serious: God’s intent reigns supreme and cannot be superseded. Israel’s deity ultimately controls even the powers of a well-known foreign seer. In the end, Balaam’s four oracles reverse Balak’s goal—by blessing Israel and cursing her enemies. Notably, Balaam’s talking donkey, who is portrayed as the wiser of the pair, is a jenny (a female donkey)—perhaps reminiscent of the biblical personification of <i>chochmah,</i> “wisdom,” as female (see, for example, Proverbs 1:20).
Importantly, a visionary named Balaam son of Beor is mentioned outside the Bible; he is featured on an ancient but fragmentary plaster wall inscription, located not far from where the biblical story is set (see further below).
The final portion of the parashah (25:1–9) resumes the narrative begun in the first verse of Numbers 22 but interrupted by the story of Balak and Balaam. It recounts the misadventure of a group of Israelite men who have sexual encounters with local Moabite women—and end up worshipping the local deity, Baal-peor. The account focuses on one particular couple: an Israelite man and his partner, a Midianite woman. The priest Phinehas impales the two in a fit of religious zeal. The Baal-peor incident results in the death of 24,000 Israelites who are struck down by a divinely sent plague.
In this episode the Moabite women are depicted as dangerous enticers who lead the Israelite men to idolatry. The account serves to highlight the biblical portrait of the dangerous foreign woman, a motif prevalent in the book of Proverbs, where young men are repeatedly warned to avoid her (Proverbs 2:16<i>;</i> 5:3, 20; 7:5; 23:27; 27:13). A similar theme is found in other biblical passages as well (see Exodus 34:16).

Pinchas

<i>Legacy of Law, Leadership, and Land</i>
A<small>S THEIR FORTY YEARS’ JOURNEY</small> in the wilderness is coming to an end, the Israelites’ focus shifts to final preparations for entering the Promised Land. It is a time of uncertainty in the face of transition. <i>Parashat Pinchas</i> (named after the priest known in English as Phinehas) describes actions and instructions for securing stability and continuity, with special attention to division of the land among the Israelite tribes. The setting is the plains of Moab, on the eastern side of the Jordan near Jericho (25:43), within view of the Promised Land. The opening verses conclude the disturbing incident of Baal-peor (25:1–9). After a census and the appointment of Moses’ successor, the parashah ends with a lengthy account of the sacrificial offerings for various sacred occasions. The final words of the Torah portion affirm that Moses instructed Israel according to God’s commands (30:1).
Five daring sisters—Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah, also known as Zelophehad’s daughters—loom large in this Torah portion, and again later in Numbers 36 (and also Joshua 17). They brilliantly challenge the inheritance system (which has disenfranchised them) when they request a share in the land (27:1–11). They are so important that each of their names appears in every episode about them. In this episode these sisters succeed in securing a legacy for themselves, so that they, rather than their father’s male relatives, will inherit his portion. But they do even more than that, something unique and extraordinary: they initiate a Torah law, a legal precept that becomes a legacy for future generations because what they ask for themselves becomes a law sanctioned by God. This case is important in showing (among other things) women who challenge community practices and who thereby bring significant modifications to existing legislation in order to meet changing social needs.
The resolution of their case is that brotherless daughters can inherit parental property. Thus, this new law preserves the integrity of family property in case only daughters are born to an Israelite couple. It also provides economic security to daughters who otherwise would depend on male relatives for sustenance.
A striking aspect of these stories about Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah concerns archeological information about territorial holdings in Israel during the monarchy. Two of these names—Noah and Hoglah—appear on ostraca (ancient clay fragments). The names seem to refer to areas of considerable size in northern Israel (see at 27:1–2).
Other fascinating women make cameo appearances as mother (Jochebed, 26:59), sister (Miriam, 26:59), or daughter; yet they are remembered mainly in relation to an important man. We find also the “dangerous” foreign woman (Cozbi; 25:15–18) and the mysterious Serah, who is named only to disappear without a story (26:46).

Matot

<i>Vows and Vengeance</i>
P<small>ARASHAT</small> M<small>ATOT</small> (“tribes”) presents final preparations for entering into the Promised Land and offers further guidelines to the Israelites for practices once they settle in the land. As the Israelites camp in the plains of Moab, their final stop before entering the land, God instructs Moses on matters that relate to the internal workings of the Israelite community and also to the community’s relationship with its neighbors.
The parashah first supplements earlier laws about vows (Leviticus 27; Numbers 6), then picks up the story about the incident at Baal-peor, where Israelite men sinned by succumbing to idolatry (Numbers 25). In that earlier account at Baal-peor, the priest Phinehas appeased God’s wrath by killing two chief offenders, an Israelite man and a Midianite woman. In this parashah, God demands that the Israelites fight against the Midianites and thereby avenge that earlier wrong.
After the successful war against the Midianites, two tribes request to remain east of the Jordan. Moses resolves this potential split among the tribes by granting the request on the condition that the fighting men from these tribes will cross the Jordan with the rest of the tribes while their families settle down in the eastern region, as requested.
Women are prominent in the discussions of both vows and the war against the Midianites. In the first case, the text delineates the rights of women who make vows (30:2–17). These instructions shed important light on the status of women within the family and illustrate the circumstances under which the male head of the household can overrule decisions made by the women within the household. At the same time, these detailed laws indicate that women could make independent vows to God and, under normal circumstances, would be held accountable for fulfilling them.
The subsequent section on war against the Midianites (31:1–12) focuses on Midianite women as the chief culprits in Israel’s earlier transgressions at Baal-peor (25:1–18). The structure of the parashah thus indirectly contrasts the Israelite women (wh article that can withstand o turn to God) with the foreign “perverse” women of Midian (who turn Israelite men away from God).
Finally, the mention of the “water of lustration” <i>(mei niddah)</i> in 31:23, the mixture that the warriors use to purify themselves after the battle, suggests a connection to women, since the word <i>niddah</i> is also used for menstruation or a menstruant (see at Leviticus 15:19–30).

Masei

<i>The Journey’s End</i>
P<small>ARASHAT</small> M<small>AS’EI</small> (“marches”) begins with exactly that: a review of Israel’s travels through the wilderness. Numbers 33 presents a step-by-step itinerary describing the journey of the Israelites from the time they left Egypt to their arrival in the plains of Moab. A number of places serve as markers not merely of a geographical itinerary but also of experiences that shaped, and at times transformed, the Israelites from slaves to a people ready to possess the Promised Land.
After Numbers 33 recounts the travels of the past, Numbers 34–36 turn to the future; these units provide details about how Israel should function as a nation in its own land. As Hara E. Person notes, the parashah is about boundaries, both geographic and social <i>(The Women’s Torah Commentary,</i> ed. Elyse Goldstein, 2000, p. 321). Specifically, God delineates the borders of the land and then appoints leaders from each tribe to oversee the distribution of each tribal portion.
After God and Moses assign the tribes their territories, the focus falls on the one tribe that is noticeably absent from the list: the Levites. Instead of possessing their own portion of land, the Levites will receive forty-eight cities in which to dwell. Since six of these cities will be set aside as cities of refuge for those guilty of unintentional homicide, God’s speech turns to a definition of murder, the requirements for witnesses in capital cases, and other relevant rules to ensure safety and equity.
The book of Numbers concludes by revisiting the case of the daughters of Zelophehad, with a stipulation added to ensure that the ancestral territories they inherit will always belong to their tribe, Manasseh.
At the conclusion of the book of Numbers, the people stand at the plains of Moab, poised to enter the Promised Land. Here, the story of Israel’s journey ends. (The book of Deuteronomy—which is composed almost entirely of Moses’ speeches—does not carry the story further except in its final scene, the death of Moses.)
Although not visible in the travel accounts recorded in this parashah, women come to the fore at the end of the book, with the story about Mahlah, Tirzah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Noah, the five daughters of Zelophehad who are entitled to inherit his land (Numbers 27). In Numbers 36, leaders of their clan raise a concern: the land might be lost to the tribe if the women marry men from another tribe. Moses solves the problem by restricting the group from which the daughters may choose a spouse. Even though Numbers 36 restricts their marriage options to those of their tribe, it also guarantees that the five women will have what they demanded in 27:4—an inheritance among their kin. In addition, and as a result, their names are perpetuated in Israel’s story.
The appearance of these five women at the conclusion of Numbers mirrors the reference to five women at the beginning of Exodus: Shiphrah and Puah, Moses’ unnamed mother and sister (later identified as Jochebed and Miriam), and Pharaoh’s daughter (Exodus 1–2), all of whom engaged in saving children’s lives, Moses’ life in particular. These two sets of five courageous and resourceful women thus form the bookends of Israel’s journey from slavery.

Devarim

<b>דברים ✦<i>D’varim</i></b>
<small>DEUTERONOMY</small>
M<small>OST OF</small> D<small>EUTERONOMY</small> is cast as Moses’ final words to Israel while the people stand in the plains of Moab, poised to part from their long-suffering leader and at last enter the Promised Land. The book’s Hebrew title, <i>D’varim</i> (“words”), reflects the book’s presentation as a series of first-person speeches. The English name comes from the Greek translation of the Hebrew expression <i>mishnei ha-torah</i> (17:18); in its biblical context, the phrase means “copy of the Teaching,” but as the book’s title, it takes on the sense of a “second [or: repeated] law.” This meaning also fits the nature of the book, which retells and reinterprets Israel’s history and laws for a new generation, often with marked differences from other versions. Deuteronomy recalls past experiences—particularly the divine wonders witnessed firsthand while fleeing from Egypt and traveling through the wilderness—as lessons for future behavior. It also includes legal material distinctive for its attention to political, social, and economic issues. The book emphasizes that security and prosperity in the Promised Land depend on adherence to these laws and lessons.
The notion of a covenant between God and Israel pervades Deuteronomy, influencing its form and content. Like political treaties found in other parts of the ancient Near East, the book begins with a historical prologue (1:1–4:43) that establishes the foundation of the covenantal relationship. Then, after a preamble to the laws (6:1–11:32), it spells out the terms of the covenant (12:1–26:15). Blessings and curses follow (28:1–68), detailing the consequences of adhering to or disobeying the covenant. Echoes of ancient Near Eastern treaties also can be heard in certain formulaic phrases that mark the book, like the charge to “love your God יהוה with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your might” (6:5).
Deuteronomy envisions a society structured around absolute loyalty to the one God and one sanctuary. At the same time, it decentralizes political power and empowers broader segments of society. In Deuteronomy, the community as a whole is responsible for maintaining justice and economic stability, protecting the rights of every member, even animals. Deuteronomy repeatedly instructs the Israelites to care for the vulnerable and needy, particularly the stranger, widow, fatherless, and Levite (and his family). The inclusion of the Levites is a hallmark of Deuteronomy, a result of one of its defining features: the centralization of sacrificial worship in “the site that your God יהוה will choose” (12:5), which the Bible considers to be Jerusalem.
Most scholars date the core of the book (the legal collection in Deuteronomy 12–26 or the laws and surrounding sections in 4:44–28:68) to the 7th century <small>B. C.E.</small>; yet they recognize that various stipulations originated earlier and other parts of the book were added to and revised during the exilic or post-exilic periods (6th century). Many link Deuteronomy to the discovery of a “book of the <i>torah</i>” during renovations of the Temple (II Kings 22; II Chronicles 34). The female prophet Huldah is a central figure in that episode, for she authenticates the scroll as God’s teachings. (See <i>V’zot Hab’rachah,</i> Another View.)
The only woman named in Deuteronomy is Miriam (24:9). However, women are addressed in many parts of the book, even though the grammatically masculine language of the Hebrew often keeps their presence only implicit. Notably, 29:10 and 31:12 explicitly include women among those who take part in the covenant and are obligated to learn and follow the <i>torah.</i> Women figure prominently in the legal collection (particularly in <i>parashat Ki Teitzei),</i> as it addresses issues like the treatment of a captive woman, inheritance by the son of an unloved wife, adultery, forced and consensual sex, divorce, and levirate marriage.
Deuteronomy persistently warns of the divine wrath that will follow if either women or men disobey the covenant. Yet toward the end of the book, <i>parashat Haazinu</i> depicts God as a loving mother who labors to give birth to Israel and nurses Israel with honey and other delicacies of the Promised Land (32:13, 18), a striking image of the culmination of the saga that unfolds in the five books of the Torah.

<i>At the Threshold of Canaan</i>
E<small>VENTS IN PARASHAT</small> D<small>’VARIM</small> (“words”) take place on the plains of Moab in the lower Jordan valley, at the moment when Israel is poised to enter the land of Canaan. The parashah contains the beginning of Moses’ first farewell address, in which he reminds the people of their history: the journey from Mount Sinai (called Horeb in Deuteronomy), the scouts’ debacle, and encounters with foreign nations. Moses’ speech is not a neutral rehearsal of Israel’s history; rather, it underscores and supports central theological and ideological arguments found throughout Deuteronomy.
The words presented as Moses’ farewell address are directed toward a double audience. The first audience is one within the biblical text, the people of Israel about to enter the Promised Land. This imagined audience is standing at a pivotal moment: its members can either follow God’s commands or they can repeat the mistakes of the prior generation, presumably with disastrous consequences. Moses’ account is designed to encourage the people to make the right choice.
The second intended audience consists of Israelites who were contemporaries of the authors of this opening part of Deuteronomy. Most scholars believe that the material in this parashah, through 4:43 in the following parashah, was written during the Babylonian exile (586–538 <small>B. C.E.</small>) as an introduction to the laws that form the core of the book (Deuteronomy 12–26) and the prologue to these laws (Deuteronomy 4:44–11:32). The exilic authors of our parashah present a version of the past that accomplishes three goals. First, this account of past events emphasizes God’s role in Israel’s history. Second, it justifies Israel’s territory in theological terms. Third, it underscores obedience to God, as defined by Deuteronomy, as the key to Israel’s ongoing political and military success.
This parashah does not deal specifically with women. The seeming absence of women in this version of Israel’s narrative, however, raises an issue that has concerned biblical scholars in general and feminist scholars in particular, namely, how to assess the relationship between texts and a community’s social reality. Contemporary scholars, women and men alike, have shown how an account of the past is nearly always colored by an author’s own subjective position and ideological stance. These scholars train readers to guard against taking historical accounts as mirror representations of historical events; they encourage us instead to explore what historical accounts disclose about their authors’ historical and social situations. These methodological insights are particularly relevant to this opening part of Deuteronomy. In several places in this parashah, Moses’ accounts of events differ from those in Exodus or Numbers. A comparison of the different versions provides insight into not only the variety of historical traditions that flourished in ancient Israel, but also the variety of theological and ideological viewpoints that shaped them.

Vaetchanan

<i>The Call to Loyalty and Love</i>
P<small>ARASHAT</small> V<small>A-ET’CHANAN</small> (“I pleaded”) begins with Moses’ recollection of how he longingly prayed to God to be allowed to enter the Promised Land. This speech is part of a larger address to the Israelites in which Moses recounts for them all that occurred in the wilderness and the lessons they should derive from these experiences. Moses exhorts them to use the past as the basis for future behavior, making their first-hand knowledge of God and their national memory of the Sinai experience (here called Horeb) the basis for their relationship to God when they begin their lives in the new land without him.
Throughout this parashah, Moses plays the role of teacher. First, he spells out various reasons as to <i>why</i> the Israelites should obey God’s teachings (4:1–40). Next, he reminds them of <i>what</i> God commanded at Horeb (Sinai) (4:44–5:30), including the Decalogue (“Ten Commandments”) (5:6–18). Then, he teaches them <i>how</i> to fulfill the commandments by specifying the proper attitude to approach the Divine (6:1–7:5). Finally, he concludes by explaining the nature of God’s love for them, the basis for the relationship between Israel and God (7:6–11). Throughout, Moses reiterates that while the people will be rewarded for their obedience and commitment to God, they will be punished severely if they stray from God’s path. In particular, he emphasizes monotheism, a central theme in Deuteronomy as a whole. God’s uniqueness and the demand for Israel’s absolute loyalty find expression in the passages known as the <i>Sh’ma</i> and <i>V’ahavta</i> (6:4–9)— prayers that stand at the center of the Jewish proclamation of faith.
This parashah seems to include women as a matter of course when Moses addresses the Israelites in the second-person masculine singular or plural, as is typical elsewhere. In addition, women are mentioned specifically in the Decalogue as daughters, slaves, mothers, and wives (5:14, 16, 18), as well as in the prohibition of intermarriage, in which Canaanite women appear to possess the power to lead Israelites astray (7:3–4). More indirectly, the parashah’s emphasis on education (6:20–25) invites readers to assess women’s role in ancient Israel with respect to raising the next generation.

Eikev

<i>Conditions for Life in the Land</i>
P<small>ARASHAT</small> E<small>IKEV</small> (“if” or “as a result of”) contains three speeches (7:12–8:20; 9:1–10:22; 11:1–25), all of which highlight the central position of the Promised Land in the relationship between God and Israel. The “good land” is the object of the divine oath to the ancestors (7:12–13; 8:1; 9:5; 11:9) and the goal reached after forty years of wandering in the wilderness (8:1–20). For Israel’s sake, God constantly keeps an eye on the land of “milk and honey,” which is so different from the land of Egypt (11:12).
Whereas the prior parashah presents categorical demands of loyalty and obedience (as in the Decalogue in 5:6–18 and the <i>Sh’ma</i> in 6:4–9), <i>Eikev</i> opens with a conditional clause that emphasizes that obedience brings blessings (“And if you do obey these rules…”). Throughout the parashah, Moses emphasizes that existence in the land is conditioned upon obedience, observance, and love—all of which are manifestations of Israel’s loyalty to God (8:1–20; 11:8–9, 13–25). This message remains central in Jewish life, as 11:21–31 are traditionally recited twice daily as the second paragraph of the <i>Sh’ma</i>, and the same passage is inserted in the mezuzah and in <i>t’fillin.</i>
This parashah mentions women explicitly only a few times. One of the blessings promised if the people follow God’s teachings is the absence of infertile women and men (7:14). A later passage extolling God’s merits mentions that God “upholds the cause of…the widow” (10:18). As divine ruler (see at 10:17), God’s role is to defend and provide for the vulnerable members of society, including widows—a frequent topic of concern in Deuteronomy.
With regard to this parashah’s use of feminine imagery, one verse open to interpretation is the analogy comparing the way God disciplines Israel to the actions of a human parent (8:5). Does the masculine language of this verse refer specifically to a father and son, or, more inclusively, to the way that either parent treats a daughter or son? (See further at 8:5.)

Re'eh

<i>Laws and Loyalty</i>
P<small>ARASHAT</small> R<small>’EIH</small> (“see”) introduces the legal collection that extends from Deuteronomy 12 to 26. Like the two other major biblical collections of legal material (the Book of the Covenant in Exodus 21–24 and the priestly legislation in Exodus, Leviticus, and Numbers), these laws are conceived of as part of the covenantal relationship between Israel and God, with responsibilities incumbent upon both parties. The legal collection here offers a unifying vision of Israel: it insists on absolute loyalty to the one God—and to God’s Chosen Place, the sole official shrine.
According to Deuteronomy 1:5, the location for the expounding of these laws is the land of Moab, east of the Jordan River, before Israel enters the land. This would be during the 2nd millennium <small>B. C.E.</small>, according to the implied chronology and the imagined “original” audience (see introduction to <i>parashat D’varim</i>). But historians believe that these laws were actually compiled in the 7th century <small>B. C.E.</small> or later, and that they comprise part of the “book of the <i>torah</i> (Teaching),” the phrase used in Deuteronomy to refer to the exhortations and laws in this book (not to the so-called Five Books of Moses). According to II Kings 22 (and II Chronicles 34:14–28), a reportedly similar “book of the <i>torah</i>” is discovered during the reign of King Josiah, in the midst of renovations of the Temple. The King orders his scribes to consult with the female prophet Huldah, who authenticates the scroll. Its laws represent a reform of earlier traditions and of existing practice. The book of Kings further reports that King Josiah implemented some of those reforms in about 622 <small>B. C.E.</small> (On the economic aspects of this “reform,” see at 12:2–3.)
The laws in this parashah (like those in the three portions that follow) contain various precepts designed to regulate activity in the Promised Land and to bind Israel to its God. The parashah includes rules about many aspects of life: the consumption of meat (12:15–28; 14:3–21; 15:21–23), avoidance of the local non-Israelite peoples’ worship practices (12:30–31; 13:6–18; 14:1–2), true and false prophecy (13:1–5), tithing (14:28), remission of debts (15:1–6), care for the needy (15:7–11), debt-slavery (15:12–17), dedication of first-born male animals (15:19–20), and the pilgrimage festivals (16:1–17).
While the legislation here applies to all Israel, several teachings at first glance seem to address only the presumably male heads of household (12:7–8, 12, 18; 13:7; 15:20; 16:11, 14). This raises the following questions: What about their wives, who are not mentioned? Furthermore, are all of these laws intended only for men and not for women? The answers are not always clear. However, some laws implicitly address everyone, such as those that regulate diet (14:3–21). Others explicitly include women, as when they are expected to attend festive celebrations at Israel’s official sanctuary (12:12, 18; 16:11, 14).
A powerful theme in <i>parashat R’eih,</i> alongside the prominent concern for the loyal worship of Israel’s God alone, is caring for the needy. It is possible that a concern for women’s welfare lies behind certain economic legislation to protect the vulnerable (see at 14:29), since women were often at risk in ancient Israelite society.

Shoftim

<i>Law and Order</i>
P<small>ARASHAT</small> S<small>HOF’TIM</small> (“magistrates”) continues Moses’ speech in which he delineates various legal teachings for Israel. This portion focuses on the organization of the community and the promulgation of rules to promote justice within it. Although the logic behind the order of laws in the Bible is not always apparent, in this parashah we can see the relationship between many of the sections. These laws tend to be of a practical nature—for the Bible rarely theorizes or philosophizes. Yet taken together, they draw a picture of the type of ideal society that Deuteronomy envisions. In such a community, justice functions as the operative principle; and all individuals, even the king, come under its rules. Every member of society is entitled to the same justice, in both religious and civil matters. (These two areas of life were not distinguished in ancient times as they are today.) While mainly concerned with the internal workings of the community, justice also applies to the conduct of war. Along with the idea that people deserve a fair government, Deuteronomy expresses the even more important idea that the failure to perform justice constitutes a failure to heed God’s commandments, which endangers the future of Israel.
Deuteronomy does not, for the most part, envision women serving as public officials and certainly not as priests or soldiers. However, women figure in a number of laws, especially in the following parashah (<i>Ki Teitzei</i>). Most of the laws are phrased in the grammatical masculine (the linguistically unmarked term that often includes both genders); but in some cases, to emphasize that the legislation concerns women and men, the text explicitly addresses both genders. For example, 17:2–5 stipulates that “the man or the woman” who engages in idolatrous worship will be put to death. Although the laws in Deuteronomy do not consider women to be the responsible party in their own right in all matters, they are protected when they might be victims and prosecuted when they are guilty of crimes.

Ki Teitzei

<i>Relationships and Society</i>
P<small>ARASHAT</small> K<small>I</small> T<small>EITZEI</small> (“when you go out”) contains a wide range of criminal, civil, and family laws, featuring many of the humane precepts for which Deuteronomy is justly famous. The topics addressed include relationships within households (between men, women, and children), among neighbors, between the underprivileged and other members of society, and even between humans and animals. As elsewhere, notably in the preceding parashah, Deuteronomy is concerned with the formation of an ideal Israelite society. However, whereas <i>parashat Shof’tim</i> concentrates on public officials, most of the laws in <i>Ki Teitzei</i> are directed at ordinary individuals. What may have once been considered family matters—such as the rights of a lesser loved wife, the punishment of wayward children, the finding of lost objects—here are matters of concern to the society at large that must be legislated publicly. The goal is to create a balanced society in which the poor and weak are legally protected from the rich and strong, in which both property and human lives are respected, and—most importantly—in which individuals are subject to the community and its laws.
While some laws in this parashah seem to follow a logical or topical order, others appear to have been inserted at random. Most of the laws offer no reason or justification for adhering to them; but some refer to events recounted earlier in the Torah, such as the skin affliction of Miriam (24:9). The repeated mention of God’s approval or disapproval (as in 24:13 and 22:5) reminds us that no matter how secular the laws of Deuteronomy may appear to us, the book presents them as being on behalf of—and through—the will of God.
Issues pertaining to women are prominent in this parashah. They include the treatment of a captive woman, forced sex, accusations of non-virginity, divorce, and levirate marriage. Much in the ideal society that Deuteronomy envisions revolves around the status of women, generally their sexual status as wives or potential wives. Since the family unit is the basis of society, marriage and the women’s position in the family unit are important. Deuteronomy advocates chastity before marriage but, at the same time, protects women in cases where premarital sex was forced upon them; however, the penalty for promiscuous sex is severe. Most of all, Deuteronomy seeks to ensure that women marry, for ancient Israelite society offered no good place for an adult unmarried woman.

Ki Tavo

<i>Entering the Land of Israel: Blessings and Curses</i>
P<small>ARASHAT</small> K<small>I</small> T<small>AVO</small> (“when you enter”) is concerned mostly with the Israelites’ entrance into the Promised Land. There they must offer first fruits and tithes, according to the ceremonies outlined in 26:1–15; and there most of the laws in Deuteronomy 12–26 will take effect. These laws, outlined in the prior Torah portions and concluded here (26:16–19; 28:69), aim to regulate society when Israel settles in Canaan. Using language familiar from other parts of Deuteronomy, this parashah emphasizes that Israel should obey God’s commandments faithfully, with all their heart and soul. Since the covenant between God and Israel establishes mutually binding obligations for both parties, God’s commitments also are reaffirmed: the promise to make Israel a treasured, holy people. This parashah is directed to a dual audience: first, to Moses’ imagined audience in Moab, the Israelites who listen to his words as he prepares them to enter the land of Canaan; and second, to the audience addressed by the authors of this part of Deuteronomy, who composed their work during the exile (586–538 <small>B. C.E.</small>) or even later, after the return from exile.
The parashah also details the ceremonies that the Israelites are to perform once they enter the land, as a way to reaffirm the covenant (27:1–26). As in the ancient Near Eastern treaties upon which Deuteronomy is modeled, the reiteration of the covenant concludes with a list of blessings for those who uphold it—and curses for those who do not (28:1–68). The last part of the parashah (29:1–8) begins Moses’ final address to the people. He recounts the wondrous deeds that God performed on behalf of the people, the experiences that form the foundation of the covenantal relationship and that provide the inspiration for Israel to walk in God’s ways.
The laws in the first part of this parashah mention women only as widows, who are counted among the underprivileged (26:12; 27:19), and as objects of impermissible sexual relations (27:20, 22–23). However, matters of gender take on more importance in the blessings and curses at the end of the covenant stipulations. Human fertility becomes a national issue that is linked to the fertility of livestock and the land, all of which are promised blessings if Israel obeys God’s commands (28:4, 11, 18). In the subsequent section, one curse concerns a man who makes the arrangements to marry a woman, build a house, and plant a vineyard—all symbols of establishing a new family unit and household—but who will lose these things to another man before he has enjoyed their benefits (28:30–32). The horrors of siege, conquest, and exile—signaling the ultimate breakdown and destruction of Israel’s society—affect women and men alike. Both sons and daughters will be taken into exile (28:32, 41); and in the famine of the siege, both women and men will become cannibals who horde their “food” from their loved ones (28:54–57). Such graphic curses depict what will transpire if Israel fails to obey God’s commandments. Hence, in its strongest rhetoric, Deuteronomy urges its audience to follow the laws that form the heart of this book.

Nitzavim

<i>Covenantal Choices</i>
P<small>ARASHAT</small> N<small>ITZAVIM</small> (“stand”) contains the bulk of Moses’ third and final speech in the book of Deuteronomy, his last exhortation in Moab to observe the covenant. In this address, which began at the end of the previous parashah (29:1–8), Moses foreshadows the full sequence of iniquity, judgment, repentance, and deliverance that he predicts Israel will experience. He concludes his words with an impassioned plea to his audience to “choose life” (30:19) by adhering to the <i>torah</i> (Teaching), a choice that will guarantee peace and prosperity.
Each of the three units of <i>parashat Nitzavim</i> brings out its two governing themes—presence versus absence, and exposure versus concealment. The first part of the parashah (29:9–28) emphasizes the inclusion of every single member of the community in the covenant and their participation in the covenant ceremony. Women and men, officials and laborers, those standing before Moses in Moab and future generations—all commit themselves to uphold the terms of the covenant. This commitment leads to a warning against secret disobedient behavior, followed by a depiction of the fierce judgment God will unleash upon the land and the people if they turn away from God.
The second part of the parashah (30:1–10) opens with a promise of restoration once the people repent. Repeatedly, here and in the subsequent unit, Moses calls upon the people to love God with all their hearts and souls (vv. 6, 16, 20). This formulaic language is familiar from elsewhere in Deuteronomy (particularly 6:5), reminding the people that they must fulfill their part of the covenant through their fierce loyalty to God and God’s teachings.
The third part of the parashah (30:11–20) returns to the subject of the covenant and the contrast between the overt and the covert. Moses assures the people that the “Instruction” <i>(mitzvah)</i> is not hidden or beyond reach, but is close and obtainable (30:11–14). He stresses that God gives each individual and the entire people two clear choices: “life and prosperity, death and adversity” (30:15). With heaven and earth as witnesses to the covenant, Moses implores the people to choose life instead of death, blessing instead of curse (v. 19).
One of the hallmarks of this parashah is the inclusion of women in the list of social groups participating in the covenant ceremony. The explicit mention of women in 29:10 leaves no doubt that women are part of the people obliged to follow God’s covenant. Nevertheless, their position in the list designates their lower status in ancient Israelite society (see at 29:9–10). The parashah refers to women again in 29:17 as part of a list of possible sinners. Thus, the text affirms that women and men alike, not only those preparing to enter the Promised Land but also the generations to follow, have the potential either to break or to maintain the covenant: it is “in your mouth and in your heart, to observe it” (30:14).

Vayeilech

<i>The Oral and the Written: Words of Encouragement and Warning</i>
P<small>ARASHAT</small> V<small>AYEILECH</small> (“[he] went”) is the shortest portion in the Torah, consisting of only thirty verses. It begins with Moses standing before the Israelites in the plains of Moab, just across the Jordan River from the Promised Land. He delivers an encouraging message to Israel (31:1–13), in which he assures the people that although he is about to die, God will lead them into the Land, wiping out any obstacles in their path. To reinforce Joshua’s legitimacy as their new leader, Moses appoints him in front of all Israel.
Moses then writes down the Teaching (<i>torah</i>) and instructs the priests and elders regarding future public readings of the written text. As in 29:9–10, the text makes the inclusive nature of the covenant explicit, specifying that men, women, children, and strangers are to listen to and learn from God’s Teaching (31:12).
In the second part of the parashah (vv. 14–23), God begins to speak, delivering a darkly pessimistic message. God anticipates that immediately after Moses’ death, the people will go astray by worshiping other gods. As a result, Moses must write down the words of a poem as witness against the people.
Finally, Moses again speaks to the people (vv. 24–30); but now, as if infected by God’s disappointment, Moses too predicts misfortune in Israel’s future. In addition, repeatedly the parashah emphasizes the transmission of God’s teaching as a written text.
Regarding the treatment of women in this parashah, they are mentioned explicitly only once (v. 12), although they are included implicitly as part of the “people.” Nevertheless, readers might consider a number of questions sparked by the parashah:
•What are the repercussions of having the tale narrated by a single dominant male voice, that of Moses? The story as told is shaped by the teller and his particular interests; and, in turn, this story will shape the type of community that Israel will become. What if, instead, the story were to be told from the perspective of a female figure, such as Miriam? What might a female narrator have considered crucial if she were asked to retell the events of the wilderness journey? What vision of community might she propose?
•Moses passes the reins of communal leadership from himself to Joshua. Who would have been a fitting successor to his sister, Miriam—the prophet and leader who died not long beforehand (Numbers 20:1)?
•The depiction of Moses writing down the <i>torah</i> (which in this context refers to the teachings in Deuteronomy) prompts speculation: Could a female author have written a biblical book? While answers to these questions remain largely conjectural, the parashah makes one thing quite clear: women as well as men must hear and study the Torah and apply it to their lives.

Ha'Azinu

<i>The Song of Moses: A Foretelling of Future Events</i>
P<small>ARASHAT</small> H<small>AAZINU</small> (“give ear”) tells of a relationship gone awry. According to the poem at the heart of this parashah, God had established a special relationship with the people Israel and then lovingly watched over and cared for them, yet they rejected God and turned to other deities. Enraged at their betrayal, God resolves to decimate Israel. But God relents when realizing that the other nations might foolishly misinterpret Israel’s demise as a result of their own power, not as a divinely inflicted punishment. Thus, with a change of heart, God decides instead to avenge the Israelites against their enemies.
In the prior parashah (<i>Vayeilech</i>), God predicted that after Moses’ death, the people would go astray by worshiping other deities, which would prompt God to punish them (31:16–18). To prevent any misunderstanding of these future events, God instructed Moses to write down a particular poem and teach it to the people so that it would serve as a “witness,” testifying to God’s justice in the face of Israel’s wayward behavior (31:19). That poem, which constitutes most of <i>parashat Haazinu</i> (32:1–43), is followed by a confirmation that Moses recites the poem to the people (32:44–47); then, the parashah looks ahead to Moses’ imminent death (32:48–52).
Although the poem is not titled in the biblical text, people refer to it as “the Song of Moses” or <i>“Shirat Haazinu</i>” (“the Song [that begins with the word] <i>Haazinu</i>”). In light of various linguistic and grammatical features, most scholars agree that the Song originated earlier than the rest of the book, as an independent composition. While a precise date remains uncertain, scholars assume that the poem was written in response to some tragedy, in an attempt to make sense of the event and provide hope for the future. Later, Deuteronomy’s creators appended this preexistent poem to the book in order to reinforce the consequences of breaking the Covenant, a central theme in Moses’ parting words to the people.
While the name “Song of Moses” implies that Moses wrote this poem, authorship of the Song cannot be determined. Note, however, that a number of biblical passages indicate that women were responsible for crafting and reciting similar sorts of poetic compositions. Various women in the Bible perform songs to celebrate military victories (Miriam in Exodus 15:20–21; Deborah in Judges 5; Jephthah’s daughter in Judges 11:34; and the women welcoming the heroes in I Samuel 18:6–7). Combining this textual evidence with other data, some scholars have concluded that another poem attributed to Moses, the Song at the Sea (Exodus 15:1–19), may have been authored by a woman (see pp. 386–87, 392). Other biblical texts indicate that women composed and chanted laments in times of national crisis or personal loss. For instance, God instructs the prophet Jeremiah to summon the “wailing women…the skillful ones” (Jeremiah 9:16). Jeremiah then calls all the women, not just the professional female mourners, to listen to God’s word and then teach their daughters and friends a dirge (9:19).
As <i>Shirat Haazinu</i> recounts the troubled relationship between God and Israel, it specifies that both women and men alike will inflame God’s anger (v. 19) and suffer God’s wrath (v. 25).
The Song employs diverse metaphors to describe the Divine. In addition to the genderneutral representations of God as a Rock (vv. 4, 15, 18, 30, 31, 37) and as an eagle (v. 11), God appears as a father (v. 6), warrior (vv. 23, 41–42), and, most remarkably, a mother who gave birth to and nursed her child, Israel (vv. 13, 18).

<b>וזאת הברכה ✦<i>V’zot Hab’rachah</i></b>
<small>DEUTERONOMY 33:1–34:12</small>
<i>Moses’ Last Words: A Blessing for Israel</i>
P<small>ARASHAT</small> V<small>’ZOT</small> H<small>AB’RACHAH</small> (“this is the blessing”) presents Moses’ poetic blessing of the Israelites (33:1–29), which is followed by a brief record of Moses’ death and a tribute to his unparalleled prophetic stature (34:1–12). As we come to the end of Moses’ life, it seems fitting to reflect back on the epic story of Israel’s unrivaled leader.
Moses’ story begins in the book of Exodus (2:1–22), where we read that a Levite woman and a Levite man (later identified as Jochebed and Amram) give birth to a child whose life is imperiled by the Pharaoh’s decree to kill all Israelite baby boys. Although Moses’ mother initially defies the king and hides her son, after three months she is forced to abandon him, so she places him in a basket floating down the Nile. His sister, Miriam, then watches as Pharaoh’s own daughter rescues and adopts the Hebrew child. At Miriam’s suggestion, the princess hands Moses over to his mother, Jochebed, who nurses him for several years. Thus, it takes the courage, ingenuity, and collaboration of these three women to ensure the survival of Israel’s future liberator and leader.
Although raised as Egyptian royalty, Moses eventually identifies with the plight of his enslaved kin. But when defending a beaten Israelite leads to manslaughter, Moses flees to Midian. There, he marries Zipporah, the daughter of the Midianite priest Yitro, and fathers two sons. Then, while shepherding his father-in-law’s flocks on Mount Horeb (also known as Mount Sinai), he glimpses the Divine amidst a bush that burns yet remains unconsumed. Reluctantly, he accepts God’s call to return to Egypt and rescue his people (Exodus 3–4). With the aid of his brother Aaron, Moses orchestrates God’s signs and wonders and eventually persuades Pharaoh to let Israel go (Exodus 5–15).
The exodus from Egypt leads to a second encounter with God atop the same mountain, where God communicates the precepts by which Israel is to live (Exodus 19–20). The rest of the Torah describes how Moses oversees the construction of the Tabernacle and the ordination of the priesthood and then leads the people on a forty-year trek through the wilderness. Once they reach the plains of Moab, Moses reaffirms the covenant and instructs the people how to live in order to thrive in the Promised Land. For Israel, the wilderness journey will culminate in the entry into the land of Canaan, as recounted in the book of Joshua. For Moses, as we read in this parashah, the journey will end atop another mountain, Mount Nebo, as he surveys the land and dies at God’s command.
<i>Parashat V’zot Hab’rachah</i> is unique in that it is not designated as a weekly Torah portion. Instead, it is read on Simchat Torah, the holiday that marks the conclusion of the annual Torah reading cycle and the commencement of a new lectionary cycle of weekly Torah readings.
The focus of this parashah is on Moses and the tribes named for Jacob’s sons; women are explicitly mentioned only once, in the reference to a mother in 33:9. However, 33:4 states, “Moses charged us with the Teaching [<i>torah</i>] as the heritage of the congregation of Jacob.” Who is “us”? Prior passages in Deuteronomy specify that women were included in the covenant (29:10) and were taught the <i>torah</i> (31:12).
Finally, 34:8 mentions that “the Israelites bewailed Moses” for thirty days. Evidence shows that women were trained as singers of laments and likely would have played a main role in mourning Israel’s most cherished leader.

Bereshit

 P<small>ERHAPS THE MOST DIFFICULT</small> biblical verse for contemporary readers is Genesis 3:16. Traditional translations understand it to mandate painful pregnancies and the domination of women by men. However, that four-line poetic passage can be understood in a different way.
In Hebrew the first line of the poetry has four words: <i>harbah arbeh itz’vonech v’heronech.</i> The first two words constitute a double verbal form that asserts that the following two words—subjects of the verb— will be more intense, more plentiful, or more numerous than would be expected. The present translation “I shall greatly increase” is a satisfactory rendering of the double verb.
The usual translation of the two nouns <i>itz’vonech v’heronech</i>—“your pains in [or: of] pregnancy”—is problematic. First, as stated, both nouns are objects of the verb “increase.” That is, the Hebrew speaks about two distinct conditions that are subject to increase, joined by the Hebrew conjunction “and.” Second, the word “pain” is inaccurate. For one thing, it suggests that pregnancy itself is painful, which is not the case in most normal gestations (in contrast to giving birth, which is often painful). Furthermore, the uninflected noun <i>itzavon</i> otherwise often refers to the “hard work” of physical labor, which it almost certainly does in the next verse in reference to the agricultural work of men: “through <i>toil</i> shall you eat of it.”
For these reasons, our translation for the first line of 3:16 is “I shall greatly increase your <i>toil</i> and your <i>pregnancies</i>.” Not only does this rendering better reflect the Hebrew wording, but also it reflects the agrarian life situation of the Israelites. The highlands of the Land of Israel were not very fertile or well watered. Therefore, the hard work of both women and men was required for households to survive. Moreover, children were needed for the family labor force. With as many as one in two children dying before the age of five, a woman needed to have up to eight pregnancies to provide the optimum family size of four offspring.
The other three lines of the verse expand on the theme of procreation. The second line (“in anguish you shall bear children”) conveys the difficulty of childbirth itself, that is, the mental and also the physical anguish of giving birth. The third line (“to your man is your desire”) refers to the passion—emotional as much as sexual—that a woman feels for her husband. Such passion allows her to succumb to the dominance mentioned in the last line: “And he shall rule over you.” In keeping with the focus of this verse on childbearing, that line probably speaks about a husband’s ultimate responsibility for his wife’s sexuality and not for her entire person. Because of the risks of death in childbirth, many Israelite women would have been reluctant to have numerous pregnancies. Yet, passion toward their spouses serves to prompt women to respond to male sexual urges and thus accept the possibility of another pregnancy. Indeed, some medieval commentaries understood it this way.
The translation as “rule”—though accurate in a limited way—remains inadequate because it implies general male dominance over women—and has usually been interpreted that way for millennia. Unfortunately, no single word in English precisely conveys the meaning of the Hebrew term in this context.
Like many biblical passages, Genesis 3:16 is an etiology, helping people to accept the difficult realities of life by viewing them as having been mandated by God. For Israelite women this meant hard work and many children as well as enduring the risks of procreation. Although their sexuality may have belonged to their husbands, women in other ways were autonomous individuals who controlled important aspects of household life.

 A <small>GENEALOGY IS</small> a typical narrative strategy to account for the long passage of time and also to express the relationships among groups. In this parashah, the concluding genealogy leads to Abram and Sarai (11:27–32). It is shocking that this genealogy ends with the information that Sarai is barren, a statement that counters the very notion of genealogy, namely, family connectedness across generations.
The theme of barrenness is emphasized in the story of the ancestors, beginning with Sarah, the first matriarch; and it recurs in the next two generations, with Rebekah (25:21) and then Rachel (29:31). The idea of a barren woman giving birth highlights the importance of the offspring, calling attention to God’s role in the child’s birth—and thus to the significance of the child.
At the same time, the presence of the barrenness theme in matriarchal narratives signifies the values and concerns of an agrarian people. Most Israelites were self-sufficient farmers, requiring a team of people to work the land; having offspring therefore meant survival. It also meant the opportunity to raise an heir who would intimately know and maintain that parcel of land. Family lands were held as patrimonies and passed down across generations. Not surprisingly, legal precepts in the Torah aimed at helping families retain their property (see Leviticus 25:23–28).
In light of the great importance of land as inheritance, barrenness was a grave problem. Archeology has produced artifacts, such as small female figurines, that arguably were used, along with prayers, in household rituals women surely performed to deal with infertility. Also, potions and remedies to overcome barrenness are known from the texts of other ancient Near Eastern peoples and later Jewish folklore; and surely they were used by Israelite women (see the mandrake of Genesis 30:14–16).
In addition, like other ancient peoples, the Israelites solved this problem by allowing for adoption or polygyny (multiple wives). A householder could take a second wife or secondary wife (a servant or a concubine), and the resulting offspring would allow the lineage—reckoned along the male line—to continue and the land to remain in the family. For elite families, especially royalty, having multiple wives was a sign of status; in ordinary families it was a solution to the dire predicament of the barrenness of a man’s initial wife.

S<small>ARAH AND</small> H<small>AGAR</small> neither speak to each other nor refer to each other by name, but their intertwined lives reflect both the systemic abuse women face and the combination of personal struggle and divine aid required to survive.
So that “it may go well for” him in Egypt, Abram asks Sarai to say she is his sister, and so the wife is taken into Pharaoh’s house (Genesis 12). So that she may “have a son [or: child] through her” (16:2), Sarai places Hagar in Abram’s bed. What the patriarch does to his wife, so the mistress does to her slave.
Like Sarai, the Egyptian Hagar—whose name echoes the word <i>ger</i> (“stranger”)—is taken from her home to Canaan. This cycle of displacement and enslavement will continue: Hagar’s descendants (the Ishmaelites) will sell Joseph into Egyptian slavery (37:27–28), and Hoar’s people (the Egyptians) will “afflict” Sarah’s descendants (Exodus 1:11–12) as Sarah “afflicted” Hagar (Genesis 16:6).
In Canaan, the women become rivals rather than companions. Rather than be “built up” through Hagar (see at 16:2), the post-menopausal Sarai “became light” (16:4) in the slave’s eyes; Hagar grows weightier—both physically through pregnancy and emotionally as she recognizes her opportunity for advancement in Abram’s household.
Abused by Sarai and ignored by Abram, Hagar flees to the wilderness. There an angel attends not to the Hebrew patriarch, but to the Egyptian slave: although sent back to her mistress, Hagar goes with the knowledge that “יהוה has heard (<i>shama</i>)” her affliction (16:11).
Similarly, Sarai herself—a foreign female trapped (enslaved?) in Pharaoh’s house—receives divine aid. Her parallels to Hagar suggest that God acts not simply “because of Sarai” but specifically “upon Sarai’s word” (<i>al d’var Sarai,</i> 12:17). Her crying out when Abram fails to act—for it is unclear how, or even if, Abram would extricate his wife—is what prompts God to send the plague (another Exodus foreshadowing) upon Pharaoh.
We later learn that the sons of Sarai and Hagar, although destined to be at odds (16:12), unite to bury their father (25:9): the cycle of abuse can be broken if children refuse to continue the system of abuse that entrapped their parents.

L<small>IKE THE PRECEDING PARASHAH</small>, this one frames the theme of generational and genealogical continuity as a male affair. Women are constructed largely as sexual objects and procreative instruments with mostly a physical and corporeal relationship to the story of threatened birth and threatened survival. The two wife-sister episodes—in Genesis 12:10–20 and (in our parashah) 20:2–18—present Sarai/Sarah as a silent object of desire. Sarah is taken by Abimelech, king of Gerar, and later returned to her husband—as, one may say, a possession—while her husband is amply compensated for the king’s error. In her role as barren wife, she is a figure discussed by, rather than addressed directly by, God, who questions her skeptical laughter (18:12–14). The announcement of a male child is not transmitted by God to Sarah, but rather to Abraham, as she eavesdrops on the conversation at the entrance of the tent (18:10). As a mother, however, Sarah is validated by God, who advises Abraham to obey her demand that her rival, Hagar, and Hagar’s son, Ishmael, be removed from the household (21:12). Yet, beyond her protective role as mother, Sarah is neither consulted nor even mentioned in the story of the great test of faith that Abraham endures when God asks him to sacrifice his one and only remaining son at the altar (22:1–19).
It can be argued, then, that in this parashah the mother’s role is limited to procreation, nurturance, and physical protectiveness. Sarah, in fact, disappears from the story as soon as Abraham is rewarded for the successful test and blessed with future progeny (22:16–19). Still, as God makes clear, it is Sarah’s son, not merely Abraham’s, who is God’s chosen. Stories about Hagar and Ishmael, and about Lot’s daughters, continue the theme of threatened survival in which women ensure the safety of the next generation: God responds to Hagar’s cry for help (21:15–21); Lot’s daughters, who first appear as silent sexual objects, and whose procreative role is temporarily threatened (19:1–8), daringly initiate incestuous sexual relations with their father and secure generational continuity (19:30–38).

I<small>SAAC’S LOVE FOR REBEKAH</small> (24:67) is the first mention of spousal love in the Bible. Like other ancient Near Eastern sources, the Bible shows a concern with preserving family possessions, both tangible (land) and intangible (blessings and identity). Arranged marriages serve this purpose. Love, however, is also mentioned as a motive for marriage: Jacob loves Rachel (Genesis 29:30), and Michal loves David (I Samuel 18:20). With Isaac, love follows rather than precedes marriage. We do not know whether Rebekah loves Isaac. Reports of a woman’s love for a man are rare, found only with Princess Michal (I Samuel 18:20 and 48) and in sensual terms in Song of Songs (see, for example, 1:7).
The Bible is largely silent about marriage procedures. In fact, Genesis 24 remains the most detailed biblical source on this subject. The customs it describes largely correspond to information from ancient Mesopotamian texts. According to both sources, parents usually arrange the marriage (as when Shechem’s father negotiates a marriage with Dinah in Genesis 34, or when Samson asks his father <i>and</i> mother to get him a wife in Judges 14:2–3). Brothers sometimes act in this role (see Laban in Genesis 24). The groom or his family brings gifts for the bride’s family. In the Bible these gifts are called <i>mohar,</i> a term without the misleading commercial overtones of its usual English translation as “bride-price.” The servant’s gifts in Genesis 24 may represent the <i>mohar.</i> In some Babylonian documents, the bride’s father also gives gifts. (See Women in Ancient Israel—An Overview.)
Genesis 24 emphasizes Rebekah’s role in the marriage negotiations. The servant bestows expensive gifts mostly on Rebekah herself (“objects of silver and gold, and garments”), with only some for her brother and mother (24:53; note the silence about the father). Moreover, she chooses when to go to her husband (24:55–58). In contrast, the groom, Isaac, plays no role in the arrangements. These details emphasize the union of Rebekah and Isaac as one in which the woman is assertive and the man compliant. This depiction sets the stage for Rebekah’s prominence in subsequent episodes (25:22–23, 28; 27:1–28:5).

Toldot

I<small>N THIS TORAH PORTION</small>, our foremother Rebekah takes matters into her own hands in order to secure Isaac’s blessing for her favorite son, Jacob. She is encouraged to do so by the prophecy she receives when she inquires of God during her pregnancy (25:23). God answers Rebekah’s inquiry about her pregnancy with the ambiguity inherent in every oracle. The oracle specifies that Rebekah is carrying twins and that each child will develop into a nation. Their future relationships, however, remain ambiguous (see at v. 23). Which of the two peoples shall overcome the other? Who will serve whom?
What if Rebekah misinterprets the prophecy? What if its ambiguity is part of the divine purpose? What if, by eliminating the ambiguity—by urging Jacob to steal the blessing meant for his brother—Rebekah is not acting in harmony with the will of God?
In that case we would expect the text to show dire consequences. Indeed, such consequences ensue. First, the fruits of the stolen blessing do not come easily to Jacob. The blessing that he gains by guile refers to material benefits (27:28–29). He later secures his wealth—the promise in this stolen blessing—in an environment of stealth (Genesis 29–31). Second, he soon loses something far more precious than material abundance: his beloved wife dies in childbirth (35:19). Third, there is consequently Rebekah’s pain. She sends Jacob away for his protection (27:43–44) and dies without seeing him again. Rebekah must have suffered deeply in separating from her beloved son Jacob. She pays a very high price for her determination to ignore the ambiguity of God’s word.
The outcome of Rebekah’s story may, perhaps, teach us to allow the divine process to unfold for a while, before we decide to take action on God’s behalf. Perhaps the gift from our biblical mother Rebekah in this parashah is her prompting us to sense ambiguity, to appreciate nuance—and to have the wisdom and patience to let divine intention blossom in its own time.

F<small>OR</small> <small>MANY</small>, the love story between Rachel and Jacob shows the text’s preference for Rachel over Leah. If one reads the story through modern eyes, where love conquers all, then Rachel seems to be more important than Leah. However, if one reads this parashah with an eye toward its own biblical concerns, then Rachel and Leah look very different.
The love story begins with Jacob seeing Rachel (29:10). The text notes that Rachel is “beautiful of form and of face” (v. 17). To modern readers beauty is positive, but in the Hebrew Bible it is dangerous for women. Abram charges that Sarai’s beauty threatens his life (12:11–12), and Amnon rapes Tamar, supposedly because of her beauty (II Samuel 13). In other places in the Bible, when people make choices because of what they see, those choices prove to be misguided. For example, Lot chooses to live in the Jordan plain because it looks nicer than Canaan (Genesis 13:10–11). Samson marries a Philistine woman because of her appearance (Judges 14:1–3), and the results are disastrous. Clearly the Bible does not recommend judging a book by its cover.
The text notes that “seeing Leah was disfavored, יהוה opened her womb” (Genesis 29:31). This clearly means that the Deity sympathized with Leah. Leah names her first child Reuben because of a play on words that the Deity saw her plight, but she adds what she hopes it will bring her: the love of her husband (v. 32). The second child follows the same pattern; Simeon is so named because God “heard” of her plight (v. 33). The third son, Levi, is named in the hope that her husband will be attached to her (v. 34). All three names reflect not only thankfulness but also a need for more—namely, Jacob’s love. With her fourth son, something finally changes and she names him Judah because, “This time I give thanks to יהוה” (v. 35). Thus Judah, who becomes the forefather of most of the Jewish people, is so named because his mother was simply thankful to the Deity to have him.

Vayishlach

V<small>AYISHLACH BEGINS AND ENDS</small> with references to Esau, Jacob’s twin brother. At the beginning of this parashah, it is to Esau whom Jacob sends messengers (32:4), who return with a report that he is on the move, coming to meet his brother (32:7). The parashah concludes with Esau going to another region “because of his brother Jacob” (36:6–8) and with Esau’s genealogical line, the Edomite people (36:9–42).
Esau is thus highlighted in this parashah by being the subject of the beginning and ending units. Even so, Jacob is clearly the more important character—a fate Esau has had to endure from early on. Esau is a touching figure because no matter how hard he tries, he cannot measure up to his younger brother who—though not always honest and fair in his dealings—outmaneuvers him.
What distinguishes the two brothers? How to account for Jacob’s prominence over Esau? The difference between the two begins with their mother’s decision and continues with their choices of marriage partners. God informs Rebekah—not Isaac—about their yet-to-be-born twins that “the older shall serve the younger” (25:23). Rebekah acts on this information by supporting Jacob at the expense of her other son.
Then Esau marries two Hittite women, causing his parents distress (26:34–35), whereas Jacob is sent (at his mother’s instigation) to find a wife from her own people (27:46–28:5), which he does (29:21–30). Attempting to please his parents, Esau tries again by marrying Mahalath, also a cousin like Jacob’s wives; she is the daughter of Ishmael, his father’s brother (28:8–9).
The Dinah story occurs in the middle, in between the references to Esau that frame this parashah. After Shechem—a Canaanite prince—rapes Jacob’s daughter, Jacob is indecisive about their marriage (34:5). Dinah’s two oldest full brothers, however, respond by killing all the Shechemites so that the marriage between Dinah and Shechem does not happen, thereby keeping their sister from marrying the people in the land.
Genesis 34 reaffirms the importance of marrying the right people within the family. Together these incidents illustrate the importance of mother and wife, and not only father, in determining a person’s destiny.

 P<small>OTIPHAR’S WIFE AND</small> T<small>AMAR</small> provide two models of the feminine and help to forge the contrasting characterizations of Joseph and Judah.
Potiphar’s wife is overtly sensual and verbally aggressive. Like the negative archetype of the feminine in one passage of the book of Proverbs (7:1–23), she tempts the young man into sexual impropriety. Potiphar’s wife serves as a test in the initiation of Joseph, the young wisdom hero who refuses to allow a woman to make him unfaithful to his master.
Tamar, a young childless widow, becomes a trickster, a marginal figure who succeeds in indirect ways, by deceiving those in power. The trickster’s marginality may be rooted in gender, age, economic or social status. Biblical tricksters include Abraham (Genesis 12:1–10), Jacob (Genesis 27), Rebekah (Genesis 27), and Tamar. Tales of tricksters appeal to the underdog side of each of us, but they may have special appeal among groups who feel themselves out of power—for example, women in a world dominated by men.
In Genesis 38, the qualities of the feminine that limited Tamar become her source of strength. When Judah sends her back to her father with empty promises of giving her his third son in good time, Tamar, like other marginal females in ancient Israelite social structure, is caught betwixt and between social categories available to women—as virgins or as child-producing, faithful wives. Eventually, Tamar takes matters into her own hands. Dressing as a prostitute and standing at the crossroads in a double symbolization of her marginality, she becomes pregnant by Judah. Wisely she has demanded and then kept his pledges, symbols of his identity and status. Judah—who is no more appealing in this tale than in the selling of Joseph—orders that Tamar be burned alive when he hears she is pregnant, dismissing her with two words. But she—clever girl—produces the tokens that identify Judah as the father, and even he must admit he has been bested. Judah, coconspirator in the exile of Joseph, is one of the many biblical males, including Samson, Sisera, and Isaac, who are tricked by women’s wiles. It is Tamar’s right to bear children in Judah’s line, and the twins indicate abundant fertility. She will be the ancestress of kings. Tamar’s power is indirect, circumscribed by the realm of procreation and supported by tricksterism. It is a power, nevertheless, that is celebrated in the biblical tale.

“P<small>HARAOH’S DREAM WAS REPEATED</small>—two times—because the matter has been fixed by God, and God is making haste to accomplish it” (41:32).
Why are there so many repetitions in the Hebrew Bible—and in the Torah especially? The Bible usually does not spell out its poetic principles, so that readers are obliged to deduce them from the text itself. Scholars since the 19th century have explained repetition in the Bible as due to its editors having drawn from different sources. But in this parashah, Genesis 41:32 uniquely offers what amounts to a poetic statement, explaining the need for narrative repetition.
The reader wonders why Pharaoh dreams twice—first of cows, then of ears of grain. Joseph explains that “Pharaoh’s dream is one: what God is doing, [God] has revealed to Pharaoh” (41:25). Thus the two dreams have a single solution: God is informing Pharaoh that seven years of abundance will be followed by seven years of famine. But if a single dream would have sufficed, why are there two, and why do they follow so closely? Verse 32 explains that repetition right away means that God had decided the matter and would shortly carry it out.
A close reading reveals that the repetition is not confined to Pharaoh’s dreams but recurs throughout the Joseph story. Joseph himself has two dreams (37:5–9), though not close together—meaning that they would not be realized immediately. Moreover, this story cycle’s use of repeated occurrences—not necessarily dreams—justifies characterizing its plot as advancing by paired structures. For example: Joseph escapes being killed by his brothers thanks to two rescue attempts (37:18–30); the brothers go to Egypt twice to procure rations (42:1–43:25); Joseph twice acts like a stranger to them and punishes them (42:7–28, 44), and more. We may conclude that repetition does not necessarily indicate a plurality of sources or traditions; it may also represent a poetical principle, a device that indicates a fixed divine intention—and sometimes its imminent actualization. In this manner, <i>parashat Mikeitz</i> offers an interpretation of more than Pharaoh’s dreams. It holds a key to the literary and theological use of repetition throughout the Hebrew Bible.

T<small>HIS PARASHAH DESCRIBES</small> the successful deliverance of the extended family of Jacob from hunger in Canaan to prosperity in Egypt and the emergence of the tribal arrangement of the nation of Israel out of Jacob’s twelve sons. The circumstances that enable the physical and social survival of the family are described in some detail. The physical survival of the family is made possible by the reconciliation of Joseph and his brothers—which leads to a reunion between Joseph and his father. Yet the family’s renewed solidarity and cohesiveness does not include any of its female members. Thus for example, Dinah, whose rape and rescue by her brothers is described in some detail in Genesis 34, was omitted from the list of Jacob’s offspring already in <i>parashat Vayishlach</i> (35:23–29).
Our parashah, which gives us insight into the emotional state of Jacob, Joseph, and his brothers, offers us no information about the emotional state of Dinah, the only daughter and sister to be explicitly mentioned here (46:15)—and no story of rehabilitation, reconciliation, nor restitution for her. Eliminated from the tribal list—whether by virtue of her gender, her rape, or association with a foreigner—Jacob’s daughter is thereby punished in a way that his sons are not. Note that Joseph has two sons by Asenath, the daughter of the Egyptian priest Potiphera, and is not censored in any way by the narrator.
The detailed genealogical list in our parashah (46:8–27) makes only brief references to Rachel, Leah, Bilhah, and Zilpah—Jacob’s four wives. To be sure, Rachel’s special status is echoed somewhat in 44:20 and 27, and Asher’s daughter Serah is mentioned by name in 46:17, but neither mothers nor daughters appear as significant names in the family or tribal genealogies. (On women in lineages, see also at 6:1, 6:10; 10:1; 17:19; 22:20–24.) Similarly, barely any information is offered at all about Asenath, Joseph’s wife and the mother of Manasseh and Ephraim. Joseph fathers two tribes in the nation of Israel. In other words, women appear in our parashah as relatives of significant fathers, husbands, and sons, or as nameless relatives as in “your wives” (45:19) or “their wives” (46:5).

A<small>LTHOUGH IT IS NAMED</small> V<small>A-Y’CHI</small> (“he lived”), this parashah details Jacob’s death rather than his life. Here Jacob insists on being buried in the cave of Machpelah, near Hebron, where his ancestors and his wife Leah are already buried (49:29–32).
To flesh out the role of the dead in Israelite society, biblical testimony can be combined with archeological evidence. According to Jacob’s statement, his family buried its members together: all the matriarchs and patriarchs were interred in the Cave of Machpelah, with the exception of Rachel. That tomb both substantiated the inheritance claim and served as a boundary marker; through his purchase of the field and cave, Abraham had established Israelite claim to territory near Hebron (Genesis 23).
Burial in a cave conforms to actual interment practices in the Hebron region from pre-Israelite times to the fall of the Davidic kingdom (ca. 1800–586 <small>B. C.E.).</small> The local residents indeed buried their family members—including children—together in either natural caves or roughly hewn chambers. Alongside their deceased, they placed ceramic vessels for food and drink, lamps, tools, and personal items. In the 8th and 7th centuries <small>B. C.E.,</small> they occasionally provided also a clay female figurine—crudely formed, with little distinguished besides a head (sometimes schematic) and prominent breasts.
Grave goods suggest that the dead were considered to continue some form of existence. Many scholars—but by no means all—identify the female figurines with the fertility goddess Asherah, speculating that perhaps a figurine conveyed the wishes of the living for the dead to intercede on their behalf with God (and Asherah) to promote lactation for children’s welfare. Biblical passages likewise attribute ongoing benevolent powers to the deceased. Repeated admonitions not to consult the dead—rather than God—on behalf of the living (Deuteronomy 18:11), the woman of En-dor conjuring up the deceased Samuel to foretell the future (I Samuel 28), and the Israelite house-holder’s annual declaration that no tithed food had been given to the dead (Deuteronomy 26:14) are just three examples of belief in the continuing powers of the dead and the practices of reaching out to them.

Shemot

T<small>HE LIBERATION</small> of the people Israel from slavery in Egypt begins with the saving acts of women. First, the midwives of the Hebrews refuse to follow Pharaoh’s edict to destroy male Hebrew children. As Tikva Frymer-Kensky has noted, when the pharaoh confronts the midwives, they tell him just what he wants to hear (<i>Reading the Women of the Bible</i>, 2002, p. 26). To the ruler worried about a people that “swarms” and fills the land (1:7), Shiphrah and Puah claim that the Hebrew women are <i>chayot</i> (“vigorous”; or, like beasts)—creatures capable of giving birth by themselves, without the civilized intervention of professionals. When he buys their excuse, the incongruous encounter between the king-of-all-Egypt and the midwives-to-the-slaves exposes Pharaoh as a fool.
The next savior is Moses’ mother, who defies Pharaoh by hiding her son and preparing a basket that saves him from death (2:3). When Pharaoh’s own daughter discovers the crying boy among the reeds of the Nile (2:5–6), she recognizes immediately that this must be one of the Hebrew children doomed to death by her father. Moved by empathy and humanity, she too defies the king when she rescues the boy. The baby’s sister then appears, offering to secure a nursemaid, who just happens to be Moses’ own mother (2:7–9). Through this conspiracy of enterprising women who collaborate with each other across ethnic, class, and religious lines, the future leader of the Exodus is spared—and with him the entire people Israel.
The presence of these five women at the opening of this critical Israelite foundation myth is immensely significant. Deeply wise in fundamental, life-sustaining ways, these women understand instinctively that Pharaoh should be disobeyed; and, with initiative, they act on this knowledge. Ultimately, these women’s defiance demeans the male tyrant. Thus, from these women filled with a power rooted in moral reason, an ethical concern for life, and the capacity to empathize, we learn a valuable lesson in political ethics: the very weakest in society can contribute to liberation by judiciously engaging in acts of civil disobedience.

Vaera

I<small>N THE PRECEDING PARASHAH</small>, Pharaoh challenged Moses: “Who is יהוה that I should heed him and let Israel go?” (5:2). Earlier, Moses had anticipated that the Israelites would pose a similar question: “When I come to the Israelites…and they ask me, ‘What is his name?’ what shall I say to them?” (3:13). Divine self-revelation in <i>parashat Va-eira</i> answers these questions in two ways.
First, God declares: “I am יהוה; I appeared to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob as El Shaddai, but I did not make Myself known to them by My name יהוה” (6:2). This personal divine name validates the promises made to the ancestors in Genesis. It also evokes God’s eternal nature (see at 3:14, 15). Moreover, introducing a new divine name signals a new beginning for Israel, as God prepares to bring them from slavery to freedom.
A second aspect of God becomes manifest in overpowering Pharaoh with the so-called plagues and even in controlling Pharaoh’s heart. The text makes it clear that the signs and wonders are part of God’s design—the means to demonstrate God’s control of history. Had there only been one or two, they might have been dismissed as a chance occurrence. However, Israel’s God is able both to inflict multiple signs and to withdraw them at a designated time.
Given the high status of Pharaoh as god in Egyptian culture, it is especially significant that Israel’s God can also control and manipulate Pharaoh himself by hardening his heart in certain instances (4:21; 7:3; 9:12; 10:1, 20, 27; 11:10; 14:4, 8). Although hardening Pharaoh’s heart creates tension regarding Pharaoh’s culpability, it highlights God’s supreme control. God’s intentions are quite explicit: “I have spared you for this purpose: in order to show you my power, and in order that my fame may resound throughout the world” (9:16).
Thus, like the revelation at the burning bush (Exodus 3) and the revelation on Mt. Sinai (Exodus 19), the ten signs become a means of divine self-disclosure. They demonstrate God’s supreme power, proving that the Creator of the universe controls even the most powerful of human rulers.

Bo

P<small>ARASHAT</small> B<small>O DESCRIBES</small> a number of rituals surrounding the Exodus that allow us to see a connection between blood, sacrifice, and family ties. Sacrificial blood in 12:1–13 is protective, separating the Egyptians who are about to die from the Israelites who soon will hurriedly flee the “house of bondage.” As an expression of the life force, the blood is also symbolic of the fertility of the family that offers it as a sacrifice and then applies it to the doorposts and the lintel of their house.
In addition, the blood symbolizes the connection between past and living generations. The living and the deceased should not be seen as mutually exclusive, but instead can be considered as part of a chain of human existence connecting ancestors and their descendants. Thus for readers of the story, the passover sacrifice acts as a link to generations past, a way to recognize the plight of those who first left Egypt and to offer gratitude to God for their liberation. The passover sacrifice also connects the past to the future, as one generation teaches the next the lessons of the Exodus: “And when your children ask you, ‘What do you mean by this rite?’ you shall say, ‘It is the passover sacrifice to יהוה, who passed over the houses of the Israelites.…(12:26–27).
Furthermore, the consumption of the communal Passover meal provides a map of the social structure of the family network. Eating the roasted lamb (or kid) with unleavened bread and bitter herbs determines the boundaries of the people who share in the event, indcating who is inside and outside the group. With all family groups eating their paschal lamb on the same evening (vv. 6–8), the act of eating becomes symbolic of continuity and unity. However, the separate groups consume their own sacrifices, “a lamb to a household” (12:3), with no foreigners allowed to eat of it (12:43–45). Thus, the rite also symbolizes discontinuity and differentiation. In these various ways, the Passover sacrificial ritual is about identity and how we solidify family ties through this ancient ritual.

Beshalach

B<small>Y BREAKING THROUGH</small> the waters of the Sea of Reeds and emerging through the narrow passage, Israel is born as a liberated nation. Like any newborn, Israel expresses the need for food and water—and voices the fear of their absence. In response, God behaves as a mother, sometimes nurturing, sometimes stern, often setting limits.
Israel first faces a lack of water. When they encounter bitter waters, Moses sweetens them by casting in a piece of wood. Later, panic ensues because no springs are discovered at Rephidim. God instructs Moses to bring forth water from a rock with the very staff that turned the Nile to blood. On this initial leg of the journey, the people interpret the lack of water and food as indicative of God’s absence, much as an infant interprets a lack of nourishment as the absence of nurture.
Food can be called Israel’s national obsession, and it is used to gauge the relative safety or danger of a situation. Raw foods that require less chewing (milk, honey, manna) indicate relative stability, while meat has the potential to cause trouble (Numbers 11). Although no mention is made of Israel eating anything in Egypt before the Passover celebration (Exodus 12:8–9, 15), the people salivate when remembering Egyptian delicacies (Exodus 16:3; Numbers 11:5). While God promises Israel a land of milk and honey, they accuse God of trying to starve them in the wilderness (Exodus 16:3; Numbers 21:5). God rains bread from heaven (Exodus 16:4) as a taste of what is to come: manna that is white as milk and resembles the promised honey (Exodus 16:31). But, as Moses later informs the Divine, not even manna can fill the bottomless pit of Israel’s appetite (Numbers 11:21–22).
Why are the people so hungry? Perhaps the trauma of slavery has left a residue of deprivation, or perhaps meals allow for some regularity during the journey through an unknown wilderness. The plot of the Torah implies that the people can find satisfaction only when they partake of the homeland’s fruits (Joshua 5:11–12). Hunger is indicative of exile; and Israel is not sated until it finds a home.

Yitro

W<small>HEN</small> G<small>OD TELLS</small> M<small>OSES</small> to command the people to sanctify themselves, wash their clothes, and be ready for the divine revelation, God emphasizes that the people should be instructed not to go up or touch the mountain (19:10–13). Moses begins by faithfully repeating God’s commands, yet he concludes, not by reiterating God’s warning not to touch the mountain, but instead by admonishing the Israelites not to go near a woman (19:15). Feminists have wrestled with this disturbing verse and its implications. Does this formulation mean that Moses was only speaking to the men? Moses seems to have subverted God’s command to all the people by speaking only to half the Israelites.
Moses’ striking deviation from God’s command is troubling well beyond the feminist focus. Moses’ alteration of God’s command raises the central question of who is the final authority on what God really says. Which version of the command is authoritative? Is Moses faithfully transmitting God’s words? Is the text accurately presenting God’s instructions? And, ultimately, what gives Moses or the text the right to report God’s words differently from the way in which they were originally delivered?
A clue can be found in the genre of this passage. Exodus 19:9–15 fits the ancient literary form of the Command/Performance formula, in which a divine command is expected to be transmitted by the messenger in identical language. According to this convention, any deviation from the initial command in the transmission draws attention to itself and is highly significant. What is the significance of Moses’ alteration of the divine word here?
This text, with its deviation from the expected Command/Performance convention, cries out <i>“darsheini”</i> (“Interpret me!”) and so invites readers—ancient as well as modern—to grapple with revelation. The entire history of interpretation of our sacred texts, from the Mishnah to modern feminist midrash, is empowered by Moses’ audacious transformation of God’s words. Exodus 19:9–15 subverts omniscient external authority and hands authority to the reader. This troubling passage empowers all of us to read, interpret, and find meaning in this parashah and its contradictions.

Mishpatim

T<small>HE TITLE OF PARASHAT</small> M<small>ISHPATIM</small> (“Rules”) belies the diversity in form and content of its legal materials. For the most part, the principles of morality and ethical concern it contains reflect admirable humanitarian principles, especially when compared to similar legal materials from other ancient Near Eastern cultures. However, with respect to language, the consistent use of the masculine gender in verbal and nominal forms is problematic. Since Hebrew often uses masculine forms generically, how do we know when masculine language refers specifically to men as opposed to both men and women? The new translation in this volume is the result of scrupulous research conducted to identify masculine terms that should be understood inclusively. The English text now reads more accurately, for it reflects the fact that many legal principles apply to women as well as men.
Nonetheless, there is an important usage of the masculine singular that is not visible in this translation. The masculine singular pronoun <i>atah</i> is translated as “you.” The word “you” is gender inclusive in English; but in Hebrew <i>atah</i> sometimes refers generically to men and women, at other times, just to men.
According to the Bible, a marital couple forms a unity. The classic evidence for this is Genesis 2:24, which presents the astonishing statement—given the patrilocal nature of Israelite society, with brides moving to the grooms’ homes—that men are to leave their parents and become “one flesh” with their spouses. Despite a powerful concern with lineages and ancestry, the marital bond trumps the parental connection and expresses the merging of female and male.
Thus, many biblical passages using masculine language may refer to a conjugal pair. In such cases, masculine singular pronouns like <i>atah</i> or masculine singular imperatives (“you”) are not simply inclusive terms, but reflect the special bond of husband and wife. For example, the injunction to cease from work on the seventh day (23:12) uses the masculine singular form but presumably applies to a man’s wife as well. Similarly, the prohibition against cooking a kid in its mother’s milk (23:19) is in the masculine singular but also applies to a man’s spouse; after all, women were largely responsible for preparing food in ancient Israel.

Terumah

P<small>ARASHAT</small> T’<small>RUMAH PROVIDES</small> specifications for constructing the Tabernacle and its furnishings. Although the gender of the artisans is not mentioned, other biblical passages indicate that metallurgy was a male domain (I Samuel 8:12), while spinning and weaving were women’s work (Judges 16:13–14; II Samuel 3:29; Proverbs 31:19). Producing and dyeing yarns, weaving, and embroidering textiles for the Tent of Meeting and officiating priests’ clothing thus provided an avenue for women of the Exodus account to participate in this public and communal religious practice. According to II Kings 23:7, women continued producing textiles as devotional service also during the time of the Jerusalem Temple: while working in a room within the Temple precinct, “the women wove coverings” for the wooden pole of Asherah that stood in the Temple. (On worship of the goddess Asherah, see at Exodus 34:13.)
Archeological evidence of weaving abounds in both domestic and industrial contexts in the biblical period. Ceramic loom weights, indicative of an upright warpweighted loom, stone or ceramic spindle whorls for twisting fibers into continuous yarn, and bone shuttles for weaving are common finds in domestic contexts. Loom weights found in rows suggest that looms, consisting of a crossbeam supported by two upright beams, rested against a room or courtyard wall. The weights pulled taut the vertical warp strings tied to the crossbeam above. Most women spun and wove to satisfy household needs: clothing, cloaks that also served as blankets, bags to transport grain, and waterproof coverings of goats’ hair. Sheep and goats from one’s flocks, the two most common domesticated animals, provided wool and hair; linen was produced from flax fibers.
While Israelite women wove cloth at home, the highly prized dye denoting sovereignty that was mandated for the Tabernacle curtains and vestments— <i>t’cheilet</i> (blue-violet) and <i>argaman</i> (purple)—was manufactured in specialized installations at coastal sites. A Mediterranean mollusk, <i>Murex,</i> secretes the main ingredient of the dye used to manufacture <i>t’cheilet</i> and <i>argaman.</i> Dye vats with accompanying mounds of broken murex shells have been uncovered in 9th-century-<small>B. C.E.</small> excavations at Tel Shiqmona, and in Persian Period Tel Dor, both located in Phoenician controlled territory along the coast south of presentday Haifa. <i>Tolaat shani</i> (crimson/scarlet) was likely derived from the body of a female insect, <i>Kermococcus/Kermes,</i> or her eggs. Since wools took the dye but linen did not, those who produced the Tabernacle curtains and priests’ ceremonial clothing likely combined decorative dyed wool with linen threads and then wove gold threads into the cloth (Exodus 39:2–3, 8). While mixing wool and linen was specified for Tabernacle draperies and curtains, the high priest’s vestments, and for <i>tzitzit</i> (Exodus 26:1, 31, 36; 27:16; 28:4–5; Numbers 15:38; Deuteronomy 22:11–12), it was forbidden for common clothing and labeled <i>shaatnez</i> (see at Leviticus 19:19; Deuteronomy 22:9–11).

Tetzaveh

C<small>ERTAIN BIBLICAL PASSAGES</small> show that women served in some capacity at the sanctuary. The clearest case is that of the women attendants at the Tent of Meeting (38:8; I Samuel 2:22). Yet, in contrast to some other ancient cultures, there is no evidence of priestesses in ancient Israel. Scholars have proposed several theories to explain this absence, but none solves the mystery.
One theory is that women could not be priests because they menstruated, making them periodically ritually unclean. However, menstruation is not considered any more defiling than other causes of ritual impurity (see Leviticus 15). Priests could become ritually impure on occasion, yet once the period of impurity passed, they could go back to their priestly duties after performing the necessary ablutions. If menstrual impurity were the issue, why could women not perform communal religious functions during the rather lengthy times in their lives when they were not menstruating?
A second theory is that the absence of women reflects a division of labor along gender lines and the needs of a pre-modern, agricultural community. Because women were needed to bear and raise children and to perform essential household tasks, they could not be spared for temple service. But then why did women function as priestesses in surrounding cultures?
A third theory suggests that the women were priestesses elsewhere because they served in the sanctuaries of goddesses; but since Israel’s official religion did not sanction the worship of goddesses, there was no place in it for priestesses. However, a weakness of this theory is that priestesses in other ancient cultures served in sanctuaries of gods and goddesses alike.
A fourth theory suggests that excluding women from the priesthood meant to distinguish Israel from her neighbors, who often employed women in rituals of a sexual nature. Note, however, that in all the surrounding cultures, female functionaries filled a diverse number of roles, not all of which were sexual in nature. Some women functioned as priestesses; others filled maintenance and support roles or served as singers, dancers, and musicians.
A fifth theory is based on the claim that priestesses in the surrounding cultures did not conduct animal sacrifice—and that Israel followed its neighbors in this respect: women were not included because animal sacrifices constituted a central part of Israelite ritual. However, as Mayer Gruber notes, pictorial illustrations and written references to women slaughtering sacrifices are extant from all over the ancient Near East (“Women in the Cult According to the Priestly Code,” 1987, n. 37).
In evaluating these theories, one should take into account the fact that many of the surrounding cultures where we find priestesses were more economically developed and socially complex than was Israel. The smaller sanctuary that likely existed in ancient Israel—and the simpler procedures there—would have limited the number of functionaries in general. Furthermore, while the Bible legitimizes only male priests (from Aaron’s family), Israelite religion was surely more complex than what the text describes. Women probably had more roles in local sanctuaries than the Bible records.

Ki Tisa

T<small>HE VERSE</small> in this parashah forbidding Israelite “sons” to marry non-Israelite “daughters” (34:16) has troubled many readers, both because of its negative view of outsiders and because of the way it denigrates the religious beliefs of foreign women. On each count, however, closer scrutiny provides a more nuanced, less problematic understanding.
The one-sided nature of this mandate—forbidding men but not women from marrying out (exogamy)— differs from other biblical texts (like Deuteronomy 7:3) that proscribe exogamy for both women and men. Such gender-inclusive prohibitions express larger concerns for setting ethnic boundaries. Forbidding only non-Israelite <i>wives</i> may represent a different practice or tradition, one sensitive to the family dynamics of agrarian societies.
The justification for prohibiting foreign wives in Exodus 34:16 is that it will prevent the worship of foreign gods. This religious reason should be understood in broader terms, with foreign religion standing for the cultural patterns of another people. Endogamous marriages—in which wives shared the same culture as their husbands—perhaps better served community needs. Such brides would be well versed in the particular social customs and technologies necessary for household life, an important consideration in the precarious environment of the farming communities of the biblical period. Thus, marrying an Israelite woman was likely a strategy for survival, not an expression of cultural disdain.
In this respect, note that none of the biblical statements against intermarriage (like Genesis 24:3 or Nehemiah 13:25–27) are absolute prohibitions; they are concerned only with marrying members of local populations. After all, several prominent biblical figures—both women (such as Bathsheba and Esther) and men (such as Moses, David, and Solomon)—have foreign spouses.
Although the religious motivation given in 34:16 for eschewing foreign brides may represent an aversion to foreign culture more generally, it is nonetheless instructive to note that the verse depicts the religious (cultural) practices of women as being more powerful than those of their husbands. Such a view is consonant with what is known about the dynamics of Israelite households: women dominated household religious praxis and exercised considerable managerial control over household life.

Vayakhel

T<small>HERE IS MUCH DEBATE</small> among scholars about the relationship between the Tabernacle and the Jerusalem Temple. Some scholars think that the Tabernacle is a completely mythic structure whose description is based on the Temple constructed early in the 1st millennium <small>B. C.E.</small> These scholars argue that the Tabernacle tradition evolved to justify and provide a pedigree for the Temple. Other scholars argue that there existed a portable Tabernacle that pre-dated the Temple. Although it would not have been as elaborate as the Tabernacle described in the Torah, this structure must have formed the basis for the portable divine dwelling recounted in Exodus 25–40.
While it is currently impossible to determine the historicity of the Tabernacle texts, it is clear that within the Bible, the Tabernacle and the Temple provide two models of sacred space. The Temple model was particularly resonant when Israel/Judea was a sovereign kingdom (10th-6th centuries <small>B. C.E.</small>). The Temple was a symbol of God’s sanction of the Davidic monarchy, and it functioned as a key element in the Judean monarchy’s attempts to centralize national and religious authority (II Samuel 7:11–16; I Kings 8; 12:26–27).
The Tabernacle model was particularly resonant in the absence of Judean—and later, Jewish—sovereignty (after the Babylonian conquest in 587 <small>B. C.E.</small>). According to the Tabernacle model, God is manifest in the community no matter where the community resides. In order to come into contact with God, the people do not need to make pilgrimages to a fixed location. Instead, they need only maintain a set of behaviors that will allow God to reside in their midst no matter where they are. According to the Rabbis, when the Jews went into exile, God’s presence <i>(Shechinah)</i> went with them and continues to manifest itself wherever Jews pray or study Torah. The medieval Kabbalists understood the <i>Shechinah</i> to be a feminine aspect of God. The idea of the <i>Shechinah</i> as an immanent and feminine divine presence has been a source of reflection and inspiration for feminist theologians like Judith Plaskow and Lynn Gottlieb.

T<small>HIS PARASHAH DESCRIBES</small> the priestly vestments: the ephod and breastpiece of gold, blue, purple, and crimson yarns of fine twisted linen, the pure blue woven robe with its pomegranates of blue, purple, and twisted crimson yarns on the hem, the tunics of fine linen woven work to be worn by Aaron and his sons, their headdress and decorated turbans of fine linen, and their sashes of fine embroidered blue, purple, and crimson linen yarns. Besides the priests’ vestments, the text also mentions the hangings and curtains used to decorate the Tabernacle and to separate the rooms.
Producing textiles like these required a series of steps—carding, spinning, dyeing, and weaving the cotton, linen, or wool—tasks typically performed by women in the ancient Near East. Graves of women and girls often include weaving equipment such as bobbins and loom weights, whereas men’s and boy’s graves lack such equipment. Likewise, 4000-year-old graves of women in Turkmenia include specialized knives similar to those used by carpet weavers who live there today. An ancient Egyptian wooden model of a weaver’s house shows women at work weaving, spinning, and winding the yarns. A relief found at Susa, dated to circa 1000 <small>B. C.E.,</small> shows a woman sitting on a stool as she spins.
The objects described in this parashah were for use in the Tabernacle and later in the Jerusalem Temple. What kind of staff maintained those facilities? Consider that Mesopotamian and Egyptian temples were large estates that employed thousands of workers. Female workers associated with these large temples cared for the sick and served as midwives, cooks and pastry chefs, menial cleaners, and janitors, as well as spinners and weavers.
According to Exodus, women performed the skilled work involved in preparing the yarn and weaving the fabrics for the Tabernacle (35:25–26). Although women are not mentioned explicitly in this parashah, archeological evidence and biblical references to women spinning and weaving (Proverbs 31:19; II Kings 23:7; compare Isaiah 19:9) allow us to reconstruct the vital role that Exodus presumes that women played in the construction of the Tabernacle and its elaborate objects.

Vayikra

A<small>LL OF THIS PARASHAH</small> and most of the next one contain instructions for sacrifices, offered by individuals (either women or men) and by households at the central shrine. Yet the extensive focus on communal rites of worship in this part of the Torah may create the impression that other religious practices were either non-existent or discouraged. However, that impression would be erroneous, for—as in traditional societies everywhere—religious activities carried out <i>only</i> by women were part of Israelite household life. Such practices are virtually invisible in the Bible. Nevertheless, archeological evidence, interpreted in light of ethnographic data and anthropological models, allows us to recognize this aspect of women’s lives in the biblical period.
The gender-specific religious behaviors of women centered on the reproductive process. Women faced the possibility of infertility, complications of pregnancy, and insufficient lactation; they were also aware of high infant mortality. Today we deal with these reproductive problems medically. But in antiquity women carried out procedures—which we might view as superstitious—that were fundamentally religious in nature. That is, women performed rituals both to avert the evil forces (like Lilith) believed to be the cause of problems and also to attract benevolent spirits in order to achieve reproductive success.
Such practices were generally apotropaic (protective). Women might wear shiny jewelry or amulets to keep the “evil eye” away. They would tie a red thread around an infant’s limb for similar reasons, a practice that continues to this day among certain Jewish groups. They might keep a lamp burning in or near a birthing room, and they would salt and swaddle a newborn (see Ezekiel 16:4). Other practices, involving votive figurines and fertility symbols known from other ancient cultures, can also be identified. Such religious behaviors focus on the welfare of childbearing women and their offspring. No doubt women considered them necessary for the creation and safeguarding of new life. Carrying out such practices, which they believed could be effective, would have given women a sense of agency in dealing with considerable reproductive risk. This also means that they were ritual experts no less than the priests in charge of the official sacrificial regimen set forth in <i>Vayikra.</i> (See also “Women in Ancient Israel—An Overview.”)

Tzav

M<small>OST LIKELY</small>, Leviticus 6:11 specifies that “only the males” among Aaron’s descendants may eat of certain sacrifices (rather than “every male”). Why can the females in Aaron’s line not partake of these offerings? What determines which priestly portions are restricted to the sons of Aaron, and which may be shared by his daughters as well?
The answer lies in the degree of holiness of the offering. The biblical text distinguishes between sacrifices considered to be “most sacred” (<i>kodesh kodashim)</i> and those considered to be “sacred” <i>(kodesh).</i> Three types of offerings fall under the rubric of “most sacred”: the meal offering (6:10), the purgation offering (6:18) and the reparation offering (7:6). The three most sacred offerings are considered most holy, which means that anyone who touches them—much less partakes of them—must have been previously consecrated, that is, made holy. For this reason, these three sacrifices may be eaten only by Aaron and his sons, that is, the male descendants of the priestly line. Any male of Aaron’s line who has been consecrated—even the blemished priests who are not permitted to officiate—may partake of the most sacred portions within the sanctuary precinct.
In contrast, the priestly portions of offerings labeled simply as “sacred,” rather than “most sacred,” such as the sacrifice of well-being and the first fruits offerings, are not restricted to those who have been consecrated. These offerings can be consumed by all members of the priestly family and household, including both the sons and the daughters of the line of Aaron, as long as they are not in a state of ritual impurity (see Numbers 18:11–19 and Leviticus 22:1–16). It is interesting to note, however, that the daughter of a priest may eat of the portion of the sacred donations assigned to priests only while she is a member of a priestly household. According to Leviticus 22:12–14, if the daughter of a priest marries a layman, she may no longer eat of the sacred gifts. However, if she is widowed or divorced and without offspring, and she rejoins her father’s household, she can once again partake of the portion of sacred offerings allocated to the priests’ families.

P<small>ARASHAT</small> S<small>H’MINI CHALLENGES</small> the notion of a rational religion, yet we still seek a logical basis for the food laws in Leviticus 11. Mary Douglas, who examines the food prohibitions in Leviticus from an anthropological perspective, looks for the underlying rationale. In her influential work <i>Purity and Danger</i> (1966), she concludes that the distinctions between pure and impure animals are based on the principle that pure animals are those that stay well within the bounds of their habitat. The qualities of impure animals are seen as unsuitable for their habitat, thereby threatening to blur the boundaries established by pure animals, who possess qualities seen as suitable for that habitat. Douglas’s categories rely largely on the means of locomotion appropriate to each sphere: wings for air, cleft hooves for earth, fins and scales for water. Everything that blurs these boundaries is segregated and put into a category of defilement.
Less well known is a brilliant and complex later essay, “Self Evidence” (in her book <i>Implicit Meanings,</i> 1975), in which Douglas suggests how biblical food prohibitions fit into the wider historical and sociological realities of the Israelites and later of the Jews, throughout their history. This preoccupation with distinguishing what is inside bounds from what is outside bounds is a reflection, according to Douglas, of Israelite history and sociology. Inside Israel’s frail boundaries is a small political unit surrounded by powerful enemies. Douglas concludes that here is a people who cherish their boundaries and want nothing better than to keep them strong and high; any attempt to cross them is seen as a hostile intrusion.
The mysteries of the parashah and the rational connection between religion and culture come together here. For biblical Israel, being holy means being set apart. Food prohibitions reflect Israel’s preoccupation with clearly defined categories. This preoccupation continues to be expressed when Jews differentiate between the holy and profane, between light and darkness, between Israel and other nations, between Shabbat and the rest of the week. What Douglas illustrates, in both her earlier and later works, is how such religious practices and systems are shaped by sociopolitical circumstances, and, in turn, shape the norms of the community.

Tazria

P<small>ARASHAT</small> T<small>AZRIA CONTAINS</small> one of the most puzzling, even disturbing, passages in Leviticus, a book concerned with holiness. <i>Tazria</i> challenges us, for it places childbirth among the sources of ritual impurity—from which one then needs purification (12:1–8)—and it reckons the birth of a daughter at twice the length of impurity as the birth of a son (12:2, 4–5). In Leviticus, the commandment of purification after childbirth is consistent with the priestly insistence that blood contains or represents the life force. The priestly authors of Leviticus believe that blood, whether menstrual or post-partum, is so powerful as a source of life that only purification rituals can allow those who come into contact with it to rejoin their community. These rituals serve to contain the life force that places contaminated people outside the normative community, by returning them to a state of purity in which they can reenter God’s holy community.
Regardless of whether a woman bears a son or a daughter, the rituals of purification are the same. Why, then must a woman spend twice as long in a state of impurity following the birth of a girl than following the birth of a boy? Traditional interpreters have assumed that this is because the birth of a girl creates a kind of double impurity, possibly because newborn girls contain the latent capacity for menstruation and reproduction. But another point is also important here: in ancient Israel, baby girls arguably faced lives filled with more risks than did baby boys. Israel was a society in which economic value accrued primarily to sons. They remained part of their fathers’ households even when they married, inherited their families’ ancestral lands, and cared for their aging parents. In contrast, there is evidence to suggest that girls were sometimes thought of as expendable. In times of need, famine, and war, baby girls might suffer hunger and neglect, or even be abandoned and left to die.
The priestly authors seem to be concerned about this situation and try to avert such tragedies by ensuring that baby girls stay in their mothers’ protective care for an extended period of time. This not only allows mother and daughter to bond tightly, but also ensures that the child is nursed and cared for. Thus, this troubling passage can be understood not as discrimination against women but as a way to promote God’s loving community—and to guarantee that women and men, both created in the divine image, are nurtured and protected.

Metzora

B<small>Y MOVING FROM</small> a state of ritual impurity to one of ritual purity, the everchanging human body serves as the index for the transformation of identity. The person departing from the state of <i>m’tzora</i> (a person with <i>tzaraat</i>, conventionally translated as a “leper”) follows about ten steps that separate the ritually pure from the ritually impure state. The spectrum between the pure and the impure becomes apparent in the gradations of being outside the camp, then inside the camp but outside one’s tent, and finally inside the community and inside the home. That the ritually impure state is transitional becomes apparent in the time-bound nature of each stage. The body passes through the various stages and is likely to cross several borders between ritually pure and impure over the course of its existence.
As the body undergoes the permutations of ritual purity and impurity, the impure body is sometimes exiled—but not abandoned to its exile. The appearance of a priest outside the camp (14:3) signals that exile is ephemeral and that restoration will begin. No particular priestly category fixes the body, but rather it moves through a full range of categories. This sense of the body as changeable and the potential reversibility of its status are what underlie prophetic notions that sinful actions can be retracted and a dire fate averted.
Focus on the body emphasizes the changes undergone by the self in the process of becoming another self. Signs on the body gauge identity and mark transformation. When the sick are healed, their bodies bear the proof. Yet one’s body is not only an indicator of change but also a vessel of memory. Illness and trauma are remembered by nerves, muscles, and scars. The body that gives birth will forever maintain a link with its offspring. The body attests to change as well as to the indelibility of experience. Therefore descriptions of identity, predicated as they are on the language of body, convey the tension between the possibility of change and the integrity of forms.

Achrei Mot

 L<small>EVITICUS</small> 18 <small>LISTS</small> twelve categories of females who are sexually off-limits to men, based on blood and marital connection. Strikingly, a man’s natural daughter is absent from the list (and from the parallel list in Leviticus 20). Interpreters have approached this glaring omission in a variety of ways. For example:
1.Some readers argue that she is in fact included in the list. Leviticus 18:17 prohibits a man from sexual intercourse with a woman and her daughter; the rabbinic sages extended this to apply to all daughters. Others have argued that Leviticus 18:6, the introductory statement banning men from sexually approaching <i>sh’er b’saro,</i> one’s own flesh, naturally implies daughters. This explanation is unsatisfactory because the other relations are enumerated; the author does not explicitly identify the daughter, as he does the sister.
2.Some argue that it was not necessary to write about the daughter, either because the taboo against father-daughter sexual contact was so ingrained in society that it did not need to be listed, or because fathers supposedly would never approach their daughters sexually. Some interpreters have suggested that a father would not have sex with his daughter because he would lose the ability to garner a generous bride-price for a non-virgin.
3.Finally, some argue that the Torah does not legislate what one does with one’s personal property, and a daughter was considered the property of her father (until transferred to another man).
However, each of these attempts at explanation is problematic. The omission of the daughter is even more troublesome when we note that Israel’s neighbors did explicitly ban father-daughter sexual relations in their law collections; in fact, the Laws of Hammurabi (¶ 154) goes so far as to banish a man who lies with his daughter.
To this date, nobody has made a convincing argument to demonstrate that the daughter is implicitly included in the list. Our task today is to take her absence seriously. We know all too well the startling number of fathers who sexually abuse their daughters in our society. Even if we do not know the real situation for daughters in the biblical period, we must be sensitive to the current message that the daughter’s omission may have for today’s survivors and perpetrators.

Kedoshim

 P<small>ARASHAT</small> K<small>’DOSHIM ARTICULATES</small> more comprehensively than any other portion of the Torah what it means for persons and community to be holy. Dictionary definitions of the Bible’s concept of holiness emphasize the notion of separation. In <i>parashat K’doshim</i>, however, holiness comes from cultivating relationships. Connections—not only separations—define the holy community: the connection to parents whom one must honor, to the poor and the disadvantaged whom one must protect, to the neighbor and stranger whom one must love, and of course to God.
God commands Israel to “love” three times in the Torah. One case is in the text that follows the <i>Sh’ma</i> (“You shall love your God יהוה with all your heart,” Deuteronomy 6:5), known as the <i>V’ahavta.</i> Our parashah mentions the other two commands: to love the one who is a member of one’s group (“Love your fellow [Israelite] as yourself,” 19:18); and finally, to love the stranger (19:34). Loving the stranger is a unique notion in the ancient world. The verse’s rationale for loving the stranger—“for you were strangers in the land of Egypt”—has continuing ramifications that are often overlooked: the proper response to having suffered abuse is not vengeance or special entitlement, but rather sensitivity and determination to prevent such an abuse of others, including strangers. The three commandments are three dimensions of a single, deep connection: to love God is to love others, those like us and those who are not.
Ruth the Moabite stands as the exemplar of what it means to love, including loving the stranger. While still in the land of Moab, Ruth vows an undying loyalty to Naomi, Naomi’s people, and Naomi’s God (Ruth 1:16–17). After she arrives in Bethlehem, Ruth’s behavior and commitment become a model for others: Boaz acknowledges that his kindness to Ruth is prompted by her prior generosity to Naomi (2:11); and the women of the town proclaim that Naomi’s eventual reversal of fortune came about because of “your daughter-in-law, who loves you” (4:15). Even without using the word <i>kadosh</i> (“holy”), the story of Ruth points to the transformation that the “love commandments” in this parashah can bring about—and to the ways that these precepts serve to sanctify life and community.

Emor

 A <small>PRIEST MAY NOT</small> come in contact with a corpse except when the deceased is a close relative (21:1–3). The list of relatives does not mention the wife.
How do we account for the text’s silence concerning the wife? The Torah gives two examples of a husband’s burying a wife: Abraham buries Sarah (Genesis 23), and Jacob buries Rachel (Genesis 35). But these cases do not pertain to priests and thus do not shed light on this law.
One could claim that the wife’s absence from the list of relatives reflects her more marginal status. As Katarzyna Grosz observes after studying documents from the 14th century <small>B. C.E.</small>, “women do not become members of their husband’s lineage—only their children do.…[The women] could be termed as a ‘foreign element’ in their husbands’ families” (“Some Aspects of the Position of Women in Nuzi,” in <i>Women’s Earliest Records,</i> ed. B. S. Lesko, 1989, p. 178).
Yet one could also argue the reverse: no mention is made because none is necessary—because the wife is included ipso facto. Three lines of evidence support this interpretation. First is the idea that Leviticus 20:11 expresses about a unity between husband and wife. According to this verse, the nakedness of the mother is equivalent to that of the father, implying that the two are as one. Second, Genesis 2:24 expresses the unity of the couple by stating that the two become one flesh. Third, the Torah in several places includes a wife without mentioning her (see at Leviticus 10:14); in other words, the writer expects readers to keep wives in mind.
While both interpretations remain plausible in <i>parashat Emor,</i> neither can be confirmed.
If a priest may not bury his wife, who then buries her? The law in <i>parashat Emor</i> permits the priest to bury his mother, and thus a priest’s wife can definitely be buried by her son. If there is no son, then the female members of the household, or members of her family of origin (if they are not priests) can still come in contact with her corpse and bury her.

Behar

 T<small>HE BIBLICAL SYSTEM</small> of a jubilee year has been described as utopian in its vision, promoting a system whereby lands sold under financial distress would be returned to the original owners every fifty years. Under this system, there are checks and balances ensuring a redistribution of wealth at set intervals. This is indeed a utopian vision, grounded both in the religious belief that only God owns the land and people are but tenants on it, and in the socio-economic vision of a remission of debts at set periods.
One would like to think that if this legislation had been in force during some period in history, it would have had a beneficial impact on women and other vulnerable members of society. However, the text does not seem to address many questions regarding the status of women under this system. For example, Leviticus 25:41 uses only grammatically masculine language and male terms to refer to an Israelite who becomes the debt-slave of a fellow Israelite. The text forbids that individual from being treated as a (non-Israelite) slave. The text literally reads that at the year of the jubilee, “he and his children with him shall be free” (25:41). Where is the wife? Commentators often argue that she must be included here, but it is striking that she is missing. According to Exodus 21:2–6, a male Hebrew slave is released after six years of service, but a female slave apparently remains with her master forever—presumably, according to some interpreters, because she has become the sexual property of the owner (21:7–11). The law in Exodus 21, in conjunction with the absence of women in the jubilee laws, prompts disturbing questions.
Similarly, Leviticus 25:47–49 spells out the order of kinsfolk who are required to redeem relatives sold to non-Israelites. The order begins with brothers, uncles, and then male cousins. Again the text is silent on women, suggesting that only men were active participants in this utopian vision of release from servitude and reclamation of ancestral lands.
However, a close reading of the text, along with a study of other sources, demonstrates that despite the seeming omission of women in this account, women were in fact recognized as active participants in all these cases. Jeremiah 34 mentions the release of women slaves; and Numbers 27 and 36 show that women could own land and thus have resources to redeem relatives.

Bechukotai

 T<small>HE CONCLUDING UNIT</small> of Leviticus concerns the economic support base, in the form of vowed resources, for ancient Israel’s central shrine. The first set of such votary pledges, Leviticus 27:2–8, involves the equivalence in silver of persons according to categories of gender and age, with separate assessments listed for females and males in four age groups. Because of the greater monetary values assigned to males in each age category, scholars have sometimes understood this table of valuations as an expression of gender bias, with females considered inherently less valuable than males.
However, many commentators now understand that this table relates mainly to labor potential rather than to intrinsic worth. The highest monetary values appear for persons of ages twenty to sixty; such people would be considered mature adults, given the fact that biblical census texts list males of age twenty and above (namely, those who might be conscripted into military service; see Numbers 1:3). That the youngest age category is that of one- to five-year-olds can be explained by presuming that ancient Israel was like many premodern agrarian societies in expecting children of very young ages to perform simple household tasks. Perhaps because of average differences in physical strength, women or girls were deemed to have a lower productive capacity than males of the same age, and thus Leviticus 27 assigns them a somewhat lower valuation in all categories.
The differential shekel values attached to females and males provide an insight into the labor patterns in Israelite households and the associated status of women. The best way to view the table is to sum the value of the two genders in each age bracket, thus obtaining the combined labor value of a female-male pair of workers in each category; then we can compare the contribution of each gender to this total amount. Except for the five to twenty category, in which childbearing (presumably beginning at puberty) might reduce the labor potential of females, the female percentage of that combined female-male amount is at or near 40 percent. Social scientists who study the relative contributions of women and men to household labor in various cultures have noted that a 2:3 female-to-male ratio, with women supplying 40 percent of the subsistence labor, correlates with the maximum prestige for women. Thus the table of valuations in Leviticus 27 is hardly a reflection of female inferiority but rather provides evidence of a positive estimation of women.

Bamidbar

 A<small>S THE</small> I<small>SRAELITES PREPARE</small> to resume their journey, Moses leads the community in organizational activities: census-taking and the placement of tribal units in preparation for the march. The principles of organization are value-laden; they count only able-bodied men of fighting age in the initial census, and they divide the Levites into units with unequal privileges concerning the holy sanctuary. Though all of the members of the community are traveling to the same place, they do so in a structured fashion in which the boundaries of tribal units are carefully maintained, and in which some groups have more responsibility—and more access to the divine sphere—than others. The overarching tone of the parashah is subsequently patriarchal and hierarchical.
Patriarchy as a cultural system is based on power differentials; able-bodied men are defined as the powerful and active members of the community. (See, for example, bell hooks, <i>Feminist Theory from Margin to Center,</i> 1984.) This is evident in the notable absence of women and other marginal figures from this parashah. What is the place allotted in the Israelite encampment for women, children, or the infirm? Even when the men of Levi are assigned to be Tabernacle functionaries, God states that they are taken for this role as redemption for the Israelite first-born males (3:12). Again, it is men who are the focus of the narrative, and all important tasks in this parashah are done by men.
It is possible, however, to glean from this text a lesson about a handful of important women: Jacob’s wives and the wives’ handmaids. The structure of the Israelite encampment is not random; rather, it groups together certain tribes while separating others. Leah’s descendants—Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun—have pride of place within the Israelite encampment, on the east side closest to the entrance to the Tabernacle. Her other descendants—Reuben, Simeon, and Gad—are located on the south side of the Tabernacle. Their placement can be explained by Genesis 49: all three of these tribal ancestors committed acts that drew harsh criticism from Jacob, and subsequently they are held in lower esteem than their full brothers. The children of the handmaids Bilhah and Zilpah are represented on the northern side of the encampment, and Rachel’s offspring are located on the western side, farthest from the Tabernacle entrance. Hence the descendants of Jacob’s most beloved wife are in a position of less honor than the children of the long-suffering Leah. Even while ignoring the roles of women in defining the community, this parashah still makes a strong statement about the matriarchs of Israel. (See further Mary Douglas, <i>In the Wilderness,</i> 1993, pp. 172–95.)

Nasso

 N<small>UMBERS</small> 5:12–31 <small>DESCRIBES</small> the ordeal of the <i>sotah,</i> the so-called errant wife or “woman accused of adultery.” If a man suspects that his wife has been unfaithful but lacks proof, she is brought to the priest, who puts her through a magical trial or ordeal to ascertain her innocence or guilt. We are not told what brings about the husband’s “fit of jealousy” (v. 14) nor is the spell-induced outcome for the guilty wife plainly described. The text simply states: “if she has defiled herself by breaking faith with her husband…her belly shall distend and her thigh shall sag; and the wife shall become a curse among her people” (v. 27). However, if the woman is innocent, she will be “unharmed and able to retain seed” (v. 28). This verse provides the clue to the entire passage; it helps us understand why the husband suspects his wife in the first place, and how to interpret the symptoms that the guilty woman will suffer.
Verse 28 is best understood to mean that the innocent wife will be able to maintain her pregnancy. If so, then the context of the <i>sotah</i> ritual can be seen as involving a pregnant woman whose husband suspects that he is not the father. It is the husband’s distrust of the origin of his wife’s pregnancy that causes the “fit of jealousy.” Therefore, the central issue is paternity: if the wife is innocent and the husband is truly the unborn child’s father, then the fetus will grow to term. It follows, therefore, that if the wife is guilty and the husband is not the father, then the wife will not be able “to retain seed.” That is, the spell of the ordeal will induce a miscarriage: “if she has defiled herself by breaking faith with her husband…her belly shall distend and her thigh shall sag” (v. 27). Ultimately, regardless of how we today might assess paternity, in the biblical context an intact pregnancy after this ritual is sufficient proof that the husband had indeed fathered this child.

Beha'alotcha

I<small>T IS HARD TO KNOW</small> what to make of the story of Miriam: she is afflicted with snow-white scales for daring to challenge Moses—and by implication, God (12:1–16). First of all, this reader is outraged. Why is Miriam punished, but not her brother Aaron? And why is she punished at all, given the legitimacy of their complaint against Moses? Like so many passages in the Torah, <i>B’haalot’cha</i> seems to express values that are difficult to accept. Upon reflection, though, this reader’s outrage is softened—for there is much here that speaks to the power of women, even as it reflects unease about their authoritative voice.
Moses has married a foreign woman and his siblings complain, perhaps upset that Moses continues to lead Israel despite violating the law while they, leaders who are guilty of no such wrong, remain subject to his authority. Imagine their surprise when God responds directly to their complaint—and their dismay when God chastises them and supports Moses. Aaron seems not to suffer for his insubordination, but Miriam’s punishment is described in detail. She is afflicted with a horrible skin ailment that threatens to place her in a state of ritual impurity and block her access to God’s holiness. As if this were not enough, she must remain outside the Israelite encampment for a full week, like a disobedient daughter shamed by her father.
At first, the story of snow-white Miriam seems a perfect example of a double standard, for God permits the brother independent thought but punishes the sister for the very same ideas and words. Still, the story is more than that, for it shows us how much all of Israel valued Miriam. Her brothers plead for her, as Aaron beseeches Moses and then Moses prays to God to reverse their sister’s punishment. And the people do not respond by abandoning this victim of God’s great anger. Rather, they “did not march on until Miriam was readmitted” seven days later (v. 15), thus expressing their solidarity with the woman who in happier times led them in victory song and celebration (Exodus 15:20–21).

Sh'lach

T<small>HE SCOUTS DISPATCHED</small> to investigate the nature of the Promised Land have suffered from a bad reputation. The Torah and the commentators blame them for one generation’s loss of the land, for forty years of wandering through the wilderness, and for Moses’ untimely demise just beyond the border of the land. The ten scouts, however, can be seen in a different light.
When they commence their reconnaissance mission, all that the scouts and the people of Israel have heard of their destination is that God promised it to their ancestors, that it flows with milk and honey, and that it is populated by other peoples. The scouts’ uncertainty as to whether Israel really belongs in its Promised Land results from their lack of knowledge and familiarity with this place. They experience Canaan through the filter of God’s description and probe its veracity more than they investigate the landscape. Because they are unable to find evidence that legitimates God’s promise of the land, the scouts reject promise and land alike.
The scouts begin by corroborating God’s description: “it does indeed flow with milk and honey” (13:27), and it is inhabited by other people; but they go on to invert the elements of God’s version. The land flowing with milk and honey becomes the land that eats its inhabitants; it is not like a nourishing mother offering sweet milk, but a cannibalistic mother not to be trusted (13:32). The peoples of Canaan are no ordinary nations, but Nephilim—a race of demi-gods born from the union of the sons of God and the daughters of humans (13:33; see also at Genesis 6:24). Next to their “enormous stature” the Israelites seem like “grasshoppers.” In the land of primordial giants, Israel’s ancestors are nowhere to be seen.
At this juncture, the majority of the scouts and the people have no will to wage war against giants or the land’s inhabitants; better they should have no homeland than engage in what seem to be fruitless wars. The scouts’ report fuels a narrative of opposition to the Promised Land—the place is a curse and not a blessing! It also opens up the possibility of a new identity: being an Israelite resistant to the notion that the people belong within a circumscribed territory. Instead of an inaugural vision, what the scouts report makes Israel want to go back to Egypt (Numbers 14:34). The scouts’ story is the anti-myth of the Promised Land.

Korach

P<small>ARASHAT</small> K<small>ORACH DESCRIBES</small> the punishment that befalls two groups of challengers. In the case of Dathan and Abiram, the rebels’ wives die along with their husbands. Yet in the Korah episode, only the men are punished. The story as a whole reflects a central biblical theme: the tension between a clan-based system of authority and a centralized system of priestly authority.
Dathan and Abiram represent what can be called clan heads or household heads. (The biblical terminology is not always consistent.) Early in Israel’s history, male heads of families had authority and jurisdiction over their families. For example, in Genesis 38 the patriarch Judah decides whether his pregnant, seemingly adulterous daughter-in-law Tamar should live or die. In contrast, the priest administers the ritual to determine whether a woman is an adulteress in Numbers 5.
According to the Bible, women within the clan system of authority played a significant role and exercised power as well as some authority. Although subject to the authority of the male head of the household, women clearly influenced the family head. For instance, unable to tolerate her rival, Sarah demands that Abraham expel Hagar. Despite Abraham’s reluctance, God tells him to obey Sarah (Genesis 21:12).
Texts that focus on the priesthood shift authority away from the family’s head toward the central sanctuary and its priests. Women, in particular, are affected by this shift (see at Leviticus 26:30). Whereas in Genesis 38 Tamar actively works to secure her fate, in Numbers 5 the suspected woman is a passive figure. The inclusion of the wives of Dathan and Abiram reflects the role that women played within the clan system.
Thus, Numbers 16 is not only a story of infighting among families, ultimately championing Aaron and his descendants; it also tells a story about the seeming demise of an important notion of the “biblical family.” The deaths of Dathan, Abiram, and their wives at the doorway to their tents (16:27) make the point painfully clear: after all, the entrance to the tent is a place associated with theophany and judgment in the clan system, and hence also a symbol of authority (Genesis 18:1; Deuteronomy 22:21). Together, Dathan, Abiram, <i>and</i> their wives represent the clan system that must be erased—swallowed whole—in order to establish the authority of the priesthood.

Chukat

M<small>IRIAM, WHO HAS PLAYED</small> both a vital and a subdued role in the story of the Exodus and the wilderness wanderings, dies in this parashah. Her death is reported briefly: “Miriam died there, and was buried there” (20:1). There is no mention of people mourning her death or feeling the loss of her contribution to the Israelite people. Not long afterward, when Aaron is about to die, Moses in an elaborate ceremony publicly passes on Aaron’s ritual clothing, signs of his exalted position, to Aaron’s son Eleazar. Then, the people mourn him for thirty days (20:22–29). This contrast between Miriam’s and Aaron’s deaths is striking and troubling.
How does Moses respond to Miriam’s death? While the text does not record his reaction, we can glean important insights from the way he handles (or mishandles) the subsequent crisis over water and from the way her name appears obliquely in this episode.
In the debacle that immediately follows Miriam’s death, when the Israelites clamor for water (20:2–5), Moses hits the rock instead of speaking to it as instructed (v. 8). God punishes both Moses and Aaron for this failure by having them die in the wilderness instead of permitting them to enter the Promised Land. The telling clue to Moses’ attitude is suggested by his words. Before hitting the rock, Moses cries out “Listen, you rebels!” (v. 10). The word for “rebels” is <i>morim,</i> and it appears nowhere else in the Bible in this form. Remarkably, in their unvocalized form the words, <i>morim</i> (rebels) and <i>miryam</i> (Miriam) are identical; both words are made up of the same four Hebrew consonants: <i>m-r-y-m.</i>
This verbal coincidence may intimate that Moses’ behavior has as much to do with losing Miriam as with his frustration with the Israelite people. It suggests that when faced with the task of producing water, Moses recalls Miriam as his older sister, his co-leader, and perhaps most of all, the clever caretaker who guarded him at the Nile.
Moses may have learned the hard way that the public silence about Miriam’s loss was a mistake. Perhaps, then, the elaborate mourning for Aaron reflects what Moses gleaned from that lesson.

Balak

I<small>N THE BRIEF</small> and gruesome episode at the conclusion of <i>parashat Balak</i> (25:6–9), what do the Israelite man and the Midianite woman do to provoke Phinehas’s wrath? Apparently it is the brazenness of an Israelite leader engaging in idolatrous worship with the daughter of a Midianite chieftain within the sight of the whole community that causes Phinehas’s immediate, violent reaction. But the text raises a number of questions and gives a few hints that something else may have incited his brutal response as well.
First, the priestly author mentions that the man brought the woman (identified in the next parashah respectively as Zimri and Cozbi), to <i>echav,</i> translated here as “his companions” (v. 6). The term <i>ach</i> is a kinship term, often translated as “brother” or more loosely as “kin.” If, following Ibn Ezra, we translate <i>echav</i> as “kinsmen,” then it appears that Zimri is introducing Cozbi to his family. Then they step into the <i>kubbah,</i> a word that appears nowhere else in the Bible, here translated as “chamber” (v. 8). If they are simply going there to engage in idolatry, why would he have introduced her to his family? Second, why does Phinehas kill both Zimri and Cozbi, when Moses commanded to kill only the Israelites who were engaging in idolatry (v. 4)? Third, why does the author include the detail that Phinehas stabs both Zimri and Cozbi in the belly (v. 8) if their crime is worshipping foreign gods?
One explanation that answers all of these questions is that the author conveys through these details that Zimri has married Cozbi, and that they come to the Israelite camp so that he can introduce his bride to his family. Thus, the <i>kubbah</i> is a marriage canopy where the couple goes to consummate the marriage. Therefore, the issue is also intermarriage, not only idolatry.
If this interpretation is correct, then the recounting of this incident reflects an attitude toward intermarriage that conflicts with other biblical stories. Possibly the report about Moses’ own wife Zipporah, which states that she was a Midianite woman and a priest’s daughter, aims specifically to illustrate a different perspective toward foreign women (Exodus 2:16–21; see also how Zipporah rescues Moses from death in Exodus 4:24–26). The book of Ruth, where a Moabite woman becomes the progenitor of King David, likewise challenges an exclusionary perspective.

Pinchas

T<small>HIS PARASHAH STARTS</small> in a significant place: in the aftermath of the momentous events at Peor. One would think that the reward of Phinehas should have concluded the last parashah instead of starting a new one. But this new parashah is about the future; specifically, changes God makes for the future, changes that affect the priesthood, the government, and the women of Israel.
<i>Concerning Phinehas.</i> A more literal translation of v. 11 may make it easier to understand why Phinehas is rewarded for his violent act. Phinehas “was zealous for יהוה’s zeal.” <i>Kinah</i> (“zeal” or “jealousy”) is the furious sense of righteous indignation that one may feel when one has been betrayed by someone who owed one allegiance and fidelity.
A husband may feel “a fit of jealousy” (5:14), and Israel is warned many times that God is a “jealous God” (Exodus 20:5; 34:14; Deuteronomy 4:24; 5:9; Joshua 24:19) and that this “jealousy” may make God utterly destroy Israel if they abandon God (Deuteronomy 6:14–15). Now God’s wrath has been kindled and a plague is raging within the Israelite camp when Phinehas steps in to prevent God from wiping out all of Israel. Like Elijah, who is also “zealous for יהוה” (I Kings 19:10), Phinehas empathizes with God’s rage and acts it out. He acts with violence to stop violence, like setting a backfire to stop a wildfire.
Phinehas’s action works. But in the new world that this parashah is setting up, God does not want to perpetuate the cycle of violence. And so, even in the act of rewarding Phinehas, God establishes a new order by granting him a “covenant of peace” (<i>shalom,</i> not “friendship”) in 25:12. The eternal priesthood will create peace and reconciliation, not by killing evildoers but by the sacrificial system. Their violence is limited to killing an animal—the bloodshed confined to dashing the blood on the altar. Once again, a careful translation brings out the meaning: “he and his seed will have a covenant of eternal priesthood because he was zealous for his God, and he will make atonement for the Children of Israel” (25:13).
Phinehas has been much discussed in our tradition. Psalm 106:30 states only that Phinehas stood in prayer and thus stopped the plague. During the Maccabean period, Phinehas was the model for Mattathias, who also acted with zeal for God (I Maccabees 2:26, 50–64). Eventually, the Rabbis became uncomfortable with the idea of people taking the law into their own hands, and they transformed even the image of Phinehas into a calm presenter of legal argument. In their assessment of this parashah, although recognizing Phinehas’s pure motives, they frame his act as part of the past—never to be repeated—but rather to be replaced by the ordinary actions of priests.
In this parashah the priests figure also in the new role for the leader. Moses appoints Joshua his successor, but with a difference: Joshua will not have all of Moses’ powers. Instead, Joshua is a temporal ruler, neither priest nor prophet. But the priests, using the Urim and Thummim, will channel God’s commands (27:21).
<i>Concerning the Daughters of Zelophehad.</i> Part of this new world order involves the right of brotherless women to inherit their father’s land. This decision is similar to the ancient Greek rule of the <i>epi-klara,</i> who also inherits her father’s land and must marry her kin. Often we assume that this makes the women just a “place marker,” holding the empty place in the paternal succession; but the story of the Shunammite in II Kings 4 and 8 shows how important it is to a woman to hold land. The wealthy Shunammite becomes the prophet Elisha’s benefactor; when he offers a reward, she responds, “I live among my own kin” (II Kings 4:13). Unusually, she has not left her kin to live with her husband’s family. Alone among the childless women of the Bible, she is not actively seeking a child. (However, once she gives birth, she is fiercely protective of her son.) Later, Elisha warns her of famine; she leaves the land and returns seven years later to petition the king to give her back her property. She comes to cry for “her land and her field,” and the king instructs, “Return to her all that is hers.” In a comparable situation elsewhere in the Bible, the land Naomi seeks to sell is carefully called “the portion of field that belonged to our brother Elimelech” (Ruth 4:3), and the property is called “all that was Elimelech’s” (Ruth 4:8). The fact that the Shunammite’s land is <i>hers</i> and that she lives among <i>her</i> people suggests that she is a latter-day daughter of Zelophehad: she lives among her own kin, and her land belongs to her. And what a difference this makes: she is independent in her actions and not worried about her lack of children. The economic security of owning her own land gives her independence from her husband; she neither asks his permission to be Elisha’s patron nor to seek the prophet as a client. The Shunammite may be an example of how women act when the economic constraints of patriarchy are removed. This is why she is identified by place rather than by name or as “Mrs. Somebody.” Shunem is her village—the village of her father’s household and the village where she lives as an adult woman, the locale of the land that she owns. She is a woman of place and—by contrast—she shows how significant the lack of such place is to most women’s history.
The limitation of women’s property rights is the economic linchpin of patriarchal structure. The basic fact that women did not normally own land in ancient Israel made them economically dependent on men—first on their fathers, then on their husbands, and ultimately on their sons. But the daughters of Zelophehad—and the rule that they initiated—let some women escape this dependence.

Matot

L<small>AWS ABOUT</small> vows in this parashah invite readers to reflect on the most (in) famous story about vows in the Bible: that of Jephthah’s daughter. Her father, the warrior Jephthah, vows to sacrifice as a burnt offering the first thing to come out of his house should he win a particular battle (Judges 11:30–31). When his only child, his daughter, comes out dancing to greet him after his victory, Jephthah bemoans his (!) predicament. But far from challenging his rash vow, Jephthah’s unnamed daughter encourages him to fulfill it (Judges 11:36). Her only request is that she be allowed to spend two months alone with her female companions in order to “bewail [her] maidenhood” (Judges 11:38). Afterward, “he did to her as he had vowed” (Judges 11:39). The narrator concludes by noting that it became a custom for young Israelite women to gather annually for four days to chant dirges in the daughter’s memory (11:39–40). Tikva Frymer-Kensky suggests that no one in Israel would have viewed this death lightly. “Jephthah’s daughter is a pious and faithful woman who is remembered in cult and story” (“The Bible and Women’s Studies,” <i>Studies in the Bible and Feminist Criticism,</i> 2006, p. 172). But what messages does her memory convey?
A story about a rash oath by another father, King Saul, suggests a comparison. Saul takes an oath that whoever eats or drinks during a particular battle will be put to death (I Samuel 14:24). His son Jonathan inadvertently violates the oath (even ridiculing it when he learns of it afterward), and Saul commands that Jonathan be executed. Jonathan expresses his readiness to die (v. 44). The troops, however, protest and instead ransom Jonathan (v. 45). Although we do not know what such “ransom” entails, Jonathan’s life is spared.
The two stories come from different settings and function as a critique within their context. Taken together, the stories of Jephthah’s daughter and of Jonathan also convey messages about community and protest. Jonathan’s story illustrates the power in community to discover ways to overturn rash pronouncements when it would cost a human life. Perhaps the legacy of Jephthah’s daughter resides in the formation of community that can protest. It begins with the women who gather annually and chant, making their voices heard.

Masei

 N<small>UMBERS 27</small> <small>DESCRIBED</small> the amending of a law regarding who may inherit land: Zelophehad’s daughters—Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah—brought their case before Moses; after they demanded their share of the land, the law was amended to enable them to inherit their father’s land. However, in this parashah (Numbers 36), the clan heads of their tribe approach Moses and ask him to prevent the discrimination stemming from the previously amended law. Apparently, correcting the earlier inequity created a new one, this time for the tribe to which they belong. As before, Moses amends the legislation, under God’s guidance.
The two stories, taken together, nicely illustrate the fact that some laws in the Torah are the outcome of cooperation between God and human beings. This raises the question concerning the nature of the Torah’s laws. Most of the commandments in the Torah appear as if written a priori and seem sealed and unchangeable. Nevertheless, five commandments happen to be the outcome of certain circumstances that called for God’s intervention and resulted in new legislation and amendments. (The other three cases are: the stories of the blasphemer in Leviticus 24:10–16; the man gathering sticks in Numbers 15:32–36; and the ritually impure individuals prevented from bringing the paschal offering on time in 9:1–14.)
The Torah could have preserved only the final laws, without the narratives that describe their emergence. But it seems that the Torah intentionally highlights a principle of dialogue between human groups and divine legislation. The purpose of the laws is that “one shall live by them” (Leviticus 18:5), meaning that the laws of the Torah must fit life. Such a goal is achieved by an openness to change, albeit with God’s explicit consent and command. As a result, this parashah constitutes the philosophical basis for the Oral Torah—that is, the ongoing, authoritative interpretations of Scripture. The presupposition is that its legal kernel and principles are embedded within the Written Torah, and that through different sorts of exegesis of the Torah (that is, through its explanation and interpretation), the Oral Torah is fleshed out. By way of constant searching, responses are revealed to neverending questions.

Devarim

 D<small>EUTERONOMY COMMENCES</small> with a review of several prior moments in Israel’s history. This parashah contains a theme relevant for women and all modern Jews, especially those interested in interpreting the text differently than has been done previously—for Moses, the great prophet and lawgiver, provides his own interpretation of Israel’s history and even law.
The book begins by claiming that what follows are Moses’ words, addressed to the Israelites (1:1), meaning that they are presented as his words, not those of the unidentified narrator. The text legitimates Moses’ comments, noting that they are “in accordance with the instructions that יהוה had given him” (1:3).
Before the start of Moses’ speech, we read, “Moses undertook to expound this Teaching” (<i>torah</i>; 1:5). The word translated as “undertook” expresses a decision connected with a new initiative or a bold action. The implication is that Moses initiates what becomes a long Jewish tradition: constant reinterpretation of the text. In an ironic and Jewish way, the Torah has already begun to be interpreted within the text.
A quick overview reveals that Moses’ address agrees with in general, but is not identical to, the way that these events are described in previous books. In some of these instances, the differences actually put more power in the hands of the people for things like choosing judges (Deuteronomy 1:13 versus Exodus 18:25) or sending out the scouts (Deuteronomy 1:22 versus Numbers 13:1). The book’s later portions even present some of the laws differently than in the prior books (see, for example, 12:2–28), indicating an early process of adaptation and interpretation, not just of history but of legal material as well.
Thus, the opening parashah of Deuteronomy, one of the most important books in the Hebrew Bible, teaches us an important lesson about the way traditions change over time, even within this most sacred text. This lesson is particularly relevant to women and liberal Jews, who at times have been criticized for engaging in what happens to be the very interpretive process witnessed in Deuteronomy—and exemplified in the work of the scholars who have contributed to this <i>Commentary.</i>

P<small>ARASHAT</small> V<small>A-ET</small>’<small>CHANAN FIGURES PROMINENTLY</small> in debates about the development of monotheism, the belief in God’s oneness. While certain passages reflect Deuteronomy’s mandate that a single God must be worshipped at one shrine by one people (see 4:35; 6:4), others suggest a belief in the existence in multiple deities (see 4:19–20). Despite the Bible’s claim that Moses introduced monotheism to the world, many scholars recognize that Israel’s commitment to monotheism developed over time. Texts such as 4:19–20 or Exodus 15:11 (“Who is like you, יהוה, among the celestials [literally: gods]?”) likely represent an earlier stage in Israel’s theological development. Furthermore, prophetic diatribes against idolatry (see, for instance, Jeremiah 2 or Hosea 2) suggest that monotheism may have been the ideal, but it may not have been the practice of the average Israelite until the 6th century <small>B. C.E.</small>
Tikva Frymer-Kensky shed enormous light on the process through which monotheism took root within Israelite culture and thus revolutionized biblical religion. In her influential 1992 book <i>In the Wake of the Goddesses,</i> she described the transition to monotheism as a process in which the image of Israel’s God expanded to include all the functions previously attributed to various gods and goddesses—the multiple divine personalities thought to determine the natural world. Israel’s God became the rainmaker, healer, warrior, and, as the many tales of barren women attest, controller of human reproduction.
However, this perception of one God as master of the universe creates a theological challenge. The polytheistic universe, observed Frymer-Kensky, is defined by change and flux in which humanity is at the mercy of the gods. Divine whims destroy cities; divine squabbles cause deluge or drought. Now, with one God in control, what accounts for destruction and tragedy? Frymer-Kensky asserted that biblical monotheism makes human beings the initiators of change within the universe. Human behavior becomes the variable that determines the course of history and the natural world. When Israel behaves, there is rain and abundance; when Israel sins, there is drought and death (Deuteronomy 11:13–17). Frymer-Kensky noted that biblical monotheism thus comes with a mandate: as God’s partners, it becomes humanity’s responsibility to maintain God’s universe through right behavior and social justice.

Eikev

 A<small>MONG ALL THE BLESSINGS</small> and exhortations of <i>parashat Eikev</i>, the social role of women is addressed most explicitly with reference to the widow (10:18). In a patriarchal world, the widow, like the fatherless child, lacks a man to defend her rights. According to the Bible, the <i>almanah</i> (widow) functions in an illdefined but usually perilous role, for women are primarily defined by their relationships to men in positions of power, first as daughters and then as wives. When no grandfather, father, or adult son is living, an <i>almanah</i> has no man with authority over her—or responsibility for her. Although an <i>almanah</i> may be independent of male domination, she would probably have difficulty functioning as an autonomous individual in ancient Israel’s kinship-based, agricultural society.
In this context, God appeals to justice: an <i>almanah</i> must be recognized as an independent agent in order to support herself; to do otherwise would be unjust. God seeks redress, not out of sympathy for the “pitiable” widow, but because the woman should rightly be allowed to function on her own authority. (See Numbers 30:10, which holds widows and divorcees solely responsible for their vows, in contrast to young-adult daughters and to wives.)
Deuteronomy is particularly concerned with the <i>almanah</i>; it employs the word eleven times (10:18; 14:29; 16:11, 14; 24:17, 19, 20, 21; 26:12, 13; 27:19), compared to six instances in the rest of the Torah. In Deuteronomy, she is always mentioned with the command that her welfare be guaranteed and protected. Significantly, the masculine form of the word appears only once in the Bible (Jeremiah 51:5), whereas <i>almanah</i> (singular or plural) appears fifty-five times with the sense of “widow.” Several biblical narratives illustrate the problems that widows face and some of the areas where they experience autonomy. Judging by I Samuel 25, wealthy widows probably do well, for there Abigail seems to inherit her husband’s property before she marries David. On the other hand, the story of Ruth and Naomi illustrates the peril of poor widows with no one to advocate or provide for them.

Re'eh

 A<small>N IMPORTANT ISSUE</small> in this parashah is the centralization of religious life at the one chosen sanctuary. Yet the wording of several instructions raises at least two questions about the inclusion of women.
First, daughters and female slaves are commanded to celebrate two of the pilgrimage festivals—Shavuot (16:11) and Sukkot (16:14), but not Passover (16:5–8)—along with marginal individuals like widows and orphans. (See also 12:12.) But why are wives not mentioned? The command addressed to the head of household apparently includes the man’s wife as the senior female of the household; the head of the household, when male, thus stands for both members of the conjugal pair (see also <i>Mishpatim,</i> Another View). This implicit inclusion of the wife perhaps authorizes her to act on behalf of her husband should he be unable for any reason to make the pilgrimage trip. In fact, listing her separately would have precluded her status as “second-in-command.”
The summary of the stipulations for the three pilgrim festivals presents a second problem, for it specifies that “all your males” shall come to the Chosen Place (16:16). Why are women not mentioned? Some have suggested that Deuteronomy exempts women because the journey might be too difficult for them, especially those with young children. But another possibility acknowledges that agrarian households included animals that could not be left untended for close to two weeks (the weeklong holiday plus travel time). As the chief household managers (see Proverbs 31:10–31), women were the natural ones to maintain the household at such times. Thus, the all-inclusive injunction for everyone to participate in the Sukkot festival every seventh year that is found elsewhere in Deuteronomy (31:10–12) may be idealistic. Alternatively, the insistence on women’s participation on that occasion may emphasize that they too should experience the special covenant renewal of the seventh-year celebration.
Twenty-first-century expectations for gender equality in the Torah are unrealistic. Because Israelite society was organized by lineage units, Deuteronomy addresses many of its instructions to the heads of households (usually male), who bear the main responsibility for fulfilling the Torah’s cultic requirements. Yet, although women often are not addressed explicitly in the pilgrimage regulations, they are not forbidden to participate; in fact, several texts indicate their presence. In this respect, the festival commands of Deuteronomy seem more inclusive than comparable rules in Exodus (compare Exodus 23:14–17).

Shoftim

D<small>EUTERONOMY CONTAINS</small> the only ancient Near Eastern legal corpus that extensively treats the question of correct wartime behavior. <i>Parashat Shof’tim</i> introduces the first group of regulations (20:1–9, 10–18, 19–20); the rest are scattered throughout the next parashah (21:10–14; 23:10–15; 24:5). Curiously, these regulations are not what one might expect from a collection of laws related to warfare. They are not concerned with strategic issues typical of warfare, like mustering the army, logistics, or battle tactics. Instead, the military regulations in our parashah deal with the peripheral aspects of war, particularly with those affected by it: women and children, cattle, trees, and even members of the attacking side.
The first, and therefore most prominent, rule defines those conscripts who are released from war (20:5–7): men who have built a new house, planted a vineyard, or given a betrothal gift, but they have not yet benefited from these three types of investments. The reason given is “lest he die in battle” and another person profit. This rationale echoes the curse familiar from ancient Near Eastern treaties: you will labor, but someone else will eat the fruit of your toil. It is noteworthy that in 28:30, precisely the three cases in our parashah are turned into curses. Thus, rather than glorify warfare, Deuteronomy views it as a curse that needs curbing, even for the attacking side.
Similar to the stipulations in our parashah pertaining to the establishment of a monarchy (17:14–20), these rules of war reflect a subversive criticism of a key element prevalent in ancient societies: in this case, wars of expansion inaugurated by the Neo-Assyrian empire in the 8th to 7th centuries <small>B. C.E.</small> Therefore, Deuteronomy’s rules of warfare can be understood as an ideological polemic related to the military and political pressures that Israel and Judah experienced at the time.
We see, then, that the attitude toward warfare in our parashah is a learned reaction to wars forced upon the small nations at that time. Criticizing military acts implicitly and indirectly reveals the viewpoint of the Israelite underdogs, the victims of such actions.

Ki Teitzei

 T<small>HE LEGISLATION IN</small> 24:1–4 deals not with divorce so much as with remarriage. The text mentions only in passing that grounds for divorce include <i>ervat davar,</i> translated here as “something obnoxious” in a woman (v. 1), and that a <i>sefer k’ritut,</i> a “bill of divorcement,” changes hands (v. 3). The real concern of this section is to prohibit a man from <i>remarrying</i> a woman who had taken a new husband in the meantime, even if the subsequent marriage ended legitimately.
It remains unclear what, if anything, these verses signify about contractual relations between husbands and wives in ancient Israel; but what lessons can we draw from the text itself? Some commentators claim that this legislation is meant to guard against confusion over paternity; others posit that it discourages men from divorcing in haste and repenting at leisure. Yet these ends could be achieved without a new-husband clause, so why not simply prohibit remarriage to the same wife? One possible answer is that the new-husband clause might create a measure of autonomy for the woman, who is otherwise a passive party under biblical marriage law. She can put herself off limits to her first husband by agreeing to become another man’s spouse, or she can signal her commitment to her first husband by remaining single.
But why would the male authors of this text legislate for female autonomy? Perhaps because of the intriguing theological implications as set forth in the book of Jeremiah. Along with some other prophets, Jeremiah envisages a metaphorical marriage in which God is the husband and Israel the wife who has done “something obnoxious” or “unseemly” (3:8). Israel has been unfaithful with many lovers (3:1), meaning that she has worshipped other gods. The prophet implies that even if God hands Israel a bill of divorce, she can refrain from taking a new husband (by no longer worshipping other gods) and can instead wait for her first husband, God, to take her back.
Like the wife in our parashah, Israel—as depicted by Jeremiah—can maintain some degree of autonomy by choosing to change her ways. With renewed commitment, she can reaffirm her sacred relationship with God.

Ki Tavo

 P<small>ARASHAT</small> K<small>I</small> T<small>AVO CONTRASTS</small> the blessings that reward those who keep the commandments with the curses that punish those who spurn them. Perhaps the most horrifying threat is that enemy invaders will devour the crops and cattle (28:51), causing even “tender” mothers to eat their own children (28:56–57). Here, as elsewhere, Deuteronomy presents a framework that we can fill out from other sources; the obvious intertext in this case is the book of Lamentations. Lamentations 4:5 depicts the upper class—“those who feasted on delicacies…those reared in crimson”—reduced to starvation and squalor. This helps us understand that in our parashah, the mother who “would never venture to set a foot on the ground” (28:56) is a member of the privileged elite, wearing the ancient equivalent of “taxi shoes” (those not for walking). One wonders if the adjective “tender” (v. 56) is ironic; not only does this mother eat her children, but according to Lamentations 4:10, she boils them first. These biblical passages remind us that enemies can reduce us to desperate measures and diminish us morally, causing us to perform formerly unimaginable acts in order to survive. Yet not all women eat their babies, even when in truly dire straits. How many actual mothers in Nazi concentration camps risked their own lives to preserve their children?
Who are the enemies that the curses of this parashah refer to? Deuteronomy blames the Israelites themselves: the enemy invasion and economic collapse are depicted as the self-induced consequences of failing to keep the commandments (28:15). People on the brink of death from starvation can face choices beyond their worst nightmares, but a reasoned choice was possible earlier on: the just society represented by Deuteronomy’s laws versus the unjust society reflected by its curses.
For Deuteronomy, the measure of a just society is at the margins—the treatment of the stranger, fatherless, and widow (26:12). If a community does not respond to their needs, then it risks creating the very conditions in which, according to Deuteronomy, even the most privileged are bound to suffer. In such circumstances, how will we treat our babies and those in need?
<i>—Diana Lipton</i>

Nitzavim

 T<small>HE CLOSING VERSES</small> of <i>parashat Nitzavim</i> are frequently invoked as evidence of the Torah’s insistence on human free will. According to Deuteronomy 30:15–21, God presents Israel with a clear-cut and seemingly obvious choice between obedience, which will lead to life, and disobedience, which will lead to death. This free-will paradigm argues that Israel is responsible for its fate and that national misfortune is caused by Israel’s disobedience of the covenant. To modern historians, events like the conquest of the northern kingdom of Israel by the Assyrians (8th century <small>B. C.E.</small>) or the destruction of the southern kingdom of Judah by the Babylonians (6th century <small>B. C.E.</small>) would be evidence of Israel’s essential powerlessness in the face of stronger nations. However, this parashah and other biblical texts insist that Israel is not a pawn at the mercy of foreign powers, but instead is wholly responsible for its own fate.
Although the articulation of free will in these verses has been central to Jewish self-understanding for centuries, in the parashah itself this notion was largely theoretical. When the exilic or post-exilic authors or redactors imagined the scene of covenant-making that occurred in the mythic past, they already knew the choice that Israel would make. If Israel experienced exile, Israel must, by definition, have made the wrong choice—namely, disobedience.
The pressing question then becomes not whether Israel has free will, but how Israel can achieve reconciliation after having made its self-destructive choice. This concern generates the other view of history articulated in this parashah: the notion that Israel’s history is a repeated sequence of iniquity, judgment, repentance, and deliverance. The Bible reiterates this pattern in the book of Judges, which frames legends about Israel’s past within statements regarding Israel’s disobedience and punishment, followed by Israel’s repentance and deliverance (as in Judges 3:5–15). Israel repeatedly disobeys the covenant and embarks on the journey of <i>t’shuvah</i> (repentance) that carries it from iniquity to deliverance. Thus, in Deuteronomy and other biblical texts, free will becomes operative not in moments of initial obedience or disobedience, but later, in the choice whether or not to repent, where the right decision ultimately leads to redemption.

Vayeilech

 P<small>ARASHAT</small> V<small>AYEILECH DESCRIBES</small> Moses’ final preparations before taking leave of Israel. On the verge of his death, Moses appoints Joshua as military commander. He also sets the date on which the Torah should be read publicly; and, in an attempt to protect the people from God’s wrath, he teaches the poem <i>Haazinu</i> (the content of Deuteronomy 32, in the next parashah). Knowing that he cannot enter the Promised Land and that he is about to die does not make Moses less committed to the nation. On the contrary, he carries out these preparations with great care and attention to detail, demonstrating his love and devotion to Israel.
One way that the parashah communicates this message is through the repetition of the word “all” <i>(kol).</i> Deuteronomy 31 begins with the statement that Moses addresses “all Israel” (31:1), and that “in the sight of all Israel” (31:7) he appoints Joshua as commander. The expression “all Israel” (<i>kol Yisrael)</i> is used frequently in Deuteronomy, reflecting the continued insistence that no individual should be left out. When Moses charges the priests and “all the elders of Israel” to impart God’s Teaching (31:9), he repeats the command that this must be done when “all Israel” appears before God (31:11). Moses specifies that “men, women, children, and the strangers” must be gathered to learn “every word” of the Teaching <i>(kol divrei hatorah)</i> (31:12).
Moses demonstrates his concern and conscientiousness in other ways, too. In particular, he makes sure that women are included. Just as 29:10 makes it clear that women are part of the covenant ceremony, 31:12 states explicitly that women must study and faithfully observe the terms of the covenant. Similarly, Moses writes down the words of this Teaching “to the very end” (31:24), and he also recites the words of the poem “to the very end” (31:30).
The word <i>kol</i> also appears in an earlier passage, one that shows Moses at a rather different point in his life. During the course of the wilderness wanderings, Moses uses a striking maternal metaphor when, exasperated, he tries to distance himself from the people: “Did I produce [or: conceive] all this people <i>(kol haam</i>), did I engender [or: give birth to] them, that You should say to me, ‘Carry them in your bosom as a caretaker carries an infant,’ to the land that You have promised on oath to their fathers?” (Numbers 11:12). Now, at the end of the journey, Moses contemplates death, not birth. Like a loving parent, he conscientiously prepares to bid his “children” farewell as they enter the Promised Land without him.

Ha'Azinu

 P<small>ARASHAT</small> H<small>AAZINU PRESENTS</small> us with startling contradictions: Moses sings of God as faithful and nurturing, but also as violent and vengeful. The images of God afflicting “the suckling as well as the aged” and firing arrows “drunk with blood” is disturbing at best. Where does this imagery come from, and how can it be reconciled with images of God as a tender caretaker?
Biblical portrayals of God as a warrior have deep roots in the traditions of the ancient Near East. As soon as warfare entered ancient Near Eastern culture (probably around 3000 <small>B. C.E.</small>), warrior gods rose to prominence throughout the region. Even a deity like Ishtar (sometimes referred to as Inanna), an ancient Mesopotamian goddess of love and fertility, took on a secondary role as a warrior. Likewise, epic poems related how Anat, the Canaanite goddess of love and war, rescues her brother Baal by killing the god Mot. According to the ancients, female and male warrior gods served as patrons to kings, who in turn carried out their warfare in the name of, and with assistance from, their patron deity. And Israel, by worshiping God as its divine ruler as well as the patron deity of its kings, affirmed that God was both willing and able to engage in bloody combat against all enemies.
Moses’ Song in <i>Haazinu</i> demonstrates the violence that, in an ancient context, formed part of the image of God as warrior and king: when Israel rebelled against its divine ruler, honor demanded that the people be punished. God, however, carries out Israel’s punishment by bringing foreign armies against the land—an event that could easily be interpreted as God’s defeat at the hands of a foreign monarch and his deity. Therefore, God acts “for fear of the taunts of the foe” (v. 27) and destroys the foreign army as well.
The biblical model of divine kingship affirms God’s care, guidance, justice, and certainly God’s power. But ancient kings were also expected to demonstrate their military prowess (hence God’s title <i>Adonai Tz’vaot,</i> God of Armies). In <i>Shirat Haazinu,</i> this view of God as a warrior-king is tempered by images of the same God giving birth to and nurturing the people.

V'Zot HaBerachah

 D<small>EUTERONOMY</small> 34:10 claims that no other prophet ever matched Moses, whom God had “singled out, face to face.” Albeit unique, Moses is only one of the many prophets who, as God’s spokespersons, guided Israel. In the Bible, Miriam is the very first person to receive the title “prophet” (Exodus 15:20; Genesis 20:7 refers to Abraham’s prophetic gifts, but he is not called “Abraham the prophet”). Along with several passages that mention unnamed female prophets (Isaiah 8:3; Ezekiel 13:17; Joel 3:1), the Bible names three other women prophets: Deborah, Huldah, and Noadiah.
Nothing is known about Noadiah (5th century <small>B. C.E.</small>) apart from Nehemiah’s claim that she opposed him (Nehemiah 6:14); she must have been important enough to disturb Nehemiah, but it is her predecessors Deborah and Huldah who are praised as prominent and influential. Deborah leads the Israelites to victory and is the only chieftain in that period of Israelite history who is also a prophet (Judges 4:4). The poem attributed to Deborah refers to her as a “mother in Israel” (Judges 5:7), a title that probably designates her position as the people’s protector rather than a biological maternity.
Huldah is perhaps Israel’s most successful prophet. Whereas the messages of other prophets in the Bible often fall on deaf ears during their lifetime, Huldah’s authority goes unquestioned and her words are heeded instantly. According to II Kings 22 and II Chronicles 34, a royal delegation in 622 <small>B. C.E.</small> consults Huldah about the “book of the <i>torah”</i> that was found at the Temple. When she authenticates it as God’s teachings, the king immediately—and unquestioningly—implements the book’s laws. Huldah is identified as a married woman, whose husband is the keeper of the king’s wardrobe, while she herself holds “office” in a public area known as the Mishneh. Although the later Rabbis express unease about the prominence of Huldah, the Bible presents her authority as a matter of fact. According to many modern scholars, the “book of the <i>torah</i>” that Huldah authenticates is Deuteronomy, or at least portions of it. If so, we owe the binding authority that Deuteronomy holds to none other than Huldah, whose own words confirmed and thus made possible the preservation and transmission of these teachings to us.

Postbiblical Interpretations

Bereshit

 <i><b>God now said, “Let us make human beings…”</b></i> (1:26). The rabbinic sages read the two quite different accounts of human beginnings in this parashah as one continuous text. They took for granted that the male and female creations of Genesis 1 were the Adam and Eve of Genesis 2–3. However, the Rabbis were skeptical that men and women were created simultaneously in the divine image as stated in 1:26; they generally insisted that the first woman was formed later, from the first human being, as in Genesis 2:4–25. In Midrash <i>B’reishit Rabbah</i> 8.1, Rabbi Jeremiah ben Leazar suggested the compromise position that initially God created one entity with both male and female sexual characteristics. Only afterward, as described in Genesis 2:22, did God separate the female “side” to form the first woman from an essentially male entity. This midrash makes the powerful point that man and woman were initially created as a united being to which they revert when they become <i>one flesh</i> (Genesis 2:24) in marriage.
<i><b>“In our image, after our likeness”</b></i> (1:26). Parallel comments in <i>B’reishit Rabbah</i> 8. 9 and 22. 2 maintain the precedence of the man in human creation, while stressing the crucial role of marriage and procreation in human life: “In the past, Adam was created from the ground, and Eve from Adam; but henceforth [with the birth of offspring] it shall be <i>in our image, after our likeness.</i> Neither man without woman, nor woman without man, nor both of them without the <i>Shechinah.”</i> This invocation of the <i>Shechinah</i>—the indwelling nurturing aspect of the Divine, designated by a feminine noun—indicates that for the Rabbis, the female also shares in the divine image when she is joined to the male in a fruitful marriage.
<b><i>God then blessed them</i></b> (1:28). Continuing the strong connection between Creation and marriage, <i>B’reishit Rabbah</i> 8.13 records the tradition that God “took up a cup of blessing and blessed them.” Then it adds: “Rabbi Judah ben Rabbi Simon said: [The angels] Michael and Gabriel were Adam’s ‘best men.’ Rabbi Simlai said: We find that the Holy One blesses bridegrooms, adorns brides, visits the sick, buries the dead, and recites the blessing for mourners. God blesses bridegrooms, as it is written: <i>God then blessed them;</i> and adorns brides, as it is written: <i>Now God יהוה built up the rib taken from the man into a woman</i> (Genesis 2:22).”
<b><i>Then God</i> יהוה <i>considered “It is not good that the man be alone—I will make him a helpmate”</i></b> (2:18). <i>B’reishit Rabbah</i> 17.2 teaches: “A man without a wife lives without good, without help, without joy, without blessing, and without atonement.…Some even say he falls short of the divine image, since immediately following <i>For human beings were made in the image of God</i> (Genesis 9:6) it is written, <i>As for you, be fruitful and multiply</i> (9:7).” For the Rabbis, humankind is like God in its ability to create human beings, yet reproduction requires both females and males. According to BT <i>Y’vamot</i> 63a, women also help men in pragmatic ways; there the prophet Elijah meets Rabbi Yosi and asks him rhetorically: “If a man brings in wheat, does he chew on the wheat? If flax, does he put on the flax? [No, he must wait until his wife sees to the processing of the wheat into bread, and of the flax into clothing!] Does she not, then, bring light to his eyes and put him on his feet?”
<b><i>and the man said, “This time</i>— / <i>bone of my bone, flesh of my flesh!”</i></b> (2:23). Prompted by <i>This time,</i> several rabbinic passages mention a previous time—a “first Eve,” who fled from Adam and was replaced with a second female creation (<i>B’reishit Rabbah</i> 17.7, 18.4, 22. 7). This legend was later combined with ancient folk traditions about the night spirit Lilith. In the <i>Alphabet of Ben Sira</i> (possibly 8th century <small>C. E.</small>), Lilith’s rebelliousness is attributed to her equal creation with Adam. Refusing to be subservient in sexual intercourse or in any other way, she became a demon rather than endure Adam’s domination. Jewish folklore attributed nocturnal emissions to Lilith, who was said to set upon sleeping men. She was also blamed for maternal deaths in childbirth and for infant mortality. One popular remedy was amulets bearing the names of angels. Lilith is further demonized in Jewish mystical traditions where she and her satanic husband Samael become the evil counterparts of Adam and Eve. (On Lilith, see further Judith R. Baskin, <i>Midrashic Women,</i> 2002, pp. 58–60.)
<b><i>And to the woman, [God] said</i></b> (3:16). Some Rabbis blame Eve for the expulsion from the Garden of Eden and its consequences. While Adam was punished for his participation in divine disobedience, none of the pronouncements against him in Genesis 3:17–19 apply only to males. But Eve, and through her all women, received additional gender-specific punishments—and rabbinic literature discusses them frequently. The inventory found in <i>Avot D’Rabbi Nathan</i> B 42 includes: menstruation, “when she is driven from her house and banned from her husband”; childbirth; nursing her children; and being subject to her husband’s authority and his jealousy. Moreover, she ages quickly and ceases to give birth, while “men never cease being able to beget children.” Also, a woman stays indoors; and when she goes out, her head must be covered like a mourner: “That is why women precede the funeral bier, saying, ‘We have brought death upon all the inhabitants of the world.’” Such harsh views permeate rabbinic commentary on Eve’s creation and her role in the Garden of Eden, and they had a long and pernicious afterlife in shaping Jewish and Christian views of women.

Noach

 <i><b>“your wife”</b></i> (6:18). Noah’s wife is mentioned five times in the Flood story (Genesis 6:18; 7:7, 13; 8:16, 18) but she is never named. While she is not the only woman (or man) to go unnamed in Hebrew Scriptures, the Rabbis were curious about her identity. Midrash <i>B’reishit Rabbah</i> 23.3 preserves a dispute about her name, in which one rabbi argues that Noah’s wife was Naamah, the “sister of Tubal-Cain,” a descendant of Adam and Eve’s son Cain, who is listed in the genealogies in Genesis 4:22. He justifies his view with the explanation that the name derives from the word “pleasant” and that Noah’s wife’s actions were pleasing (<i>n’imim</i>) to God. However, the majority opinion in <i>B’reishit Rabbah</i> 23.3 rejects the identification of Noah’s wife with the Naamah of 4:22 since “her name indicates that she sang (<i>man'emet)</i> to the timbrel in honor of idolatry.”
<i><b>Noah, with his sons, his wife, and his sons’ wives came into the ark</b></i> (7:7). Noah’s family and the animals were chosen for preservation on the ark in male-female pairs, in order to ensure the continuation of their species after the Flood. However, a midrash in the Talmud (BT <i>Sanhedrin</i> 108b) teaches that this process of “continuation” did not begin on the ark. Careful attention to the word order shows that the genders were separated at the boarding of the ark. The midrash contrasts this with the wording of Genesis 8:16 where the instructions for disembarking are given to marriage groupings. That is, Noah was instructed that he should leave first with his wife, and then his sons with their wives. Thus, the authors of this midrash demonstrate that the sexes were segregated on board, at least enough that they did not have sexual contact on the ark. However, when they disembarked, each male, together with the appropriate female, they were to resume normal sexual relations.
<i><b>Abram’s wife was named Sarai…Haran father of Milcah and of Yiscah</b></i> (11:29). The text introduces us to Abraham, who at this point is still referred to by his pre-covenantal name, Abram. Similarly, his wife Sarah is also referred to here by her pre-covenantal name, Sarai. However, the Rabbis noticed that the first time Sarai is mentioned, her family is not identified. Yet in the same verse, Milcah—the wife of Abram’s brother Nahor—is identified as the daughter of Haran; in addition and for no obvious reason, <i>her</i> sister Yiscah is then mentioned. The following verse (Genesis 11:30) resumes Sarai’s story once again. It is probably the juxtaposition of all of these characters, as well as the rabbinic desire to link Sarai to the larger family, that explains a midrashic tradition that Sarai and Yiscah were in fact the same person. (The idea of marrying a niece would not have seemed unusual in the biblical or rabbinic eras. It is not one of the incestuous relationships forbidden in Leviticus 18.) The Talmud explains this conflation of Sarah with Yiscah (BT <i>M’gillah</i> 14a) linguistically. The Hebrew letters that spell the name Yiscah are similar to the Hebrew verb “to look” (<i>s-c-h).</i> Thus, based on midrashic traditions of Sarah’s great beauty, the Rabbis explain that Sarai was called Yiscah because everyone wanted to <i>look</i> at her. A second explanation offered is that Sarai was called Yiscah because she was a prophet and could <i>look</i> into the future.
<i><b>And Sarah was barren; she had no offspring</b></i> (11:30). The Talmud (BT <i>Y’vamot</i> 64b) understands this double description of Sarah’s infertility to have two meanings. The first phrase, <i>was barren,</i> means Sarah did not have children; and the second phrase, <i>she had no offspring,</i> indicates she was missing the vital internal organs necessary for conception and pregnancy. Thus, the later birth of Isaac was doubly miraculous.

<b><i>“I will make your name great”</i></b> (12:2). Some midrashim describe the matriarchs as equal partners in God’s covenant with Israel. Midrash <i>B’reishit Rabbah</i> 39.11 reports that “Abraham’s coinage was widely distributed.…And what was on his coinage? An old man and an old woman (Abraham and Sarah) on οne side, and a young man and a young woman (Isaac and Rebekah) on the other.” This midrash also explained the repeated use of the words for “greatness” and “blessing”: “greatness” refers to the patriarchs and “blessing” to the matriarchs.
<i><b>and the people</b> [nefesh] <b>they had acquired</b> [asu,</i> literally “made”] <b><i>in Haran</i></b> (12:5). According to <i>B’reishit Rabbah</i> 39.14, Sarah was an active agent of God’s work in the world even when she and Abraham were still in Haran. Commenting on the literal sense, Rabbi Eleazar said in the name of Rabbi Yosi ben Zimra: “If all the inhabitants of the world got together to create [a living being], they would be unable to animate even a mosquito, but the Torah says <i>the people they had made</i>! These are the proselytes they converted.” [The Midrash then asks:] If the verse refers to conversion, why does it employ the verb “made”? To teach you that when a person converts another, it is as if the one created the other. [The Midrash then points out a problem:] It should say, <i>he had made</i>—why does it say, <i>they had made</i>? Rav Huna said: “Abraham converted men and Sarah converted women.”
<b>יהוה</b> <i><b>then struck Pharaoh and his household with severe afflictions because of Sarai, Abram’s wife</b></i> (12:17). <i>B’reishit Rabbah</i> 41.2 imagines that when Sarai was trapped in Pharaoh’s house, she prostrated herself “and said, ‘Ruler of the Universe, Abram left [Haran] on the strength of promises, and I left on the strength of my faith. Now, Abram is outside this prison and I am inside!’ The blessed Holy One said, ‘All that I do, I do for you.’” This midrash suggests that Sarai’s belief that she would share in Abram’s blessings was called into question when she was trapped in Pharaoh’s house while Abram walked free; however, she is reassured that it is precisely <i>because of Sarai, Abram’s wife,</i> that Pharaoh is punished. Even more remarkably, Sarai reminds God that her willingness to leave Haran for an unknown destination is more praiseworthy than Abram’s precisely because God has promised her nothing. Sarai serves here as a paradigm of a faithful follower of God, one who responds to God’s call without the promise of reward.
<i><b>Now Abram’s wife Sarai, who had not borne him a child had an Egyptian slave named Hagar</b></i> (16:1). The Rabbis gave Hagar an exalted lineage, identifying her as the daughter of Pharaoh. This tradition underscores Sarai’s piety since it claims that when Pharaoh sees the wonders performed on her behalf, he exclaims, “Better my daughter be a servant in this household than mistress in another”; and later on, Sarai gives Hagar to Abram as a second wife, not as a concubine (<i>B’reishit Rabbah</i> 45.1). She also encourages Hagar to have sexual relations with Abram by emphasizing her husband’s holiness (<i>B’reishit Rabbah</i> 45.3). According to <i>B’reishit Rabbah</i> 45.2, Sarai’s decision that Abram should take Hagar as a wife is seen as an instance of her prophetic powers.
Still, the Rabbis are troubled by both Hagar’s and Sarah’s behavior. <i>B’reishit Rabbah</i> 45.4 relates that once Hagar became pregnant, she told other women that Sarah was clearly not the righteous woman she pretended to be, as evidenced by her infertility. Sarah, in turn, is criticized for harassing Hagar and for forcing Abraham to mediate between his wife and the mother of his unborn child (<i>B’reishit Rabbah</i> 45.5–6). While Hagar is criticized for treating her mistress disrespectfully, she is also worthy of divine protection. Five of God’s messengers appear to Hagar as she flees Sarah’s anger (<i>B’reishit Rabbah</i> 45.7). In naming God as the <i>One who looks upon me</i> (16:13), Hagar recognizes God as the One who sees the pain of the injured.
<b><i>“Sarai your wife—call her Sarai no more, for her name is [now] Sarah”</i></b> (17:15). <i>B’reishit Rabbah</i> 47.1 argues that Abraham and Sarah’s relationship was unique. Rabbi Aha claims, “Abraham was crowned by Sarah rather than the reverse.…In most marriages, the husband commands, but in this case, God tells Abraham to obey all of Sarah’s directives.” At the age of ninety, Sarah is blessed with fertility—and, according to one tradition, God restored her youthful appearance (<i>B’reishit Rabbah</i> 47.2).

Vayera

<b><i>“Why is Sarah laughing so…?”</i></b> (18:13). In Genesis 18:12, Sarah’s laughter at the prediction that she would soon bear a child was prompted as much by her husband’s advanced age as her own. According to Midrash <i>B’reishit Rabbah</i> 48.18 and BT <i>Bava M’tzia</i> 87a, however, God’s query omitted Sarah’s reference to Abraham’s age so as to preserve good will between husband and wife, demonstrating that truth may be compromised for the sake of peace. The Rabbis also noted that Sarah was the only woman to whom God spoke directly, on account of her righteousness. When God spoke to Hagar or Rebekah, it was through an angel or an intermediary (<i>B’reishit Rabbah</i> 48.20).
<i><b>his wife looked behind him and became a pillar of salt</b></i> (19:26). According to one midrashic tradition, Lot’s wife turned around to ensure that her daughters were still following—and inadvertently beheld the <i>Shechinah,</i> who had descended to rain fire and brimstone on Sodom <i>(Pirkei D’Rabbi Eliezer</i> 25).
<i><b>God restored Abimelech, his wife, and his female slaves, and they bore children</b></i> (20:17). The Rabbis appreciated Sarah’s discomfort after Abimelech’s wife and even his slave girls gave birth. The angels cried out to God on Sarah’s behalf, claiming that it was only just that she too bear a child (<i>P’sikta Rabbati 42).</i> In other texts, the conception of Isaac is attributed to Sarah’s enduring trust in God during this painful episode <i>(B’reishit Rabbah</i> 53.3).
<b>יהוה</b> <i><b>now remembered Sarah</b></i> (21:1). According to <i>B’reishit Rabbah</i> 53.8 and <i>P’sikta Rabbati</i> 42, God rejoiced in Isaac’s birth by showering gifts on the whole of Creation: infertile women gave birth; the blind were granted sight; the deaf could now hear; and the insane became sane. God was so exultant that the sun shone forth with a full radiant splendor not seen since Creation.
<i><b>Sarah shall nurse children</b></i> (21:7). [The plural noun is surprising, given that Sarah has only one son. Rabbi Levi read this rhetorical flourish as a sign that Sarah had surplus milk and nursed others’ children as well (BT <i>Bava M’tzia</i> 87a). —<i>Ed</i>.]
<i><b>Now Sarah saw the son…playing</b></i> (21:9). Citing a series of verses linked by multiple usages of <i>m’tzachek</i> (“playing”), the Rabbis defend Sarah’s culpability in the expulsions of Hagar and Ishmael by suggesting that Ishmael was actually “making sport” by seducing women, engaging in idolatrous practices, and even threatening Isaac by shooting arrows in his direction. These activities border on the three most serious public offenses in Jewish law: idolatry, rape, and murder. The Rabbis explained that God told Abraham to listen to Sarah’s demand to expel Hagar and Ishmael because her perceptions were inspired by prophecy (BT <i>M’gillah</i> 14a; BT <i>Sanhedrin</i> 69b; <i>Seder Olam Rabbah 2).</i>
<i><b>God heard the boy’s cry</b></i> (21:17). The midrash notes that God answered Ishmael although it was Hagar who cried out. This is because “sick persons’ prayers on their own behalf are more efficacious than those of anyone else” (<i>B’reishit Rabbah</i> 53.14).
<i><b>God then opened her eyes, and she saw a well</b></i> (21:19). This was said to be Miriam’s Well, created on the eve of the first Shabbat of Creation (<i>Pirkei D’Rabbi Eliezer</i> 30). Rabbi Benjamin suggested that the phraseology of the text teaches that “All are blind until God brings light to their eyes” (<i>B’reishit Rabbah</i> 53.19).
<i><b>After these things</b></i> (22:1). <i>Sefer HaYashar, parashat Vayeira,</i> suggests that when God commanded Abraham to offer up his son, Abraham masked his intentions and informed Sarah that he was taking Isaac to study with the sages. Sarah agreed but begged Abraham to protect Isaac on the journey and not to keep him away for long, “for his soul is bound up with mine.”
<i><b>after all these things</b></i> (22:20). Strikingly, Sarah is never mentioned in Genesis 22, but Genesis 23 will begin with her death. This juxtaposition led to the tradition that when Sarah learned that Abraham planned to offer Isaac as a sacrifice to God, she died of grief, thinking her son dead (<i>B’reishit Rabbah</i> 58.5). Other versions suggest that when Satan (or the demon Samael) told Sarah that Isaac had been sacrificed, she began to weep and cried aloud three times, corresponding to the shofar’s three sustained notes (<i>t’kiah</i>) on Rosh HaShanah, followed by three laments corresponding to the three disconnected short notes (<i>t’ruah).</i> Her soul then fled and she died (<i>Pirkei D’Rabbi Eliezer</i> 32). According to others, Sarah died of shock when she learned that Isaac had actually survived (<i>Tanchuma</i> on <i>Vayeira</i> 23; <i>Midrash HaGadol).</i>

Chayei Sara

<b><i>Sarah died</i></b> (23:2). A 13th-century Yemenite Midrash collection begins its interpretations of this parashah with an extended commentary on Proverbs 31, the description of a “woman of valor.” The midrash connects the various exemplary qualities of the outstanding wife of Proverbs 31 to twenty-three biblical women, in order of their scriptural appearance. The second woman discussed (after Noah’s wife) is Sarah: “‘The heart of her husband trusts in her’ (Proverbs 31:11)—this is Sarah, in whom Abraham’s heart trusted. ‘And lacks no good thing’ (same verse)—for she used to bring guests [converts] under the wings of the Shechinah” <i>(Midrash HaGadol).</i> | Commenting on “the sun rises, and the sun sets” (Ecclesiastes 1:5), another midrash notes the Torah’s juxtaposition of the mention of Rebekah’s lineage at the end of Genesis 22 and the death of Sarah at the beginning of Genesis 23; that midrash praises the divine omniscience that plans for all things: “Before allowing Sarah’s sun to set, the Holy One caused Rebekah’s sun to rise” (Midrash <i>B’reishit Rabbah</i> 58.2).
<i><b>Abraham was old, well advanced in years</b></i> (24:1). Abraham was profoundly affected by Sarah’s death, according to the Rabbis. While she was alive, he felt himself young and vigorous, but after she had passed away, old age suddenly overtook him (<i>Tanchuma</i> 4). | According to the Talmud, “Until Abraham there was no physical aging; people would confuse Abraham with his son Isaac because they looked so similar. Thereupon Abraham prayed and the physical manifestations of old age came into existence” (BT <i>Bava M’tzia</i> 87a).
<i><b>So they called Rebekah and asked her.…And she said, “I will go”</b></i> (24:58). One midrash connects this episode with “She is good to him, never bad” (Proverbs 31:12) and comments, “It was customary in the world that when a man would wed his daughter to someone…she would be too embarrassed to say anything [either in affirmation or rejection]” (<i>Midrash HaGadol).</i> Rebekah, however, made clear that she was willing to go with a stranger to become Isaac’s wife. | Another midrash derives from this narrative the legal ruling that “a fatherless maiden may not be given in marriage without her consent” (<i>B’reishit Rabbah</i> 60.12).
<i><b>Sister, may you become thousands of myriads</b></i> (24:60). Rabbinic tradition harbors great suspicion toward Rebekah’s brother, Laban, as an enemy of the people of Israel. Therefore, some rabbis strongly denied that his blessing could have had any positive effect: “Why was Rebekah not remembered [with children] until Isaac prayed for her (Genesis 25:21)? So that the heathen should not say, ‘Our prayer bore fruit’” (<i>B’reishit Rabbah</i> 60.13).
<i><b>Isaac brought her into the tent of his mother Sarah</b></i> (24:67). One midrash claims that this verse proves that “Rebekah’s deeds were [praiseworthy] like Sarah’s” (<i>Midrash HaGadol).</i> A cloud signifying the divine Presence had hovered over Sarah’s tent throughout her lifetime. It disappeared when she died—“but when Rebekah came, it returned” (<i>B’reishit Rabbah</i> 60.16). Similarly, Rebekah continued all the positive activities that Sarah had initiated, “separating her <i>challah</i> in ritual purity” (see Numbers 15:18–21) and keeping the Sabbath lamp kindled.
<i><b>Abraham went on and took a wife named Keturah</b></i> (25:1). This marriage is mentioned following Isaac’s marriage to Rebekah. One midrash learns from this that “if a man has grown-up sons, he must first see that they marry, and only then take a wife himself” <i>(B’reishit Rabbah</i> 60.16). | The Rabbis wondered who Keturah was, since no information is given about her origins or lineage. Some of the sages insisted she was actually Hagar, who, they argued, had returned to Abraham after Sarah’s death (<i>Pirkei D’Rabbi Eliezer</i> 30, among others). And lest anyone be concerned about Hagar’s chastity during her absence from Abraham’s household, another midrash explains, based on the linguistic similarities between the Hebrew root <i>k-t-r</i> (to “tie up” or “seal”) and the name Keturah, “that she was like one who seals up a treasure and produces it with its seal” <i>(B’reishit Rabbah</i> 61.4). An alternate and late midrashic tradition understands Keturah to be a separate individual from Hagar. This midrash relates that Abraham married three wives and that each was a descendant of one of the sons of Noah: Sarah was of the line of Shem, Keturah descended from Japheth, and Hagar was from the family of Ham <i>(Yalkut Reuveni,</i> Genesis 26.2, 36c).

Toldot

<i><b>This is the line of Isaac</b></i> (25:19). In <i>parashat Tol’dot</i> the reader is re-introduced to Rebekah, the second of the matriarchs, whom the Rabbis extolled for resisting the temptations of idolatry and unrighteous behavior that characterized her childhood home. Moreover, when God’s intention to maintain the covenant through Jacob was made known to her, she single-mindedly fulfilled the divine will, even when it meant deceiving her husband and disinheriting her older son. The Rabbis’ high regard for her reminds us that this portion is as much about Rebekah as it is about her husband. According to the Rabbis, her virtuous behavior merited that the twelve tribes would spring directly from her through her son Jacob (Midrash <i>B’reishit Rabbah</i> 63.6).
<i><b>daughter of…the Aramean</b></i> (25:20). This verse describes Rebekah as the daughter of Bethuel “the Aramean,” of Paddan Aram, and as the sister of Laban “the Aramean.” Given the name of the city, both mentions of “the Aramean” (<i>ha-arami</i>) appear superfluous. By means of word play, <i>B’reishit Rabbah</i> 63.4 explains that the first “Aramean” comes to teach us that her father was a <i>ram’ai</i>—a deceiver. Her brother was also a deceiver, as were all her neighbors. Rebekah was surrounded by deception, living among bad influences on her behavior. But she set herself apart and stood out like “a lily among the thorns” (Song of Songs 2:2).
<i><b>Isaac pleaded with</b></i> <b>יהוה</b> <i><b>on behalf of his wife, for she was childless</b></i> (25:21). According to rabbinic tradition, there were seven infertile biblical women for whom prayer was efficacious. <i>P’sikta D’Rav Kahana</i> 20.1 lists the first six as Sarah, Rebekah, Leah, Rachel, the wife of Manoah (Samson’s mother in Judges 13), and Hannah. The seventh is personified Israel, based on the characterization of Zion as a childless woman whose hopes for offspring will be fulfilled by God at the time of redemption (Isaiah 54).
<i><b>The children pressed against each other inside her</b></i> (25:22). <i>B’reishit Rabbah</i> 63.6 relates that whenever Rebekah stood near synagogues or schools, Jacob struggled to come out; and when she passed idolatrous temples, Esau eagerly endeavored to emerge.
<b>יהוה</b> <i><b>said to her: “Two peoples are in your belly”</b></i> (25:22). The Rabbis dignified both Sarah and Rebekah with the title of prophet. They further observed that Rebekah experienced divine revelation twice, once when God informed her that she was pregnant with twins, and again when Rebekah learned about Esau’s decision to kill Jacob (27:42). In the first instance, she learns of the two nations struggling in her womb when she visits the study house of Shem and Eber (see Genesis 11:10–26; <i>B’reishit Rabbah</i> 63.6). Here, the Rabbis reaffirmed the need for intercession between the Divine and humans, a notion found also in <i>B’reishit Rabbah</i> 82.3 with reference to Jacob. Thus gender does not seem to be the issue as much as the notion of how one makes contact with God. Similarly, in the second case, the Rabbis stated that the matriarchs were prophets—and Rebekah was a matriarch. Thus, despite her less than reputable pedigree, Rebekah joins her husband in meriting prophetic status; in fact, it is Rebekah rather than Isaac who executes the divine will in ensuring that Jacob receive the status of first-born son (<i>B’reishit Rabbah</i> 63.7; 67.9).
<i><b>but Rebekah favored Jacob</b></i> (25:28). According to <i>B’reishit Rabbah</i> 63.10, “The more she heard his voice [engaged in study, reciting his lessons aloud], the stronger grew her love for him.”
<i><b>They were a bitterness of spirit to Isaac and Rebekah</b></i> (26:34–35). The Rabbis invoked Rebekah’s idolatrous pedigree when they considered this reference to Isaac’s and Rebekah’s unhappiness over Esau’s choice of wives. They concluded that Isaac is mentioned first in this verse because he was far more disturbed over Esau’s marriages to idolators than Rebekah. This is because, “as the daughter of idolatrous priests, Rebekah was more accustomed to the pollution of idolatry and did not object—but Isaac, the son of holy parents, did object” (<i>B’reishit Rabbah</i> 65.4). The Rabbis were also struck by the focus on Isaac in a passage concerned with domestic matters. Ordinarily one would have expected Rebekah to be more aware of what went on in her household than her husband. The Rabbis extrapolated this assumption to women in general, positing “another reason why Isaac is mentioned first: It is a woman’s habit to stay at home [and do productive work], and a man’s to go out in public and learn understanding from people; but as Isaac’s eyes were dim he stayed at home; therefore [the matter was disturbing] to Isaac first” (<i>B’reishit Rabbah</i> 65.4).

<b><i>Now Laban had two daughters</i></b> (29:16). Midrash <i>B’reishit Rabbah</i> 70.15 portrays the sisters Rachel and Leah as equal partners in building the Jewish people: “Both produced chieftains and kings.…Both produced prophets and judges.” Leah was “greater in gifts,” in that her sons were the ancestors of the priests and the Davidic kings.
<b><i>Leah’s eyes were weak</i></b> (29:16). In <i>B’reishit Rabbah</i> 70.16, Rabbi Yohanan explains that Leah’s eyes had grown weak from weeping. It had been expected that Rebekah’s two sons would marry Laban’s two daughters—and Esau was intended for Leah. Hearing negative reports about Esau’s conduct, Leah had wept, praying that her destiny would change. Rabbi Huna observes that Leah’s prayer had been powerful enough to alter her fate, but in the process her eyes were permanently affected.
<b><i>In the morning</i></b> (29:25). The commentators are amazed that Leah fooled Jacob. After living in Laban’s house for seven years, surely Jacob could tell Rachel and Leah apart! Furthermore, how did Laban prevent Rachel from warning Jacob of the deception? Midrash <i>Eichah Rabbah,</i> proem 24, explains that Rachel was a willing—albeit unhappy—partner to Laban’s plan. In this midrash, Rachel recounts her version of the events of Genesis 29. Aware that her father was plotting to deceive Jacob, she warned her future husband of Laban’s plans. Jacob and Rachel agreed upon a sign to allow Jacob to distinguish between the sisters. But then, Rachel changed her mind, realizing that if Laban’s plan failed, Leah would be shamed. Instead of thwarting her father’s plot, Rachel aided her sister in the deception: “That evening, my sister took my place with Jacob and I taught her the signs I had given him so that he would think she was Rachel. I also hid under the bed upon which they lay, and when Jacob spoke to my sister, I responded while she was silent so that he would not recognize her voice. In this way, I showed kindness to my sister; I did not act on my jealousy and saved her from disgrace.”
<b><i>Laban then gave his maid Bilhah</i></b> (29:29). According to the 11th-century commentator Rashi, the slaves Bilhah and Zilpah were Laban’s daughters by his concubine, thus suitable mothers of four of the tribes of Israel (on 31:50). The childless Rachel’s use of Bilhah parallels Sarah’s earlier use of Hagar in 16:1–3 (<i>B’reishit Rabbah</i> 71.7). Leah’s motives in giving Zilpah to Jacob are less clear; some commentators suggest that Leah acted to ensure that Jacob would father twelve sons. The Midrash <i>Tanna D’Vei Eliyahu Rabbah</i> 25 (Ish-Shalom edn., p. 138) counts Rachel’s and Leah’s willingness to offer their maidservants to Jacob as among the righteous acts of the matriarchs that led to Israel’s redemption from Egypt. Some traditions include Bilhah and Zilpah among the matriarchs (<i>B’midbar Rabbah</i> 12; <i>Shir HaShirim Rabbah</i> 6; <i>P’sikta D’Rav Kahana</i> 1.10).
<b><i>“Let me have children”</i></b> (30:1). Rachel’s demand is understood by rabbinic tradition as a complaint against Jacob. She expects him to pray on her behalf, as his father Isaac did for Rebekah. Jacob was criticized by some rabbis for his harsh reply (<i>B’reishit Rabbah</i> 71.7). Isaac Arama, a 15th-century commentator in Spain, attributed Jacob’s frustration to Rachel’s insistence that a childless woman is worthless. He argues that women have two functions: like men, they can develop their intellectual and spiritual qualities, and they can also bear and raise children. Jacob wants Rachel to recognize that she can have a meaningful life even if she has no children <i>(Akedat Yitzchak</i> on Genesis 3:20).
<b><i>Afterwards she bore a daughter</i></b> (30:21). The power of Leah’s prayers is again emphasized in BT <i>B’rachot</i> 60a. Commenting on “afterwards,” Rav suggests that after she discovered she was pregnant, “Leah reasoned, ‘Jacob is destined to father twelve tribes. I have given birth to six sons, and the handmaidens have borne four. If this child is a son, my sister Rachel won’t be equal even to the handmaidens.’ Immediately, the child [in her womb] was transformed to a female.” In other versions of this miraculous demonstration of the efficacy of prayer, the handmaidens, Bilhah and Zilpah, join Leah in prayers on Rachel’s behalf (<i>B’reishit Rabbah</i> 72.6).
<b><i>Reuben went and found mandrakes</i></b> (30:14). In <i>B’reishit Rabbah</i> 72.5, the sages explain that through these mandrakes two additional tribes came into being, Issachar and Zebulun. Leah’s willingness to barter with her sister allowed her to attain precedence as the mother of six tribes and to merit burial at Jacob’s side (<i>B’reishit Rabbah</i> 72.3).

<i><b>his eleven children</b></i> (32:23). Benjamin was not yet born, but didn’t Jacob already have twelve children? Midrash <i>B’reishit Rabbah</i> 76.9 and 80.4 suggest that Jacob hid Dinah in a box so that Esau would not see her and seek to marry her. On that basis, Jacob is castigated for lack of compassion toward his brother; as Rashi explains, perhaps by such a marriage, Esau would have returned to a path of good (on 32:23).
<i><b>Dinah, Leah’s daughter…went out</b></i> (34:1). <i>B’reishit Rabbah</i> 80.1 (also 8.12, 18.2, 45.5) and JT <i>Sanhedrin</i> 2:6 (20d) are among numerous sources that judge both Dinah and Leah harshly based on this verse. Both are seen to act inappropriately for women simply by going out unattended—Dinah here, and Leah when she likewise “went out” to inform Jacob, “I am the one you will bed [tonight]” (30:16).
<i><b>to see the women of the locality</b></i> (34:1). <i>Pirkei D’Rabbi Eliezer</i> 38 claims that they were a ruse, sent by Shechem to play timbrels outside Dinah’s tent, in order to lure her outside—where he could lay hold of her.
<i><b>then, taking Dinah</b></i> (34:26). Dinah is mentioned only once more in Torah, among Jacob’s descendants in 46:15. What became of her? In <i>B’reishit Rabbah</i> 80.11, Rabbi Huna puts into Dinah’s mouth the words of Tamar—King David’s daughter who was raped by her half-brother Amnon: “Where will I carry my shame…?” (II Samuel 13:13); he suggests that Dinah agreed to leave Shechem’s house only after her brother Simeon promised to marry her himself. Thus—based on her involvement with Shechem—Dinah is identified as the otherwise unnamed “Canaanite woman” who was the mother of Simeon’s son Saul (46:10). It was also taught that when she died, Simeon buried her in Canaan.
Another tradition found in <i>B’reishit Rabbah</i> 19.12 (also 57.4, 76.9, 80.4) and BT <i>Bava Batra</i> 15b, among other sources, is that Dinah became the wife of Job. Some versions of this tradition view Dinah’s subsequent marriage to a non-Israelite (namely, Job) as part of Jacob’s punishment for having withheld her from Esau (see the first entry, above). Alternatively, <i>Pirkei D’Rabbi Eliezer</i> 38 states that Dinah became pregnant when raped by Shechem, and she bore a daughter. Afraid of the shame that the presence of this child would bring on their community, Dinah’s brothers sought to kill the infant. Jacob, however, put an amulet with the name of God around the girl’s neck and sent her away; she was taken by the archangel Michael to Egypt, where she was adopted by a childless Egyptian priest and raised as his daughter. Dinah’s daughter, “Asenath daughter of Potiphera, priest of On” (Genesis 41:45), later became Joseph’s wife. A further embellishment on this legend tells the story as follows: Joseph was exceedingly handsome, and when he went out, women would throw jewelry to attract his notice. Asenath tossed her amulet and when Joseph saw it, he realized their relationship and married her (<i>Chizz’kuni</i> to 41:45).
<i><b>Deborah, Rebekah’s nurse, died…and was buried…under the…Oak of Weeping</b></i> (35:8). The word <i>bachut,</i> “weeping,” is similar to the plural term <i>b’chiyot,</i> “weepings,” suggesting to the Rabbis that <i>two</i> deaths were being mourned here: the death of Deborah, and the death of Rebekah—an event not otherwise mentioned in the Torah. According to <i>B’reishit Rabbah</i> 81.5, this is why the next verse (35:9) relates that <i>God appeared to Jacob…and blessed him</i>: God performed the kindness of visiting and comforting Jacob while he mourned his mother. But why is Rebekah’s death not related directly? Midrash <i>Tanchuma, Ki Teitzei</i> 4, explains that it was impossible to have an honorable funeral for her. Abraham was dead; Isaac, blind and weakened, could not leave his tent; and Jacob had gone abroad and could not return in time. Only Esau remained, and the continued ill feeling between him and his mother made it unlikely that he would come. Because Rebekah’s life ended in such a lonely way, the Torah hints at her passing only obliquely (see also the medieval commentator Ramban on 35:8).
<i><b>as her life was leaving her…she named him Benoni, but his father called him Benjamin</b></i> (35:18). Commentators generally agree that by the word <i>oni,</i> Rachel meant “my pain” or “my sorrow.” Rabbi Moses ben Nachman (1194–1270)—usually known as “Nachmanides” or by his initials as “Ramban”— notes here that another meaning of <i>on</i> is “strength,” as in 49:3, in which Jacob blesses Reuben as “first fruit of my vigor (<i>reishit oni).”</i> So too <i>y’min,</i> the right hand, stands for strength in the biblical world. Thus, Jacob does not actually change the name given by Rachel—for all Jacob’s children bear names given to them by their mothers—but rather “translates” it to its most positive interpretation.

 <b><i>Around that time</i></b> (38:1). Pondering why the story of Joseph is interrupted by events in the life of his brother Judah, the Rabbis draw our attention to the pivotal roles women play in the lives of both men. Midrash <i>B’reishit Rabbah</i> 85.2 explains that Judah’s and Joseph’s adventures are juxtaposed “to bring the stories of Tamar and Potiphar’s wife into close proximity, in order to teach that as the former was actuated by a pure motive, so was the latter. For Rabbi Joshua ben Levi said: Potiphar’s wife saw by her astrological arts that she was to produce a child by Joseph, but she did not know whether it was to be from her—or from her daughter.” In fact, as related in <i>B’reishit Rabbah</i> 86.3, the Rabbis believed that the woman whom Joseph eventually married was none other than the daughter of Potiphar and his wife, since they identified Potiphar with “Potiphera priest of On,” Joseph’s future father-in-law (41:45).
<i><b>covered herself up with a veil</b></i> (38:14). For the Rabbis, Tamar’s heroic actions displayed the where-withal, foresight, and fortitude of a matriarch such as Rebekah. They allude to this association in <i>B’reishit Rabbah</i> 60.15 and 85.7: “Two covered themselves with a veil, and each gave birth to twins—Rebekah and Tamar.” Tamar’s behavior is considered a praiseworthy response to a situation of injustice.
<i><b>he turned toward her</b></i> (38:16). The Rabbis saw Tamar’s deception as foreordained since they believed that the messiah will ultimately arise from her long-ago union with Judah. <i>B’reishit Rabbah</i> 85.8 recounts that an angel intervened on Tamar’s behalf in order to make sure that Judah did not pass her by: “Rabbi Yohanan said: He wished to go on, but the blessed Holy One made the angel who is in charge of desire appear before him and say to him: ‘Where are you going, Judah? From where are kings and redeemers to arise?’ Thus: <i>he turned toward her.”</i>
<i><b>a kid from the flock</b></i> (38:17). <i>B’reishit Rabbah</i> 85.9 makes clear that Judah received his comeuppance: “The blessed Holy One said to Judah, ‘You deceived your father with a kid of goats [when you hid the truth about Joseph’s disappearance, 37:31–32], thus Tamar will deceive you with a kid of goats.”
<i><b>“Your signet seal, your cord, and the staff in your hand”</b></i> (38:18). In <i>B’reishit Rabbah</i> 85.9, the Rabbis further express their support for Tamar’s actions by interpreting the pledges that Judah gives her as emblems of (future) royalty.
<i><b>she became pregnant by him</b></i> (38:18). Even Tamar herself was mindful of the important role her descendants would later play. During her pregnancy, “she would pat her belly and exclaim, ‘I am big with kings and redeemers’” (<i>B’reishit Rabbah</i> 85.10).
A 1st-century-<small>C. E.</small> Jewish work known as <i>Biblical Antiquities</i> (by an unknown author usually referred to as Pseudo-Philo) presents Tamar as a role model for the Israelites in Egypt. In that account, Amram, Moses’ father, speaks of her as “our mother Tamar.” The emphasis falls on her determination to perpetuate the line of Judah despite risk—which Amram uses to encourage the people to continue to perpetuate life despite their slavery (<i>Biblical Antiquities</i> 9.5–6).
<i><b>Judah…said, “She is more in the right than I”</b></i> (38:26). According to <i>B’reishit Rabbah</i> 97, Judah was rewarded for his confession that he had wronged Tamar, since God delivers those who admit their misdeeds—and promises them a life in the world to come.
<i><b>after all this, his master’s wife</b></i> (39:7). Tamar and Potiphar’s wife are both presented in midrashic texts as powerful, beautiful, clever, and seductive women. However, while Tamar is universally praised because she ensured the future destiny of the tribe of Judah—from which the Davidic dynasty would eventually spring—Potiphar’s wife emerges as a more ambiguous figure. She is most often depicted as both seducer and seduced. She is portrayed as an immoral woman who meant to taunt and tease Joseph but was overwhelmed by his great beauty. According to <i>B’reishit Rabbah</i> 87.10, when Joseph was in prison, she would say to him: “See how I have made you suffer. By your life, I will persecute you in other ways too.” The midrash continues: “She went so far as to place an iron fork under his neck so that he should have to lift up his eyes and look at her. Yet in spite of that he would not look at her.” Rabbi Huna explains that Jacob’s outcry—“a wild animal has devoured him” (37:33)—was actually a moment of clairvoyance in which the distraught father perceived Mrs. Potiphar’s wicked ways and her obsession with Joseph (<i>B’reishit Rabbah</i> 84.19). Indeed, the more depraved and seductive she acted, the more commendable was Joseph’s resistance and display of honor.

Miketz

<i><b>Pharaoh woke up</b></i> (41:7). Many ancient Jews used to reflect on a passage from the Torah by juxtaposing it with a passage from the Prophets—called a haftarah—that contains similar themes, turns of phrase, or both. A widely attested haftarah with <i>parashat Mikeitz</i> is I Kings 3:15–4:1, which is the norm even today. Royal dreams form one connection between the two biblical passages. The haftarah echoes the parashah verbally by opening with the words “Solomon woke up,” and then it relates that Israel’s new king had been dreaming.
<i><b>no one could interpret them</b></i> (41:8). In <i>B’reishit Rabbah</i> 89.6, the Rabbis explain that Pharaoh’s magicians interpreted his dreams incorrectly. According to the sorcerers, the healthy cows foretold that Pharaoh would sire seven daughters; the starving cows signified that he would bury seven daughters.
<i><b>“as he interpreted for us, so it came to be”</b></i> (41:13). Rabbi Eliezer states that “all dreams follow the mouth”; that is, a dream comes true according to how it is interpreted (BT <i>B’rachot</i> 55b). As an example, <i>B’reishit Rabbah</i> 89.8 recounts that a woman came to him and told him of a recurring dream in which her house split open. The first two times she came to the sage, he told her she would give birth to a boy. The third time the rabbi was away; his students told the woman that her husband would die and this immediately came to pass. When the rabbi heard her laments, he accused his students of killing the husband, and cited this verse as his proof. As the anecdote indicates, power rests not in the dream itself, but in the skill, wisdom, and righteousness of the interpreter.
<i><b>“Since God has made all this known to you, there is no one as discerning and wise as you!”</b></i> (41:39). The haftarah cited above reiterates the parashah’s mention of wisdom when it recounts how two prostitutes come before King Solomon. Each had recently given birth, but one of the babies had died during the night. Now each woman insists that the living boy is hers. Solomon orders that the surviving baby be cut in two, to be divided between the claimants. When one woman pleads for the child’s life by agreeing to give the baby to the other woman, Solomon declares her to be the true mother. Thereupon, we read, the people “held the king in awe, seeing that he had within him divine wisdom” (I Kings 3:15–4:1).
<i><b>and gave him Asenath daughter of Potiphera priest of On as a wife</b></i> (41:45). Uncomfortable with the Bible’s implication that Joseph married a non-Israelite, Jews of the Hellenistic period composed a romance <i>(Joseph and Asenath)</i> in which Asenath, the most beautiful young virgin in Egypt, converts to belief in the one true God before her marriage to Joseph. During the seven years of plenty, Joseph—as second-in-command to Pharaoh—would travel throughout Egypt to collect corn. He stopped at the home of Pentephres (Potiphera, Asenath’s father), where he met the bejeweled and richly attired Asenath. Upon her first sighting of Joseph, the haughty Asenath is smitten by the beauty of this man whom she first considered to be a common Israelite shepherd. Asenath’s parents suggest that the two beautiful virgins kiss, but Joseph declines to kiss a woman who eats the sacrificial meat of idols. Asenath retires to her chambers (a high tower) to don sackcloth and ashes and repent before God for her sins of idol worship and selfishness. She throws away her idols, fasts, prays, and humbles herself. On the eighth day of her self-flagellation, an angel appears in Asenath’s room and converts her to Judaism in an otherwise unknown ceremony involving a honeycomb and bees. Joseph returns, sees that Asenath is even more beautiful than before, and—having been informed by the angel of Asenath’s conversion—agrees to marry her in a ceremony before Pharaoh.
Later midrashic traditions also demonstrate uneasiness with the implications of Joseph’s marrying the daughter of an Egyptian priest. The sages told that Asenath was actually Dinah’s daughter from her liaison with Shechem (Genesis 34). To prevent public disgrace to his family when the child was born out of wedlock, Jacob had placed an amulet engraved with the divine name around the baby’s neck, and the angel Gabriel had carried her to Potiphar’s house in Egypt—where Potiphar’s childless wife raised her as her own daughter. (The Rabbis also insisted that Potiphar, Joseph’s master, was identical to Potiphera, Joseph’s father-in-law. See also <i>Vayishlach,</i> Post-biblical Interpretations, at 34:26.) Thus, according to this legend, Joseph ends up marrying his niece—a permitted marriage in Jewish law—and both are preserved from marrying outsiders.

Vayigash

<i><b>“give your servant a hearing”</b></i> (44:18). In the Hebrew, what Judah literally asks is to speak a word in Joseph’s ears. Midrash <i>B’reishit Rabbah</i> 93.6 understands this locution as implying that Judah was relaying a private caution to Joseph—warning him of violent consequences, both human and divine, if Benjamin were to be enslaved in Egypt. All of the examples Judah uses to back up his threats (according to the Rabbis) refer to episodes of retribution in the lives of female family members—starting with Sarah and Rachel: “Because Pharaoh took Benjamin’s great-grandmother for only one night (12:15), he and his household were afflicted with plagues (12:17).” Moreover, “[Benjamin’s] mother died only because of his father’s curse, <i>But the one with whom you find your gods shall not live</i> (31:32). So take heed lest he hurl a curse against you—and you die!” Judah goes on to warn Joseph that two of his brothers once entered a large city and destroyed it (Genesis 34): “And if they did so much on account of a woman—their sister Dinah—how much the more so would they do when it is on account of a man [namely, their brother Benjamin], the beloved of the eyes, the one who gives hospitality to the blessed Holy One, as is said: <i>Of Benjamin he said: Beloved of the Eternal, / He rests securely beside [God], / Who protects him always, / [God] dwells amid his slopes</i> (Deuteronomy 33:12).” This valuing of a man over a woman is reflective of the social ordering of human beings in rabbinic literature, where women are seen as a secondary creation, both lesser and other than men. Nevertheless, the Rabbis did not view the women of Israel as nonentities; as each of the examples cited makes clear, their reputations, their words, and their actions were highly valued.
<i><b>“your servant made himself responsible for the lad.…how can I go home to my father without the lad…?”</b></i> (44:32–34). The Rabbis very much admired Judah’s loyalty to Benjamin and to the pledge he had made to Jacob. Contrary to the biblical narrative, in which Judah speaks to Joseph with cautious and even obsequious words, the rabbinic sages imagined so mighty a confrontation between “Judah the lion and Joseph the bull” that even the angels descended from heaven to witness the dispute (Midrash <i>Tanchuma, Vayigash</i> 4, 5).
<i><b>His sons and his sons’ sons were with him, his daughters and his sons’ daughters</b></i> (46:7). In <i>B’reishit Rabbah</i> 94.6, Rabbi Judah bar Ilai noticed that this verse includes both the sons and daughters of Jacob’s sons but not his daughters’ children, and commented: “The daughters of one’s sons are as one’s own children, whereas the sons of one’s daughters are not as one’s own sons.” This statement reflects a frequent situation in ancient times where daughters left their birth families at marriage and became part of their husbands’ households. Thus, their children were less likely to spend time with their maternal grandparents. In rabbinic halachah (that is, legal traditions), a married woman received a dowry from her father’s resources at the time of marriage but did not automatically inherit anything from her father’s estate.
<i><b>Asher’s sons…and their sister Serah</b></i> (46:17). This is the first biblical mention of Serah bat Asher. She reappears in Numbers 26:46 among Asher’s descendants who participated in the Exodus. Some rabbis linked these passages and imagined that Serah’s lifetime spanned not only the four hundred years of Israel’s captivity in Egypt but extended far beyond. Her remarkable longevity is attributed to a powerful blessing of praise that her grandfather Jacob bestowed on her when she informed him in song that Joseph was still alive (<i>Midrash HaGadol</i> and <i>Sefer HaYashar</i> on 46:8). At the time of the Exodus, Serah showed Moses where Joseph had been buried, so that his coffin might return with the Israelites to the land of Israel (<i>M’chilta, B’shalach</i> on 13:19; BT <i>Sotah</i> 13a). Other rabbis identify Serah with the “wise woman” who negotiated with David’s general Joab in II Samuel 20:16–24, another four hundred years after the Exodus (<i>B’reishit Rabbah</i> 94.9; <i>Midrash HaGadol</i> on Genesis 23:1). In the 13th-century Yemenite compendium <i>Midrash HaGadol,</i> Serah is further linked with Proverbs 31:26, “Her mouth is full of wisdom, her tongue with kindly teaching” (on Genesis 23:1). Other medieval sources claim that Serah “did not taste death” but entered Paradise alive (<i>Alphabet of Ben Sira</i> 20–21).

Vayechi

<i><b>“treat me with faithful kindness”</b></i> (47:29). In giving his burial instructions, Jacob asks to be treated with <i>chesed v’emet</i>. The Midrash asks why Jacob uses this expression—is there really such a thing as <i>unfaithful</i> kindness? Rather, Jacob’s words come to teach that truly faithful kindness is that which the living show the dead (<i>B’reishit Rabbah</i> 96.5). Consider that when a person shows kindness to someone living, no one knows for certain what that person’s motivation is; perhaps there is a hope for a favor in return. Furthermore, the outcome of that action is uncertain; while intended to be kind, it may result in harm or pain. But the kindness shown to a dead person—in the form of burial and a eulogy—is always true kindness. In addition, it is disinterested; one expects no favors from the dead (<i>Itturei Torah</i>).
<i><b>“Rachel died…on the road”</b></i> (48:7). Jacob had once before pressed Joseph to bury him in his ancestral burial plot (47:28–30). The commentators ask why Jacob only now—and not in that earlier scene—discusses his decision to bury Rachel at the roadside (rather than in the cave of Machpelah). One commentator argues that there was room in the cave of Machpelah only for Jacob and one of his wives. Up until now, Joseph had accepted the fact that Leah—as Jacob’s senior wife and the mother of his oldest sons—was entitled to that place. However, Jacob has since adopted Joseph’s sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, saying that they “will be to me as Reuben and Simeon” (48:5). With his sons recognized as the equals of his father’s oldest sons, Joseph then must have inquired why his mother should not henceforth be viewed as Jacob’s senior wife—and so be entitled to burial by his side. Therefore, Jacob now explains his decision to bury Rachel near Ephrath <i>(Itturei Torah).</i>
In defending his decision, Jacob explains that Rachel is destined to be an intercessor for her descendants (and, in fact, for all Israel). When the Israelites are conquered by the Babylonians, they will pass Rachel’s tomb on their way into exile. Rachel will then mediate on their behalf, beseeching God to have compassion on her children (a rabbinic understanding of Jeremiah 31:15–17). Rachel, rather than any other matriarch, is chosen as Israel’s intercessor because of her compassion for her sister, and her willingness to overcome her jealousy, when Leah married Jacob by subterfuge <i>(Itturei Torah,</i> citing Rashi and <i>Eichah Rabbah,</i> proem 24; see <i>parashat Vayeitzei</i> at 29:25).
<i><b>“Rachel died.”</b></i> Heb. <i>metah alai Rachel,</i> literally “Rachel died on me” or “…upon me.” According to <i>Rut Rabbah</i> 2, the preposition indicates that Jacob sees Rachel’s death as a “greater grief than all his other misfortunes.” Another rabbinic tradition construes the preposition as a reminder that a woman’s death is painful especially to her husband (BT <i>Sanhedrin</i> 22b). The same teaching meanwhile derives the parallel lesson—that a man’s death pains his wife more than anyone else—from Ruth 1:3, “And Elimelech, Naomi’s husband, died…” because that verse identifies him in terms of her.
<i><b>“By you”</b></i> (48:20). In his commentary on this parashah, Rashi cites this verse as the source for the custom of blessing sons with the words “May God make you like Ephraim and Manasseh.”
<i><b>blessing each one</b></i> (49:28). How could Jacob have “blessed” Simeon and Levi, given the harsh words he directed toward them (49:5–7)? One interpreter of this verse suggests that Jacob’s rebuke of his sons was, in fact, a blessing. In cursing their anger specifically—rather than his sons—Jacob sought to temper it, and to encourage them to distance themselves from their inappropriate behaviors. In this sense, his criticism was intended as a blessing, offering his sons a chance to renounce their past actions and become better people <i>(Itturei Torah).</i>
<i><b>“Please…forgive…your brothers”</b></i> (50:17). Given that the narrative did not mention Jacob’s having dispatched this exact message, Rabbi Eleazar son of Rabbi Simeon bar Yohai sees this verse as proof that one may alter another person’s words for the sake of peace (BT <i>Y’vamot</i> 65b); the brothers’ claim made it easier for them to approach Joseph and easier for him to respond positively.
<i><b>“I will provide”</b></i> (50:21). Commentators wonder why Joseph promised to care for his brothers’ children. The brothers believed that the compassion Joseph had shown them since their arrival in Egypt reflected his duty to them as his older brothers. They feared that when they died, Joseph’s anger at them for selling him into slavery would emerge and be directed at their children. Joseph reassures them; not only does he have no intention of harming them, but he plans to care for their children even after their death (<i>Itturei Torah).</i>

Shemot

<i><b>Shiphrah and…Puah</b></i> (1:15). The Rabbis are worried about unnamed women and intrigued with the Hebrew midwives. They conclude that Shiphrah and Puah are actually designations for Jochebed and Miriam (Midrash <i>Sifrei B’midbar</i> 78). They explain this via wordplay on the meaning of the names: Shiphrah was associated with Jochebed because she made children beautiful, and Puah was linked with Miriam because she wept over Moses. This conflation of the characters limits the number of women involved in the salvation of Moses and, by association, all Israel.
<i><b>And his sister stationed herself</b></i> (2:4). The Rabbis engage in creative midrash, claiming Miriam had prophetic powers. A midrash found in BT <i>Sotah</i> 12a–13a, among other sources, indicates that when Pharaoh decided to kill all Israelite male newborns, the Israelites chose to cease procreating, and Amram—Moses’s destined father—divorced his wife. His daughter Miriam rebuked him and described his decree as harsher than Pharaoh’s, since Amram’s action spelled disaster for females as well as males. Furthermore, Miriam prophesied that a son born to Amram would redeem Israel. Her father listened to her and remarried Jochebed, after which Moses was born. Yet, when they were forced to abandon Moses in the reeds, Amram no longer believed Miriam’s prophecy and reprimanded her. To find out whether she was right, Miriam “stationed herself” to see what would befall her brother.
<i><b>The daughter of Pharaoh came down to bathe in the Nile</b></i> (2:5). The Rabbis are also interested in naming Pharaoh’s daughter. Using a verse from I Chronicles 4:18 (“These are the sons of Bithiah daughter of Pharaoh”), they identify Bithiah as her name and interpret it as a message from God: “Moses was not your son, yet you called him your son; so too you are not my daughter, yet I call you my daughter” (Bithiah, or <i>bat Yah,</i> means daughter of God) (<i>Vayikra Rabbah</i> 1.3). This very positive attitude to this Egyptian woman downplays her foreign background.
In BT <i>Sotah</i> 12b, the Rabbis transform Pharaoh’s daughter into a prophet, claiming that the reason she could tell that the child in the basket was a Hebrew (2:5–6) was because of her unacknowledged prophetic capabilities. Since it is inconceivable to the Rabbis that such insight could be found in a non-Israelite woman, they thus conclude that Pharaoh’s daughter had converted. To reach this conclusion, they interpret “the daughter of Pharaoh came down to bathe in the Nile” (2:5) with the words “she went down to wash away her father’s idolatry.” The Rabbis are also interested in presenting Moses’ upbringing as untainted by heathen practices. They remark that a Hebrew wet nurse (ultimately his mother) was sought for Moses after he had turned down all the Egyptian wet nurses, their milk obviously not being kosher. Thus, the Rabbis are more concerned with a differentiation between Jews and Gentiles than the Bible seems to be.
<i><b>and</b></i> [<i><b>Reuel</b></i>] <i><b>gave Moses his daughter Zipporah as wife</b></i> (2:21). Interestingly, Zipporah’s foreign background does not seem to have been an issue for the Rabbis. When retelling the story of Moses’ marriage to Zipporah, they make Moses a greater hero than in the Bible. They do so by suggesting that the shepherds from whom Moses saves Zipporah and her sisters had actually threatened to rape them (<i>B’reishit Rabbah</i> 70.11). In this stereotypical, patriarchal manner, they portray the man who is to become her husband as protecting the defenseless woman from sexual danger.
<b>יהוה <i>encountered him and sought to kill him</i></b> (4:24). In order to make sense of this mysterious story, the Rabbis fill in its gaps with the following details: Before encountering God in the desert, Moses had promised his heathen father-in-law to allow his first-born to be raised as a heathen. But God is merciless and will kill Moses unless he goes back on his word. Moses is placed in a difficult situation, which is resolved by Zipporah, who had herself made no such promise to her father. Thus, she is the one who circumcises the child <i>(M’chilta, Yitro</i> 1).
<i><b>Zipporah…cut off her son’s foreskin</b></i> (4:25). This text is about a woman circumcising a child, which in early sources was not a problem (Tosefta <i>Shabbat</i> 15:8); yet for the Rabbis of the Babylonian Talmud it was. In a complicated halachic discussion they maintain that some Jews are not circumcised for medical reasons yet still are considered Jews, while some gentiles (such as Arabs) are circumcised but obviously are not Jews. In this context the Babylonian Talmud disqualifies women as circumcisors. This means that if a woman were to perform circumcision, her action would not be ritually valid. At this point, the Rabbis invoke the memory of Zipporah circumcising her son. To this seeming contradiction they respond with two alternative readings. One suggests that Zipporah only gave instructions and a man who was present performed the circumcision. The other claims that Zipporah took the knife, but that Moses actually circumcised his sons <i>(Avodah Zarah</i> 27a).

Vaera

<i><b>Amram took to wife his father’s sister Jochebed</b></i> (6:20). While Moses’ mother is mentioned several times in the Torah, her proper name, Jochebed, is stated only twice, here and in Numbers 26:59. Here, she is simply described in the Hebrew as her husband Amram’s <i>dodah</i>, an imprecise term indicating a familial relationship. Numbers 26:59, however, makes clear that Jochebed was the daughter of Jacob’s son Levi (and that she was born to Levi in Egypt). That information has been taken into account in the translation of the present verse: Jochebed (daughter of Levi) was the aunt of her husband, Amram (grandson of Levi; Exodus 6:16, 18).
The Rabbis were uncomfortable with this marriage, since it appeared to contradict the prohibition in Leviticus 18:12 against an aunt-nephew sexual/marital relationship. One response to this dilemma was simply to point out that the relationship was pre-Sinaitic and therefore was not restricted to the law as stipulated in Leviticus (BT <i>Sanhedrin</i> 57b–58b). Another rabbinic approach rested on further investigation into the meaning of the word <i>dodah.</i> According to BT <i>Sanhedrin</i> 58b, Jochebed was only a “half-aunt.” She and Amram’s father were said to have shared the same father (Levi), but they were born of different (unnamed) mothers. Therefore, the marriage of Amram and Jochebed was not prohibited as it was between a man and his half-aunt.
<i><b>Aaron took to wife Elisheba, daughter of Amminadab</b></i> (6:23). The Torah mentions Elisheba only once and defines her by her familial relationships. While it is standard for a biblical woman to be identified by her father’s name, and even by her husband’s or children’s names, the mention of all of them in the same verse is unusual. The description of Elisheba is even more unusual in that she is also identified as the sister of Nahshon. <i>Vayikra Rabbah</i> 20.2 elaborates on these relationships by pointing to one day in Elisheba’s life, which was also an important day in the lives of all the male relatives mentioned in this verse. According to narratives found later in the Torah, it occurred exactly one year after the Exodus took place; on that day, the Tabernacle was dedicated in the wilderness, and Elisheba experienced a number of joyous events—but then a disaster transformed her happiness into mourning. The joyous incidents were that her brother-in-law (Moses) took on a mantle of leadership that is compared to royalty; her brother (Nahshon) was made chief of the tribe of Judah; her husband (Aaron) was made high priest; her grandson (Phinehas) was anointed as a military leader; and two of her sons (Nadab and Abihu) were made assistants to the high priest. The circumstance for grief concerned these two sons. According to Leviticus 10:1–2, on that same day “they offered before יהוה alien fire…and fire came forth from יהוה and consumed them; thus they died at the instance of יהוה.”
Even though Elisheba bat Amminadab is mentioned only once in the Torah, a rabbinic opinion in BT <i>Sotah</i> 11b equates her with Puah, one of the two midwives who saved the Israelite baby boys contrary to Pharaoh’s decree (Exodus 1:15–22). These two midwives, Shiphrah and Puah, are identified by some rabbinic commentators as the mother-daughter team of Jochebed and Miriam, and by other rabbinic commentators as a mother-daughter-in-law team, namely, Jochebed and Elisheba. Such conflation of several biblical personalities into one person is typical of rabbinic interpretation.
<i><b>Aaron’s son Eleazar took to wife one of Putiel’s daughters</b></i> (6:25). This verse is part of a longer priestly lineage recorded in Exodus 6. It is unusual, although not unique, in that it mentions a wife. The way that this woman is designated is also unusual, in that she is described as one of the daughters (plural) of Putiel, rather than simply a daughter (singular) of Putiel. The Rabbis derived from this plurality that <i>both</i> sides of her family may be seen as influences on her son, Phinehas (who plays a major, heroic role in events recorded in Numbers 25). They learned about her ancestors by analyzing the name of her father Putiel, since he is not mentioned elsewhere in the Bible, and nothing else is known about him. By examining the Hebrew root of his name they deduced that he (and therefore his daughter) is descended from Jethro (Moses’ father-in-law) on one side of his family, and from Joseph on the other side (BT <i>Sotah</i> 43a).

Bo

<b><i>“the first-born of the slave girl who is behind the millstones”</i></b> (11:5). According to the midrash collection <i>P’sikta D’Rav Kahana</i> 7.9, Egyptian slave women were proud to work beside well-born Israelite women like Serah bat Asher, Jacob’s granddaughter (Genesis 46:17). Yet, despite their lowly status and their solidarity with Israelite slaves, the Torah makes clear that these women were still Egyptians—and their first-born children were not spared. According to midrashic tradition, Serah’s life spanned the entire period of Israel’s slavery in Egypt (see Numbers 26:46).
<b><i>“This month shall mark for you the beginning of the months”</i></b> (12:2). Based on this verse, traditional Judaism ordains the celebration of Rosh Chodesh, the new month. Since the Jewish calendar is partially based on the lunar cycle, this observance corresponds with each new moon, and it has special connotations for women. In ancient times, Rosh Chodesh did not have the elevated status of a full holiday, but it was celebrated in a festive, sacred manner. According to JT <i>Taanit</i> 1:6, women customarily did not work on the day of the new moon. Later rabbinic sources explain that the Rosh Chodesh holiday was given to women as a reward, since—according to midrashim on Exodus 32—they refused to participate in the sin of the Golden Calf (<i>Pirkei D’Rabbi Eliezer 45).</i> The custom of special time for women on Rosh Chodesh, which persisted through the Middle Ages, has been renewed today in Rosh Chodesh groups for women and girls.
<b><i>In the middle of the night</i> יהוה <i>struck down all the [male] first-born in the land of Egypt</i></b> (12:29). Even though the Egyptians had already been tortured with nine plagues, they continued to force the Israelites to work as slaves. One of the well-known, back-breaking tasks of the slaves was making bricks (1:14; 5:7). This involved the treading of clay to mix it with water and straw in order to prepare it for placing into molds to form bricks. A midrash in <i>Pirkei D’Rabbi Eliezer</i> 48 recounts the story of a specific woman, Rachel the granddaughter of Shuthelah, who is not actually named in the Torah although her grandfather appears in a genealogical list (Numbers 26:36). At this late stage in the Egyptian bondage, Rachel was pregnant and was treading clay for bricks along with her husband. She spontaneously gave birth to her baby in the midst of her work, and the newborn mistakenly fell into the clay and was mixed into it. The new mother’s desperate cry was so great that it reached heaven. There, the angel Michael heard her, went down to earth, and took the clump of clay that had now been made into a brick with the infant inside it and brought it up to God’s Throne of Glory, where the brick served as God’s footstool. This outrage served as a reminder for God to proceed with the punishment of the Egyptians—and it was to that very same night that the present biblical verse refers.
<b><i>That was for</i> יהוה <i>a night of vigil</i></b> (12:42). A rabbinic opinion states that first-born Egyptian females as well as males were killed in the tenth plague. According to this view, Pharaoh’s daughter—who had rescued Moses and raised him as her son (2:5–10)—was a first-born and thus should have perished in this plague. <i>P’sikta D’Rav Kahana</i> 7.7 explains that Moses prayed for his adoptive mother, whose name was thought to be Bithiah. His prayer is said to have extolled Bithiah in the language of Proverbs 31, the biblical tribute to the “woman of valor.” According to a verse in this poetic passage, the woman of valor’s lamp does not go out at night (Proverbs 31:18). The midrash understands this statement as a metaphorical reference to the survival of Pharaoh’s daughter, whose soul was not extinguished on the fateful night of death. Evidence is adduced from the unusual spelling of the Hebrew word for “night” as written in Proverbs 31:18 (without the final letter <i>heh),</i> which matches the spelling of a form of the same word in Exodus 12:42. Insisting on the connection between these two biblical verses, the midrash teaches that Pharaoh’s first-born daughter was saved during the tenth plague due to Moses’ prayer on her behalf.

Beshalach

<i><b>Then Moses and the Israelites sang this song</b></i> (15:1). The Rabbis noted that the word <i>shirah</i> (song) appears ten times in the Hebrew Scriptures. The Song at the Sea (Exodus 15) is the second instance. According to <i>M’chilta,</i> an early commentary on Exodus, nine of these songs were sung in the past, but the tenth is for the “Age to Come.” This passage also reports that “for all the songs referring to previous events the noun used (<i>shirah)</i> is in the feminine” (<i>Shirta</i> 1). In a revelatory exposition of rabbinic sexual politics, the sages explained that “even as a female gives birth, so the achievements of the past were followed by subjugation.” That is, just as a woman who emerges from a successful labor is still subject to the authority of her husband, so Israel, despite small victories, has consistently been subjected to foreign conquest. However, in the case of the future song, predicted in “Sing unto יהוה a new song” (Isaiah 42:10), the masculine noun <i>shir</i> is used. This indicates “that just as no male gives birth, so the triumph which is yet to come will not be succeeded by subjugation” (<i>M’chilta, Shirta</i> 1).
<i><b>Then Miriam the prophet</b></i> (15:20). Miriam is called “the prophet” in this verse, although she never prophesies in the Bible. The <i>M’chilta</i> says she predicted the birth of Moses to her father, who praised her when Moses was born—but then blamed her when they were forced to expose him in the basket (S<i>hirta</i> 10; also BT <i>Sotah</i> 12a–13a, referring to Exodus 2:1–3).
<i><b>and all the women went out after her in dance with hand-drums</b></i> (15:20). The Rabbis speculated as to where the women obtained the musical instruments they played when they danced at the sea. Like a mother who remembers to pack all the necessities for a family trip, the women’s confidence that God would deliver them made them bring these instruments along: “But where did the Israelites get hand-drums and flutes in the wilderness? It was simply that the righteous were confident and knew that God would perform miracles and mighty deeds when they left Egypt, so they prepared hand-drums and flutes” (<i>M’chilta, Shirta</i> 10). Although the <i>M’chilta</i> calls the righteous <i>tzaddikim</i> (masculine plural), the medieval commentator Rashi, in his remarks on this verse, made a point of calling them <i>tzadkaniot</i> (feminine plural), referring to the women.
<i><b>And Miriam chanted for them</b></i> (15:21). Interpreters visualized two choral groups at the sea chanting the same song, both led by prophets: the men by Moses, the women by Miriam. Just as Moses recited the Song among the men, so it was Miriam who recited among the women: “Sing to יהוה for He has triumphed gloriously” (<i>M’chilta, Shirta</i> 10).
In rabbinic literature, Miriam and Moses often appear in parallel, with Miriam given an equal status to Moses. In a midrash in the 13th-century-<small>C. E.</small> <i>Midrash HaGadol,</i> Joseph explains two dreams of Pharaoh in which the number three appears. According to Joseph’s interpretation, the double appearance of this number refers to the three patriarchs and to the three leaders who would redeem the people from Egypt: Moses, Aaron, and Miriam. Furthermore, the miraculous well of Miriam, which accompanied the people of Israel though the wilderness and sustained them because of Miriam’s righteousness (BT <i>Taanit</i> 9a; <i>B’midbar Rabbah</i> 1.2), was among the ten miraculous entities created by God during the twilight on the eve of the first Sabbath (Mishnah <i>Avot</i> 5:6). This well complements the manna, which was given to the people because of Moses’ righteousness. The Talmud (BT <i>Taanit</i> 9a, among many other sources) explains as follows: “Rabbi Yose the son of Rabbi Judah says, ‘Three good leaders had arisen for Israel—namely, Moses, Aaron, and Miriam—and for their sake three good things were given: the well, the clouds of glory, and the manna. The first was given for the merits of Miriam, the second for those of Aaron, and the third for those of Moses.’” The well disappeared at Miriam’s death, but one tradition says a vessel of water from Miriam’s well is one of three concealed objects that Elijah will restore in the messianic age, along with vessels of manna and of sacred oil (<i>M’chilta, Vayassa</i> 6).

Yitro

<i><b>Jethro priest of Midian…heard</b></i> (18:1). The Rabbis wondered what prompted Jethro, priest of Midian, father of Moses’ wife, Zipporah, to visit Moses in the wilderness. One tradition concludes that Jethro learned of the revelation at Mt. Sinai. Another sage suggests that Jethro heard about the parting of the Sea of Reeds. The Rabbis go on to say that Jethro converted to Judaism because he was so impressed by God’s power in redeeming Israel from Egypt (<i>M’chilta, Amalek</i> 3; <i>Sh’mot Rabbah</i> 27.6).
Discussion of Jethro’s acceptance of Judaism in this passage in <i>M’chilta</i> reminded the Rabbis of another supposed convert, Rahab the harlot—who was said to have been, along with Sarah, Abigail, and Esther, one of the most beautiful women who ever lived (BT <i>M’gillah</i> 15a). In Joshua 2:10–11, Rahab tells Joshua’s spies that when she heard of the parting of the Sea of Reeds, she became convinced that “your God יהוה is God in heaven above and here on earth” (Joshua 2:11). Rahab is said to have gone beyond all other converts in her recognition of God’s great powers (<i>M’chilta, Amalek</i> 3). When she was fifty years old, she converted and asked God to forgive her for her life as a prostitute, reminding God that she had enabled Joshua’s spies to escape from Jericho. According to some rabbinic sources, Rahab even married Joshua (BT <i>M’gillah</i> 14b) and was rewarded by having priests and prophets of Israel among her descendants (<i>Sifrei B’midbar</i> 78). Her story, like Jethro’s, represents a powerful message that neither gender, foreign origins, nor a dubious past is a barrier to those who sincerely wish to join the Jewish people.
<i><b>So Jethro…took Zipporah, Moses’ wife, after she had been sent home</b></i> (18:2). The biblical text gives no information on when or why Moses sent Zipporah and her two sons back to Jethro. A tradition in <i>M’chilta, Amalek</i> 3, imagines that after Moses received the divine call to redeem Israel from slavery, he set out for Egypt with his family. When he encountered Aaron on the way (4:27), Moses introduced his wife and sons. Aaron responded, “We are worrying about those already there and now you bring upon us these newcomers!” At that moment, Moses said to Zipporah, “Go to your father’s house.” Based on the use of the verb “sent” (<i>shalach</i>) both here and in the description of divorce in Deuteronomy 24:1, the Rabbis concluded that Moses divorced his wife, though they debated whether he did so with a <i>get</i> (a bill of divorce) or simply by an oral statement (<i>M’chilta, Amalek</i> 3).
<i><b>Thus shall you say to the house of Jacob and declare to the children of Israel</b></i> (19:3). The Rabbis were certain that divine words contained no repetition. Thus, <i>M’chilta, Bachodesh</i> 2, explains that <i>house of Jacob</i> refers to the Israelite women, while <i>children of Israel</i> refers to the men. (In 1917, Sarah Schenirer of Cracow, Poland, founded what is now a worldwide network of Orthodox schools for girls, which takes its name from the rabbinic interpretation of this verse: <i>Beis Yaakov,</i> The House of Jacob.) A second interpretation of this juxtaposition suggests that <i>Thus shall you say</i> was a divine directive that Moses should instruct the women in a mild tone, while the parallel verb <i>declare</i> implied that Moses should be strict with the men. The result was that God’s revelation was accessible to everyone.
<i><b>Honor your father and your mother</b></i> (20:12). A statement in <i>M’chilta, Bachodesh</i> 8, observes that honoring parents is equal to honoring God. The Rabbis also noticed that this verse puts honoring father before honoring mother, while in Leviticus 19:3 fearing one’s mother precedes fearing one’s father. They explained this discrepancy as being the result of the parents’ different gender roles: “a man honors his mother more than his father because she sways him with persuasive words,” whereas “a man is more afraid of his father than of his mother because his father teaches him Torah.”

Mishpatim

<i><b>When you acquire a Hebrew slave</b></i> (21:2–11). Slavery was an accepted part of life in biblical and post-biblical times. Numerous Roman Empire documents and inscriptions demonstrate that Jews were slaves and slave owners. Slaves could be emancipated, but mostly within ongoing structured relationships between freed persons and their master’s/patron’s household. The provisions for treatment of slaves outlined in our parashah do not appear to have been applied by Jews in the post-biblical period, even when their slaves were also Jews.
Thus, female slaves in the post-biblical period did not enjoy the protections of Exodus 21:9–11, which considers female slavery as leading to marriage and refers to a woman’s conjugal rights. Rather, rabbinic legislation, like Roman law, considered slavery a deficient status. A Jewish slave woman could not form a legal marriage with her Jewish sexual partner, whether a slave or a free man, and the offspring of such a union were slaves (Mishnah <i>Kiddushin</i> 3:12). The likelihood of sexual relations between female slaves and various males in the master’s household was assumed. Rabbinic texts tacitly recognized that women slaves were sexually available to their owners, as in the maxim “the more women slaves, the more unchastity” (Mishnah <i>Avot</i> 2:7). This warning addresses the distraction that female slaves posed to the male scholar.
Emancipation affected men and women differently. The Jewish historian Flavius Josephus (1st century <small>C. E.)</small> described a Jew who was taken as a slave to Rome and married a captive virgin at the command of his master, Emperor Vespasian (<i>Life</i> 414–15). At the moment that the male slave was freed, they separated, and later he married again. The first woman was apparently an appropriate wife for a slave, but not for a free man.
Rabbinic law presumed that female slaves and freed women were no longer virgins. Thus, even if a slave woman was emancipated, the legal minimum value of her marriage settlement (<i>k’tubah</i>) would be half that of an unmarried free woman. Although the liberation story of Exodus was always a central focus of Judaism, few commentators have struggled with the larger issues of enslavement that continued for centuries in Jewish societies.
Rabbinic Judaism did place a premium on <i>pidyon sh’vuyim,</i> the redemption of Jewish captives who were at risk of being sold into slavery. BT <i>Bava Batra</i> 8a-b asks: “Since Rabbi Samuel ben Judah has laid down that money for <i>tzedakah</i> is not to be levied from the fatherless even for the redemption of captives,’ should we not conclude that redeeming captives is a religious duty of great importance?” The Rabbis insisted that in most cases women were to be redeemed from slavery before men, in order to preserve the women from dishonor (Mishnah <i>Horayot</i> 3:7; BT <i>Horayot</i> 13a). If a woman testified that a fellow female prisoner, the wife of a priest, was not raped in captivity, her testimony was believed, even though women’s testimony was generally not admissible in rabbinic courts (Mishnah <i>K’tubot</i> 2:6; BT <i>K’tubot</i> 27b). This meant the undefiled woman could return to her husband.
<i><b>When [two or more] parties fight</b></i> (21:22–25). The phrase <i>if other damage ensues</i> (v. 23) played a critical role in shaping rabbinic attitudes about abortion (Daniel Schiff, <i>Abortion in Judaism,</i> 2002). In the Torah, <i>a miscarriage results, but no other damage</i> (v. 22) is contrasted with the potential <i>other damage</i> (v. 23), an apparent reference to the death of the woman. This formulation suggests that only mortal injury to the pregnant woman is considered homicide. However, Jews who translated the Hebrew Bible into Greek (3rd century <small>B. C.E.)</small> understood the import of these verses differently. Instead of contrasting the death of the fetus and the death of the mother, the Septuagint (Greek translation) renders <i>ason</i> as “formed,” distinguishing the death of an “imperfectly formed” fetus (v. 22) from that of a “perfectly formed” fetus (v. 23). Thus, this translation considers the violently induced miscarriage of a completely formed fetus as homicide.
Rabbinic interpretation, however, follows the Hebrew text; therefore, the Rabbis drew a clear distinction between the monetary penalty for one who kills a fetus, and the capital penalty for one who causes a woman’s death. The Rabbis considered elsewhere the existence and formation of a fetus once it had reached forty days, but they stopped short of declaring it a <i>nefesh,</i> a legal human life. Despite the complexity and ambiguity in many of their discussions of abortion, the Rabbis specifically legislated aborting a fetus if its continued existence threatened the pregnant woman’s life (Mishnah <i>Ohalot</i> 7:6 and BT <i>Sanhedrin</i> 72b).

Terumah

<i><b>every person</b></i> (25:2). Heb. <i>kol ish,</i> which is often translated as “every man,” but as Nachmanides commented on “whole Israelite community” (35:1), the expression <i>kol ish</i> here includes women as well.
<b><i>whose heart is so moved</i></b> (25:2). Sforno said that God specifically included the phrase “whose heart so moves” in order to differentiate this freely given offering from <i>tzedakah,</i> an obligation that everyone is obligated to fulfill.
<i><b>that I may dwell among them…the Tabernacle</b></i> (25:8–9). The two key Hebrew words, <i>v’shachanti</i> (“that I may dwell”) and <i>mishkan</i> (“Tabernacle”), are related linguistically to the feminine noun <i>Shechinah.</i> The Rabbis used that term for the indwelling and intimately felt presence of God, believing that the <i>Shechinah</i> was present in the Tabernacle and, later, in the Temple in Jerusalem. According to the Talmud, the <i>Shechinah</i> also accompanied Israel into exile (BT <i>M'gillah</i> 29a) and becomes manifest during communal worship (BT <i>Sanhedrin</i> 39a) and moments of individual need (BT <i>Shabbat</i> 12b). [As Sharon Faye Koren explains (“Shekhinah as Female Symbol,” <i>Encyclopaedia Judaica,</i> 2nd ed., 2006), medieval Jewish mysticism (Kabbalah) often represented the <i>Shechinah</i> as a female aspect of God. The <i>Shechinah</i> mediated between heaven and earth and served as the passive eye or door through which a mystic could achieve divine vision. The mystics believed that sexual relations between the <i>Shechinah</i> and a male aspect of the divine brought about cosmic harmony. (Similarly, intercourse between a male mystic and his wife on earth, especially on Shabbat night, could foster both divine and mystical union.) Some contemporary Jewish feminists have reclaimed the symbol of the <i>Shechinah</i> to counter what they perceive to be the patriarchal bias of Jewish theology; they have reinterpreted mystical themes and emphasize the symbol of the feminine <i>Shechinah</i> in innovative new liturgies. —<i>Ed.</i>]
<i><b>so shall you make it</b></i> (25:9). God’s instructions concerning the building of the Tabernacle are recounted in the Torah prior to the incident of the Golden Calf (Exodus 32–34). However, some rabbinic commentators believed that these directions were given after that shameful event; and they interpret God’s command to create the Tabernacle as a sign of divine forgiveness. According to Midrash <i>Sh’mot Rabbah</i> 51.4, the nations of the world had declared that God would never be reconciled with Israel after Israel rejected God in favor of an idol. However, Moses sucessfully pleaded for mercy on the people’s behalf. At that moment, God said to Moses, “I will let my <i>Shechinah</i> dwell among [the Israelites], so that all may know that I have forgiven Israel. My sanctuary in their midst will be testimony of My forgiveness—and from this time on may be called a ‘Tabernacle of Testimony.’” (On the <i>Shechinah,</i> see the previous comment.) Nachmanides, however, did not accept this tampering with chronology. He suggested that the commandment to build the Tabernacle was divine acknowledgment of Israel’s merit in having freely accepted the Decalogue (comment to 35:1).
<i>P’sikta D’Rav Kahana</i> 1.1–2 understands the Tabernacle as a sign of God’s love for Israel and portrays it as a bridal chamber for the bride (Israel) and groom (God), patterned on the heavenly Tabernacle. A parable in <i>Sh’mot Rabbah</i> 33.1 utilizes somewhat different symbolism: When the beloved daughter of a king married another king, her father could not bear to part from her and so requested that his son-in-law build him a room so he could dwell with her. Here, God is depicted as a father and the Tabernacle as a place for the father to remain with his beloved daughter, Israel.
<i><b>Make two cherubim of gold</b></i> (25:18). According to BT <i>Chagigah</i> 13b, the cherubim had the forms of winged human beings. One represented divine mercy and the other represented divine justice.
<i><b>There I will meet with you</b></i> (25:22). The Rabbis acknowledged that God is everywhere. Nevertheless, they also understood that through an act of <i>tzimtzum,</i> contraction, God could meet with Moses from between the cherubim, which were ten spans above the earth <i>(Sh’mot Rabbah</i> 34.1).
<b><i>make fifty gold clasps, and couple the cloths to one another with the clasps, so that the Tabernacle becomes one whole</i></b> (26:6). Ibn Ezra compared the interconnected components of the Tabernacle to the intricacies and interdependence of the parts of the human body, as well as to the similar interlocking segments of the entire world. The <i>Zohar</i> elaborates: “The mystery of the Tabernacle which is [composed of] limbs and joints—they all amount to the mystery of the human being, on the pattern of the commandments in the Torah, for all the commandments in the Torah are in the form of the mystery of the human being, male and female, for when they are joined together they are the single mystery of humanity” (<i>Zohar</i> 2:162b).
<i><b>You shall make the planks for the Tabernacle of acacia wood upright</b></i> (26:15). <i>Sh’mot Rabbah</i> 35.1 asks why the Hebrew reads “<i>the</i> planks” rather than just “planks.” One answer is that God concealed some things after the Creation until they were specifically required. These particular cedar trees were hidden until they could be used to construct a dwelling place for the <i>Shechinah.</i>

<i><b>You shall further instruct the Israelites to bring you clear oil…for kindling lamps regularly</b></i> (27:20). Reflecting on this commandment about kindling lights, medieval commentators offered two possible interpretations of the phrase <i>ner tamid</i> (literally “light regularly” but understood to mean “eternal lamp”). Rashi suggested it meant “routinely kindled,” while Nachmanides understood it as “continually burning.” In general, the latter interpretation—the image of an eternal, rather than a regularly kindled, light—predominated. In the rabbinic imagination, the eternal lamp of the synagogue recalled the <i>menorah</i> of Temple times, since rabbinic tradition associated the <i>ner tamid</i> with the westernmost or central lamp of the <i>menorah</i> in the Temple (<i>Sifra Emor</i> 13.7). In a poem composed for the occasion of this Torah reading, the Byzantine Jewish liturgical poet Yannai drew a parallel between the synagogue’s eternal lamp and that of the “woman of valor,” whose “lamp never goes out at night” (Proverbs 31:18).
The Rabbis understood the eternal lamp as an important symbol with multiple meanings. First, they associated the light with Torah. For example, BT <i>B’rachot</i> 57a teaches: “If one sees olive oil in a dream, one may hope for the light of the Torah, as it is written, <i>You shall further instruct…”</i> This association derives from Proverbs 6:23, which states: <i>The commandment is a lamp</i> / <i>And the Torah is a light.</i> The song <i>“Torah Orah</i> (The Torah is a Light),” popular in many contemporary synagogues during the Torah services, reflects this symbolism.
The Rabbis frequently represented the eternal lamp as symbolic of the divine presence, or <i>Shechinah.</i> In BT <i>M’nachot</i> 87b, the Rabbis wonder why God would need a light; they then deduce that the eternal lamp commemorated the divine light that had led Israel through the wilderness. The reason the eternal lamp was the “western lamp” was because “the divine Presence will never depart from the Western Wall” (Midrash <i>Sh’mot Rabbah 2.2).</i> Over time, the ritual of the Temple lamp was transferred to the home. Thus, Mishnah <i>Shabbat</i> 2:1 offers instructions for kindling Shabbat lights, which 2:6 then characterizes as a specifically female commandment. Yannai read those Mishnaic passages back into Exodus, linking the priestly rules for maintaining the Tabernacle’s lights with women’s command of <i>hadlakat nerot,</i> kindling lamps.
The eternal lamp was also understood in post-biblical Judaism as foreshadowing the light of the messianic age. The lamps described in this parashah were popular in Byzantine and medieval synagogue art. These images, themselves multivalent, may have both memorialized the Temple destroyed in 70 <small>C. E.</small> and also anticipated a time when the Temple lamps would be rekindled. As the poet Yannai wrote of those days to come, “And our light will no longer be quenched / and our flames no longer extinguished / and You shall be our everlasting light.”
The medieval mystical compilation <i>Zohar</i> (2:99b) offers a spiritual understanding of the <i>ner tamid</i> when it states that <i>“ner”</i> is an acronym for <i>n’shamah-ruach</i> (“soul-spirit”). Together, soul and spirit represent a perfect union of masculine and feminine. Together, they can bring forth light; but separated, they are powerless and in the dark.
<i><b>Make sacral vestments for your brother Aaron</b></i> (28:2). The Rabbis taught that each item of the head priest’s ritual garb possessed symbolic value. The fringed tunic atoned for bloodshed; the robe, for slander; the breeches, for sexual impropriety; the headdress, for arrogance; the frontlet, for brazenness; the sash, for impure thoughts; the breastplate, for neglect of the civil laws; and the ephod, for idolatry (BT <i>Z’vachim</i> 88b; <i>Vayikra Rabbah</i> 10.6; <i>Shir HaShirim Rabbah</i> 4.8). According to BT <i>Sotah</i> 36b, it was Joseph’s desire to have his name engraved upon the ephod (along with the names of his brothers) that restrained him from succumbing to temptation with Potiphar’s wife (Genesis 39).
According to the <i>Zohar,</i> “All the priestly garments were emblematic of supernal mystery” (2:231a). This mystical reading focuses on the layered nature of the vestments, which indicate a balancing of dualities: left and right, soul and body, and male and female. The primordial human whom God created (Genesis 1)—this passage teaches—was a singular creature, both male and female, but the two halves were joined at the back, facing away from each other. God separated this single entity into two, and “thus they [the first woman and first man] were brought face to face, [and] love was multiplied in the world.” Unfortunately, this physical division also led to emotional estrangement, jealousy, and strife. The unity of the ephod and breastplate (which were worn together) recalled the original unity of the first woman and the first man and, by extension, of all humankind.

<i><b>See, I have singled out by name Bezalel…I have endowed him with…skill, ability, and knowledge</b></i> (31:2–3). According to rabbinic midrash, Miriam’s husband was Caleb (<i>Sh’mot Rabbah</i> 1.17; <i>Sifrei B’midbar</i> 78; BT <i>Sotah</i> 12a); given that Bezalel—the craftsman who designed the Tabernacle and supervised its construction—was Caleb’s great-grandson (I Chronicles 2:18–20), this means that he was also Miriam’s great-grandson. In <i>Sh’mot Rabbah</i> 48:3–4, the Rabbis connected Exodus 31:2–3 with Job 28:28, “See! Fear of Adonai is wisdom (<i>chochmah</i>)., / To shun evil is understanding (<i>binah</i>).” They explained that “fear of Adonai” referred to Jochebed and Miriam, whom the Rabbis identified with the God-fearing midwives of Exodus 1:21. Since the reward for fearing God is Torah, Jochebed gave birth to Moses, through whom the Torah was revealed. As for Miriam, because she “shunned evil” she became the great-grandmother of Bezalel, known for his “skill (<i>chochmah),</i> ability (<i>t’vunah</i>—a noun related to <i>binah),</i> and knowledge” (31:3).
<i><b>Upon finishing speaking with him…, [God] gave Moses the two tablets</b></i> (31:18). The Hebrew expression rendered here as “upon finishing” (<i>k’chaloto</i>) is almost identical to a term that means “as his bride.” (The two words differ by one vowel.) Based on that wordplay, the Rabbis sometimes understood part of this verse as: <i>[God] gave Moses, as his bride, the two tablets.</i> The feminine personification of the Torah as the bride of Israel is an ancient tradition. In <i>Sh’mot Rabbah</i> 41.5, the Rabbis declared that when God “gave the Torah to Israel, it was then as dear to them as a bride is to her spouse.”
<b><i>all the people took off the gold rings that were in their ears</i></b> (32:2–3). According to Midrash <i>Pirkei D’Rabbi Eliezer 4</i>5, only the men contributed jewelry; the Israelite women refused to surrender their earrings for the forging of the Golden Calf, rejecting it as “a graven and molten image without any power.” In recognition of their faithfulness, God reward the women both in this world and the world-to-come. In this world, they received special privileges on Rosh Chodesh (the new), traditionally a day on which Jewish women abstained from work. And in the world-to-come, “women are destined to be renewed like the raw moons.” (For more on women and Rosh Chodesh, see <i>P’kudei,</i> Post-biblical Interpretations.)
<b><i>As soon as Moses came near the camp…he hurled the tablets from his hands</i></b> (32:19). Τhe Rabbis repeatedly compared Israel’s rejection of God in favor of the Golden Calf to a woman’s sexual betrayal of her fiancé or husband. In <i>Sh’mot Rabbah</i> 43.1, they likened Moses’ decision to destroy the tablets to the act of a marriage broker, sent by a king to betroth a certain woman. While the broker was en route with the marriage document, the woman “corrupted herself with another man.” Τhe broker immediately destroyed the marriage document, saying it was better that she be judged as an unattached wanton woman than as a married woman who had been unfaithful. Similarly, Μοses destroyed the tablets, saying it was better that Israel be judged as ignorant and foolish rather than as having deliberately disobeyed the commandments forbidding idolatry that they had just received.
<b><i>And</i> יהוה <i>said to Moses: Write down these commandments</i></b> (34:27). Midrash <i>D’varim Rabbah</i> 3.17 asks why the first tablets were written by God and the second set were inscribed by a human being. The reply is another analogy: This is like a king who married a woman and gladly paid for all the expenses of preparing the marriage contract. When he saw his wife behaving in an inappropriate manner with one of his servants, he was enraged and sent her away. His groomsman pled on her and explained that since she was brought up among servants, she did not know her actions were wrong. The king agreed to be reconciled with his wife, but he required the contract. Similarly, Moses beseeched God to remember that Israel had spent many years in “Egypt, the house of idolatry,” and to forgive the lapse with the Golden Calf. Although God. Although God agreed to the reconciliation, God’s ardor was now cooled and Moses was required to prepare and insert the tablets himself. (So also <i>Sh’mot Rabbah</i> 47.2.)

<i><b>Men and women…came bringing…gold objects of all kinds</b></i> (35:22). Because the Hebrew wording is unusual, literally “the men on [or: over] the women came…,” many medieval commentators understood it as referring to relations between men and women. Rashi and Ibn Ezra understood the passage simply as “the men came <i>with</i> the women.” Nachmanides explained that the men followed the women’s example and donated jewelry only <i>after</i> the latter had already done so. Chizz’kuni said that the men collected the jewelry from the women in order to then donate it for the building effort. And Sforno interpreted the words to mean that husbands accompanied wives who were bringing gift offerings in order to indicate their approval. (Two other verses in this parashah, 35:25 and 38:8, also mention women bringing gifts for the building of the Tabernacle.)
<i><b>all the skilled women spun with their own hands</b></i> (35:25). “Skilled” in this verse is literally “wise-hearted.” This beautiful tribute to the work of women’s hands provides the proof text for Rabbi Eliezer’s infamous statement: “A women’s wisdom is only in (connection with) the spindle” (BT <i>Yoma</i> 66b). Rabbi Eliezer believed that women were unfit for Torah study, declaring that “anyone who teaches his daughter Torah, it is as if he taught her <i>tiflut</i> (licentiousness)” (BT <i>Sotah</i> 21b). His opinion expressed the dominant rabbinic attitude which limited Jewish women’s access to traditional Jewish learning for centuries. The sage Ben Azzai expressed the opposite point of view, “A man is obligated to teach his daughter Torah” (BT <i>Sotah</i> 20a); however, this remained a minority view.
<i><b>He made the laver of copper and its stand of copper, from the mirrors of the women who performed tasks at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting</b></i> (38:8). who were these women and what were they doing? Ibn Ezra, Chizz’kuni, and Sforno all agreed that this verse refers to women who had cast away their jewelry in order to devote themselves to God. They came to the Tent of Meeting to pray and hear either “words of the living God” (Sforno), the praises of God pronounced by the priests (Chizz’kuni), or words of <i>mitzvot</i> (commandments) (Ibn Ezra). By donating their mirrors they also renounced personal vanity. Ibn Ezra explained that the reference to their gathering at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting indicated that there was a large group of such women.
Rashi explained the significance of the mirrors through a midrashic tradition, in which Moses first rejected the mirrors, angry that objects associated with vanity and the Evil Inclination would be used in constructing something holy. But God told Moses to accept the mirrors because the Israelite women had used them for a most holy purpose during their enslavement in Egypt: when Pharaoh decreed that the men could not return home from the fields at the end of the day, the women went out to the fields, bringing their husbands hot food and drink. After their husbands had eaten, each women pulled out her mirror and held it up to catch the image of her husband’s face together with her own. “I am more beautiful than you,” she flirted with him. In this way, God explained, the women awakened desire in their exhausted husbands and ensured the Israelites a future generation of children. BT <i>Sotah</i> 11b cites this midrash along with other examples of women’s contributions to Israel’s survival and redemption, stating that it was on account of the righteousness of the women during the generations of slavery that the Israelites were taken out of Egypt.

 <i><b>Now Bezalel, son of Uri son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah, had made all that יהוה had commanded Moses</b></i> (38:22). Although no women are mentioned in Bezalel’s genealogy, rabbinic tradition connected him with Moses’ sister Miriam. Hur’s father was Caleb, and Caleb’s wife was Ephrath (I Chronicles 2:19). But Midrash <i>Sh’mot Rabbah</i> 1.13 and 1.17 suggested that Ephrath was, in fact, another name for Miriam—who was also identified with Puah, one of the heroic midwives of Exodus 1. All of these conflated identities combined to make Miriam the great-grandmother of Bezalel. According to <i>Sh’mot Rabbah</i> 48.4, Miriam was not only Bezalel’s great-grandmother; she was also the source of his inspiration. As one of the two midwives who saved the Israelite infants, Miriam was rewarded with special access to wisdom. This midrashic tradition is based on the biblical statement that God “established households [literally: houses]” for the midwives (1:21); according to the Rabbis, Miriam’s house was the house of wisdom. Since Bezalel, too, is associated with wisdom (35:31), the Rabbis assumed that the source of his special knowledge must have been Miriam. Thus, women played key roles at both the beginning and the conclusion of the book of Exodus: Moses could not have been saved without the ingenuity and bravery of women—including the midwives, his mother and sister, and Pharaoh’s daughter—nor could the Tabernacle have been built without the wisdom that Miriam bequeathed to Bezalel.
<i><b>Then they brought the Tabernacle to Moses</b></i> (39:33). For the Rabbis, the establishment of the Tabernacle represented the culmination of Israel’s relationship with God. In a metaphor often found in rabbinic literature, <i>Sh’mot Rabbah</i> 52.5 invokes the relationship between a man and a woman to reflect upon the bond between God and Israel. However, while most such interpretations envisioned a marital relationship in which God was imagined as the husband and Israel as the wife, here we see something different. Based on Song of Songs 3:11, “O maidens of Zion, go forth / And gaze upon King Solomon / Wearing the crown that his mother / Gave him on his wedding day, / On his day of bliss,” Rabbi Eleazar ben Rabbi Yose suggested that God first loved Israel like a father loves his daughter, and then, as God’s love increased, like a man loves his sister. Finally, God’s love for Israel reached the point where it was like the love a man has for his mother. Thus, each successive example represented a more intense love, including this striking idealization of the relationship between mother and son. Rabbi Eleazar then offered an interpretation based on the marital relationship; he concluded with a reflection on the destruction of the Temple and the promise that God would rebuild Jerusalem. Here, the proof text is Isaiah 51:3, and the image is of God comforting Zion in a time when “joy and gladness are found, thanksgiving and the strains of song.” Ultimately, we learn from this midrash that when we read about the Tabernacle, we are to imagine both its destruction and its ultimate rebuilding. Above all, we are to remember that the loving and intimate relationship between God and Israel—whichever relational imagery we use—remains intact.
<i><b>In the first month…on the first of the month, the Tabernacle was set up</b></i> (40:17). The rabbinic association of women with Rosh Chodesh, the celebration of the New Moon and the beginning of a month, has become well known. The usual explanation is that Rosh Chodesh was a reward for the Israelite women’s refusal to contribute their jewelry to the making of the Golden Calf (Midrash <i>Pirkei D’Rabbi Eliezer</i> 45). However, another rabbinic tradition also links women with Rosh Chodesh via the erection of the Tabernacle. As we read in this verse, the Tabernacle was erected on the first day of the first month, namely, Rosh Chodesh Nisan. According to the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> and its commentaries (<i>Orach Chaim</i> 417.1), this day was the original women’s holiday, from which the idea of Rosh Chodesh arose. Women were connected with the erection of the Tabernacle because they were the first to contribute when the Tabernacle was being built (Nachmanides on 35:22). Women’s support of the Tabernacle strengthens the significance of their earlier refusal to contribute to the Golden Calf: it indicates that women are able to discern when a cause is worthy of their generosity.

Vayikra

<b>יהוה</b> <i><b>called to Moses</b></i> (1:1). Midrash <i>Vayikra Rabbah</i> 7.3 addresses the custom of beginning children’s education with the book of Leviticus, asking why study commences with Leviticus instead of Genesis. The response is that “children are pure and the sacrifices [described in Leviticus] are pure; let those who are pure study that which is pure.”
<b>יהוה <i>called to Moses</i></b> (1:1). “<i>Vayikra</i>,” the opening word of Leviticus, ends with an <i>alef</i> that in Torah scrolls is inscribed smaller than the other letters in the word. A number of commentators seek a reason for this. One argues that the small <i>alef</i> recalls the word <i>adam</i> (human being), and reminds individuals to “make themselves small,” that is, to avoid arrogance. Another sees a play on the word <i>aluf</i> (leader), spelled using the same letters as the word <i>alef:</i> Moses, who was extremely close to God, maintained his humility. A third commentator explains that the Torah does not include an exhortation to be humble because were humility to be commanded, it would no longer be humility. Rather, the commentator concludes, every person should cultivate true humility <i>(Itturei Torah</i> on Leviticus 1:1, IV, 1998, pp. 7–8).
Several commentators note that this is the only time in the Torah that the verb “to call” precedes the verb “to speak.” They point out that at the end of Exodus, Moses was unable to enter the Tent of Meeting when the cloud symbolizing God’s presence descended (40:35). <i>Vayikra</i> begins with God’s call to Moses, indicating that Moses had achieved permission to come before the divine Presence (Rashi and Rashbam on 1:1).
<b><i>from the Tent of Meeting</i></b> (1:1). One rabbi notes that until now, God had spoken to Moses in open places—such as the burning bush in the wilderness, Midian, and Sinai, where God’s presence was public and without bounds. Thus “a (lowly) maidservant saw at the Sea of Reeds what even the prophet Ezekiel was not privileged to see.” However, once the Tent of Meeting was erected, God chose concealment over openness. This is a sign of divine modesty, since what is private is seen by God as more precious <i>(Itturei Torah</i> on 1:1, IV, p. 8). According to Midrash <i>Tanchuma, Vayikra</i> 4 (ed. Buber, II, p. 475), God chose to leave the high heavens and descend to the earth, to the Tent of Meeting, for love of Israel.
<b><i>When any of you presents an offering…to</i> יהוה</b> (1:2). This portion discusses a variety of ritual sacrifices. A number of interpreters take this opportunity to consider “sacrifice” in a broader, less material sense. Remarking on the Hebrew word for “presents an offering” (<i>yakriv),</i> one commentator says, “When we want to draw close (<i>I’hitkarev)</i> to God, we must offer something of our own, that is, our ‘evil inclination.’” Another suggests that this verse calls upon individuals to offer God their innermost strength and will, to submit to God, and to dedicate all of their acts to the service of God <i>(Itturei Torah</i> on Leviticus 1:2, IV, p. 10).
One commentator on this verse cites BT <i>Kiddushin</i> 40b, “Those individuals who perform a single mitzvah draw themselves and the entire world toward righteousness.” Responding to the mixing of the singular and the plural verb forms in Leviticus 1:2, another interpretation urges that we each acknowledge that we realize our full potential through our bonds to the community of Israel <i>(Itturei Torah</i> on 1:2, IV, p. 11).
<b><i>You shall lay a hand upon the head of the burnt offering</i></b> (1:4). While the Rabbis exempted women from the legal obligation to lay hands upon one’s burnt offering, some rabbis permitted them to participate in this mitzvah “if they choose” (BT <i>Rosh Ha-Shanah</i> 33a; <i>Vayikra Rabbah</i> 1.7). This view is one of those cited within the contemporary halachic community in support of expanding women’s roles in ritual.
<b><i>The bull shall be slaughtered…and Aaron’s sons, the priests, shall offer the blood</i></b> (1:5). The first verb of this verse is impersonal, and it mentions the priests only after the animal has been killed. Citing these details of wording, the Rabbis validated animal slaughter by any lay person—male or female—whether for a sacrificial offering or for purely human consumption (Midrash <i>Sifra</i>; BT <i>Z’vachim</i> 32a; see also Mishnah <i>Z’vachim</i> 3:1, <i>Chulin</i> 1:1). Late medieval historical sources document that Jewish women were slaughtering animals for kosher meat (<i>sh’chitah)</i> in various parts of Europe as a matter of course; in Italy, they did so from at least the Renaissance into the 20th century.
<b><i>When a person presents an offering of meal to</i> יהוה</b> (2:1). Midrash <i>Tanchuma, Vayikra</i> 5 (ed. Buber, p. 475) notes that this is the only instance in the prolonged discussion of sacrifices in which the word for “person” is <i>nefesh</i> instead of <i>ish</i> (man) or <i>adam</i> (human being). The midrash says that the meal offering is a poor person’s donation, brought by an individual who cannot afford to present an animal or bird sacrifice. According to this view, God responds to the offering of the poor “as if that individual had offered his or her own life <i>(nefesh).”</i>
<i>—Dvora E. Weisberg</i>

Tzav

<b><i>This is the ritual of the burnt offering</i></b> (6:2). The Rabbis understood the burnt offering as a sacrifice brought for sins of the heart or mind, <i>hirhur halev</i>. According to <i>Vayikra Rabbah</i> 7.3, this notion was derived from Job’s explanation of his burnt offerings on behalf of his children, when he said, “Perhaps my children have sinned and blasphemed God in their thoughts” (Job 1:5). In an ongoing midrashic discussion as to which sacrifice is divinely preferred, <i>Vayikra Rabbah</i> 7.4 maintains that God favors the burnt offering because it is the only sacrifice that remains on the altar at night as well as during the day. A parable compares the situation to that of a king traveling in the desert. He stops first at one inn and eats and drinks, and then at another inn where he not only eats and drinks but also stays overnight, showing that he favors the latter. Conversely, <i>Vayikra Rabbah</i> 3 argues that God most esteems the meal offering because of its association with poverty.
<i><b>He shall then take off his vestments</b></i> (6:4). The medieval commentator Rashi explains that this verse is a lesson in etiquette <i>(derech eretz),</i> teaching that a servant should change clothes between preparing food and serving it.
<i><b>One who offers it for thanksgiving</b></i> (7:12). <i>Vayikra Rabbah</i> 9.4 asserts that God favors the thanksgiving offering because it is a freewill offering, rather than an obligatory one brought for the expiation of a sin. According to the Rabbis, the thanksgiving offering is the only sacrifice that will remain in the world-to come <i>(Vayikra Rabbah</i> 9.7). Rashi comments on this verse (based on BT <i>B’rachot</i> 54b) that the thanksgiving offering is an appropriate response to the following “miraculous” deliverances: a safe journey across an ocean or desert, release from imprisonment, and recovery from a serious illness.
<i><b>Such are the rituals of the burnt offering…and the sacrifice of well-being</b></i> (7:37). <i>Vayikra Rabbah</i> 9.9 suggests that the sacrifice of well-being, the <i>sh’lamim,</i> is last in this list of sacrifices because of the importance of <i>shalom,</i> peace, a theme which also appears at the end of many prayers. The Midrash lists a number of examples where the value of peace is deemed higher than the value of truth. Many of these situations involve women and endorse the value of peace in marriage. The most famous biblical example is that of Sarah and Abraham: When Sarah laughs at the possibility of conceiving a child, she says that it is impossible because of her husband’s age. However, when God repeats Sarah’s words to Abraham, God reports only that she complained of her own age (Genesis 18). This “lie” is understood by the Rabbis as a sign of the greater importance of marital harmony over truth. A story is also told about Rabbi Meir and a woman who came to hear him preach one Friday night and ended up staying so late that she angered her husband. When her husband swore that she must spit in Rabbi Meir’s face, Rabbi Meir miraculously understood this and pretended that he needed her to spit in his face for medical reasons, thereby restoring marital harmony (also <i>Sifrei B’midbar</i> 42; <i>B’reishit Rabbah</i> 48).
<i><b>Take Aaron</b></i> (8:2). The Rabbis connect this “taking” of Aaron for his priestly duties with another biblical use of the word “taking” with respect to Aaron—his taking of the people’s gold and silver to make the Golden Calf in Exodus 32:4. As <i>Vayikra Rabbah</i> 10.4 puts it, “Let this ‘taking’ come and atone for that ‘taking.’”
<i><b>anointing oil.</b> Vayikra Rabbah</i> 10.8 relates that the original 12 <i>logs</i> of oil (72 rabbinic “eggs’” worth) prepared by Moses miraculously sufficed not only to anoint the sanctuary and its vessels, and Aaron and his sons on each of the seven days of the sanctuary’s consecration, but also to anoint future generations of high priests and kings.
<i><b>You shall remain at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting day and night for seven days, keeping</b></i> יהוה<i><b>’s charge</b></i> (8:35). Midrash <i>Tanchuma</i> connects this seven-day seclusion of the priests to the customary seven days of mourning after a family member’s death: Aaron was unknowingly in mourning for the future death of his two oldest sons on the eighth day—the day of the final consecration of the Tabernacle (see the next parashah). Aaron’s period of pre-mourning is compared to the pre-mourning that God is said to have done for seven days prior to the Flood <i>(Tanchuma,</i> ed. Buber II, 21–22).

Shmini

<i><b>a spring or cistern in which water is collected shall be pure</b></i> (11:35–36). The biblical phrase “a cistern in which water is collected” (<i>mikvei-mayim</i>) provides the foundation for rabbinic justifications for required immersion in the <i>mikveh</i>, the ritual bathing pool. This phrase, <i>mikvei-mayim</i>, referring to an accumulation of water, also appears in Genesis 1:10 and Exodus 7:19. The Bible does not use the word <i>mikveh</i> by itself except in the form of a variant (<i>mikvah</i>) in Isaiah 22:11. There is no biblical reference to the legislated use of such pools or cisterns for ritual immersion. Since no ritual baths from the time of the First Temple have been found, scholars do not know how the earliest Israelites conducted the purifying washings that are mentioned in such places as Leviticus 15.
The Rabbis inherited from the Torah a ritual purity system that had involved both priests and laity, and both women and men; those sages assumed that the biblical commandments for ritual purification required full immersion in a <i>mikveh</i> (plural, <i>mikva’ot).</i> In biblical times, however, ritual washing could have been achieved instead by splashing, pouring (affusion), or rinsing. The range of available strategies is illustrated in Greek red- and black-figure pottery from the 6th century <small>B. C.E.</small> onward, where scenes depict men or women showering from spigots in a slightly stooped but standing position, using tubs and basins, or having water from large jugs poured upon them while in a crouched position. Neighboring Near Eastern cultures also had a variety of forms of purification, and there is no reason to think that uniformity was the rule in ancient Israel as well. When rabbinic Judaism eventually emerged as the dominant form of Jewish practice, however, the <i>mikveh</i> would become the only acceptable type of installation for ritual immersion.
Archeologists have found numerous ritual bathing pools that Jews constructed during the Second Temple period (some two thousand years ago), indicating their practice of full bodily immersion. Since stored rainwater was always a scarce commodity, Jews utilized water diverted from caves, springs, and rivers whenever possible in building ritual baths. The most common use of such <i>mikva’ot</i> during this era was purification prior to entering the area of the Temple. Rabbinic sources indicate that the Jewish court <i>(beit din</i>) supervised the construction, validity, measurements, and cleanliness of these <i>mikva’ot.</i> During Second Temple times, however, it appears that Jews had not achieved uniformity of opinion as to <i>mikveh</i> requirements: the pools found do not all adhere to the same configurations, and surviving texts reveal doctrinal differences.
<i>Mikva’ot</i> is the sixth tractate in the order <i>T’harot</i> (Purities) of the Mishnah. It discusses the characteristics of a valid <i>mikveh,</i> various ways of constructing a <i>mikveh,</i> and the nature and sources of the water necessary for a valid <i>mikveh.</i> This tractate also explains what constitutes valid immersion.
According to tractate <i>Mikva’ot</i> and other rabbinic sources, a <i>mikveh</i> must be hewn out of rock or built into the ground; it must also be made watertight, usually with plaster, since any leakage invalidates it. A ritual bath must contain a minimum of forty <i>se’ahs</i> (at least two hundred gallons, or more than 750 liters) of free-flowing clean water, sufficient for full immersion either vertically or horizontally. Rain or spring water is valid, as is water diverted from a river, lake, or ocean. Once a <i>mikveh</i> contains the minimum quantity of valid water, drawn water of any amount may be added.
Most biblical laws of ritual purity lapsed with the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 <small>C. E.</small> Since that time, the <i>mikveh</i> has been used most frequently by women. They immerse on a variety of occasions: prior to marriage, at a specified time in each menstrual cycle, and following the birth of children. Traditionally, <i>mikveh</i> immersion is part of conversion to Judaism. Some authorities have encouraged men to immerse in a <i>mikveh</i> on the eve of the Sabbath and festivals. In accordance with Numbers 31:22–23, some Jews also immerse in the <i>mikveh</i> their new metal and glass vessels and vessels purchased from non-Jews.
Rabbinic efforts to justify immersion indicate that the rationale was secondary to the practice. Midrash <i>Sifra</i> connects the ritual immersion of a vessel to another requirement for purification, namely, waiting for the sun to set. The midrash states that just as purification is linked to the <i>simultaneous</i> setting of the entire sun, so purification should be understood to refer to <i>simultaneous</i> immersion of the entire vessel <i>(Sh’mini</i> 8).

Tazria

<i><b>a woman at childbirth</b></i> (12:2). The literal meaning of the word <i>tazria</i>, translated here as “at childbirth,” is that the woman “produces seed.” The talmudic rabbis—who had much to say about matters of conception, pregnancy, the formation of the embryo, and birth—played upon such a reading when some of them held that both woman and man can emit “seed.” A statement in the Talmud, frequently repeated in medieval biblical commentaries, asserts that “if the woman emits her ‘seed’ first, she bears a male child; if the man emits his seed [semen] first, she bears a female child” (BT <i>Niddah</i> 25b, 28a, 31a; BT <i>B’rachot</i> 60a). Presumably this comment models female genital secretions after the male seminal emission. Among other proofs, the Rabbis cite the language in this verse (BT <i>Niddah</i> 31a). Based on this theory, some rabbis speculated on how men should conduct their sexual lives in order to produce offspring of the desired gender. These suggestions were later anthologized in the mystically inspired medieval sex manual <i>The Holy Letter.</i> Another area of rabbinic interest was the genetic material from which the embryo is made. One opinion in the Talmud suggests that “there are three partners in [the procreation of] a person: the blessed Holy One, the father, and the mother” (BT <i>Niddah</i> 31a). The father is said to supply the seed (<i>mazria</i>) of the body’s white substances, such as bones, sinews, nails, the brain, and the white of the eye. The mother supplies the seed (<i>mazraat)</i> of what the Rabbis consider to be the red substances, such as skin, flesh, blood, and the pupil of the eye. And God gives the child its breath, along with beauty of feature, eyesight, the powers of hearing and speaking, the ability to walk, and intellectual capabilities.
<i><b>If she bears a female, she shall be impure two weeks</b></i> (12:5). Like modern commentators, the talmudic rabbis were puzzled by the doubling of the mother’s status of ritual impurity following the birth of a daughter. Mishnah <i>Niddah</i> 3:7 touches on this question in a rabbinic disagreement about embryology. According to the opinion of Rabbi Ishmael, the male embryo is fully fashioned after forty-one days, while the female embryo requires eighty-one days. The Talmud suggests that Rabbi Ishmael deduces these numbers from our verse: 7 plus 33 days for a male embryo, completed on the forty-first day; and 14 plus 66 days for a female embryo, completed on the eighty-first day. (Early Greek scholars, such as Aristotle and Hippocrates, also assumed a slower development of the female embryo.) However, a majority of rabbis in this debate disagree and affirm the equal development of male and female embryos at forty-one days. Elsewhere, the Talmud (BT <i>B’rachot</i> 60a) considers whether, if the sex of the child is already determined at conception, it would be useful during the first forty days of a woman’s pregnancy to pray that the child be male. According to Mishnah <i>B’rachot</i> 9:3, a prayer for a male baby at any point during pregnancy is to be considered “a vain prayer”; the Talmud, however, suggests that it may avail in certain circumstances if it is made in the first forty days of pregnancy.
<i><b>she shall bring…a purgation offering</b></i> (12:6). Again, the rabbis of the Talmud wondered why the postpartum woman should have to bring a <i>chatat</i>-offering to the priest and why he would need to make expiation on her behalf. While modern translations and commentaries usually construe this particular <i>chatat</i>-offering as unrelated to prior sin, the Rabbis did not easily dismiss the usual connection of the <i>chatat-</i>offering with sin (see 4:1–5:13), even in the context of birth. As one tradition has it: “Rabbi Simeon ben Yohai was asked by his disciples: Why did the Torah ordain that a woman after childbirth should bring a sacrifice? He replied: When she kneels in bearing she swears spontaneously that she will have no more sex with her husband. The Torah, therefore ordained that she should bring a sacrifice” (BT <i>Niddah</i> 31b). This prompts some talmudic rabbis to a somewhat farfetched explanation for the double length of the mother’s impurity following the birth of a female child (see 12:5), based on the social attitudes of Jewish antiquity: They suggest that since everyone is happy about the birth of the boy, the mother quickly regrets her oath made while she was suffering the pains of labor; however, for a girl, whose birth prompts little celebration, regret at the oath does not set in for fourteen days (BT <i>Niddah</i> 31b). Elsewhere, however, the Talmud (BT <i>K’ritot</i> 26a) denies that the <i>chatat-</i>offering expiates the mother’s supposed sin of an unintended oath, and instead emphasizes its purifying function, thus anticipating contemporary commentators.

Metzora

<b><i>This shall be the ritual for a leper</i></b> (14:2). In BT <i>Arachin</i> 15b the Rabbis interpreted this biblical word for “leper” (<i>m’tzora</i>, the person afflicted with <i>tzaraat</i>) as an acronym for the Hebrew term for slander (<i>motzi shem ra</i>). Thus, they insisted that <i>tzaraat</i> is a divine punishment for defaming others, a grave transgression in a culture that highly valued oral communication (BT <i>Bava M’tzia</i> 58a). The connection between slander and <i>tzaraat</i> already appears in Numbers 12 when Miriam is afflicted for complaining about her brother Moses. In Midrash <i>Sifra, M’tzora</i> 5.7, the Rabbis emphasize that Miriam’s contraction of <i>tzaraat</i> (Numbers 12:10) was the result of her denunciation of Moses, particularly because she slandered him behind his back.
<b><i>When…I inflict an eruptive plague upon a house</i></b> (14:34). From early on, the Rabbis held that the house afflicted by this strange plague never existed and never will exist—and that the only reason that this law exists is for the purpose of theoretical study (Tosefta <i>N’gaim</i> 6:1). The Talmud does not develop the Mishnah tractate devoted to the topic.
<b><i>he shall…bathe his body in fresh water</i></b> (15:13). Heb. <i>mayim chayim</i> (“fresh water,” literally “living water”) is required as a means of purification not only for the man with a discharge but also in the case of <i>tzaraat</i> for both people and houses (14:5–6, 50–52), and in the case of corpse impurity (Numbers 19:8). All of these cases of ritual impurity last for at least seven days. However, the Torah notably does not mention the requirement of immersion in water for cases of impurity of similar duration that are specific to women, such as those resulting from birth, menstruation, or irregular genital bleeding. The Mishnah assumes that immersion in fresh water applies to women’s impurities as well (<i>Mikvaot</i> 1:8).
<b><i>When a woman has a discharge</i></b> (15:19). This passage establishes the rules of purification concerning a woman’s menstrual period. The Rabbis developed these regulations into an entire tractate called <i>Niddah,</i> the “menstruating woman,” which is part of the mishnaic order called <i>Purities.</i> Much like the priestly writers of Leviticus, the Rabbis did not consider purity and impurity a matter of morality, but rather a matter of ritual status with regard to access to the Temple in Jerusalem. Thus, many of the rules of purity and impurity detailed in the biblical passage here and in Mishnah <i>Niddah</i> had no application in a post-Temple reality. However, the rules of sexual abstinence during the wife’s menstrual period, which the Rabbis derived from Leviticus 18:19 and 20:18, are not dependent on the historical existence of the Temple and continue to regulate the sex life of married couples in traditional Jewish communities to this day. Indeed, many of the rabbinic discussions in BT <i>Niddah</i> focus on the workings of menstruation and on women’s physiology in general, instituting the rabbinic sage as a sort of gynecological expert to be consulted when problems arise.
<b><i>a discharge of blood for many days</i></b> (15:25). The Torah assumes a menstrual calendar of seven days of bleeding. It considers any bleeding beyond seven days or outside of the seven regular days to be abnormal. It categorizes a woman with an irregular discharge as a <i>zavah,</i> parallel to the male category of <i>zav</i> (15:13). In a tractate called <i>Zavim,</i> the Mishnah discusses both men and women with irregular genital discharges. In biblical law, the rules of purification for the <i>zavah</i> differ from the rules for menstruation. Notably, the afflicted woman must count seven days after the irregular discharge has ceased before purification can take place. The Talmud, however, merges the two categories of regular and irregular bleeding. Accordingly, a woman is to count seven “white” days without discharge after her menses before she immerses in a <i>mikveh</i> and resumes marital intimacy. The Talmud famously attributes this more stringent practice to women: “Rabbi Zera said: The daughters of Israel (<i>b’not Yisrael)</i> have imposed upon themselves the stringency that even where they observe only a drop of blood the size of a mustard seed, they wait on account of it seven clean days” (BT <i>Niddah</i> 66a). One should not dismiss Rabbi Zera’s attribution of this legal stringency to women too readily, considering that throughout Jewish history women have used the laws of <i>niddah</i> toward their own spiritual empowerment, as well as for practical purposes, including control over their sex lives.

Achrei Mot

 <b><i>Thus only shall Aaron enter the Shrine</i></b> (16:3). According to Midrash <i>Vayikra Rabbah</i> 21.11, the three animals sacrificed on the Day of Atonement together evoke the merits of the patriarchs who will intercede on Israel’s behalf. Thus, the bull represents Abraham, who prepared a calf for his visitors (Genesis 18:7), while the ram stands for Isaac, in whose place a ram was sacrificed (22:13). The two goats recall Jacob, who deceived Isaac into giving him Esau’s blessing with goat meat and skins (27:9–29). According to the Rabbis, the high priest also calls upon the merit of the matriarchs in 16:4, when he replaces his usual ornate vestments with four linen garments (tunic, breeches, sash, and turban), one for each Mother of Israel.
<b><i>Aaron is…to make expiation for himself and for his household</i></b> (16:6). According to rabbinic law, the high priest who officiates on the Day of Atonement must be married. The Hebrew word <i>beito</i> (“his household,” literally “his house”) is said to mean “his wife.” In Mishnah <i>Yoma</i> 1:1, Rabbi Yehudah suggests that a “back-up” wife must be prepared for the high priest—lest something happen to the first and the priest be disqualified. Other Rabbis respond, however, “If so, there would be no end to the matter!” JT <i>Yoma</i> 1:1 and BT <i>Yoma</i> 13a–b (also Midrash <i>Sifra, Acharei Mot</i> 8.6), consider the possibility that the high priest is <i>forbidden</i> to have more than one wife, noting that the verse demands that he atone for his “house,” in the singular.
<i><b>For the life of all flesh—its blood is its life</b></i> (17:14). Discussing this verse, the 13th-century commentator Nachmanides notes that the relationship between life (<i>nefesh)</i> and blood <i>(dam)</i> is referred to three times in this unit. According to 17:11, the life is “in” the blood <i>(ki nefesh habasar b’dam hi)</i> while the beginning of 17:14 teaches that the blood is “in” the life <i>(ki nefesh kol basar damo b’nafsho hu).</i> Using the analogy of wine mixed with water, Nachmanides suggests that one can equally say that the water is “in” the wine or the wine is “in” the water. Thus, the end of v. 14 states that the life “is” the blood <i>(ki nefesh kol-basar damo hu).</i> Ultimately, he claims, the two are inseparable; one cannot be found without the other.
<i><b>None of you men shall come near anyone of his own flesh to uncover nakedness</b></i> (18:6). Translated hyperliterally, this verse reads, “A man, a man <i>(ish ish),</i> to any of his near flesh, you (plural) shall not come near <i>(lo tikr’vu).”</i> Although one might think that these incest prohibitions are directed only at men, the <i>Sifra (Acharei Mot</i> 13.1) explains that the verse applies to everyone: the repetition of “man” <i>(ish)</i> is said to include non-Jews, while the second-person plural <i>(tikr’vu)</i> includes women.
<i><b>Do not uncover the nakedness of a woman and her daughter; nor shall you marry her son’s daughter or her daughter’s daughter</b></i> (18:17). Mishnah <i>Sanhedrin</i> 9:1 makes clear that although the Torah in this passage does not explicitly mention incestuous relations with a daughter or step-daughter, it prohibits such relations as well, and deems them punishable by death. The Talmud points to this verse as the source for these prohibitions (JT <i>Sanhedrin</i> 9:1, BT <i>Sanhedrin</i> 76a). The Rabbis understood this verse to prohibit a man from sexual relations with a woman when he is <i>married</i> to her daughter or to her mother (based on the parallel verse in Leviticus 20:14, which forbids a man from <i>marrying</i> a mother and daughter). Thus, a man’s sexual connection with his own daughter by his wife or with his wife’s daughter by another man also means that he has violated this prohibition. As for incest between a man and his daughter by a woman to whom he was not married, the Rabbis derived the prohibition by logical inference: since this verse (and similarly in v. 10) forbids relations with a granddaughter, then all the more so it must forbid relations with a daughter.
<i><b>Do not marry a woman as a rival to her sister</b></i> (18:18). In his commentary on this verse, Nachmanides observes that sisters should not be rivals since they are meant to love each other. In their interpretations, Rashi and Sforno both note that following his wife’s death, a husband may marry her surviving sister. According to BT <i>P’sachim</i> 119b, at the end of days God will reward the righteous with a great banquet. The patriarch Jacob will decline the honor of leading the blessings after the meal, because his marriages to Leah and Rachel violated this prohibition.

Kedoshim

 <b><i>You shall be holy</i></b> (19:1). Commentators have been challenged by the interweaving of ritual and civil commandments in <i>parashat K’doshim</i>. Observing that both Leviticus 18 and 20 list prohibited sexual partners, Rashi suggests that 19:1 teaches that separating ourselves from forbidden sexual relations and transgressions is the path to holiness, “for every place (in the Torah) you find instruction to fence yourself in against such relations, you also find mention of holiness.” Nachmanides views this verse as commanding moderation in satisfying physical urges such as eating, drinking, and sexual relations.
<i><b>Do not deal basely with members of your people</b></i> (19:16). The Rabbis identify these words as the source for the prohibition against <i>l’shon hara</i> (evil speech or gossip). Even if what we are saying is true, if it is negative and the person is not present to defend herself, it is prohibited (Maimonides, <i>Mishneh Torah, Hilchot De’ot 7.2).</i> The Talmud teaches that <i>l’shon hara</i> kills three parties: the person speaking, the person listening, and the person against whom the comment is being made (BT <i>Arachin</i> 15b–16a).
<i><b>Reprove your kin…incur no guilt on their account</b></i> (19:17). The double verb in the command <i>hochei-ach tochi-ach</i> (whose plain sense is: “you shall [<i>surely</i>] reprove”) has inspired much commentary. According to BT <i>Arachin</i> 16b, the first part of this verse teaches that when someone has done something offensive, confrontation is essential. While many people might hesitate out of fear of stirring up conflict and resentment, Midrash <i>B’reishit Rabbah</i> 54.3 urges confrontation as a way to improve understanding and increase caring. BT <i>Arachin</i> 16b also suggests that the command to rebuke is doubled in order to teach us that when we do confront the offending individuals, if they do not correct their behavior we must go back and confront them again. But—the Talmud continues—we must not embarrass such persons, making sure that we “incur no guilt on their account.” Rashi advises that we avoid causing embarrassment by making sure not to confront others in public.
In BT <i>Bava M’tzia</i> 31a, Rava teaches that the Torah’s double verb in the command means that we must rebuke even an authority figure, such as a teacher, parent, or employer. Ibn Ezra comments that confrontation can clear up misunderstandings and obviate resentment or even hatred. BT <i>Shabbat</i> 54b insists that we speak out to prevent wrongdoing; failing to do so leaves us partly responsible for injustice, whether in our family, our community, or even the world at large. Our sources are divided on what to do about the person who will not listen. BT <i>Shabbat</i> 55a suggests that only God really knows how a person will respond, and so we are <i>always</i> obligated to confront the person who is doing something wrong.
<i><b>Love your fellow</b></i> [<b><i>Israelite</i></b>] <b><i>as yourself</i></b> (19:18). Rabbi Akiba said that this is the most important teaching in the Torah. For Ibn Ezra, this verse teaches us to treat others the way we want to be treated (so also Midrash <i>Sifra, K’doshim</i> 2.4). Other rabbis suggest we should express this love by being a good friend and neighbor, and by accepting the rebuke of others in a loving way.
<i><b>If a man lies with a male as one lies with a woman…they retain the bloodguilt</b></i> (20:13). While Rashi and others understood this verse as specifically prohibiting anal intercourse, BT <i>Sanhedrin</i> 54a-b saw it (along with 18:22) as prohibiting male homosexual acts in general. While Rabbi Judah forbade two bachelors to sleep under the same blanket, a majority of the Rabbis of the Talmud permit it (BT <i>Kiddushin</i> 82a). Maimonides agreed, stating that “Jews are not suspected of engaging in homosexual relations” (<i>Mishneh Torah, Laws of Forbidden Intercourse</i> 22.2). This disagreement persists in later codes, with some, like the <i>Shulchan Aruch,</i> counseling against two men sleeping under the same blanket.
The Rabbis limited their reading of this verse to male homosexual acts, noting that the Torah nowhere explicitly prohibits sex between two women. However, in BT <i>Y’vamot</i> 76a, Rav Huna argued that women who engage in lesbian sex cannot marry priests. Rabbi Eliezer urged leniency, on the grounds that sex between women does not involve penetration and therefore is “mere indecency.” <i>Sifra, Acharei Mot</i> 9.8, prohibits marriage between women as something done by the Egyptians that, based on Leviticus 18:3, we must not imitate. Maimonides combined these two teachings in his <i>Mishneh Torah</i> (<i>Laws of Forbidden Intercourse</i> 21.8), noting that sexual relations between women are prohibited because they are among the “ways of the Egyptians,” but that such acts are not punished with stoning or even lashes, as there is no act of penetration and the women violate no explicit biblical prohibition. A woman who has engaged in lesbian sex would be permitted to marry or stay married, even to a priest. Still, Maimonides says that such a woman should be punished with lashes for breaking a rabbinic law, and he advises husbands not to allow their wives to spend time with women known as lesbians, to avoid their being tempted to engage in sexual relations with another woman.

Emor

 <b><i>None shall defile himself</i></b> (21:1–2). These verses stipulate that <i>kohanim</i> (priests) may not come into contact with a corpse, with the exception of close relations. The Rabbis of the Talmud later applied this list of close relatives to all mourners. That is, the relatives for whom a Jew sits shivah are those enumerated in <i>Emor</i>, with the Rabbis’ additions of wives and married sisters (BT <i>Mo’ed Katan</i> 20b). The Rabbis interpreted the clause “except for the relatives that are closest (literally ‘flesh’) to him…he may defile himself” as a veiled reference to a wife (Midrash <i>Sifra, Emor</i> 1.4).
In spelling out the rabbinic definition of marriage, the Mishnah obliges a husband to bury his deceased wife—and then raises the issue of what constitutes a proper burial. One rabbi’s answer takes for granted the vital role of women professionals in public mourning: “Even the poorest husband in Israel must hire at least two flute-players and one wailing woman” (<i>K’tubot</i> 4:4).
In general, the laws of mourning treat men and women with parity. Women mourn, and are mourned, with only minor differences from men.
<i><b>A widow…such he may not marry</b></i> (21:14). The Rabbis preserved these biblical prohibitions limiting which women a man of priestly origin could marry. In fact, they went so far as to say that <i>kohanim</i> are hot-headed and sometimes divorce their wives without good reason; upon calming down, they then discover they cannot take their divorced wives back. To save <i>kohanim</i> from this predicament, the Rabbis instituted a special bill of divorce for <i>kohanim</i> that takes longer to prepare and would not be completed until the <i>kohein</i> has regained his composure. This would give him an opportunity to call off the divorce proceedings before it is too late (BT <i>Bava Batra</i> 160b).
<i><b>These are My fixed times</b></i> (23:2). Leviticus 23 provides information about the Sabbath, the New Moon, Pesach, Shavuot, New Year, Yom Kippur, and Sukkot. These verses address the people in the second person masculine plural and nowhere is there any reference to women. Thus, one must inquire: were women, too, expected to offer a paschal lamb, blow the shofar, dwell in a sukkah, refrain from work on the Sabbath and holy days, and afflict themselves on Yom Kippur?
The Rabbis answered these questions in different ways and they also discussed women’s obligations for Purim and Chanukah, two festivals that are not mentioned in the Torah. The basic premise is that women are considered responsible for obeying all of Judaism’s negative commandments and for observing most of the positive commandments, including celebrating Shabbat and the festivals. A man should cause his children and household to rejoice on a festival (BT <i>P’sachim</i> 109a). However, the Rabbis explicitly exempted women from hearing the shofar on Rosh HaShanah; dwelling in a sukkah during the Sukkot festival; waving the <i>lulav</i> on Sukkot; and counting the <i>Omer</i> between Pesach and Shavuot. Since these are all commandments to be performed at fixed times of the year, they conform to the exemption of women from time-bound commandments prescribed in Mishnah <i>Kiddushin</i> 1:7.
However, the Talmud specifically obligated women to other time-bound festival observances. These included <i>Kiddush</i> (sanctification of wine) on the Sabbath (BT <i>B’rachot</i> 20b) and, according to most authorities, on the festivals as well; kindling Sabbath and festival lights and the Chanukah lamp (BT <i>Shabbat</i> 23a); listening to <i>M’gillat Esther</i> on Purim (BT <i>M’gillah</i> 4a); and eating matzah (BT <i>P’sachim</i> 43b) and drinking four cups of wine at the Passover seder. Rabbi Joshua ben Levi justified women’s inclusion in these Chanukah (BT <i>Shabbat</i> 23a), Pesach, and Purim rituals (BT <i>M’gillah</i> 4a), on the grounds that women, too, were included in these miracles. Women, like men, are required to fast and afflict themselves in various ways on the Day of Atonement and to refrain from doing any work (BT <i>Sukkah</i> 28b); they are also obligated to observe all other mandated fast days. [In the course of the 20th century, liberal movements in Judaism fostered women’s equal participation in all aspects of festival and holiday observance and introduced a number of new rituals, some of which focus specifically on women and female experience. <i>—Ed.</i>]
<i><b>There came out…a man whose mother</b></i> (24:10). This narrative, by noting the Egyptian lineage of the father of the man who cursed God, implies that his mother was responsible for her son’s horrendous behavior because she had married an Egyptian. Some of the Rabbis disagreed and exempted her from wrong-doing, suggesting that the Egyptian man slipped into her bed unbeknownst to her, and this was why her offspring was tainted (<i>Tanchuma</i>, <i>Sh’mot</i> 9). Others said the Torah recorded her name in full because she alone behaved in a promiscuous manner, whereas the other Israelite women acted modestly and did not consort with foreign men (Midrash <i>B’midbar Rabbah</i> 20).

Behar

 <i><b>you shall not wrong one another…Do not wrong one another, but fear your God</b></i> (25:14, 17). The discussion of this passage in the midrash collection <i>Sifra</i> leads us to one of the most important passages in rabbinic literature, one in which women play central roles. The Rabbis explain the apparent repetition of the command not to oppress one’s neighbor as follows: Each verse speaks of a different kind of oppression; the oppression of v. 14 is economic oppression, while that in v. 17 is inflicted psychologically. The Tosefta repeats this interpretation in <i>Bava M’tzia</i> 3:25–29, and the Talmud deeply explores the issues in BT <i>Bava M’tzia</i> 58b–6ob. There we learn how important feelings are, and how critical it is for us not to hurt them. According to the Rabbis, the archetypal example of someone who preferred death to hurting another person’s feelings is Tamar (Genesis 38). The Rabbis maintain that rather than shame her father-in-law in public, she was willing to be burned to death. We then learn that it is especially important not to distress one’s wife (BT <i>Bava M’tzia</i> 59a and subsequently in <i>Shulchan Aruch, Choshen Mishpat</i> 228:3). A husband can easily wound his wife’s feelings because she is close to him, and he also has many opportunities to hurt her. He must therefore take proportionately more care not to do so. We learn, too, of the counter-example of Rav’s difficult marriage. Rav asserted that anyone who followed his wife’s advice would descend into <i>Geihinom</i> (the place of eternal punishment). When we examine a description of his married life, we can see why he might say this. His wife is said to have constantly tormented him and contradicted his smallest wish (BT <i>Y’vamot</i> 63a). Of course, this androcentric text does not consider how Rav’s treatment of his spouse may have contributed to such behavior.
Rav Pappa seems to have had a good marriage, since he quotes the folk saying that if one’s wife is short, one should bend down and listen to her opinion. Other teachings are likewise designed to increase marital harmony. One such teaching urges that grain always be available in the home, as lack of food is often the cause of marital strife. We learn, too, that a husband should be careful to honor his wife more than he honors himself. He should show this by dressing her in better clothes than he himself wears (BT <i>Bava M’tzia</i> 59a and subsequently in <i>Mishneh Torah, Sefer Nashim, Hilchot Ishut</i> 15:19). In the same passage, Rav Helbo asserts that blessings are found in a man’s house only on account of his wife; and Rava opines that honoring one’s wife is the road to wealth.
What follows is one of the most famous legends in all of rabbinic literature. It appears in BT <i>Bava M’tzia</i> 59b and concerns Rabbi Eliezer and his wife, Imma Shalom (which means “Mother of Peace”). Imma Shalom came from a distinguished family of Davidic heritage. Her brother was Rabban Gamliel, who, at that time, presided over the academy in which her husband, Rabbi Eliezer, was one of the greatest sages. Her husband had a strong disagreement of opinion with the rest of the academy. When they would not accept his opinion he brought all sorts of supernatural proofs that his was the correct view. Even a voice out of heaven was summoned, which duly testified that he was, in fact, right. At this, Rabbi Yehoshua, Rabbi Eliezer’s study partner, stood up and said, “The Torah is no longer in heaven” (Deuteronomy 30:12). In other words, we decide law and practice here on earth and do not take heavenly voices into account. Finally, Rabban Gamliel expelled Rabbi Eliezer from the academy, and he was excommunicated. Imma Shalom, knowing what harm her husband could do out of the pain of his humiliation, kept watch on Rabbi Eliezer day and night, so that he would not have the opportunity to pray for Rabban Gamliel’s death. One day her attention was diverted, and she saw afterward that Rabbi Eliezer was prostrated on the ground, supplicating God for succor from his hurt feelings. Seeing this, she said, “Rise. You have killed my brother!” At that moment a shofar blast was heard, signaling that Rabban Gamliel had died. Rabbi Eliezer then asked his wife, “How did you know my prayer worked, and I had killed him?” She replied, quoting learning as easily and with as much authority as her husband, “I learned it from my grandfather’s house: All the gates of heaven are locked except for the gates of hurt feelings.”

Bechukotai

 <i><b>When anyone explicitly vows to</b></i> <b>יהוה</b> (27:2). The Hebrew noun translated here as “anyone” is <i>ish,</i> which in some contexts refers only to males. This verse’s formulation contrasts with the nazirite vow in Numbers 6:2 and with the general vows and oaths in Numbers 30:3–4, which both specify also the female counterpart noun, <i>ishah,</i> as a potential oath taker (see commentaries there). Nonetheless, the Rabbis (Mishnah <i>Arachin</i> 1:1) explicate that both men and women can make the type of vow presumed by this biblical unit, implying that <i>ish</i> as used here is to be read inclusively.
In several different places, Mishnah <i>Arachin</i> records the names of women who made vows of various kinds, mostly related to their children. In the current context, it mentions the mother of a girl by the name of Yirmatia (or Domitia in a manuscript version) who vowed her daughter’s weight, although it is unclear to what purpose (5:1). Elsewhere in the Mishnah, Helena—the queen of Adiabene, a convert to Judaism who is also mentioned by the 1st-century-<small>C. E.</small> historian Josephus—is said to have vowed to become a nazirite for seven years if her son returned “in safety from the war” (Mishnah <i>Nazir</i> 3:6). Also a certain Miriam of Palmyra brings offerings to fulfill a vow related to her dying daughter (<i>Nazir</i> 6:11). Josephus further mentions that his contemporary Berenice—sister of the Jewish Herodian ruler Agrippa II, and lover of Titus (the Roman general and later emperor)—made a vow of abstention.
Nonetheless, even though women appear prominently as autonomous oath takers in rabbinic aggadic literature, halachically a woman’s oaths were subject to a father’s or husband’s annulment, much as specified already in biblical law (Numbers 30:4–17). Only widows, divorcées, or unmarried women above the age of 12½ could make vows as freely as any adult male.
<b><i>the equivalent for a human being</i></b> (27:2). Although the vows of dedication to the Temple lost their relevance after its destruction in 70 <small>C. E.</small>, the Rabbis developed the regulations outlined in Leviticus 27 into a special mishnaic tractate called <i>Arachin</i> (Valuations), derived from the biblical word translated here as “equivalent” (<i>erech).</i> Indeed, the subject of vows and oaths occupied the Rabbis greatly as they set about organizing their formulation of Jewish law. Indeed, the Mishnah devoted three additional tractates to this topic—<i>N’darim</i> (Vows), <i>Nazir</i> (Nazirite), and <i>Sh’vuot</i> (Oaths)—all of which received extensive talmudic discussion. Perhaps this indicates the popularity of oaths and vows as an expression of religiosity, extending into rabbinic times. Other evidence of this propensity is found in the words of the 4th-century Christian leader John Chrysostom of Antioch and Constantinople, known for his anti-Jewish sermons, who chastised his audience for flocking to the synagogues to take oaths.
<b><i>if it is a female, the equivalent is thirty shekels</i></b> (27:4). The scale of fixed human value established here remains uncontested and unchanged in rabbinic tradition and does not receive much further commentary. The Rabbis devoted much more attention to regulating individualized vows such as vowing someone’s weight, or even the weight of a particular body part (Mishnah <i>Arachin</i> 5:1–2). Interestingly, the Rabbis take note that the Torah differentiates between the weight of male <i>(zachar)</i> and female (<i>n’kevah</i>), and they therefore insist that this refers to those who are “definitely male” and “definitely female.” This is one of the many contexts in Jewish law where the Rabbis introduce the concept of indeterminable sexual identity, namely the hermaphrodite <i>(androginos)</i> and the nonsexed person (<i>tumtum</i>), only to exclude such people from the scale of human valuation. However, the Mishnah considers both the <i>androginos</i> and the <i>tumtum</i> fully human and therefore able to make vows of valuation on someone who is of unambiguous sexual identity <i>(Arachin</i> 1:1).
<b><i>If the age is from one month to five years, the equivalent for a male is five shekels of silver</i></b> (27:6). Numbers 18:15–16 likewise prescribe five shekels for the redemption of a month-old first-born son from the priest. Since this practice persisted in Jewish communities beyond Temple times (<i>pidyon haben</i>), the Rabbis in Mishnah <i>B’chorot</i> 8:7 attempted to determine the contemporary coinage that contained the equivalent amount of silver. The talmudic Rabbis emphasize that women are exempt from the commandment of redeeming the first-born son, just as they are not obligated to circumcise their infant sons (BT <i>Kiddushin</i> 29a).

Bamidbar

 <b>יהוה <i>spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai</i></b> (1:1). Midrash <i>B’midbar Rabbah</i> 1.2 connects this verse with Jeremiah 2:31: “O generation, behold the word of יהוה! Have I been like a wilderness to Israel?” and explains that compared to slavery in Egypt, the wilderness experience was luxurious. Furthermore, according to this midrash, God assigned three mentors to sustain Israel in the wilderness: Moses, Aaron, and Miriam. Due to the merits of Moses, the people ate manna; due to the merits of Aaron, God encircled Israel with clouds of glory; and due to the merits of Miriam, a miraculous well accompanied them. The passage continues, “How was the well constructed? It was rock-shaped like a kind of beehive, and wherever they journeyed it rolled along and came with them.” When the Israelites stopped and the portable Tabernacle was erected, the well would establish itself in the Tent of Meeting. “Then the leaders of the tribes would come and stand upon it and say, ‘Spring up, O well!’ (21:17) and it would rise.”
<b><i>The Israelites shall camp each man with his standard, under the banners of their ancestral house</i></b> (2:2). <i>B’midbar Rabbah</i> 2.7 relates that each tribe had a different colored flag, corresponding to the precious stones on Aaron’s breastplate. For example, “Reuben’s stone was ruby and the color of his flag was red, and embroidered on it were mandrakes.” (On mandrakes, see Genesis 30:14–15.) “Judah’s stone was a carbuncle and the color of his flag was something like the heavens; embroidered on it was a lion.” This midrash adds that the nations of the world provided themselves with distinctive flags based on Israel’s example.
<b><i>But Nadab and Abihu died by the will of</i> יהוה…<i>and they left no sons</i></b> (3:4). Midrash <i>P’sikta D’Rav Kahana</i> 26.9 explains that one of the reasons for the mysterious deaths of Aaron’s sons was their arrogance in refusing to marry, even though the chief priest was commanded to make atonement for himself and “his household” (Leviticus 16:6). The midrash explains that “his household” (literally “his house”) signifies “his wife” and relates that “many young women sat grieving, waiting in vain to be asked in marriage by Nadab or Abihu.” But the young men said, “Our father’s brother [Moses] is king (Deuteronomy 33:5), our mother’s brother [Nahshon] is prince (Exodus 6:23; Numbers 2:3), our father is chief priest; we are adjutants of the chief priest. What women are worthy of us?”
<b><i>So it was Eleazar and Ithamar who served as priests in the lifetime of their father Aaron</i></b> (3:4). The Rabbis were interested in how Aaron, Eleazar, and Ithamar shared their duties as priests. <i>B’midbar Rabbah</i> 2.26 reports that when one of those men was incapacitated, one of the others took on the role of chief priest in his stead. This text goes on to discuss a woman named Kimhith who lived many centuries later: she had seven sons and each of them served in the office of chief priest. On one occasion, two sons served as chief priest on the same day. The Rabbis paid her a visit and asked her, “What good deeds have you performed to merit such an honor?” She responded, “So help me Heaven! In all my life the rafters of my house have never looked upon the hair of my head.” Rabbinic society, like many surrounding cultures, believed that married women should cover their heads when they went out in public. Kimhith’s modesty was such that she did not uncover her hair, even in the privacy of her own home. Punning on her name, the Rabbis observed, “All flours (<i>kimha)</i> are flour; but the flour of Kimhith is fine flour,” and they applied to her Psalm 45:14, “All glorious is the king’s daughter within the palace,” as an indication that the domestic domain is the best place for a praiseworthy and virtuous woman.
<b><i>record every male among them</i></b> (3:15). The Rabbis asked, “Why every male, without mentioning every female?” and they responded, “Because the glory of the blessed Holy One is derived from the males.” This is proven by Psalm 127:3, “Sons are the provision of יהוה; the fruit of the womb, [God’s] reward.” The midrash explains that “provision of יהוה” refers to males, while if females come, they are also “a reward” <i>(B’midbar Rabbah</i> 3.8). Rabbinic Judaism valued males over females but recognized that women, too, have multiple virtues and are essential for human society and human continuity.

Nasso

 <i><b>When men or women individually commit any wrong</b></i> (5:6). This is one of only a few places in the Torah where a woman is mentioned as committing a wrong and being punished for it. The Rabbis of the Talmud derive from this passage the principle that men and women are to be treated alike with regard to punishment for all kinds of misbehavior (BT <i>Bava Kama</i> 15a).
<b><i>If any wife has gone astray</i></b> (5:12). This passage speaks of a woman whom her husband accuses of adultery, even though he has insufficient evidence to convict her. The Rabbis later developed Numbers 5:11–31 into an entire tractate in the Talmud, called <i>Sotah,</i> “the errant wife.” It describes in detail the ordeal that she will endure, filling in much that the Torah does not mention, but also encasing this ritual in a set of rules that transform it into an unusual and infrequent event. According to Mishnah <i>Sotah</i> 1:1, only if a husband warns his wife in advance not to seclude herself with a particular man, and only if there are witnesses to the warning and to the act of seclusion, only then may he force her to go with him to the Temple. Since such a complex sequence of events is unlikely to happen, the chances of administering this degrading ritual decrease dramatically. The Rabbis also stipulate, based on close readings of the biblical verses, that the waters would test not only the woman suspected of infidelity but also her supposed partner. They add that if a jealous husband had himself committed adultery in the past, then the waters would not be able to harm his wife (BT <i>Sotah</i> 47b).
According to Mishnah <i>Sotah</i> 9:9, this ritual was abolished toward the end of the Second Temple period. [That mishnah attributes the suspension of the ritual to Rabbi Yohanan ben Zakkai, who acted in light of a proliferation in adultery during that era. He cited the prophet Hosea to explain why it was no longer meaningful to accuse wives of unfaithfulness in an atmosphere of widespread dissipation: “I will not punish their daughters for fornicating / Nor their daughters-in-law for committing adultery; / For they themselves turn aside with whores / And sacrifice with prostitutes, / And a people that is without sense must stumble” (4:14). —<i>Ed.</i>] The Rabbis viewed the errant wife as a metaphor for the entire Jewish people, whose betrayal of God and divine commandments was understood to have led to the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 <small>C. E</small>.
<b><i>If any…women explicitly utter a nazirite’s vow</i></b> (6:2). Since a female nazirite was required to bring the sacrifice, just like a male, the Torah implies that women owned and controlled property. Mishnah <i>Nazir</i> refers to two women who took nazirite vows: Miriam of Tadmor became a nazirite to pray for her sick daughter (6:11), and Queen Helena of Adiabene, a 1st-century-<small>C. E.</small> convert to Judaism, vowed to become a nazirite for seven years if her son returned safely from war (3:6). Josephus mentions the nazirite vow of Berenice of the Herodian royal family (<i>Wars of the Jews</i> 2, 15:1). Thus, we learn that becoming a nazirite in the rabbinic period was viewed as a way of prompting God to answer one’s prayers, often on behalf of family members in difficult circumstances. Clearly, these traditions presume that women chose this option when they found themselves in situations of personal duress.
<b><i>Thus shall you bless the people of Israel</i></b> (6:23). The three-fold priestly blessing appears immediately after a number of other topics, such as the <i>sotah</i> and the nazirite, that require the involvement of priests. Women could not serve as priests and hence did not utter this blessing. Although the verses that frame the blessing appear in the plural (6:23, 27), the words of the blessing themselves are all in the singular. The priest does not himself bless the people but serves as a vehicle for transmitting God’s blessing to them. According to the talmudic sources, the main venue for the recitation of the priestly blessing was the Temple in Jerusalem, until it was destroyed in 70 <small>C. E.</small> If recited in a communal context, the blessing is addressed to the entire congregation, men and women alike.

Beha'alotcha

 <i><b>Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses</b></i> (12:1). This episode raises several concerns. God nominates male priests, male Levites, and male elders to run the enterprise of Israel, whereas women are all but absent. The only women we meet are Moses’ sister Miriam, who speaks (out of turn), and his Ethiopian wife, who is silent. In Exodus 15:20, Miriam had been designated as a prophet, and she now claims a prophetic role for herself. Yet, although Miriam and Aaron both discuss Moses’ wife, it is only Miriam who is punished for her words.
The question of God’s partial administration of justice is the only one of these issues that is explored in the Rabbis’ discourse on this parashah. The tannaitic Midrash <i>Sifrei B’midbar</i> 99 raises the inequity of Miriam’s treatment and answers with the words: “This shows that it was Miriam who first raised the issue.” That is, Miriam was responsible for initiating the critical conversation about Moses’ wife and thus was the person punished. Yet, not all the Rabbis were happy with this superficial solution. In BT <i>Shabbat 97a,</i> Rabbi Akiva argues that Aaron too was afflicted with leprosy, based on the notice in v. 9 that God was “incensed with <i>them</i>” (plural). However, this is a minority view; the general opinion in that talmudic passage is that Aaron was not similarly stricken. Another halachic midrash, <i>Sifra, M’tzora</i> 5.7, identifies <i>tzaraat</i> as the quintessential punishment for slander, and it emphasizes that Miriam’s contraction of <i>tzaraat</i> (Numbers 12:10) was the result of her denunciation of Moses, essentially because she slandered him behind his back.
The sages were also interested in solving the apparent contradiction between what we hear about Moses’ marrying an Ethiopian woman and what we know about his marriage to the Midianite woman, Zipporah (Exodus 2:21). Earlier Jewish Hellenistic literature suggested that young Moses—while still an Egyptian prince—had carried out a campaign against Ethiopia and there married an Ethiopian princess (Josephus, <i>Antiquities</i> 252–3). Yet the Rabbis do not adopt this solution. In their opinion, the Ethiopian woman is none other than Zipporah herself, and thus they need to explain why she is called Ethiopian—and why Miriam and Aaron found it necessary to speak about her. Already in <i>Sifrei B’midbar</i> 99, we learn that Miriam spoke against Moses because he had refrained from having sexual intercourse with Zipporah ever since God had begun speaking to him face to face. The Rabbis tell us that Miriam and Zipporah had been standing together when the news came that Eldad and Medad were prophesying. Zipporah remarked that she felt pity for their wives, for they would now suffer her fate, meaning that their husbands would no longer sleep with them. Miriam then said to Aaron, “Why does Moses have to behave this way? Has not God also spoken to us, and we have not refrained from sex with our spouses?” <i>(Sifrei B’midbar</i> 99). Obviously the question that bothers the Rabbis here is a contrived one, not actually found in the Bible: namely, the connection between holiness and refraining from sexual activity. It is likely that this discussion originates in rabbinic knowledge of contemporaneous non-Jewish practices that advocated celibacy of religious leaders.
If the wife that Moses took, and about whom Miriam and Aaron spoke, was actually Zipporah, the Rabbis still needed to explain why she was designated as Ethiopian. They explained that the term <i>kushit,</i> usually translated as Ethiopian or Cushite, in fact refers to exceptional beauty. Just as Ethiopians are unusual in their skin color, so was Zipporah unusual to behold (<i>Sifrei B’midbar</i> 99). This interpretation removes from the biblical text any hint of bigotry, but leaves one with the lingering feeling that Ethiopian skin color is at some level an issue.
Much of rabbinic interpretation on this episode is concerned with correct hierarchy and gender ordering. The same midrash that states that it was Miriam who initiated this conversation about Moses’ wife comments that it was unusual for her to speak to her brother Aaron before she was spoken to (<i>Sifrei B’midbar</i> 99). Another early midrash teaches that if Miriam was punished for speaking against her younger brother, one should all the more so refrain from speaking against one’s superiors (<i>Sifrei D’varim</i> 1). Midrash <i>D’varim Rabbah</i> 6.12 notices the absence of the title “prophet” here in connection with Miriam and suggests that this is a warning that slanderous talk brings about loss of status. Midrash <i>B’reishit Rabbah</i> 45.5 cites this episode to denigrate women in general as overly talkative. The import of all these texts is that women are viewed as subordinate to men and that society should endeavor to maintain men’s gender-based prerogatives.
Yet the Rabbis too are aware of Miriam’s unique status. In Mishnah <i>Sotah</i> 1:9, the notice that “the people did not march on until Miriam was readmitted” (12:15) is interpreted as proof that “a human being is treated according to how that person treats others” (Mishnah <i>Sotah</i> 1:7). Miriam herself had many years earlier waited for her infant brother Moses after his mother had set him afloat in the Nile (Exodus 2:4). For this, according to the Rabbis, she was rewarded at the end of Numbers 12, when the Israelites did not continue their march without her.
<i>—Tal Ilan</i>

Sh'lach

<i><b>Send emissaries</b></i> (13:2). A hyperliteral translation of the first three words of this verse reads, “Send for yourself men.” In his 1602 commentary, the <i>Kli Yakar</i> (Rabbi Efraim Shlomo of Luntshits, Poland) claims that while the Israelite men of the wilderness generation hated the Land of Israel, the Israelite women loved it. His proof is based on the argument that the demand of the discontented Israelites, “Let us head back for Egypt” (14:4), represents the feelings of all the men, while “Give us a holding [in the Land of Israel] among our father’s kinsmen!” (27:4)—although formally attributed only to the daughters of Zelophehad—actually represents the feelings of all of the women. Based on these generalizations, the <i>Kli Yakar</i> claims that if God had chosen the scouts, God would have selected female scouts who loved the land, in order to ensure a positive report. Instead, when Moses was given permission to choose the scouts (“for yourself”), he made the tactical error of sending men instead.
<b><i>From the tribe of Judah, Caleb son of Jephunneh</i></b> (13:6). Caleb, introduced for the first time in this verse, is identified by the names of his father and of his tribe. His wife’s name, not surprisingly, is not included here, but she is identified in the Midrash. In fact, two wives are mentioned—each in a different midrashic text—and it is unclear if the Rabbis believed that he was married to both women at the same time, or to one after the other, or whether the two teachings existed independently. The wife more commonly connected with Caleb is Miriam, the sister of Moses <i>(Sh’mot Rabbah</i> 1.17). Meanwhile, Pharaoh’s daughter, who had adopted Moses and whom rabbinic literature identifies as Bitya, is also described as Caleb’s wife (BT <i>M’gillah</i> 13a). Neither of these marriages is mentioned in the Bible, and each is derived from a complex rabbinic interpretation of different genealogical lists in the book of Chronicles (I Chronicles 2:18–19 for Miriam; I Chronicles 4:18 for Bitya).
<b><i>and you eat of the bread of the land, you shall set some aside</i></b> (15:19). This verse describes the commandment of <i>challah.</i> This commandment does not mandate the eating of special loaves of bread on Shabbat (known later in Judaism also as “challah”) but applies instead to the baking process. To perform the mitzvah of <i>challah,</i> the baker ritually removes a tiny portion of the raw dough and recites a specific blessing. When the Temple stood in Jerusalem, this consecrated portion was to be eaten by the priests. Since the destruction of the Temple in 70 <small>C. E.</small>, the piece of separated dough is to be burned in the oven and thrown away. Separating <i>challah</i> is one of three commandments that are traditionally and specifically associated with—and performed by—women. (The other two are candle lighting for Shabbat and the rituals concerning menstrual purity.)
Bread baking is usually regarded as a female activity, but it may also be seen as the exemplar of the many mundane tasks needed to provide physical nourishment for one’s family. The anonymous author of the 13th-century <i>Sefer haChinuch</i> (385:1) emphasized this latter aspect of bread baking when he suggested that the commandment of <i>challah</i> allows women to take an ordinary act and elevate it to the spiritual. While eating the bread feeds the body, the ritual aspect of making the bread feeds the soul.
Midrash <i>B’reishit Rabbah</i> 17.8, which connects the idea of <i>challah</i> with the creation of humankind, takes a less positive view of women’s fulfillment of this commandment. This midrash imagines that at the moment of human creation God removed a small portion of the newly formed earth for a special purpose, the creation of Adam. Thus, Adam became the <i>challah</i> of the world. Eve, the first woman, corrupted Adam by encouraging him to eat from the forbidden Tree of Knowledge. According to this rabbinic view, the commandment of <i>challah</i> was specifically given to women as a reminder of Eve’s sin and as a means of spiritual atonement.
[Some of the extant early modern supplicatory prayers in Yiddish (<i>tkhines</i>) were intended for women to recite while separating <i>challah.</i> These prayers refer to the ancient bringing of tithes and recall female participation in ancient Temple worship. They also invoke the messianic era when the Temple’s rites will be restored. One such supplication requests that an angel guard the baking and prevent the bread from burning, just as angels had guarded the <i>challah</i> of the biblical matriarchs (Chava Weissler, <i>Voices of the Matriarchs,</i> 1998, pp. 29–35, 68–75). <i>—Ed</i>.]

Korach

<i><b>Now Korah…betook himself</b></i> (16:1). Literally, “and Korah took” (<i>va-yikach Korach),</i> which presents a dilemma for translators and commentators since the verb lacks a direct object. What did Korah take? Midrash <i>B’midbar Rabbah</i> 18.4 explains that Korah “took” his <i>tallit</i>—and went to get advice from his wife. BT <i>Sanhedrin</i> 110a goes further and portrays Korah’s wife as playing an active role in the development of his resentment. She complains that Moses has become a king, his brother Aaron is chief priest, and Aaron’s sons are priests, while Levites such as Korah are disadvantaged in a number of ways. Moreover, she continues, Moses humiliated the Levites by ordering them to shave their entire bodies (8:7). Finally, Korah’s wife ridicules the commandment of <i>tzitzit</i> (15:37–41), which requires the presence in the fringes of <i>t’cheilet</i> (a blue thread). If blue thread is so important, she asks rhetorically, why not wear a cloak made entirely of blue thread?
Why does the Babylonian Talmud—and, by implication, <i>B’midbar Rabbah</i>—portray Korah’s wife in this negative way? Rabbi Hanokh Zundel (author of the <i>Etz Yosef</i> commentary on <i>B’midbar Rabbah)</i> hypothesized that because Dathan’s and Abiram’s wives and children were with the rebels at the fateful moment of being swallowed up (16:27), their wives must have shared their husbands’ rebellious sentiments. Presumably, Korah’s wife also agreed with Korah’s anger. Of course, in a patriarchal society, women would have had little choice but to “agree” with their husbands. Korah’s wife, however, may have had a more specific motivation: given that Korah was a first cousin of Moses and Aaron, his rebellion was a family affair—at least in part. Korah’s wife may have zealously pursued what she saw as her husband’s legitimate interests against her powerful cousins-in-law. It is also possible that the Rabbis, who often impute the worst possible motives to women, are portraying Korah’s wife as another Eve who (in rabbinic lore) is leading her innocent husband into temptation and disaster.
<i><b>On son of Peleth</b></i> (16:1). The Rabbis give us a different model of a rebel’s spouse in their construction of the wife of On son of Peleth. The Rabbis assume that On did not see the rebellion through to the end, and thus he was spared the collective punishment. This is because he is listed among the rebels in 16:1, but there is no specific mention of his death in 16:23–35 when the rebels are destroyed. In a story found in two versions <i>(B’midbar Rabbah</i> 18.20 and BT <i>Sanhedrin</i> 109b–110a), the Rabbis attribute On’s rescue to his wife. In both versions, On’s wife points out to him that the rebellion will leave him no better off: he is currently subordinate to Aaron; if the rebellion is successful, he will be subordinate to Korah. She observes to herself, “I know that all of the congregation is holy,” citing as proof Korah’s own words in 16:3. She then gets her husband drunk, puts him to bed, and sits at their front door with her hair undone and exposed. The holiness of the congregation is made manifest when the rebels approach the house to summon her husband—and withdraw immediately upon seeing her immodest appearance. By the time On awakens from his drunken sleep, the rebellion has been put down and the rebels destroyed.
In the version of this story in the Midrash <i>(B’midbar Rabbah),</i> On never speaks; we do not know if he agrees with his wife or not. We may reasonably infer that he does not; otherwise, why would she have to get him drunk to put an end to his participation in the rebellion? In the version in the Talmud, however, On appears to agree with his spouse’s assessment of his status after the rebellion. When he asks her, “What should I do?” she makes her observation about communal holiness and executes her plan to save her family from destruction.
The possible appeal to women—especially poor women—of Korah’s overall critique of the Mosaic order is illustrated differently in <i>Midrash T’hillim</i> 1:15. Korah is represented there as showing the injustice of Torah laws by pointing out their adverse impact on a widow with two daughters. Whether the poor widow wishes to plow, sow, harvest, or raise animals—Korah notes—Moses and Aaron are there to regulate how she should plow and sow, and to insist that she gives portions of her harvest and her herds to the priests. The widow, frustrated at all these restraints and exactions, ends up bereft and weeping together with her children.

Chukat

<i><b>Miriam died</b></i> (20:1). Midrash <i>Kohelet Rabbah</i> 7.4, uses this occasion to reflect upon the lives of righteous people in general, noting that when the righteous are born nobody feels the difference, but when they die, many are affected. Following Miriam’s death, for example, her well—which had provided water for the Israelites in the wilderness—ceased to exist, and everybody felt her loss (also Tosefta <i>Sotah</i> 11:10). The Bible does not mention the marvel known as Miriam’s Well. However, the earliest forms of rabbinic literature discuss how the death of each of the three leaders in the wilderness resulted in the end of a beneficial supernatural phenomenon that had assisted the Children of Israel. The supernatural qualities of Miriam’s Well include that it traveled with the nation in the wilderness (BT <i>Shabbat</i> 35a) and that it later had healing powers (Midrash <i>Vayikra Rabbah</i> 22.4). The medieval commentator Rashi explains the connection between Miriam’s death and the disappearance of the well (on BT <i>Shabbat</i> 35a) by pointing out that the subsequent verse states, “The community was without water” (20:2).
<i><b>Miriam died</b></i> (20:1). The Talmud (<i>Mo’ed Katan</i> 28a) asks, “Why is the death of Miriam juxtaposed to the portion of the <i>parah adumah</i> (the red heifer of Numbers 19)?” It then provides the answer that the ritual of the <i>parah adumah,</i> which according to the Rabbis was performed until the destruction of the Second Temple in Jerusalem (70 <small>C. E</small>.), was intended to provide atonement for specific types of sin. Therefore, the Talmud explains, the deaths of righteous people, including Miriam, have an atoning effect. This emphasis on atonement seems to stray from the biblical presentation of the <i>parah adumah</i> as a ritual purification sacrifice and ceremony. The talmudic linkage to the idea of atonement is clarified by the <i>Tosafot</i> to that passage; it states that the <i>parah adumah,</i> as described in Numbers 19, provided atonement for the sin of the Golden Calf (Exodus 32).
The theological idea that the death of Miriam, or any righteous person, enables atonement is a difficult concept for modern Jews to accept. Ours is evidently not the first generation to grapple with the notion of vicarious atonement, since it was already discussed in the 13th-century commentary of Rabbi Menachem ben Solomon Meiri. He stated that it is not the act of the righteous dying that atones for sins; rather, these deaths often move the living toward introspection and private acknowledgement of wrongdoing, which then results in personal prayer for repentance.
<i><b>Miriam died there</b></i> (20:1). A rabbinic tradition (BT <i>Baba Batra</i> 27a) states that six people did not die as ordinary mortals do. By the conventional method, as explained by the Rabbis, it is the Angel of Death who takes individuals from this world. The six who did not die in this manner experienced their deaths by God’s “kiss”—that is, their lives were taken by God directly. These six were Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, Aaron, and Miriam. The Talmud discusses the last three individuals in this list, noting that the Torah text can be said to describe Moses and Aaron’s demise explicitly as “by the kiss of” God (translated in this book as “at the command of,” but literally “by the mouth of,” Deuteronomy 34:5; Numbers 33:38). Miriam’s death “by the kiss of” God, however, is derived via a midrashic method that compares the technical language used in describing her death to the technical language used for the deaths of her brothers. The language is similar enough to imply that the details of their deaths were similar as well. After comparing these deaths, the Talmud then goes on to explain that Miriam’s death by God’s “kiss” is implicit rather than explicit, because it would be considered indelicate for her—the only woman on this list—to have been described in such a manner (BT <i>Mo’ed Katan</i> 28a).
<i><b>Spring up, O well—sing to it</b></i> (21:17). This is the beginning of the song of thanksgiving that was recited by the Israelites after God gave them water from a well in the region of Beer (sometime after Miriam’s death). Although the Torah does not mention Miriam in connection with this biblical incident, rabbinic traditions did link her to it later. One of the ancient Aramaic translations of the Torah, the <i>Targum Yerushalmi,</i> incorporates an elaboration of this verse, explaining that this well was brought forth due to the merit of Miriam. It also links her to a tradition of wells associated with other biblical figures, namely, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, Aaron, as well as other unnamed leaders.

Balak

<b><i>Balaam son of Beor</i></b> (22:5) For the Rabbis, the biblical soothsayer Balaam personified the perceived gentile evils of immorality, idolatry, and sorcery. Rabbinic literature consistently portrays the wicked Balaam as advising other nations’ kings on how to destroy Israel, iniquity noted already in Numbers 31:16 (not in this parashah). The Rabbis affirm that Balaam had great prophetic powers and the facility to bless and curse effectively. According to Midrash <i>B’midbar Rabbah</i> 14.20, God bestowed these special abilities on Balaam so that the nations of the world should not say: “Had we possessed a prophet like Moses we [too] would have worshipped the blessed Holy One.” Thus, the nations wasted their opportunity to find a way to the worship of God and could not claim that Israel had special privileges.
<i><b>While Israel was staying at Shittim</b></i> (25:1). <i>B’midbar Rabbah 20.22</i> recounts that during all the years in the wilderness, the Israelites acted virtuously; they did not commit any sexual sins until they came to Shittim. The reason for their lapse, according to the midrash, was the waters of the local spring: “Some fountains produce strong men and some weaklings, some handsome men and some ugly men, some chaste men and some men who are steeped in lewdness.” According to the Sages, this fountain of Shittim, which promoted immoral sexual behavior, was also the fountain that provided the water for Sodom. They predicted that at some future time God would cause this cursed spring to dry up and then renew it in purity, as the prophet Joel predicted, “A spring shall issue from the House of יהוה, and shall water the valley of Shittim” (Joel 4:18).
<i><b>whoring with the Moabite women</b></i> (25:1). The Rabbis recall that the Moabites were descended from the incestuous union of Lot and his older daughter (Genesis 19:33–35), following the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah. The Sages usually treat this event positively, since the two daughters believed that the rest of the world had been destroyed and they were trying to reconstitute humanity by sleeping with their father. In <i>B’midbar Rabbah</i> 20.23, however, this act of incest is cited as the beginning of a history of debauchery by the women of Moab: “Cast a staff into the air, and it will fall back to its place of origin. The one who began the harlotry in the beginning [Lot’s older daughter], finally committed it again [the Moabite women].”
<i><b>who invited the menfolk to the sacrifices for their god</b></i> (25:2). According to a number of rabbinic sources, including BT <i>Sanhedrin</i> 106a, the plot to seduce the Israelite men, which led to the deaths of 24, 000 people (25:9), was concocted by the villainous Balaam, in accordance with what Numbers 31:16 states in the next parashah. In order to ensnare Israel, Balaam advised Balak to erect stalls where old women would offer linen garments to the Israelite men. However, inside the stalls, young women offered to sell the same items for less. Having established a relationship with a particular man, the young woman would say to him: “You are now like one of the family…. Why is it that though we love you, you hate us?…. Are we not all the children of one man, Terah the father of Abraham?” She would then encourage him to drink wine, and he would desire her—as it says in the Prophets, “Harlotry, wine, and new wine destroy the mind of My people” (Hosea 4:11). At that point, the young woman would refuse to have sexual relations with the Israelite man until he had sacrificed an animal and bowed down to the local idol, Baal-peor.
<i><b>who were weeping at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting</b></i> (25:6). <i>B’midbar Rabbah</i> 20.24 suggests that Moses and the Israelite leaders were weeping because they were so shocked and disappointed at the behavior of the Israelite men who were worshiping Baal-peor. The midrash offers a parable: “It is like a king’s daughter, adorned for her wedding and sitting in her bridal litter, who was discovered in a compromising position with a stranger, and so the king and her relatives lost faith in her. It was the same with Israel. At the end of forty years they camped by the Jordan to cross over into the Land of Israel…and there they gave way to harlotry. [At this betrayal] the courage of Moses failed him, as did that of the righteous with him.”

<i><b>Cozbi daughter of Zur; he was the tribal head of an ancestral house in Midian</b></i> (25:15). As related at the end of the last parashah, Phinehas the priest killed Cozbi and her Israelite lover, Zimri, at Shittim (25:6–9). Some traditions portray the highly born Cozbi as the innocent victim of her father’s hatred for Israel. According to Midrash <i>B’midbar Rabbah</i> 21.3, Zur was so eager to ensnare the Israelites in sin (Numbers 25:1–5) that he sacrificed his own daughter, a princess, to harlotry. <i>B’midbar Rabbah</i> 20.24 relates that Zur had instructed Cozbi to have relations with no one but Moses, but Zimri convinced her that he was even higher in rank.
BT <i>Sanhedrin</i> 82a, discussing consequences for men who have sexual relations with non-Jewish women, denigrates Cozbi, a reflection of the considerable sexual anxiety the Rabbis harbored about the attractions of foreign women. Cozbi’s name is linked to <i>kazav,</i> the Hebrew word for “falsehood,” and she is castigated in the coarsest terms as a common prostitute.
This passage about Cozbi also reveals the serious problems raised for rabbinic commentators by Moses’ passivity in the face of the events at Shittim and by Phinehas’s extreme zealotry. The Rabbis explain that Zimri justified his relationship with Cozbi to Moses and the elders of Israel on the grounds that Moses had also taken a foreign consort, the Midianite Zipporah. Moses was rendered speechless by this challenge, and his great-nephew, the fervent Phinehas, had to remind him of the prohibition against cohabitation with foreign women, a law that Moses himself had taught the people when he descended from Mount Sinai. <i>B’midbar Rabbah</i> 20.24 describes how Moses’ failure to act at this moment of crisis demoralized all the Israelites except Phinehas and concludes that it was in punishment for this public weakness that Moses was buried in an unknown location. The passage concludes, “This serves to teach you that we must each be as fierce as a leopard, swift as an eagle, fleet as a hart, and strong as a lion in the performance of our Maker’s will.”
<i><b>The name of Asher’s daughter was Serah</b></i> (26:46). This statement in the tribal genealogies of Numbers 26 is startling because Serah bat Asher was also mentioned among the seventy family members who accompanied Jacob to Egypt several centuries earlier (Genesis 46:17). The Rabbis transform Serah into the longest-lived individual in midrashic literature and praise her for her wisdom. They attribute her remarkable longevity to the potent blessing that her grandfather Jacob was said to have given her after she informed him through music that Joseph was still alive. BT <i>Sotah</i> 13a relates that it was Serah who later showed Moses where Joseph was buried at the time of the Exodus so that his coffin might be returned to the land of Israel. Midrash <i>B’reishit Rabbah</i> 94.9 identifies her also with the clever woman who negotiated on behalf of her city with David’s general Joab (II Samuel 20:16–22). And Midrash <i>P’sikta D’Rav Kahana</i> 11:13 even imagines the venerable Serah resolving rabbinic disputes about events that she witnessed in biblical times. In medieval writings, Serah is among the nine human beings who are said to have entered heaven alive; according to the <i>Zohar</i> (3:167b), she lives in a heavenly palace and teaches Torah.
<i><b>The daughters of Zelophehad…came forward</b></i> (27:1). The Rabbis taught: “When the daughters of Zelophehad heard that the land of Israel was being apportioned among the males of the tribes but not the females, they consulted together as to how to make their claim. They said: ‘The compassion of God is not like human compassion. Human rulers are more concerned with males than with females—but the One who spoke and brought the world into being is not like that. Rather, God shows mercy to every living thing, as Scripture says, <i>Who gives food to all flesh</i> <b>/</b> <i>Whose steadfast love is eternal</i> (Psalm 136:25), and <i>The Sovereign is good to all</i> <b>/</b> <i>God’s mercy is upon all God’s works</i> (Psalm 145:9).”’ This rabbinic midrash from <i>Sifrei B’midbar</i> 133 represents the daughters of Zelophehad as canny and competent women who trusted that divine mercy would transcend the mutable norms of a human society in which women were subordinate beings. According to the Rabbis, these admirable sisters epitomized the females of the wilderness generation who consistently outshone their male contemporaries in their faith in God and their personal courage. <i>B’midbar Rabbah</i> 21.10 relates that women refused to participate in making the Golden Calf; they also rejected the disheartening counsel of the scouts who warned of the dangers of invading Canaan. Similarly, the daughters of Zelophehad are understood to have demonstrated their complete confidence in the ultimate fulfillment of the divine promise when they petition Moses to secure their inheritance in the land of Israel.
BT <i>Bava Batra</i> 119b praises the daughters of Zelophehad in three ways: as intelligent women, since they spoke at an opportune moment; as scriptural exegetes knowledgeable in Jewish law, since they were aware of the legal issues involved in their situation; and as sexually chaste, since they did not marry until their inheritance status was resolved, despite their advanced ages. The rabbinic sages awarded the daughters of Zelophehad this exalted standing among biblical women because they prompted Moses to seek divine help in clarifying the laws of succession of property. Nor did it hurt that God supported the sisters’ claim. According to <i>B’midbar Rabbah</i> 21.11, by expanding the Torah these women earned merit for themselves and for their forebears listed in 27:1—including Joseph, the founder of their tribe. So pious and self-sacrificing were these women that they are said to have humbled Moses himself.
The Rabbis, who sought meaning in every detail of the biblical text, noticed that the order in which the five daughters are named is not always the same. <i>Sifrei B’midbar</i> 133 says that this inconsistency is meant to show that all the women were equal in good qualities. BT <i>Bava Batra</i> 120a speculates that 27:1, where the daughters seek their inheritance, names them according to their wisdom, while 36:10, which describes their marriages, lists them by age—since age takes precedence at a festive gathering.

Matot

<i><b>Moses spoke to the heads of the Israelite tribes</b></i> (30:2). Rabbi Moses Sofer, a Hungarian communal leader of the early 19th century, suggests that the Torah’s discussion of vows and oaths is addressed to the “heads of the Israelite tribes” because it is leaders who most often fail to fulfill their promises and commitments (cited in A. Y. Greenberg, <i>Itturei Torah</i>, 1985).
<i><b>If a woman makes a vow</b></i> (30:4) The Rabbis imagined that women made vows denying themselves certain food, bathing, the use of cosmetics and jewelry, and sexual intercourse (BT <i>N’darim</i> 79a–b, 81b–82a), perhaps because these were things over which women had some control and which also gave them pleasure.
<i><b>in her father’s household</b></i> (30:4). According to Midrash <i>Sifrei B’midbar</i> on this verse, a young woman was still under her father’s authority, even if she was not literally in her father’s home when she made the vow. The medieval French commentator Rashi comments that the phrase “by reason of her youth” excludes both a very young girl, whose vows have no legal force, and a young woman who has reached the age of majority. An adult woman is not under her father’s legal control, even if she is still living at home, and her father cannot annul her vows.
<i><b>But if her husband restrains her</b></i> (30:9). BT <i>N’darim</i> 79a–b restricts a husband’s power to annul his wife’s vows to those of self-denial or that have an impact on the marital relationship. Depending on the interpreter, the husband’s power of cancellation could be limited to vows that interfere with the couple’s sexual relationship or could include any vow that might cause contention in the marriage (Adin Steinsaltz on <i>N’darim</i> 79b, citing R. Isaac DeTrani and R. Menachem Meiri). A vow to abstain from sexual intercourse could certainly be annulled by the husband.
<i><b>The vow of a widow or of a divorced woman…shall be binding upon her</b></i> (30:10). Since widows and divorcées are independent entities, no one is in a position to annul their vows. According to BT <i>Gittin</i> 79b, if a husband had annulled his wife’s vows that had a negative impact on the marital relationship, the woman is obligated to fulfill those vows should she become a divorcée or widow. Once vows purely of self-denial have been annulled, however, they are cancelled permanently.
<i><b>But if he annuls them after [the day] he finds out, he shall bear her guilt</b></i> (30:16). The Rabbis were concerned that a woman’s ability to make vows could harm her marriage. Mishnah <i>Gittin</i> 4:7 discusses a husband’s decision to divorce his wife due to her vows, while BT <i>Gittin</i> 46a indicates that a husband may simply not want to be married to a woman who makes vows.
The discussion of women’s vows in Numbers 30 indicates that women are, in principle, capable of making and fulfilling vows. The restrictions on the vows of a minor daughter or wife in no way negate this ability. Rather, the laws recognize a certain understanding of the father-daughter and husband-wife relationship, one in which the man has a significant amount of power over the woman. This power is tempered, at least in a marital relationship, by rabbinic legislation. Mishnah <i>K’tubot 7:1–5</i> teaches that a husband who makes vows that compromise his wife’s ability to eat certain foods or wear jewelry, to visit her family or attend social functions, or who upholds his wife’s own vows of self-denial for a lengthy period of time should divorce her, since his actions make her life uncomfortable.
<i><b>The Reubenites and the Gadites</b></i> (32:1). Midrashic commentaries, such as <i>Tanchuma, Matot</i> 7, criticize the request of the Reubenites and the Gadites. They note that the tribes speak of providing shelter for their flocks before mentioning their children, an indication that they loved their possessions more than their families. Moses hints at their need to rethink their priorities; in his reply, he reverses the order, instructing them to “build towns for your children and [then] sheepfolds for your flocks” (32:24). According to <i>Tanchuma, Matot</i> 5, their inordinate love of possessions is what led these tribes to live outside of the land of Israel; as a result, they were exiled from their land before the other tribes (I Chronicles 5:26).

Masei

 <i><b>These were the marches of the Israelites</b></i> (33:1). Why does the Torah recount all of the steps of Israel’s forty-year wanderings? Midrash <i>Tanchuma, Mas’ei</i> 11 draws a parallel to a king who takes his child on a journey to seek a cure for the child’s sickness. On the return trip, the doting father recalls each leg of the original trip, remembering how they traveled together and how he worried about his child’s condition. So the Torah in recalling the journey calls to mind the struggle God had with the Israelites in the wilderness.
<i><b>The towns that you assign to the Levites</b></i> (35:6). <i>Tanchuma, Mas’ei</i> 11 draws a parallel between God’s punishment of Adam and the law of the individual who commits homicide. God had told Adam that eating the fruit of the tree of knowledge would result in his death; nevertheless, God was merciful and exiled Adam from the Garden of Eden as a punishment for bringing death into the world. So too this law shows compassion for a person who accidentally kills another human being, exiling the killer to a city of refuge rather than mandating the killer’s death.
<i><b>The blood-avenger himself shall put the murderer to death</b></i> (35:19). The Torah recognizes that homicide can easily lead to a blood feud between families, with one act of vengeance leading to another and then another. JT <i>Makot</i> 2:5 even considers the possibility that the killer and his victim might be relatives, leading to a situation where to avenge one family member, a person might seek vengeance on another relative.
<i><b>the assembly shall decide</b></i> (35:24). Since the assembly that decides between the killer and the blood avenger must be impartial, relatives of the accused and his victim are excluded from the assembly (JT <i>Sanhedrin</i> 3:9).
<i><b>This is what</b></i> (36:6). Rabbinic sources (BT <i>Taanit</i> 30b; <i>Bava Batra</i> 120a) indicate that this law, requiring daughters who inherit from their father to marry within the clan, applied only to the generation of the wilderness, or to a time in which land was held by the tribes (Baruch HaLevi Epstein, <i>Torah T’mimah</i> on 36:6).
<i><b>They may marry anyone they wish, provided they marry into a clan of their father’s tribe</b></i> (36:6). This statement seems contradictory. A tradition in BT <i>Bava Batra</i> 120a explains that the daughters of Zelophehad were permitted to marry into any of the tribes, but the Torah advised them to make “suitable” marriages that would please bot hthemselves and their father’s clan members.
<i><b>Mahlah, Tirzah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Noah</b></i> (36:11). Zelophehad’s daughters are listed in a different order here than in Numbers 27. According to BT <i>Bava Batra</i> 120a, this indicates that each of them was equal to the other. This text also suggests that Numbers 36 lists the women in the order in which they were born, while Numbers 27 mentions them in order of wisdom.
These different orders are cited in several 19thcentury anecdotes that discuss women’s experiences and characteristics (cited in A. Y. Greenberg, <i>Itturei Torah</i> on 36:11). A disciple of Rabbi Elijah ben Solomon Zalman (“the Vilna Gaon”) was approached by a man who complained that after marrying his son to the daughter of an important man, he discovered that his daughter-in-law, a woman whom he described as both intelligent and pious, was ten years older than her new husband. The rabbi responded with humor, pointing out that the daughters of Zelophehad were listed in chronological order only after they were married, to teach that a woman’s age should not be mentioned while she is single since it becomes irrelevant after marriage.
In another story, the wife of Rabbi Saul of Amsterdam, known in her youth as a brilliant woman, was asked why she had abandoned her studies after marrying and having children. She replied by noting that before their marriage, the daughters of Zelophehad were listed by (that is, known for) their wisdom, but “after they married and accepted the millstone [of household duties and childrearing] around their necks, their wisdom was forgotten and they were thereafter listed by their ages.” This story acknowledges the challenges that intelligent and learned women faced in continuing their studies in a society that expected married women to devote themselves to their husbands and children.

Devarim

 <i><b>These are the words</b></i> (1:1). This parashah is read in the synagogue on the Sabbath immediately preceding Tishah B’Av, the annual commemoration of the destructions of the First and Second Temples. Therefore, the haftarah reading (from Isaiah 1:1–27) and many of the rabbinic commentaries focus on images and themes of rebuke, in which Israel is called upon to repent and embrace a higher level of moral and ethical conduct.
Midrash <i>Sifrei D’varim</i> 1 is devoted almost entirely to the subject of rebuke. The midrash explains that Moses wrote the entire Torah, not just “these…words.” If so, the midrash responds, then “these words” must be words of reproof as similarly seen in Amos, Jeremiah, and in reference to King David, “These are the last words of David” (I Samuel 23:1). However, according to <i>Sifrei D’varim</i> 1, in some cases it is God, rather than Moses, who voices criticism. For example, God rebukes the Israelites for complaining about the manna they ate during their trek in the wilderness (Numbers 21:5), asserting that kings would willingly choose to eat such a food for its apparent health benefits. The Israelites’ ingratitude reminds God of another ancestor, Adam, who was given Eve as a helper and mate—but then blamed her for his disobedience in eating the fruit (Genesis 3:12). In this unusual interpretation of Genesis 2–3, the Israelites’ behavior is explained through a comparison with Adam, whom the Rabbis deem cowardly and unjust in attributing his own sin to Eve.
Elsewhere, the Rabbis view rebuke as a vehicle for repentance. In <i>P’sikta D’Rav Kahana</i> 15:5 (Mandelbaum edn.), a late midrashic compilation based on the liturgical cycle of holy days, the midrash for the Shabbat before Tishah B’Av focuses on Israel’s abandonment of the study of Torah and its subsequent disastrous results: the destructions of the First and Second Temples. The Rabbis observe that a person who forsakes God but continues to study Torah will return to God by means of the power of the Torah itself.
<i><b>It was in the fortieth year</b></i> (1:3). The Sages understood this phrase to mean that Moses did not rebuke the Israelites until he was about to die. A midrash found in <i>Sifrei D’varim</i> 2 and <i>B’reishit Rabbah</i> 54.3 cites a number of other cases of deathbed rebuke (including Abraham, Isaac, and Joshua), and then explains why one should not reprove another person until one’s death is near. The reasons include avoiding reproaching another person repeatedly, preserving the chastised person from shame in the presence of the rebuker, preventing the individual from holding a grudge against the rebuker, and permitting the rebuked one to leave in peace, “for rebuke should bring about peace.”
<i><b>Do not harass the Moabites…You will then be close to the Ammonites</b></i> (2:9, 19). The Rabbis often interpret these verses about Moab and Ammon in relation to Ruth and Naamah, two foreign women who influenced Israelite history. According to the Bible, Ruth, a Moabite, remained faithful to her mother-in-law Naomi after both were widowed, and she adopted Naomi’s people and their way of life. With Naomi’s help, Ruth married Boaz, and became King David’s great-grandmother. Naamah, an Ammonite, was King Solomon’s wife and the mother of Rehoboam, the king of Judah after Solomon (I Kings 14:21). On their behalf, according to BT <i>Bava Kama</i> 38b, God instructed Moses not to wage war against the Moabites or Ammonites: “The idea you have in your mind is not the idea I have in My mind. In the future I will bring forth two doves from them: Ruth the Moabite and Naamah the Ammonite” (also BT <i>Nazir</i> 23b, BT <i>Horayot</i> 10b–11a).
These talmudic passages also note that Lot’s two daughters were the matriarchs of Moab and Ammon through incestuous relations with their father (Genesis 19:37–38). The exegetical etymologies of the names of the offspring, and therefore of the tribes, are significant to the Rabbis. They view the name of the elder daughter’s son (Moab, or “my father”) as a reference to the sinful incestuous act, which explains for them why God forbade war with Moab but did not restrict Israel from harassing this potential enemy. The Rabbis use a Greek word, no doubt familiar from Roman rule, to describe this harassment as the seizure or subjugation of Moab for forced labor, particularly for public works projects. In the case of the younger daughter’s son (Ben-ammi, meaning “son of my people,” and rendered as Ammon), no reference is made to incest. As a result, the Sages explain, God forbade Israel from either warring with or harassing the Ammonites.

Vaetchanan

 <i><b>I pleaded with</b></i> <b>יהוה</b> <i><b>at that time</b></i> (3:23). Midrash <i>D’varim Rabbah</i> 2.1 poses four rhetorical questions on the halachah of prayer. For the answers, it looks to the behavior of four biblical figures—Hannah, Daniel, David, and Solomon. The first question is whether a person should pray in a loud voice, as Moses apparently does in this passage. Based on the actions of Hannah, who prayed silently, with only her lips moving (I Samuel 1:13), the answer is no.
<i><b>Honor your father and your mother</b></i> (5:16). The Rabbis (JT <i>Kiddushin</i> 1:7, 61b) illustrated this commandment with two exaggerated tales designed to emphasize the seriousness of the mitzvah. Rabbi Tarfon’s mother was walking in her courtyard on Shabbat when her shoe broke, exposing her foot to the ground. Her son placed his hands under her feet step by step until she returned to her room. When she later complained to other Rabbis that her son had shown her too much honor, they disagreed. Even if he repeated that act thousands of times, he would still not have shown her even half the honor the Torah requires. Conversely, Rabbi Ishmael’s mother complained to the Rabbis that her son did not honor her sufficiently when he refused to allow her to wash his feet and drink the wash water. The Rabbis insisted that if this was the honor she desired, then he must allow her to do it.
At BT <i>Kiddushin</i> 39b, the Rabbis compared the mitzvah of honoring parents with the commandment in Deuteronomy 22:6–7 to send away a mother bird before gathering up her eggs. In each case, the Torah promises long life to those who keep these mitzvot. And the comparison goes deeper: by sending away the mother bird, the egg gatherer shows sensitivity to a mother, albeit a non-human one. Broadly speaking, sending away the mother bird is “honoring a mother,” or honoring motherhood.
<i><b>Hear, O Israel!</b></i> <b>יהוה <i>is our God</i></b> (6:4–9). The Rabbis saw the recitation of the <i>Sh’ma</i> as a Jew’s acceptance of the “yoke of the Kingdom of Heaven”—that is, the acceptance of God’s sovereignty, including acceptance of God’s legitimate authority to require obedience to the Torah (for instance, Mishnah <i>B’rachot</i> 2:2, 5). The martyr Rabbi Akiva died while saying these words (BT <i>B’rachot</i> 61b). This entire passage, known as “recitation of the <i>Sh’ma,”</i> became part of the standard prayer liturgy that men are required to recite twice daily. However, the Rabbis ruled that women are not required to recite the daily <i>Sh’ma</i> (Mishnah <i>B’rachot</i> 3:3) since it is a positive, time-bound commandment from which women are generally exempt in rabbinic law (BT <i>B’rachot</i> 20b). The Talmud raises the possibility that women should also be obligated in the recitation of <i>Sh’ma</i> because of its proclamation of God’s sovereignty, but then dismisses this option. The insistence on women’s exemption from time-bound commandments, even in the service of God, is a powerful talmudic statement of gender hierarchy and female spiritual marginalization. As Rabbi David Abudraham (14th-century Spain) explained, women are exempt from time-bound commandments so that they will not be occupied in divine service when their husbands need them for domestic service.
<i><b>You shall not intermarry with them…For they will turn your children away from Me</b></i> (7:3–4). The Torah forbids intermarriage with the seven Canaanite nations on the grounds that the Canaanite spouse could turn the Israelite spouse away from the worship of God. In their biblical context, these verses depict an equal-opportunity danger: whether the intermarrying Israelite is the bride or the groom, the fear is that the Canaanite spouse will lead the Israelite partner astray. Partly because the Canaanite concern was nonexistent in their time, and partly because rabbinic legal interpretation of Scripture generally tends to focus closely on words and phrases, the Rabbis read the grammatically masculine Hebrew of 7:4 with extreme literalness: “For <i>he</i> will turn <i>your son</i> away.” In the Talmud this reading is used to justify the determination of Jewish descent according to whether one’s mother is Jewish (BT <i>Kiddushin</i> 68b). The argument is that “he” (the Israelite daughter’s Canaanite spouse) will turn away “your son” (the Israelite father-in-law’s grandson from that union). This proves that the child of a Canaanite father and Israelite mother is considered “your son” (an Israelite), while the child of an Israelite father and Canaanite mother is, by implication, considered “her child” (a Canaanite). Thus, according to rabbinic halachah, in cases of intermarriage the children of an Israelite mother married to a non-Jew are considered part of the Jewish people, but the children of an Israelite father and a non-Israelite mother are not.

Eikev

 <i><b>who fed you in the wilderness with manna</b></i> (8:16). Here God is portrayed in feminine terms as a provider of food. It is usually women who do the cooking and baking in the Bible, as illustrated by the “Woman of Valor,” who rises early to cook and bake (Proverbs 31:15), and by Sarah, who prepares all manner of food for the visitors (Genesis 18:6–7). The Rabbis record the seven tasks expected of a wife, including grinding grain, baking bread, and cooking food (Mishnah <i>K’tubot</i> 5:5). Women were also expected to perform the accompanying religious rituals, such as separating a portion of dough for the priest (Numbers 15:20; Mishnah <i>Shabbat</i> 2:6).
<i><b>As for that sinful thing you had made, the calf, I…ground it thoroughly</b></i> (9:21). In this passage, Moses recounts how he put the Golden Calf to the fire, ground it thoroughly, and threw the dust into the brook. The version in Exodus 32:20 is a bit different, for it describes how Moses burned the calf, ground it into dust, sprinkled the dust on the water, and made the people drink. The latter’s similarity to the <i>sotah</i> ritual in Numbers 5 is obvious. Just as the wife accused of adultery must be tested by drinking a potion, so the Israelites had to drink the dust of the idol for which they abandoned God. This parallel creates the impression, further developed by the biblical prophets, that Israel’s relationship with God was like that of a wife and husband or a pair of lovers. In worshiping an idol, Israel betrayed an intimate partner; therefore, God’s punishment was swift and severe. It is ironic that the Rabbis deduce from the phrase “and all the people took off the gold rings that were in their ears” (Exodus 32:3) that the women refused to hand their rings over to their husbands for inclusion in the Calf. God rewarded the women with a holiday of their own, Rosh Chodesh, the New Moon, a day on which they were to abstain from household chores <i>(Pirkei D’Rabbi Eliezer</i> 45).
<i><b>upholds the cause of the fatherless and the widow</b></i> (10:18). In the rabbinic period, a principal purpose of the marriage contract (<i>k’tubah</i>) was to provide women with economic sustenance when widowed or divorced. Nevertheless, much like the Bible did, talmudic texts often portray widows as needing protection and financial support (see, for example, BT <i>Gittin</i> 35a).
<i><b>If then, you obey the commandments</b></i> (11:13–21). This passage constitutes the second paragraph of the <i>Sh’ma</i> (Mishnah <i>B’rachot</i> 2:2) that is traditionally recited twice daily, together with 6:4–9 <i>(Sh’ma)</i> and Numbers 15:37–41 (on <i>tzitzit).</i> Mishnah <i>B’rachot</i> 3:3 exempts women from the daily obligation to recite the <i>Sh’ma</i> and from donning <i>t’fillin</i> (11:18), but it obligates them to hang a mezuzah on the doorposts of their home (11:20), pray daily, and recite the blessing after meals <i>(Birkat HaMazori).</i> Most of these exemptions and obligations are consistent with the general rules enunciated in Mishnah <i>Kiddushin</i> 1:7, that women are exempt from positive time-dependent ritual acts but obligated to all others. Recitation of the <i>Sh’ma</i> and donning <i>t’fillin</i> must be done at specified times of the day, whereas hanging a mezuzah may be done at any time. But women are obligated to prayer at fixed times because the Rabbis consider them better advocates before God than men are (BT <i>B’rachot</i> 20b).
<b><i>loving your God</i> יהוה <i>and serving</i> [<i>God</i>] <i>with all your heart and soul</i></b> (11:13). The Rabbis attach to these words one of their favorite ideas: that one must be engaged in study for its own sake <i>(Torah lishmah).</i> Should people say that they will learn in order to become rich, or to be called “Rabbi,” or to receive a reward in the world-to-come, this verse teaches that such motivations are not acceptable. Instead, one should spend time in the study of Torah for its own sake—out of the love both of learning and of engagement with God’s words (<i>Sifrei D’varim, Eikev</i> 41). Since women were not obligated to study sacred texts, any instance of women engaged in Torah study implies that it was for its own sake. A clear but chilling case of a woman studying Torah can be found in BT <i>Yoma</i> 66b: a woman came before Rabbi Eliezer and asked him a detailed question about the punishments meted out by God for worship of the Golden Calf; but he would not answer her. The reason for his reticence, according to another version of this tale (JT <i>Sotah</i> 3:3, 19a), was that “it is better to burn the words of Torah than turn them over to women.”

Re'eh

 <i><b>Together with your households, you shall feast there before your God</b></i> יהוה (12:7). The use of the phrase “your households” (literally “your houses”) immediately raises questions about who is included in this designation. Subsequent verses in this parashah (12:12, 18; 16:11, 14) consistently omit wives from lists of participating household members, but they do include other women, such as daughters and female slaves. Thus, early rabbinic interpreters considered the expression for “house” here to mean “wife” (<i>Sifrei D’varim</i> 64); in fact, rabbinic texts often equate the two terms (Mishnah <i>Yoma</i> 1:1). Rabbinic sources frequently cite a statement to this effect attributed to Rabbi Yosi, who said, “All my life I never called my wife ‘my wife’ <i>(ishti)</i> and my ox ‘my ox.’ Instead, my wife I called ‘my house’ and my ox ‘my field’” (BT <i>Shabbat</i> 118b; BT <i>Gittin</i> 52a, among others). Indeed, in talmudic Aramaic one of the words for “wife” is related to the word for “house.” Thus, the Rabbis understood a wife to be the essence of a household, and they attached a great deal of significance to this fundamental conviction.
The metaphoric connection between woman and house in the rabbinic imagination led to further elaborations, such as references to the interior organs of the woman’s body as various rooms. For example, “the sages made a simile (<i>mashal mash’lu)</i> with regard to the woman: the chamber, the antechamber, and the upper chamber” (Mishnah <i>Niddah</i> 2:5). At times, women’s sexual organs are referred to as doors, hinges, and even keys (BT <i>B’chorot</i> 45a).
<i><b>You shall consecrate to your God</b></i> <b>יהוה</b> <i><b>all male firstlings</b></i> (15:19). The repeated biblical insistence that the first-born be consecrated led to an entire mishnaic tractate, <i>B’chorot,</i> which is devoted to the legal aspects of this topic. Among many other concerns, Mishnah <i>B’chorot</i> inquires as to what constitutes the status of a first-born animal. Does this include, for instance, an animal that emerged from “its mother’s side,” presumably by Caesarean birth? The answer is that such a birth does not bestow first-born status on the animal since Numbers 18:15 defines the first-born as literally what “opens the womb.” Moreover, biblical law explicitly requires a “male” first-born. Thus, any sexual ambiguity, whether a lack or a doubling of external sexual organs, constitutes a blemish that disqualifies an animal from sacrificial status as a first-born (Mishnah <i>B’chorot</i> 6:12).
<i><b>You shall rejoice in your festival</b></i> (16:14). According to the Babylonian Talmud, this verse teaches that a husband is obligated to make his wife and children rejoice as part of the holiday observance. A Babylonian sage suggests that wives are made joyous with new clothes; he goes on to claim that in Babylonia women prefer colorful garments, while women in the Land of Israel prefer bleached clothes made from linen (BT <i>P’sachim</i> 109a). Another rabbinic tradition based on this verse prohibits weddings during the intermediary days of Passover or Sukkot, since “one should not mix up one joy with another” (BT <i>Mo’ed Katan</i> 8b).
<i><b>Three times a year…all your males shall appear before your God</b></i> יהוה (16:16). The emphasis on “males” in the concluding verses of the parashah is noteworthy, especially since earlier statements imply that the entire extended household, including daughters and female slaves, was obligated to participate in festival observances. The exclusion of women in this verse appears to contradict the preceding passages. The Rabbis solved this contradiction by subdividing the responsibilities of rejoicing (v. 14) into various components. Accordingly, women and people with sexual ambiguities, such as the hermaphrodite and the non-sexed person, are said to be exempt from the commandment of appearing before God (Mishnah <i>Chagigah</i> 1:1), since the biblical verse specifies that males are to do this. “Appearance” (<i>r’iah</i>) entails both presence in the Temple and offering a sacrifice, since “they shall not appear before יהוה empty-handed” (16:16). Talmudic discussions (BT <i>Chagigah</i> 4b) suggest that the exemption of women from this particular obligation makes sense since bringing a sacrifice in this instance is a time-bound commandment (festival observances take place three times a year on specific days on the calendar). According to an early rabbinic principle, women are exempt from commandments that must be performed at fixed times (Mishnah <i>Kiddushin</i> 1:7). However, the responsibility to rejoice applies to everyone (Tosefta <i>Chagigah</i> 1:4 and BT <i>Chagigah</i> 6b); thus, in that aspect of the festival celebration, women and men are equally obligated.

Shoftim

 <i><b>A person shall be put to death only on the testimony of two or more witnesses</b></i> (17:6). Despite the admirable exhortation in this parashah to pursue justice (16:20), post-biblical Judaism restricted women’s participation in the judicial system. In response to the requirement of two witnesses for criminal cases in this verse and 19:15–17, <i>Sifrei D’varim</i> 190 asks, “Is a woman also qualified to give testimony?” Their answer is no, for they note that in 19:15 the Torah states “two witnesses” and further on, in 19:17, “two [men].” Reading these two biblical verses literally, the Rabbis reason: “As the meaning of ‘two’ in the one instance is men and not women, so the meaning of ‘two’ in the other instance is men and not women.” Even earlier, the Jewish historian Josephus (1st century <small>C. E.</small>) asserted that “by Jewish law women are disqualified as witnesses” (<i>Jewish Antiquities</i> 4.219).
However, the Mishnah (<i>Y’vamot</i> 15:1–5 and 16:5) permits a woman to serve as a sole witness in establishing a man’s death, thus allowing his widow to remarry. Since rabbinic courts accepted female testimony in this and some other situations, why were they excluded from most civil and criminal cases? The Rabbis did not give a reason for their general disqualification of women as legal witnesses. Perhaps women’s dependence on their husbands or fathers was understood to compromise their ability to serve as independent witnesses. They could testify only when the two-witness paradigm did not hold. This proved especially important when women might have more access than men to necessary information.
<i><b>Is there anyone who has paid the bride-price for a wife?</b></i> (20:7). The groom becomes betrothed <i>(eiras)</i> after he gives a betrothal gift, which is referred to here as a “bride-price.” This implies that the wife is an object acquired by her future husband. (For a different perspective on the institution of betrothal in the Bible, see at Genesis 29:18; Exodus 22:15–16; and <i>Chayei Sanah,</i> Another View.) The Rabbis’ use of the term <i>kiddushin</i> for “betrothal” might encourage us to think that women played a more active role in their own betrothals in rabbinic times. <i>Kiddushin</i> is connected to the Hebrew word for “holy,” and “holy” in this context could indicate a relationship recognizing the betrothed woman as more than property. However, rabbinic writings (Tosefta <i>Kiddushin</i> 1:1 and BT <i>Kiddushin</i> 5b) make it clear that a betrothal is legitimate only if a man “acquires” a woman, whether he uses the term <i>m’onesset</i> or <i>m’kuddeshet</i> to assert his claim. Betrothal is not considered valid if a woman speaks or acts as the one changing the couple’s status from single to betrothed.
Like the new house and newly planted vineyard (20:5–6), the betrothed woman (20:7) appears as a partially claimed property for whose full possession a man must take further action. Passages like this indicate that obligations accompanied betrothal (see also 22:23) and imply that some men may not have fulfilled them expeditiously. At any given time, significant numbers of betrothed women may have occupied a limbo state wherein they were already designated as “wife” but not entitled to that status. Although biblical sources are silent about mechanisms for canceling betrothals, the Rabbis insisted on divorce to terminate the betrothed couple’s connection (Mishnah <i>Kiddushin</i> 1:1, 3:7).
Similar views that betrothal was tantamount to marriage are also found in Roman law. The 2nd century historian Suetonius remarked, “[O]n finding that the spirit of the law was being evaded by betrothal with immature girls…[the Emperor Augustus] shortened the duration of betrothals” (<i>Augustus</i> 34:1–2). While Suetonius is discussing a binding betrothal that some elite men used to their advantage in order to avoid restrictions upon gifts and the higher taxes owed by unmarried men, the biblical example appears to establish the binding nature of betrothal intentionally. In both Jewish and Roman law and practice, a betrothal either led to a marriage or was terminated in some quiet manner.
In general, historians find references to betrothals only where problems have occurred or are envisioned. The present verse discusses one potential difficulty. A non-Jewish example appears in a legal ruling from Emperors Valerian and Gallienus (dated 259 <small>C. E.</small>) concerning a young woman who has been engaged for three years but her fiancé is abroad and unreachable. She would like to end the betrothal but cannot communicate this to him. This young woman’s lawsuit expresses concern that she would be liable to charges of bigamy were she to marry someone else (Judith Evans Grubbs, <i>Law and Family in Late Antiquity,</i> 1995, pp. 167–8). That such cases required resolution suggests that the interval between betrothal and marriage could be problematic in both Jewish and Roman societies. However, the rarity of references to these cases raises more questions than answers about how betrothals really functioned in ancient Judaism.

 <i><b>When you [an Israelite warrior] take the field</b></i> (21:10–14). The Rabbis make no attempt to abrogate the law permitting Israelite men to bring home female war captives. However, they are not enthusiastic about the practice. Drawing upon an opinion in BT <i>Kiddushin</i> 21b, the 11th-century commentator Rashi claims (at 21:11) that the Torah is making a concession to the <i>yetzer hara</i> (often translated as the “evil impulse”) when it permits the captive woman. Rashi indicates that were the Torah to forbid the women, men would take them anyway; instead, the Torah limits the practice.
<i><b>If a householder has a wayward and defiant son</b></i> (21:18–20). The Rabbis restrict the law of the rebellious son, effectively legislating it out of existence. One restriction involves requiring the consent of both parents to the punishment. The son cannot be subjected to the procedure unless he has both a father and a mother, and the parents’ marriage must be a “suitable” one. If either parent has any one of a number of physical defects, the law does not apply (<i>Sifrei D’varim, Ki Teitzei, piska</i> 219).
<i><b>A woman must not put on man’s apparel</b></i> (22:5). The Sages argue that this verse prohibits wearing clothing associated with the opposite gender expressly for the purpose of passing oneself off as the opposite gender (<i>Sifrei D’varim, Ki Teitzei, piska</i> 226).
<i><b>A householder marries a woman and cohabits with her</b></i> (22:13). <i>Sifrei D’varim, Ki Teitzei, piska</i> 235, comments that one sin leads to another. If a husband fails to love his wife, transgressing the command “You shall love your neighbor as yourself” (Leviticus 19:18), he is likely to transgress further. This formula suggests that the commentator sees a husband’s claim against his wife’s virginity as an expression of hatred rather than a legitimate use of law.
<i><b>he writes her a bill of divorcement…and sends her away</b></i> (24:1). This passage (vv. 1–4) takes for granted a husband’s right to initiate divorce. Citing this verse, some of the Rabbis allow a man to divorce his wife simply because he finds her housekeeping skills unsatisfactory or because he no longer finds her physically attractive (Mishnah <i>Gittin</i> 9:10).
The Torah does not mention a wife’s right to initiate divorce, but Jews have nevertheless recognized it in various times and place (compare Exodus 21:10–11). Extant Jewish marriage contracts from the early Second Temple period stipulate either party’s right to initiate divorce. Marriage contracts among rabbinic Jews of the early medieval Levant often contain similar stipulations.
Meanwhile, the Mishnah (<i>K’tubot</i> 5:7) mentions a different approach, wherein an unhappy wife can start a countdown for dissolution of the marriage by declaring herself to be a <i>moredet</i> (refusing or recalcitrant wife). After allowing time for reconciliation, the court would apparently compel her husband to divorce her, although she would not receive a divorcée’s usual marriage settlement.
The Mishnah allows women to petition the court directly for release from an unsatisfactory marriage (<i>K’tubot</i> 7:10), and it describes instances in which a man’s behavior would require that he divorce his wife (<i>K’tubot</i> 7:1–5). Yet according to another line of legal reasoning, a man cannot be divorced against his will (Mishnah <i>Gittin</i> 9:8; BT <i>Gittin</i> 88b). In Babylonia, most rabbinic authorities maintained that only a husband could initiate divorce, and this view prevailed in rabbinic Judaism by approximately the year 1300 <small>C. E.</small>
<b><i>Remember what your God</i> יהוה <i>did to Miriam</i></b> (24:9). Some rabbinic sources understand Moses as alluding to Miriam’s being stricken with the skin disease <i>tzaraat</i> for speaking against him (Numbers 12:10–15). Rashi here echoes the words of <i>Sifrei D’varim,</i> “If you want to avoid being stricken with <i>tzaraat,</i> do not gossip, for Miriam gossiped about her brother and was stricken.” The 13th-century commentator Nachmanides adds here that this exhortation should be understood as a positive commandment parallel to other verses that call on us to remember something in particular (such as Exodus 20:8; Deuteronomy 25:17). He notes that the gravity of this commandment is demonstrated by the affliction of Miriam, “a righteous woman, a prophet who spoke about her brother out of concern, loving him as she did herself.” Although Miriam “did not speak directly to Moses so as not to embarrass him, nor did she speak in public, but only in private to her holy brother [Aaron],” nonetheless, and despite “all of her good deeds,” she was punished. This demonstrates the enormity of gossip.
<i><b>When brothers dwell together</b></i> (25:5–10). The Rabbis of the Mishnah limit the situations in which levirate marriage is required (for example, <i>Y’vamot</i> 1:1–3; 2:1–3). The Talmud recounts situations in which widows were reluctant to marry their brothers-in-law despite the men’s eagerness to perform levirate marriage. These women confided their concerns to rabbis, who—convinced that the men’s motives were selfish—tricked the men into releasing their sisters-in-law from their obligations (BT <i>Y’vamot</i> 106a).
Beginning already in the Talmud (BT <i>Y’vamot</i> 39a-b; 101b), rabbinic authorities differ as to whether a brother should fulfill his levirate obligation or undergo the ritual of vv. 7–10 (known as <i>chalitzah).</i> In the post-talmudic period, authorities disagreed as to whether levirate marriage or <i>chalitzah</i> was preferable. Today, all agree that <i>chalitzah</i> is mandatory. In liberal Judaism, neither levirate marriage nor <i>chalitzah</i> is employed.

 <i><b>Now, if you obey</b></i> (28:1). The Hebrew construction of this phrase gives double emphasis to the word “obey.” Midrash <i>Sh’mot Rabbah</i> 7.1 suggests that this apparent repetition refers to the double reward that obedience to God’s commandments in this world, such as synagogue worship and study, will merit in the world-to-come: “Whoever listens to the voice of the Torah in this world will be privileged to listen to the voice of which it is written, The voice of mirth and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride’ (Jeremiah 16:9).” According to this midrash, “Moses said to Israel: ‘Whoever listens to the words of the Torah is exalted in both worlds, so be diligent to listen to the words of the Torah.’”
<i><b>Blessed shall you be in the city</b></i> (28:3). According to <i>Sh’mot Rabbah</i> 7.5, “in the city” refers to rewards for precepts performed in the city—including <i>challah</i> (dough offering; see Numbers 15:18–21), <i>tzitzit</i> (tassels), sukkah, and the kindling of the Sabbath lights. While only men must fulfill <i>tzitzit</i> and sukkah, rabbinic Judaism considered <i>challah</i> and the kindling of Sabbath lights (<i>hadlakat nerot)</i> to be specifically female ritual responsibilities. Together with observance of the laws connected with the <i>niddah</i> (menstruating woman), these three women’s obligations were known in rabbinic parlance by the acronym <i>ChaNaH,</i> which spells the name “Hannah,” alluding to Samuel’s mother—whose supplication to God in I Samuel 2:1–10 is seen as the model of sincere prayer. According to Judith Hauptman, Mishnah <i>P’sachim</i> and its Tosefta both assume women’s knowledge of key home rituals like separating challah or baking matzah. Rather than supervising the women, or assuming the duties themselves, men relied upon women’s expertise in order to retain a state of sinlessness and ritual purity (<i>Women in the Rabbinic Kitchen,</i> forthcoming).
<i><b>And she who is most tender and dainty among you</b></i> (28:56). Particularly horrific in this passage is the reference to the woman whose desperate hunger leads her to devour her own children. This image of the loving mother who turns deadly is a staple of folk literature; it appears in the Bible as a symbol of the world turned upside down by war and famine (II Kings 6:25–29; Lamentations 2:20). It also fits with the broader prophetic portrait of the nation as a formerly beautiful and prosperous woman now degraded and suffering (Amos 4:1–3; 5:1–3; Lamentations 1:1).
The Jewish historian Josephus underscores the depth of suffering during the war against Rome in 66–70 <small>C. E.</small> with the story of a wealthy woman of pedigree, Mary the daughter of Eleazar of Bethezuba, who roasts and eats half of her nursing baby: “She proceeded to an act of outrage on nature. Seizing her child, an infant at the breast, ‘Poor babe,’ she cried, ‘amidst war, famine, and sedition, to what end should I preserve you?…Come, be food for me, to the rebels an avenging fury, and to the world a tale such as alone is wanting to the calamities of the Jews.’ With these words she slew her son, and then, having roasted the body and devoured half of it, she covered up and stored the remainder. At once the rebels were upon her and, scenting the unholy odor, threatened her with instant death unless she produced what she had prepared. Replying that she had reserved a goodly portion for them also, she disclosed the remnants of her child” (<i>The Jewish War</i> 6.3.4 §§ 205–213). Even the Roman soldiers shrank away in horror from this sight, and the whole city shuddered at the abomination.
The same motifs appear in BT <i>Yoma</i> 38b and Midrash <i>Eichah Rabbah</i> 2.23 in a story about an infant named Doeg ben Joseph: “Every day his mother would measure him by handbreadths and would give his [added] weight in gold to the Temple. And when the enemy prevailed, she slaughtered him and ate him; and concerning her Jeremiah lamented, ‘Shall the women eat their fruit, their new-born babes?’ (Lamentations 2:20). Whereupon the Holy Spirit replied: ‘Shall the priest and prophet be slain in the Sanctuary of יהוה?’ (Lamentations 2:20).” For the Rabbis, the horror of the mother’s actions parallels the divine outrage at the murder of Zechariah ben Jehoiada in the Temple, referred to in II Chronicles 24:20–22. Rabbinic attitudes toward women and their bodies are symbolic: the tender mother who cares for her child stands for the world as it ought to be, while the baby-devouring mother shows the world gone mad.

Nitzavim

 <i><b>You stand this day, all of you…from woodchopper to water drawer</b></i> (29:9–10). Midrash <i>Kohelet Rabbah</i> 1.12 teaches that these verses should have been placed at the beginning of Deuteronomy, directly following the initial statement, “These are the words that Moses addressed to all Israel on the other side of the Jordan” (1:1). In this midrash, the Rabbis include Deuteronomy 29:9–10 among other biblical verses cited to substantiate the rabbinic dictum that the Torah does not follow a chronological order (“There is no before and after in Scripture”). With this suggestion, the Rabbis accomplish two things. First, 29:9–10 clarifies that “all Israel” in 1:1 includes tribal heads, elders and officials, children and women, as well as strangers within the camp. Second, they stress that 29:9–10 is a direct address to the people Israel. Juxtaposing these two verses emphasizes that Moses addressed all Israel, and that all Israel stood present “to enter into the covenant of your God יהוה” (29:11).
<i><b>with those who are standing here with us this day…and with those who are not with us here this day</b></i> (29:14). This verse is part of Moses’ speech to the Israelites in Moab, but the Rabbis connected it with the revelation at Sinai (Exodus 20), where all Jews—present and future—are said to have participated in the revelation of Torah. According to Midrash <i>Sh’mot Rabbah</i> 28.6, the Rabbis wondered why the verb “standing” was not also used in the second part of the verse, which simply reads, “who are not with us.” They suggested that the Torah was referring to future prophets and sages, whose words of wisdom appear in later parts of the Written and Oral Torah, respectively, but who were not physically present at Sinai because they had not yet been born: “Those are the souls who will one day be created…. Since there is not yet any substance in them, the word ‘standing’ is not used with them.”
A similar tradition in BT <i>Sh’vuot</i> 39a uses 29:13–14 to teach that all future generations of Israel, including all future converts, were at Sinai. Although these traditions do not refer explicitly to women, <i>Sh’mot Rabbah</i> 28.2 affirms their presence. Noting an apparent redundancy in Exodus 19:3, "Thus shall you say to the house of Jacob and declare to the children of Israel,” the midrash asks why the Torah mentions both the house of Jacob and the children of Israel. The answer is that “the house of Jacob” refers to the women and “the children of Israel” refers to the men. Indeed, the midrash further imagines that God addressed the women first in order to prevent a repetition of the catastrophe in the Garden of Eden when God initially commanded Adam, but Eve (who had not heard God’s directive first-hand) transgressed “and spoiled the world.” God, therefore, addressed the women first so they would not also “nullify the Torah.”
<i><b>It is not in the heavens</b></i> (30:12). Midrash <i>D’varim Rabbah</i> 8.6 imagines a dialogue based on 30:12–14 in which the Israelites ask Moses, “If the Torah is not in the heavens, nor beyond the sea, where is it?” Moses answers, “It is in a place very near, in your mouth and in your heart that you may do it.” The emphasis on “doing” Torah, meaning living by it, is made clear by a rabbinic interpretation of Leviticus 26:3, “If you faithfully observe My commandments,” literally “If you keep My commandments and do them.” Midrash <i>Vayikra Rabbah</i> 35.7 teaches of those who learn Torah without “doing” Torah, that it would be better if they had not been born.
In a famous talmudic story known as the “Oven of Achnai” (JT <i>Mo’ed Katan</i> 3:1, 81c–d; BT <i>Bava M’tzia</i> 59a–b), in the midst of a legal dispute ostensibly about the ritual purity or impurity of an oven, Rabbi Yehoshua stands up and quotes this verse, proclaiming, “It [the Torah] is not in the heavens.” Despite miraculous evidence supporting the oven’s purity, Rabbi Yehoshua sides with the majority of the sages in declaring the oven impure. In doing so, he asserts that the Torah belongs to humanity (or at least to the Rabbis) here on earth—not “in the heavens.” Miracles and even divine proclamations cannot overturn a community’s ruling. Thus the Talmud teaches that although the Torah was given by God, it remains ours to interpret.

 <i><b>He said to them: I am now one hundred and twenty years old, I can no longer be active</b></i> (31:2). Some commentators could not imagine that Moses was deficient in any way. Ibn Ezra suggested that “I can no longer be active” meant that Moses could no longer wage war. A sage in BT <i>Sotah</i> 13b asserted that in his old age the “sources of wisdom” were stopped up for Moses to prevent his being troubled by the transfer of leadership to Joshua.
<i><b>Gather the people—men, women, children, and the strangers in your communities</b></i> (31:12). While the Rabbis apparently took for granted that the entire community of Israel was required to hear the divine “Teaching,” medieval interpreters (not usually known for their egalitarianism) wondered why the women were included. Rashi emphasized the distinction between the men and women: whereas the men were there to learn, the women were capable only of listening. <i>Tanna D’Vei Eliyahu,</i> a book of midrashim collected in the 10th century <small>C. E.</small>, uses this verse to prove that it is the man’s responsibility to ensure that every member of his household follows the law faithfully (p. 112). The medieval commentator Nachmanides disagreed, emphasizing in his comments on this verse that the women who were present also learned to fear God.
<i><b>When Moses had put down in writing the words of this Teaching to the very end</b></i> (31:24). What does this “Teaching” constitute? Most of the Rabbis understood it to refer to the entire Torah, although they debated whether Moses actually wrote the last eight verses of Deuteronomy that recount his death (see BT <i>Bava Batra</i> 14b–15a). This understanding of Mosaic authorship is present in the Dead Sea Scrolls, where quotations from the Torah are often introduced by “Moses said,” or “as written in the Book of Moses.” However, <i>Tanna D’Vei Eliyahu</i> specifically designates God as the author, maintaining that the Torah was composed before the creation of the world (p. 160) (see Midrash <i>B’reishit Rabbah</i> 1.1). According to this midrash, the divinely revealed words are only called the “Torah of Moses” on account of God’s great mercy toward Israel’s greatest prophet. Several early interpretations of the Bible, such as the pseudepigraphical book of Jubilees, note that the purpose of the writing down of the Law was to remind future generations of the terms of the covenant and of Israel’s obligations to fulfill it. The <i>Testament of Moses</i> 10:11, another pseudepigraphical book, emphasizes that it was now Joshua’s responsibility to keep the words and the book.
<i><b>Take this book of Teaching and place it beside the Ark of the Covenant…. Then Moses recited the words of the following poem to the very end</b></i> (31:26, 30). Rabbinic and medieval commentators wondered about the relationship between the “Teaching” <i>(torah;</i> 31:9, 11–12, 24, 26) and the “poem” <i>(shirah,</i> often translated by others as “Song”; 31:19, 21–22, 30). According to Midrash <i>Sifrei D’varim,</i> this <i>shirah</i> (Deuteronomy 32), in which Moses calls upon heaven and earth as witnesses, is known as the “Song of Moses.” Since 31:26 designates the Torah as witness against Israel, some of the Rabbis smoothed out the relationship between the “Teaching” and the “Song” by equating the two (see BT <i>Sanhedrin</i> 21b and BT <i>Chulin</i> 133a).
Although some commentaries interpret the poem as testimony by Moses <i>against</i> Israel, following the literal reading of 31:26, other rabbinic texts demonstrate that Moses frequently defended Israel to God. Thus, BT <i>B’rachot</i> 32a recalls that following the episode of the Golden Calf, God said, “Let Me alone and I will destroy them” (9:14); but Moses immediately “stood up, prayed vigorously, and begged for mercy” on Israel’s behalf. According to Midrash <i>D’varim Rabbah</i> 3.11, “Moses left no corner in heaven upon which he did not prostrate himself in prayer” on Israel’s behalf (also Midrash <i>Sh’mot Rabbah</i> 42.9). BT <i>Sanhedrin</i> 111a–b teaches that Moses continued to advocate for Israel, even after his death.
<i><b>Then Moses recited the words of the following poem</b></i> (31:30). The Rabbis speak of ten sublime “poems” (or “songs”; Heb. <i>shirah)</i> in the Hebrew Bible that mark central events in the history of the people of Israel; although they differ on the exact listing of the ten, they all include this poem (Midrash <i>M’chilta, B’shalach, Shirta</i> 1). Several of the other songs mentioned are specifically associated with women, including the Song of Miriam, in which she sang and led the women in dance (Exodus 15:20–21), and the Song of Deborah (Judges 5). Both celebrate Israel’s victories over its enemies. According to the <i>M’chilta, B’shalach, Shirta</i> 1, the tenth song will be recited in the messianic era: “Sing a new song to יהוה; / sing God’s praise, all the earth” (Isaiah 42:10).

 <i><b>Give ear, O heavens, let me speak</b></i> (32:1). Midrash <i>Sifrei D’varim</i> 306 imagines that in the future, Israel—personified as a woman—will implore God to listen to her confession of sins. She will say, “Master of the universe, I now see the places that I corrupted, and I am ashamed”; but God will reply, “I shall cause them to pass away.” She will continue, “Master of the universe, my name is linked with the <i>baalim</i> [foreign gods]”; but God will reply, “I shall cause it to pass away.” Israel will then point out that if a man divorces a woman and she marries another man, he may never remarry her (24:1–4). However, the Almighty will respond, “Have you been divorced from Me, O house of Israel?” Thus, the Rabbis interpret the moment of divine judgment as a time of repentance <i>(t’shuvah)</i> and reconciliation, in which the unfaithful Israel confesses her misdeeds and a loving God forgives her offenses and reaffirms their intimate relationship.
<i><b>Like an eagle who rouses its nestlings</b></i> (32:11). In <i>Sifrei D’varim</i> 314, the Rabbis expand on this biblical simile, comparing God to an eagle: “Just as the mother eagle does not enter her nest without first shaking her chicks with her wings, as she flies between one tree and another, between one bush and another, in order to rouse them so that they will be strong enough to receive her,” so also when the Holy One revealed the divine Presence in order to give the Torah to Israel, God did so “not from only one direction but from all four directions,” from Sinai, from Seir, from Mount Paran, and from Teman, to alert the people to the seriousness of the moment. Here the Sages evoke the <i>Shechinah,</i> the nurturing female aspect of the Divine, which is often described as drawing both converts and the faithful of Israel under her wings.
In this same midrashic passage, the Rabbis declare that 32:11 also alludes to other divine redemptions of Israel. In the second half of this verse, “So did [God] spread wings and take them” refers to Israel’s emancipation from slavery, recalling “how I bore you on eagles’ wings and brought you to Me” (Exodus 19:4). Similarly, the end of our verse, “Bear them along on pinions,” speaks of the future redemption when the nations “shall cradle your sons in their arms, / and carry your daughters on their shoulders” (Isaiah 49:22).
<i><b>You neglected the Rock who begot you</b></i> / <i><b>Forgot the God who labored to bring you forth</b></i> (32:18). Rabbinic interpreters were struck by the image of God—whose actions are generally described in male terms—as a woman in labor. They interpreted this verse as follows, “The Holy One…said to them, ‘You caused Me to feel like a male trying to give birth.’ If a woman about to give birth is sitting on the birth-stool, is she not anxious…? If she is in labor and giving birth for the first time, would she not be concerned…? If there are twins in her womb, would she not be uneasy…?” How much more so, “if it is a male, who does not ordinarily give birth but is trying to give birth, would not the pain be doubled and redoubled…?” Yet this is the extent to which God was prepared to labor and suffer out of love for Israel (<i>Sifrei D’varim</i> 319).
<i><b>The grapes for them are poison,</b></i> / <i><b>A bitter growth their clusters</b></i> (32:32). In <i>P’sikta D’Rav Kahana</i> 20.6, this verse figures in a long debate over the correct identification of the forbidden fruit that Eve and Adam ate in the Garden of Eden (Genesis 3). According to one of the Rabbis, this verse proves that the fruit was grapes, since “those clusters that Adam ate brought bitterness into the world.”
<i><b>through it you shall long endure</b></i> (32:47). In its interpretation of this verse, <i>Sifrei D’varim</i> 336 observes that the study of Torah yields a double reward: one enjoys the fruit in this world and prolongs one’s days in the world-to-come. The midrash goes on to teach that this concept of a twofold recompense also applies to those who honor their fathers and mothers, as well as to people who devote themselves to establishing peace. The midrashic passage concludes with a consolatory prophecy for the days to come: “All your children shall be taught by יהוה, and great shall be the happiness of your children” (Isaiah 54:13).

V'Zot HaBerachah

 <i><b>May Reuben live and not die</b></i> (33:6). In his farewell blessing to the tribes of Israel, Moses first mentions the tribe of Reuben, descended from Jacob’s eldest son. His benediction for Reuben is expressed in biblical poetic parallelism. To the modern reader this may seem redundant, since it expresses the same idea twice, albeit in different words. For the Rabbis, however, this apparent repetition was an opportunity for interpretation. They noticed that while the first half of the verse expresses the hope that Reuben would live, the second half states that he should not die. Both of these outcomes are positive for Reuben, but the former is phrased in upbeat language, whereas the latter uses negative terminology. Midrash <i>Sifrei D’varim</i> 347 finds different meanings in these linguistic nuances. Thus, the first phrase is said to refer to Reuben’s reward for convincing his brothers not to treat Joseph as harshly as they would have liked (Genesis 37:22). The second half of the verse points to a death penalty decreed for Reuben that has been reversed (“not die”), referring to the punishment that Reuben deserved for having sexual relations with Bilhah, his father’s concubine and the mother of some of his brothers (Genesis 35:22). However, a prominent rabbinic tradition teaches that Reuben atoned for this sin and the decree of death was lifted. This midrash from <i>Sifrei D’varim</i> appears to link these two biblical incidents and implies that Reuben’s good actions in one situation helped to atone for his bad actions in the other.
<b><i>So Moses the servant of</i> יהוה’ <i>died there</i></b> (34:5). A medieval <i>piyut</i> (liturgical poem) begins with the words <i>Azlat Yocheved</i> (“Jochebed went out”), referring to Moses’ mother (Exodus 6:20). This <i>piyut</i> is part of the Italian prayer tradition for the holiday of Simchat Torah, when the final Torah portion, including the account of the death of Moses, is read. (While there are no known midrashic parallels for the symbolic ideas in this <i>piyut,</i> it shares common motifs with rabbinic traditions, including a narrative about Moses’ death found in <i>Avot D’Rabbi Natan</i> A 12, in which the angel of death, Samael, is the protagonist, rather than Jochebed.) In the <i>piyut,</i> Jochebed heart-rendingly searches for her son. She has heard of his death but refuses to accept that Moses has actually died. Understandably, a mother would not to want to learn that her son had preceded her in death. However, Jochebed’s refusal to believe in Moses’ demise is complicated by the fact that only God knows the circumstances of his death and his burial place. This <i>piyut</i> describes Jochebed traversing the world, including Egypt and various other pivotal places in Moses’ life, searching for him. In her travels, she asks inanimate objects to tell her the whereabouts of her son. Her quest, of course, is unsuccessful, because he is, in fact already dead and buried.
The theme of the poem <i>“Azlat Yocheved”</i> is based on the rabbinic premise that Jochebed outlived her son Moses, who was 120 years old at his death (34:7). Jochebed’s long life is discussed in a rabbinic midrash in <i>Seder Olam</i> 9, where she is described as surviving all of her children and entering the land of Israel at the age of 250.
<b><i>[God] buried him in the valley in the land of Moab</i></b> (34:6). A midrashic tradition physically connects the burial place of Moses, who was interred alone, to the graves of Abraham and Sarah in the Cave of Machpelah (Genesis 25:10). According to <i>Sifrei D’varim</i> 357, the two sites were linked by an underground tunnel.
Moses’ grave is unknown to human beings but it is known to God. In fact, according to 34:6, Moses was buried by God. BT <i>Sotah</i> 14a explains that the Torah is framed by two divine demonstrations of loving-kindness. The charitable act in the beginning was “clothing the naked.” This was fulfilled when God “made outfits out of skin for Adam and his wife, and clothed them” (Genesis 3:21). The loving-kindness at the end of the Torah was “burying the dead,” God’s final act of caring for Moses. According to rabbinic sources (BT <i>Shabbat</i> 127a), preparing the dead for burial is one of the ten ethical obligations for which there is no measure and whose reward is without measure.

Contemporary Reflection

Bereshit

 T<small>HE ANCIENT</small> B<small>ABYLONIAN MYTH</small> (or foundational story) that strongly resembles Genesis 1 has one great dissimilarity from it: in that myth, creation begins with a murder. The goddess Tiamat—cognate to our word <i>t’hom</i> (watery chaos, 1:2)—is slain by the hero-god Marduk; and the universe is carved out of her body. Violence there is inextricable from the process of creation. In Genesis 1, however, creation entails no destruction. Even the primal watery abyss is not completely obliterated but lingers at the bottom of the sea to reappear in many a psalm or story. The drawing of distinctions and boundaries that marks both accounts is in Genesis 1 peaceful and harmonious.
God distinguishes elements of the original watery chaos by drawing boundaries between them and naming them: light and darkness, day and night. Created elements are not simple oppositions. They are both distinct and akin. Juxtaposed verses emphasize the parallels between elements. There are waters above and waters below. Between them stretch a solid expanse of earth and a solid expanse of firmament. The earth brings forth grasses and trees. The sky is strewn with lights. The sea and the air bring forth swarms of living things, schools of fish, flocks of birds, clouds of insects. The earth births its many creatures, joyously productive, mirroring the water and the air.
The creation of humankind continues these dual themes of distinction and similarity. Not one but two words underline the likeness between <i>adam</i> (the earthling) and its Maker. Humankind bears the <i>tzelem</i> (image) and <i>d’mut</i> (resemblance) of the divine Creator, although in contrast to God’s oneness, they are several. They are also distinguished from one another: <i>zachar</i> (which means “male” but is also a word related to “remember”), the bearer of the male member, and <i>n’kevah</i> (which means “female” but is also a word related to “piercing”), the pierced one. In Genesis 3 the two will become a hierarchy, but in Genesis 1, they are presented as equals. Both bear the divine image and semblance, both are adjured to “be fruitful and multiply, fill the earth and tame it, and hold sway…over all the earth” (1:28).
<i>Adam</i> is the only creature whose sexuality the text notes—that is, describes as male and female. This suggests a sexuality unlike that of the animals. Moreover in both 1:27 and a summary in 5:1–3, the mention of <i>adam</i>’s maleness and femaleness is immediately followed by the proclamation of its divine image, as if our diverse sexualities and our kinship with God were linked. Rather than our sexualities being <i>dissimilar</i> to God or excluded from the divine image, they seem to <i>point toward</i> some element in the divine nature, some divine attribute—creativity or delight, perhaps, or the longing for an Other—for which our embodied sexuality is the metaphor.
Genesis 2 and 3 tell a darker tale. Here we learn why <i>adam</i> is called <i>adam.</i> Multiple puns are evoked by the name: kinship with <i>adamah</i> (earth or soil) out of which <i>adam</i> is fashioned, association with the color red (<i>adom)</i> like the ruddy sunburnt skin of the worker and the red earth he was created to till, and resonance with blood (<i>dam),</i> the red life-fluid. Unlike in Genesis 1, however, in 2:7–3:20 the term <i>adam</i> refers to the man. The woman is never called <i>adam</i> but only <i>ishah</i> (woman), “for this one is taken from man” (2:23). Together they are <i>ha-adam v’ishto,</i> “the human and his woman,” for the first man represents both the male particular and the generically human.
As the verb “built” (2:22) attests, the creation of woman differs from other creations. The dual <i>adam</i> of Genesis 1 is created (<i>bara)</i> by divine word, and the <i>adam</i> of Genesis 2 is fashioned or molded (<i>yatzar)</i> by a divine potter. The woman is constructed <i>(banah)</i> out of part of an existing creation. An afterthought, created when <i>adam</i> finds the animals unsatisfactory for mating, she is meant to be <i>ezer k’negdo,</i> literally “a helper over against him,” that is, opposite him or corresponding to him. The ambiguity in the expression foreshadows an ambivalent relationship. Is she against him or for him? A challenger or an “other” who mirrors him and merges with him? Awakening, <i>adam</i> claims her as part of himself: “bone of my bone, flesh of my flesh” (2:23). He does not appear to recognize her otherness, nor does he address her. Her only recorded conversations are first with the serpent and then with God. Finally, at the end of the chapter, <i>adam</i> names her as he previously named the animals. It does not occur to him to ask her what she calls herself.
Genesis 1 is an account of the Creation, whereas Genesis 2–3 is an account of the creation of patriarchy—a remarkably truthful account. The world brought about by Genesis 2–3 is one in which desire is no longer joyful but oppressive. Even before the disobedience, relations between man and woman and world are commodified and function-based. <i>Adam</i> is created to till the soil. Woman is created to help <i>Adam.</i> However lush, the garden is a workplace. Created things are good, not intrinsically as in Genesis 1, but because they are resources. The Garden is described as prime real estate, rich in water and in trees, and adjacent to lands rich in gold and gemstones. Everything is viewed extractively. The forbidden fruit is presented as the epitome of desire in terms not of intrinsic value but of what it is good <i>for:</i> “good to eat,” “alluring to the eyes,” “desirable for insight” (3:6).
Woman’s desire for man ensures her subjugation and her anguish (3:16). Man’s desire is not even mentioned. He is exhausted by the effort to pull from the ground what can be consumed before descending into the ground and being consumed by it. Adam and Eve are alienated from each other, from the earth, from their labors, from the rest of creation.
The world of patriarchy cries out for mending. A mending world would commit itself to equality and power-sharing, to working cooperatively in order to fill needs and solve problems. At one again with the rest of Creation, perhaps we would even learn not to resent our mortality so bitterly. Reunited also with the rest of creation, men and women could learn again to be “loving friends”—as the traditional rabbinic wedding blessing portrays them.

Noach

 <small>GENESIS BEGINS</small> with God’s creation of the world by word alone: <i>God said, “Let there be light!”</i> (1:3). At the end of Genesis 1, <i>God surveyed all that [God] had made, and look—it was very good!</i> With language God created the world, separated the waters above from the waters below, named, judged, and expressed great satisfaction with the results. But by the end of <i>parashat B’reishit,</i> we read that יהוה <i>saw how great was the wickedness of human beings.…So</i> יהוה <i>thought: “I will wipe the humans whom I created from off the face of the earth"</i> (6:5–7).
In <i>parasht Noach,</i> what sin had the people committed to warrant the Flood? The fact that so many different answers have been offered suggests that there is no clear answer. Some interpreters say that the wrongdoing was miscegenation: the interbreeding between the sons of God and the daughters of mankind (6:1–4). Others in traditional sources postulate that it was the sin of refusing to have children—indeed, even Noah waited until he was 500 years old to have his first child.
For all the various theories about the precise nature of the sin, it is clear that the Flood’s essential purpose was to cleanse Creation of the flaw that led to its corruption. And yet, from the time of the Ark’s landing on dry land, God demonstrates an awareness that some essential flaw persists. God says: <i>Never again will I bring doom upon the world on account of what people do, though the human mind inclines to evil from youth onward</i> (8:21). Why does the human mind incline to evil? What is the flaw in the human mind? While the questions are not explicitly answered, we can nevertheless find answers in our tradition.
Many commentators have criticized Noah for not challenging God about the planned destruction, as Abraham later does when God reveals the plan to destroy Sodom and Gomorrah (18:17–33). Readers over the ages have been puzzled by Noah’s silence. But his silence is precisely the point. Nearly the entire portion of <i>Noach</i> is filled with God’s speech and Noah’s actions—but not words. From his building the ark through the entire Flood, Noah utters not a single word. When Noah finally speaks after being <i>awakened from his wine</i> (9:24), his words disclose the problem: he <i>understood what his youngest son had done to him, so he said “Damned be Canaan! To his brothers he shall be the basest of slaves!"</i> (9:24–25).
So Noah’s first words neither praise God, nor express gratitude, nor ask for help, nor proclaim justice. Instead, he uses language to curse and to set up the differentiated love that will plague all the offspring of Genesis—from Ishmael and Isaac to Esau and Jacob, and to Joseph and his brothers. By “differentiated love” I mean love that is given to one person and withheld from another.
Noah’s first words show what might be an essential flaw in creation, leading to destruction in this parashah. As we read in Proverbs 18:21, <i>death and life are in the power of the tongue.</i> We have already seen the creative power of language in Genesis 1. Now it becomes clear that one sin causing the Flood was the abuse of language. In a way, we have always known that, as the Confession for the Day of Atonement lists many forms of language: idle talk, offensive speech, foolish talk, slander, passing judgment, plotting, talebearing, and swearing falsely. Each of these offenses involves some abuse of language.
In <i>parashat Noach,</i> the inherent flaw is made clear. Noah’s words form a curse; moreover, even when he comes to bless (9:27), he does so comparatively, blessing one son at the expense of another son’s son, relegating his grandson Canaan to the role of slave. But love should not be comparative, quantifiable, or conditional.
God acknowledges the power of human language in the very next story, the episode of the Tower of Babel (Genesis 11). This time God, in order to restrain the people who are reaching out to heaven, confuses the language. God is thus undermining their capacity to use language in a destructive fashion (11:1–6).
From Noah’s words and the people’s words when they attempt to build their tower, we learn that the language that survives the devastation of the Flood is that of differentiated love, competition, hatred, cursing, and revenge across generations. God’s action at Babel is an attempt to heal the flaw of the sin at Babel by multiplying languages: perhaps somewhere among the new tongues would emerge a vision of reality that transcends the destructive, condemning words carried forward in the ark.
Our own experience verifies the lesson of the sin of the Flood. We know how language can kill. We have seen the medical charts on which a doctor has scribbled “untreatable,” thereby sealing a patient’s fate. We have labeled a plant in our garden a “weed,” thus sealing its fate.
Silence, then, might be a virtue. During the long days of the Flood and its aftermath, Noah did well, being silent. His silence reminds us of the better part of Job’s comforters who initially <i>sat with him on the ground seven days and seven nights. None spoke a word to him for they saw how very great was his suffering</i> (Job 2:13). Once they began to speak, though, their words brought only discomfort, and finally God rebuked them: <i>for you have not spoken the truth about Me as did My servant Job</i> (42:7).
What lessons may we draw from this juxtaposition of silence and language? Is human speech invariably destructive? Where can we find the language that blesses, heals, and even creates? Again, the model is within this parashah, when God responds.
God restricts divine power, saying: <i>Never again will I bring doom upon the world on account of what people do</i> (Genesis 8:21); God restores blessings: <i>God then blessed Noah and his sons saying to them, “Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth”</i> (9:1); and God enters into covenant with all living creatures: <i>I am going to establish My covenant with you and your descendants after you, and with every living being in your care</i> (9:9–10).
God’s words and actions in the aftermath of destruction show us how we can use language to repair relationships, instruct others, forgive, and bless.

Lech Lecha

Is S<small>ARAH PART OF</small> the <i>b’rit</i> (the covenant) that God establishes with Abraham? While our impulse might well be: “How can you ask such a question? <i>Of course</i> Sarah was part of the covenant,” the details of the text force the question upon us. From the opening words calling Abraham to leave his homeland, and throughout this parashah, God speaks directly with Abraham, not with Sarah. Most dramatically, the sign of the <i>b’rit</i> in Genesis 17 is circumcision, clearly a male-only ritual.
One could argue that this ritual established a covenant only between God and Abraham, and Abraham’s male descendants, and that women stood outside this religious cult altogether. Perhaps Sarah and the other matriarchs had their own religious practices and traditions, their own way of relating to God. Or, perhaps, they were passive members of this covenant between God and the men, valued as child-bearers, but otherwise on the periphery.
Let us consider another way to read the text. The critical element of the <i>b’rit</i> is the promise that Abraham will be fruitful and become the father of nations. Women’s role as childbearers is therefore not ancillary but central to meaning of the covenant. And, while God does not address Sarah directly in Genesis 17, God refers to her and changes Sarah’s name just like Abraham’s—with the addition of the letter <i>heh</i> and with a parallel explanation: “she shall give rise to nations; rulers of peoples shall issue from her” (17:16).
Even when Abraham doubts Sarah’s ability to bear children and suggests that God’s covenant continue through Ishmael, God reassures him that the covenant will pass through Sarah’s son, Isaac. Thus, God makes it clear that not <i>all</i> of Abraham’s descendants are part of this covenant, <i>only the ones of Sarah.</i> This underscores Sarah’s crucial role; it makes Sarah and Abraham, physically speaking, equal partners in the covenant.
In a sense, the greatest “sign” of this covenant is the fulfillment of God’s promise that Sarah will bear a child. Sarah’s pregnancy and Isaac’s birth are tangible proof that God fulfills promises—and will similarly fulfill the other promises. Perhaps women after Sarah, as the ones bearing life, carry on the covenant between God and Abraham and Sarah’s descendants in the most basic, physical way. Maybe circumcision is a male ritual to include men in a physical way in the covenant that women make real in their flesh when they bear the next generation.
This view has its own problems. Women of every nation bear children; how can childbearing be an essential characteristic or sign of a particular covenant? And what about women who will not bear children? Are they excluded from the covenant?
We need to look further. Scholars such as Savina Teubal argue that the world described in the Torah was preceded by a matriarchal system in which women held significant power, perhaps as priestesses. The decisive role of the matriarchs in determining the transmission of this male covenant (through Isaac and later Jacob) might be a trace from a time of greater female power (<i>Sarah the Priestess: The First Matriarch of Genesis,</i> 1984). Such intriguing possibilities open up different ways of understanding the Torah and our earliest history.
But regardless of its origins, Jews today understand the <i>b’rit</i> to include boys and girls, men and women. Numerous rituals have evolved to welcome baby girls into the covenant. Today, many Jews would not consider <i>not</i> having a <i>b’rit bat</i> ritual to welcome their daughter into the covenant. In some communities, a particular ritual provides the norm. In others, parents decide on the ritual, often together with the rabbi.
One covenant ceremony for girls is a simple footwashing ritual often referred to as <i>B’rit R’chitzah</i> (the Covenant of Washing) or <i>B’rit N’tilat Raglayim</i> (the Covenant of Washing Feet). This ritual was first imagined into being by a small group of female rabbis and rabbinical students I participated in, at a retreat in Princeton in 1981. Eventually, this group crafted a ritual that continues to be used by individuals and communities in the United States, Israel, and other countries.
This idea—of washing a baby girl’s feet to welcome her into the covenant between the Jewish people and God—grew out of our reading of Genesis 17–18. Immediately after the covenant in Genesis 17, when Abraham is circumcised, Abraham invites three visitors passing by for a meal (18:1–15). He washes their feet, a sign of welcome in his own day. Abraham’s guests, who prove to be God’s messengers, announce the future birth of Isaac.
Abraham’s act of washing his guests’ feet, as a sign of welcome, therefore, is closely associated with the original establishment of the <i>b’rit</i> in Genesis 17. Washing the baby’s feet allows us to introduce water into the ritual, and to make the association with Miriam’s Well, <i>mikveh</i> (ritual bath), and the healing, nurturing power of its <i>mayim chayim</i> (fresh water, literally “living waters”). The ritual includes readings and music that bring out these motifs and involves the parents as well. Usually the formal naming of the baby follows, with blessings over wine, as at a male circumcision. This ritual, simple and gentle, lends itself to individual adaptation and creativity (see “The Covenant of Washing: A Ceremony to Welcome Baby Girls Into the Covenant of Israel,” <i>Menorah,</i> IV/3–4, May 1983).
Was Sarah part of the covenant? For centuries, Jews have looked to Sarah as the first of our foremothers. Women’s <i>tekhines</i> (petitionary prayers) have called upon the God of Sarah, and pleaded in Sarah’ name on women’s behalf. As the covenant continues to be fulfilled by the commitment of every new generation of Jews, the impassioned voices of Jewish women bring forth Sarah’s voice in our own time, with new clarity. Today we can celebrate a rediscovered Sarah as the mother of the covenant we the Jewish people share with God.
Even if <i>b’rit bat</i> rituals have not always been part of Jewish tradition, they are so today. Mothers who were welcomed into the covenant with such ceremonies now perform these same rituals with their own babies. Generations from now, Jews may be surprised to learn that baby girls were not always welcomed into the covenant with a ritual <i>b’rit bat.</i> As contemporary men and women today, we can look forward to seeing such rituals flourish and evolve in the years ahead.

Vayera

T<small>HIS EXTRAORDINARILY RICH PARASHAH</small> is filled with violence—not just the obvious and dramatic violence of the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah and the incipient violence of the binding of Isaac, but also various, more ordinary, forms of violence against women. Half-buried in the vivid description of the people of Sodom gathering around Lot’s house and demanding the strangers staying with him is Lot’s reply, “Look—I have two daughters who have never been intimate with a man; let me bring them out for you, and do to them as you please. But do nothing to these men, for they have come under the shelter of my roof” (19:8). While a later midrash will see Lot’s offer as evidence that he was infected by the wickedness of Sodom and picture him as having been punished (<i>Tanchuma Vayeira</i> 12), the biblical text offers no explicit judgment on his behavior. The violence of the people of Sodom merits the destruction of the city, but the willingness of Lot to see his daughters assaulted and raped is apparently unworthy of comment.
At the beginning of Genesis 20, we have another form of violence: the second of two stories (or two versions of the same story; see 12:10–20) in which Abraham seeks to pass off his wife Sarah as his sister in order to protect himself. In this passage, Abimelech, king of Gerar, seizes Sarah, but her potential rape is averted when God keeps Abimelech from touching her. The similar tale will be repeated once again in relation to Isaac and Rebekah (26:6–11). The three-fold reiteration of the narrative suggests that it might serve as a paradigm of the situation of Jewish women. The first two male ancestors of the Jews, perceiving themselves as “other” and therefore endangered in foreign lands, use their wives as buffers between themselves and the larger culture. The women become the “others’ other,” the ones whose safety and well-being can be sacrificed in order to save the patriarchs’ skins. The story names a pattern that becomes a recurring part of Jewish history: male Jews, subordinated by the dominant culture, in turn subordinate women within their own cultures, doubling the otherness that partly mirrors their own. As in the case of Lot’s offering his daughters to the people of Sodom, the biblical text offers no comment on or protest against this situation. Unlike when God appears to Abimelech in a dream and threatens him with death unless he releases Sarah (Genesis 12), God does not explicitly chastise Abraham or Lot.
Then, in Genesis 21, we meet still another form of violence—this time Sarah’s violence against Hagar. After Sarah bears Isaac in her old age, she tells Abraham to throw the slave girl Hagar and her son Ishmael out of the house, so that Ishmael will not share in his father’s inheritance along with Isaac. The violence that is practiced by Abraham against Sarah, she now recapitulates in relation to the most vulnerable person in her own household. Thus, the cycle of abuse goes on. In this context, not only does the text not judge Sarah, but God is explicitly on her side, telling Abraham to listen to Sarah because her son Isaac will be the bearer of the covenantal line.
This Torah portion makes clear that our ancestors are by no means always models of ethical behavior that edify and inspire us. On the contrary, often the Torah holds up a mirror to the ugliest aspects of human nature and human society. It provides us with opportunities to look honestly at ourselves and the world we have created, to reflect on destructive patterns of human relating, and to ask how we might address and change them. In Lot’s treatment of his daughters—and in the Torah’s lack of comment on that treatment—can we see the casual acceptance, indeed the invisibility, of violence against women that is so ubiquitous in many cultures, including our own? In Abraham’s seeming lack of concern about the fate of Sarah, can we see the ways in which marginalized peoples are all too liable to duplicate patterns of subordination from which they themselves have suffered? In Sarah’s banishment of Hagar, can we see the horizontal violence that oppressed people visit on each other as they jockey for what seems to them limited resources, rather than making common cause against the forces that suppress them? And what do we do when we see ourselves enacting these patterns in our own personal and political lives? How do we respond to and interrupt them?
It is striking that throughout the portion, God is implicated in the violence in the text. Except in the case of Lot’s willingness to sacrifice his daughters, God carries out or commands the violence (Sodom and Gomorrah; Isaac) or supports it (Abraham and Sarah; Sarah and Hagar). The representations of violence that the text holds up to us are ones on which the human and divine levels mirror each other. There is no cosmic relief, so to speak, from the reality of violence. Abraham’s challenge to God over the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah can thus be seen as a question to both God and ourselves. “Must not the Judge of all the earth do justly?” Abraham asks God. “Will You indeed sweep away the innocent along with the wicked?” (18:23). The implication of these questions is that it is the judge of all the earth who creates the ethical norms that Abraham reflects back to God and to which he holds God answerable. But the moral voice in this passage is Abraham’s voice. What happens to that moral vision two chapters later when Abraham betrays his wife Sarah? Can we read these narratives in ways that strengthen our resolve to hold both ourselves and God accountable to standards of justice that we recognize and value—and yet continually violate?

Chayei Sara

“A<small>ND</small> A<small>BRAHAM</small> P<small>ROCEEDED</small> to mourn for Sarah and to bewail her” (Genesis 23:2). With this verse, our parashah invites us to consider the history of a significant yet often obscured tradition in women’s discourse, namely, mourning.
In this parashah we have the first account of mourning (even though death has figured prominently earlier). Here a woman, Sarah, is mourned, and the mourner is a man, Abraham her husband. Yet sources disclose that in the ancient world the act of mourning was typically associated with women. Margaret Alexiou’s landmark study, <i>The Ritual Lament in Greek Tradition</i> (1974), calls attention to the gendered characteristics of mourning practices and language. Throughout antiquity, in both Greek and Middle Eastern cultures, the lament—a standard feature of ritual life—belonged largely to women who gathered to lead the community in the rites of grief. In the Bible, just as in the Classical tradition, the lament was associated with the feminine. The book of Jeremiah lets us hear the bitter weeping of Rachel, mourning over her absent children (Jeremiah 31:15). That book also conspicuously presents songs of communal loss as a maternal legacy; because of disaster, the prophet instructs the women thus: “Teach your daughters wailing, and one another lamentation” (Jeremiah 9:19). When the world splits open, when history fails, the feminine voice is made audible.
The Bible does not preserve actual descriptions of mourning rituals or women’s laments. What we do have is the book of Lamentations, a national lament, in which—as is common in laments—the poet repeatedly appropriates a female persona, singing as if a woman: “My children are forlorn, / For the foe has prevailed” (1:16). Composed in response to the destruction of Jerusalem (586 <small>B. C.E.</small>) at the hands of the Neo-Babylonian army, Lamentations chronicles a nation’s effort to know itself in the aftermath of a profound severing of its relation to God—the divine principle that confers meaning upon the social order. And in this book, catastrophe is repeatedly gendered. The female is the subject reciting the lament; she is also the object of exploitation, since to the poet the feminine body represents the site of social disrepair. In this way, Lamentations provides yet another textual example of the widespread symbol of nation-as-woman, ever vulnerable to foreign invasion. Women are cast as the ideal speakers of loss and rupture, for that is a condition which they embody.
Lamentations opens with a cluster of images figuring Jerusalem as an abandoned woman; she is likened variously to a slave, a fallen princess, and a widow—an <i>almanah,</i> a term Alan Mintz points out “designates not so much a woman who has lost her husband as the social status of a woman who has no legal protector and who may thus be abused with impunity” (<i>Reading Hebrew Literature,</i> 2002, p. 24). Indeed, <i>almanah</i> may be etymologically linked to the Hebrew verb that means to be mute or dumb (with the letters <i>aleph, lamed,</i> and <i>mem</i>). This association deepens our sense of the widow as one who cannot speak on her own behalf. Focusing on the structures of meaning in the Hebrew Bible, Elaine Scarry identifies a crucial division between God manifested as a <i>voice</i> and humanity as <i>embodied:</i> “To have a body is to be creatable,…and woundable. To have no body, to have only a voice, is to be none of these things; it is to be the wounder but not oneself woundable” (<i>The Body in Pain,</i> 1985, p. 206). The distinction is central to Lamentations, where “daughter Zion” is represented, especially in the first chapters, as virtually all body, broken and disabled.
Turning to the post-biblical period, women continue to dominate in the mention of laments. Rabbinic tractates include a few such references. For example, in Mishnah <i>K’tubot</i> (4:4), Rabbi Yehuda rules that even the poorest husband must provide one lament-singing woman for his wife’s funeral, as a minimum display of honor. In the Talmud, we find a suite of poetic fragments which suggest that the lament, as a standard feature of ritual life, belonged largely to the women who gathered to lead the community in the rites. Attributed to the sage Raba, we read: “The women of Shkanziv say: ‘Woe for his leaving / woe for our grieving’” (BT <i>Moed Katan</i> 28b). To this day, Yemenite and Kurdistani women living in Israel continue to assume a large role in mourning the dead in their communities. (See Susan Sered, <i>Women as Ritual Experts,</i> 1992.)
In Western culture, meanwhile, the genre of lament has become a useful frame for women poets. Dahlia Ravikovitch, who emerged as an important Israeli poet during the 1950s, has been described as a “lamenting poetess in the ancient biblical tradition” (Shirley Kaufman et al., eds., <i>Hebrew Feminist Poems,</i> 1999, p. 13). A particularly beautiful and haunting example of Ravikovitch’s contribution to the genre may be found in her poem “They Required a Song of Us.” The poem begins with a line from another well-known Israeli poet, Lea Goldberg, who asks: “How shall we sing a song of Zion / when we have not even begun to hear?” Like Goldberg’s query, Ravikovitch’s poem meditates on Psalm 137, a famous expression of exilic despair in the Bible, where the speaker asks: “How can we sing a song of יהוה on alien soil?” Ravikovitch answers this ancient query by recognizing the need for a new kind of utterance: “Sing intimate songs / that the soul shies away from singing…” (Tal Nizan, ed., <i>With an Iron Pen: Hebrew Protest Poetry 1984—2004,</i> 2005).
Turning to twentieth-century Jewish American poetry, we find new variations on the lament in the work of Adrienne Rich. Wrestling with the expressive limitations of other forms of poetic mourning, Rich writes of her frustration in “A Woman Dead In Her Forties.” Here the speaker first confronts the genre of lament’s potential inadequacy, feeling “half-afraid” to write a lament for one who did not “read it much”—and then gropes for an alternative: “from here on I want,” she writes, “more crazy mourning, more howl, more keening” (<i>Facts on a Doorframe,</i> 2002, p. 255). This discontent compels Rich to reactivate the lament in her 1991 volume <i>An Atlas of the Difficult World.</i> In a later collection, written in the aftermath of the Gulf War crisis (1991–92), Rich longs to convey what she knows to be true: that poetry can be a powerful, socially constitutive force for reconfiguring community (<i>What is Found There,</i> 1993, p. xiv). Poets such as Merle Feld, Esther Broner, and Penina Adelman also explore the power of mourning. Their versions of lament, along with Rich’s, alert us to the reconstructive possibilities of an ancient biblical form.

Toldot

T<small>HIS TORAH PORTION PRESENTS</small> the second of three matriarchs who suffer barrenness. In this episode Rebekah and Isaac are unable to conceive for the first twenty years of their marriage (25:20, 26). The Torah uses barren couples as a literary device to demonstrate the miraculous nature of the conception of the patriarchs and the beneficence of God. Infertility in the twenty-first century tells a different story: overworked and overstressed women, late marriage, and perhaps environmental toxins that inhibit reproduction.
The economy and culture of Rebekah’s Canaan and our society are worlds apart, yet the emotional reaction to infertility has remained largely unchanged. While suffering from her difficult pregnancy, Rebekah cries out, <i>“Im ken lamah zeh anochi?</i> (If this is so, why do I exist?)” Rebekah herself utters these words after she becomes pregnant. But many Jews ask such a question earlier, when they face difficulty conceiving and bringing a pregnancy to term. Aspiring parents today often suffer a crisis of meaning. Women and men who face infertility may experience devastating depression, anger, jealousy, and deep existential angst. It might seem that feminism would have liberated women from expectations of motherhood. After all, feminists of our age take pride that we are not limited by the narrow definitions of womanhood that characterized Rebekah’s milieu. Yet even in our liberated modern age, women and men usually see biological parenthood as a necessary rite of passage without which they are not considered full adults. Generating a child is a signifier of “true womanhood” and “real manhood” to many. Barrenness remains a social stigma—particularly in the Jewish community, which holds that the first <i>mitzvah</i> in the Torah is <i>p’ru u-rvu</i> (be fruitful and multiply).
Full integration and acceptance in the Jewish community often revolve around family life. The Jewish community has grown more open to gay and lesbian families in recent years largely because many such couples have been able to become parents—some through adoption or prior heterosexual reproduction, and more recently through artificial insemination. Yet adults in their thirties, forties, and fifties without children—regardless of their marital status and sexual orientation—remain outsiders in all but the most avant-garde synagogues and activist Jewish organizations. Childless adults treated as full participants in Jewish life remain the exception, and thus the Jewish community tends to lose these people from the rolls of temple membership.
What of the Jewish championing of classic feminist ideas that a woman is much more than a baby machine; that anatomy is not destiny; that a woman defines herself not primarily through her family but through her deeds and ideas? Even today, motherhood and fatherhood in the Jewish community are both idealized and romanticized. Now as much as ever, family and parenthood are the primary cultural institution where individuals look to find personal fulfillment, happiness, and love. Most contemporary Jews cannot imagine finding such rewards without children; many find it difficult to consider doing so without their own genetic children to realize the wish to pass Judaism, love, and genes <i>mi-dor l’dor</i> (from generation to generation).
Our community has done only an adequate job providing support for the infertile. Chapters on infertility in mainstream Jewish parenting books remain either absent or in the non-normative category even though infertility is rife. Nina Beth Cardin has written <i>Tears of Sorrow, Seeds of Hope</i> (second edition, 2007), a spiritual companion for those grieving infertility, pregnancy loss, or stillbirth. This book belongs in every Jewish library, and in time, its messages will perhaps pervade Jewish culture. Yet even in this book adoption is discussed only as a last and unfavorable alternative.
Meanwhile, responsa literature and halachic interpretations have strongly supported artificial insemination and <i>in vitro</i> fertilization for heterosexual couples facing infertility because of the strong drive for Jewish continuity. Such a notion of Jewish continuity is not only religious, but also biological. There is more support in the Jewish institutional world than in Christian communities for reproductive technologies, apparently because many Jews believe Judaism is inherited as much as taught.
The definition of family in the Jewish world, it seems, clings to a model of parents who have genetic offspring. For example, in a study reported in 1991, researchers who surveyed a sample of male college students found that the Jews considered it more important than did the Christians that children be conceived by themselves and their spouse, rather than adopted.
Bonnie Ellen Baron and Lawrence Baron refer to that survey in the ground-breaking book <i>Lifecycles,</i> edited by Rabbi Debra Orenstein (1994). In their article “On Adoption” they explain that while there are some biblical precedents for adoption (Mordecai was guardian of Esther; Sarah initially seeks to adopt Hagar’s son), Judaism never has strongly encouraged it. They speculate that “Jewish law lacks a formal procedure for adoption because of the primacy it accords biological kinship in determining a child’s inheritance rights and religious and tribal status” (p. 28). This is true in spite of the primacy of <i>tikkun olam</i> as a deeply embedded value among Jews. How can we identify ourselves as a community of <i>tikkun</i> (repair) without a commitment to adopt children who languish around the world without loving parents?
Adoption support is rarely modeled by Jewish leaders. A remarkable exception is Yosef Abramowitz and Rabbi Susan Silverman, a couple who direct Jewish Family and Life! and began a family with biological offspring but also fulfilled a dream to adopt two children born in Ethiopia.
<i>“Im ken Lamah zeh anochi?</i> (If this is so, why do I exist?)” was Rebekah’s question that continues to bedevil Jewish adults who hope to parent but are unable to carry a pregnancy to term. Has feminism not brought us better questions and better answers? Have modern, forward-thinking Jewish communities failed to provide real alternatives to a dilemma of meaninglessness in the absence of genetic heirs?
<i>Tol’dot</i> poses the question of meaning. If we answer that we exist only to fulfill impulses through our children, we have failed Judaism and feminism. If we answer that we exist for <i>tikkun,</i> to nurture children—biological, adoptive, and those we teach, mentor and support—then we will have succeeded far more in realizing the sacred goal of <i>mi-dor l’dor,</i> from generation to generation.

Vayetzei

I<small>N</small> G<small>ENESIS</small> 31, Jacob calls his wives Rachel and Leah out to the field and confidentially expresses his desire to return to Canaan. <i>Vataan Rachel v’Leah</i> (31:14): Rachel and Leah respond in one voice—as indicated by the singular verb form—expressing a shared anger against their father and a willingness to leave Haran. Jacob then gets up, places his wives and sons on camels, carries off his cattle and other property, and departs.
At first, Jacob appears as the central actor in this narrative. Everything is said and done in relation to him, stated in masculine possessive terms. In 31:19, however, Rachel seizes the opportunity afforded by Laban’s going off to shear his sheep to steal her father’s <i>t’rafim.</i> Until this point, Rachel and Leah have followed a course initiated by Jacob and his concerns. Here, however, Rachel initiates and plots her own destiny. So much so that in the next verse Jacob is seen as following Rachel’s lead: Rachel stole the <i>t’rafim</i> (v. 19) and Jacob “stole the mind (literally: heart) of Laban the Aramean” (v. 20).
Jacob re-assumes center stage in the narrative when Laban overtakes him on his journey and the two men begin to air their respective grievances. But from the moment Rachel steals the <i>t’rafim,</i> Jacob ceases to control the action or facts. It is in a condition of ironic ignorance that Jacob makes his rash pronouncement (v. 32): “But the one with whom you find your gods shall not live.” (Compare Jephthah’s vow in Judges 11:30 to sacrifice the first to come out to meet him, a vow that leads him to sacrifice his daughter.)
Several midrashic sources contend that Jacob’s death sentence for the theft of Laban’s <i>t’rafim</i> is borne out in Rachel’s tragic death after giving birth to Benjamin (for example, <i>B’reishit Rabbah</i> 74.32). According to a plain reading of Genesis 31, however, Rachel emerges from the episode victorious and unscathed. After all, Jacob’s curse is conditioned upon Laban actually finding the <i>t’rafim</i> in someone’s possession— something that Laban never accomplishes.
Laban conducts a thorough search of Jacob’s camp: Jacob’s tent, Leah’s, the two maidservants’, and Rachel’s—<i>v’lo matza</i> (and he finds nothing), a verb construction that appears three times (31:33, 34, 35). What has Rachel done to elude her father? She has placed the <i>t’rafim</i> in a camel’s saddle (echoing how Jacob put his wives and sons onto camels in v. 17) and conceals them by sitting on this same saddle. She then shrewdly apologizes to her father for not obeying usual custom and rising before him as he searches her tent. “The way of women is upon me” (31:35), Rachel claims, cunningly manipulating the (male) menstruation taboo to her own advantage.
What are these <i>t’rafim</i> that Rachel risks so much to steal? What did they stand for in Rachel’s time, and what do they mean for us today?
According to Rashi, the 11th-century commentator, the <i>t’rafim</i> were household idols that Rachel steals from her father for pious, monotheistic reasons: “in order to distance him from the practice of idol worship.” This interpretation clearly stems from rabbinic discomfort with the idea of Rachel as idol worshipper. But if Rachel were so angry with her father as to be willing to leave his house forever without so much as a goodbye, would she really care about his spiritual fate?
Based on other instances in the Bible where the same word appears, other traditional exegetes identify the <i>t’rafim</i> with the practice of divination. Thus, Rachel steals the <i>t’rafim,</i> which were used by ancient magicians as a means of telling the future, in order to prevent Laban from knowing Jacob’s plans or whereabouts. If that were the case, however, Rachel should have simply broken them. Why does she go to the trouble of stealing them, hiding them in a saddle, and tricking her father?
Several contemporary biblical scholars have argued that possession of the “household gods” was related to issues of clan leadership or inheritance. Accordingly, the <i>t’rafim</i> are symbolic tokens that indicate Rachel’s right to take her children and possessions away from her father and hand them over to her husband. And yet, Rachel’s decision not to inform Jacob of her theft of the <i>t’rafim</i> suggests that she acts for her own sake, not Jacob’s.
Along these lines, feminist biblical scholar J. E. Lapsley argues that Rachel steals the <i>t’rafim</i> because her status as a woman in a patriarchal household prevents her from confronting her father with her own grievances about her rightful inheritance. “Therefore, she goes about getting justice from her father through devious and extra-legal means” (“The Voice of Rachel,” <i>Genesis: A Feminist Companion to the Bible (Second Series),</i> ed. Athalya Brenner, 1998, p. 238). In telling her father that she cannot “rise before” him because the “way of women is upon her,” Rachel is “speaking two languages simultaneously.” Laban hears Rachel as saying that she cannot honor him by standing because she is menstruating. But Rachel’s speech also reads as a complaint that she has no forum for rising before her father and pleading her case for inheritance; the social “way of women” constrains her possibilities for speech, advocacy, and direct action. According to Lapsley, Rachel’s “subversive action in stealing the <i>t’rafim</i> is matched by her equally subversive undermining of male definitions of women and her creation of new meanings out of male-generated language” (p. 242). According to this interpretation, Rachel steals not only the <i>t’rafim</i> but also the <i>language</i> that has been used by this patriarchy to define her as woman and limit her access to culture and law.
Rachel thus emerges from this story as an archetypal feminist writer, who dares to steal across the border of masculine culture, seize control of her cultural inheritance, and make it her own. Understood this way, the theft of the <i>t’rafim</i> becomes a story about women’s potential to use and craft language, both holy and mundane, in all of its many meanings, to speak potently—and cause others to listen.

Vayishlach

A<small>FTER TWENTY YEARS</small>, Jacob is coming home. Anticipating that the reunion with the brother he cheated all those years ago will be disastrous, he sends messengers laden with presents ahead to his brother. But just to be on the safe side, he divides his camp in order to minimize the losses should he come under attack. The story continues: “That same night, he got up, took his two wives, his two maidservants, and his eleven children, and crossed at a ford of the Jabbok [river].…Jacob was left alone, and a man wrestled with him” (32:23–25). The nocturnal wrestler wounds and blesses him and gives him a new name—our name: Yisrael, one who wrestles with God.
Jacob’s wrestling with God is a powerful image and legacy. We never know with whom Jacob is wrestling: is it himself, his conscience, his brother, God, or all of these parts of himself and of his life? Jacob names the place Peniel, meaning “Face of God,” for, as he states, “I have seen God face-to-face” (32:31). Somehow, alone, separated from his “two wives” and his “eleven children,” Jacob discovers the face of God in his adversary—and Jacob is blessed.
Eleven children cross the river? But Jacob already at this point has twelve children. What about Dinah, his daughter? What happened to her? Rashi, quoting a midrash, explains: “He placed her in a chest and locked her in.” While many commentaries understand that by locking Dinah in a box Jacob intends to protect her from marrying his brother Esau, we know the truth of the story. Hiding Dinah—locking her up—is a powerful image about silencing a woman. And that silence echoes loudly through the rest of the Torah.
What happens next? Dinah gets raped (Genesis 34). In an ultimate act of silencing, the commentaries understand Dinah’s rape as Jacob’s punishment for withholding her from Esau. Dinah’s rape is <i>Jacob’s</i> punishment? What about Dinah? What has she done? How does she feel? Our text is silent. We only know what her brothers and father think: that she has been defiled (34:5–7), that she must not be treated as a whore (34:31). No one in the Torah or the midrashic accounts asks her what she wants, what she needs, or how she can be comforted.
Her silence is loud enough to reverberate through the generations. We hear it in the reports of other fathers who perceive their daughter’s rape as their dishonor, their punishment. Fortunately for Dinah, in Genesis the blame and punishment fall entirely on the perpetrator and his people, not on her. Other women are not as lucky. In 1998, in Pakistan, Arbab Khatoon was raped by three men in a village in Jacobabad district. She was murdered seven hours later. According to local residents, she was killed by her relatives for bringing dishonour to the family by going to the police. In 1999, Lal Jamilla Mandokhel, a 16-year-old mentally retarded girl, was reportedly raped several times by a junior clerk of the local government department of agriculture in a hotel in Parachinar, Pakistan. The girl’s uncle filed a complaint about the incident with police—who took the accused into protective custody but then handed over the girl to her tribe. The elders decided that she had brought shame to her tribe and that the honor could only be restored by her death; she was killed in front of a tribal gathering.
Similar stories are reported not only in Pakistan but also in Bangladesh, Great Britain, Brazil, Ecuador, Egypt, India, Israel, Italy, Jordan, Pakistan, Morocco, Sweden, Turkey, Uganda—as well as Afghanistan, Iraq, and Iran. No wonder women are silent!
This outrage is only part of a much larger problem of violence against women. For example, according to the United Nations Children’s Fund <small>(UNICEF),</small> more than five thousand brides die annually in India because their dowries are considered insufficient. Widney Brown, advocacy director for Human Rights Watch, says that “in countries where Islam is practiced, they’re called honor killings, but dowry deaths and so-called crimes of passion have a similar dynamic in that the women are killed by male family members and the crimes are perceived as excusable or understandable.” The practice, she said, “goes across cultures and across religions.” In the few cases when public outcry around the world and international pressure were used, a woman’s life was spared. But stories that capture the headlines do not begin to address the scope and range of the problem.
Another form that violence takes is sexual slavery and human trafficking, which even happens in Israel. According to a recent Knesset report, thousands of women are illegally smuggled into Israel and sold into sexual slavery. These young women—typically in their early twenties—are raped, abused, incarcerated and threatened, “servicing” 15–25 clients over 14–18 hours a day, 7 days a week. The women become indentured slaves with an ever-growing debt to their owners. Israeli men from all walks of life pay approximately a million visits to brothels per month and the profits from this illicit activity are estimated at $750 million annually. Sexual slavery and human trafficking remain a global problem, taking place in nearly every corner of the world. It is estimated that 600,000–800,000 people—mostly women and children—are trafficked across borders worldwide every year. (For ways to get information—and to get involved in this issue—please contact the Task Force on Human Trafficking through its Web site.)
We hear Dinah’s silence as well in the challenges to reproductive rights happening right now in the United States. If Dinah were raped and became pregnant while living in South Dakota in 2007, she might not be able to get an abortion.
What happens to Dinah in the aftermath of her ordeal? We do not know. We never hear from her, just as we may never hear from the women and girls in our generation who are victims of violence and whose voices are not heard. But the legacy of Jacob as Israel, the one who wrestles, demands that we confront the shadowy parts of ourselves and our world—and not passively ignore these facts. The feminist educator Nelle Morton urged women to hear each other “into speech.” Dinah’s story challenges us to go even further and be also the voices for all of our sisters.

Vayeshev

 I<small>N TERMS OF THE BIBLICAL WORLDVIEW,</small> Tamar’s tragedy is evident: she has lost her husband, and she has no offspring to secure her status as a widow and give her life purpose. Tired of leaving her fate to male relatives, Tamar takes action to secure her own position, thereby joining the circle of matriarchs who exemplify action to protect Israelite destiny.
<i>When the Family Constellation Changes.</i> As the Bible tells the story, Judah and Tamar are in-laws who have reached a crisis point in their relationship. Why? As Carol Meyers explains (<i>Discovering Eve: Ancient Israelite Women in Context,</i> 1988, pp. 133, 183), a young woman typically married into her husband’s extended family household. The new wife was expected to conform to household norms.
At first, Judah is more than willing to support Tamar’s rights. It is he who prompts Onan to perform his duty (38:8); however, when Onan dies in turn, Judah inwardly blames Tamar (38:11), although the reader knows that she is innocent (38:7, 10). Clearly, there is a failure of communication. Judah tells Tamar he will eventually allow her access to Shelah, while he privately intends no such thing. For her part, Tamar correctly surmises Judah’s true intentions, but she never confronts him, discusses it with him, or attempts less radical measures, such as mediation. Evidently, Judah’s abiding sense of loss and resentment are blocking his reconciliation with Tamar. Because of Judah’s failure to heal, Tamar is also unable to move on.
Even now, any new family member—whether spouse, in-law, or child—begins as an outsider. The attendant changes in family dynamics bring accompanying stresses. If conversion or adoption is involved, the difficulties of adjustment may be compounded, requiring increased patience and sensitivity. Recriminations, too, have never been uncommon when premature death occurs in a family.
<i>Recovering from the Loss of a Husband.</i> Tamar’s actions following the loss of her spouse involve extreme risk, but they are not reckless; she has a plan. Spousal loss should not force anyone into desperate acts. In modern terms, Tamar’s predicament cautions women today not to abdicate their financial security to others. They should be aware of and involved in household decisions concerning retirement plans, mortgages, and taxes. Too many widows emerge from mourning to discover financial troubles they had not known existed, and, apart from any monetary crisis that may ensue, are left with a tainted memory of their loved one and an ensuing anger that is hard to resolve.
On a less dire note, entering widowhood nowadays may not be dangerous, but it can be frightening to face life as a single after years of partnership. Tamar’s courage in the face of genuine adversity serves as a model for those who fear entering a social situation alone for the first time, and it may help reduce that fear to realistic proportions. After all, no one in America today will try to burn them for exiting their fathers’ houses, even were they to turn up pregnant.
Widows today should remember that they are not genuinely alone. Just as Tamar could fall back on her family of origin, the bereaved should not avoid turning to their support networks of family and friends. If these do not exist or are inadequate, there are communal resources—and new interests and people yet to explore.
Tamar eventually rises from her mourning and responds to her loss by taking action that will produce meaning for her life. Producing an heir is not the only way to create a legacy. Many are the widows and widowers who have responded to their loss through volunteer work and community involvement. Victor Frankl, in his work <i>Man’s Search for Meaning</i> (1959), taught that while we may have no control over circumstances in which we find ourselves, we have utter freedom in how we respond to those circumstances, even if only in the attitude we choose to assume in response. Tamar teaches us not to become immobilized by loss. Mourn—but then move to find ongoing purpose.
<i>The Role of the Foreigner.</i> Had Tamar been kin, mention of her lineage would be expected; thus it seems that she was foreign. Yet this matters little to Judah: he resents Tamar because he associates her with the loss of his sons, not because of her ethnic identity. Judah had himself been married to a Canaanite, and it is he who arranged Er’s marriage with Tamar in the first place (38:6). Moreover, in Tamar’s time, no conversion rite, as such, existed; she makes her affiliation clear by aligning herself with the destiny of Judah’s household—and thus with the destiny of Israel.
Non-Israelite origin connects Tamar to the story of Potiphar’s wife that follows in Genesis 39. Placing the story of a good woman next to that of a bad woman clarifies, from a biblical standpoint, the meaning of both goodness and badness in women. This juxtaposition of good and bad models, known to literary structuralists as “binary opposition,” is found again in the case of the widow of Zarephath (in Phoenicia), who aids Elijah in I Kings 17 and is in counterpoint to that other Phoenician woman, Jezebel, who hounds Elijah. Women are not the only foreign exemplars: the good Kenites are repeatedly balanced with the hated Amalekites (Exodus 17–18; Judges 4; and I Samuel 15:6). Such stories provide examples of how a foreigner or foreign people should behave, and another less edifying one of how they often did behave. In the context of the Bible, such passages represent ethnic tensions of the past and highlight the uncertainty of trusting outsiders. For the modern world, they serve as a reminder for us to judge individuals by their actions and attitudes, rather than by labels and assumptions.

Miketz

T<small>HE PAINFUL PAST</small> casts a long shadow on <i>parashat Mikeitz.</i> A father’s insensitive treatment of his sons—and the resulting sibling rivalry—form the back-drop to this tale. Though the women are never explicitly mentioned here, Jacob’s relationship to his sons’ mothers underlies his attitude toward their children. Among his wives, Jacob loves Rachel only, paying scant attention to Leah and the sisters’ maidservants. Likewise, Jacob clearly favors Joseph—Rachel’s first-born—showing little evidence of affection toward his other children. Blind to the difficult family dynamic he engenders, Jacob had sent Joseph alone to check on his brothers (37:13–14), setting up a situation rife with the potential for disaster. Joseph’s ensuing disappearance does nothing to stop Jacob from now favoring yet another son, Benjamin, Rachel’s second (see 42:4).
But healing and transformation also begin here. A hint of what is to come is encapsulated in the name Joseph chooses for his first son, Manasseh, “For God has <i>made me forget</i> all the troubles I endured in my father’s house” (41:51). Clearly Joseph has not forgotten his troubles if they form the basis of his son’s name. Rather, it seems that the past is no longer a burden to him. He is able to thrive despite the horrors he suffered in the pit where his jealous brothers threw him (37:24). The name of Joseph’s second son, Ephraim, expresses this forward movement: “For God has <i>made me fruitful</i> in the land of my affliction” (41:52). His marriage to Asenath indeed bears fruit: their children will become tribes of Israel.
Joseph soon enables his older brothers to achieve a new relationship with <i>their</i> past as well, creating a set of circumstances that provides them with the opportunity to respond to favoritism differently. That would represent true <i>t’shuvah</i> (literally “return”), as the medieval Spanish rabbi and philosopher Moses Maimonides describes it: <i>t’shuvah</i> has occurred when a person, confronted with the opportunity to commit a transgression anew, refrains from doing so—not out of fear of being caught or failure of strength (<i>Mishneh Torah, Hilchot T’shuvah</i> § 2.1). <i>T’shuvah</i> is, indeed, a primary theme of <i>parashat Mikeitz.</i> The word, too often mistranslated as “repentance,” actually means “return”—to the right path. Whereas “repentance” connotes remorse and self-flagellation, “return” suggests a kind of joyous homecoming. Our mistakes, rather than serving solely as a source of guilt, become also a springboard of opportunity.
Perhaps unwittingly, the brothers had begun the process of <i>t’shuvah</i> before meeting Joseph again in Egypt. In 42:1, at home with their father, they are referred to as <i>Jacob’s sons.</i> Two verses later, on their way to Egypt, we read, “So <i>Joseph’s brothers</i> went down…” Restating classic midrashim, Rashi opines that “they set their hearts on conducting themselves toward him as brothers.” This is an optimistic reading, but the language does suggest a change in their relationship to Joseph—though one that is undoubtedly buried beneath layers of guilt and denial.
Joseph manipulates the situation so that the brothers’ feelings can rise to the surface. Simeon is held back as ransom. Alarmed at the prospect of returning home to their father one brother short, the brothers recall their cruelty of more than twenty years ago: “Oh, we are being punished on account of our brother! We saw his soul’s distress when he pleaded with us, but we didn’t listen…” (42:21). Perhaps because they could not hear him then, Joseph’s pleading was not mentioned in the initial narrative (Genesis 37). Now, for the first time, the brothers exhibit empathy toward Joseph. According to Marsha Pravder Mirkin, empathy is the key to <i>t’shuvah:</i> “Empathy…is valuing another person enough to listen and hear her voice. It is a halting that then allows us to take action…that brings us closer to becoming the best we can be” (“Hearken to Her Voice: Empathy as <i>Teshuva,”</i> in Gail Twersky Reimer and Judith A. Kates, eds., <i>Beginning Anew: A Woman’s Companion to the High Holy Days,</i> 1997, p. 70).
When the brothers return to their father in Canaan, a significant transformation has occurred. The first indication is their report of their time in Egypt: the brothers demonstrate a newfound sensitivity to their father’s feelings, sparing Jacob some of the more disturbing details of their journey. Modern Israeli commentator Nehama Leibowitz points out, for example, that they omit Joseph’s original plan to keep all but one of them in Egypt (42:16) and the threat of death (42:20) (<i>New Studies in Bereshit/Genesis,</i> undated, pp. 471–2). Then, in the face of their father’s fear for Benjamin’s life, Reuben offers his own sons’ lives in pledge for Benjamin’s (42:37). This is an impulsive and ill-conceived gesture—yet a marked change for the man whose idea it was to throw Joseph into the pit (37:22). Finally Judah, who had convinced his brothers to sell Joseph to the Ishmaelites (37:27), offers to take personal responsibility for the life of his youngest brother (43:9). Clearly, Judah is the brother who has matured and evolved the most.
He and his brothers have made peace with their father’s favoritism. We might imagine that, after Joseph forces them to confront their guilt, they realize that their earlier violent response to their father’s unequal love has not changed Jacob. Aware that hurting Jacob or Benjamin will not get them greater attention from their father, they come to terms with Jacob’s failings, choosing compassion over anger in their dealings with him.
This parashah ends mid-action, leaving us to wonder: Will Joseph really enslave Benjamin? How will the brothers respond? Will Joseph reveal his identity? The answers are not clear—because neither Joseph’s motivation for putting his brothers through this ordeal, nor their commitment to ethical behavior, are fully actualized until the next parashah. Perhaps the Rabbis broke off the story here to suggest that our choices are moment-to-moment decisions, the path never certain until the time comes to act. This cliffhanger ending is also a signal of hope, because <i>t’shuvah</i> is always open to us.

A<small>MERICANS LIVE</small> in the kingdom of self-help books: <i>Five Steps to Overcoming Fear and Doubt; Five Steps to Emotional Healing; Five Steps to Spiritual Growth.</i> Every self-help book is marketed as the “ultimate one,” or even as “the last self-help book you’ll ever need.” Over 300,000 self-help books are on the market. Typically, they promise a neatly outlined plan for self-transformation, for becoming free of a rooted sorrow or of deep-seated fears. They encourage the reader to believe that suffering is not worth the trouble, and gaining self-knowledge a routine affair—easily available for anyone with access to amazon.com and a credit card.
Thanks to the “self-help” industry, Americans—in particular—flee from mourning. We talk of going through the “grief process” until we experience “closure,” as if we ourselves roll along an assembly line of emotion until we get to the final station: the packaging of our sorrow, the sealing it tight, the storing it away.
But the very notion of “closure” for grief is an illusion. Instead, there is only the tentative recognition that our anguish is endurable, that—despite ourselves—life goes on and engages us with new emotions, new situations and images, new challenges and changes. The remembrance of the people we miss gets tucked into our hearts to be revisited—perhaps when we least expect it. As for the process of true inner change, true self-transformation, we learn to forgive ourselves for the mistakes of the past by not making them again. If we are lucky, life “tenderizes” the heart, gives us hearts not of stone but of flesh.
<i>Vayigash</i> powerfully addresses this more authentic model of true emotional change via the character of Judah. In its very opening lines, we find Judah in the midst of responding in an impassioned voice to the demand of the Egyptian vizier that the youngest of Jacob and Rachel’s sons, Benjamin, be left behind in Egypt. Not knowing, of course, that the forbidding vizier is none other than Rachel’s other son, Joseph—whom Judah and his brothers threw into a pit years before—Judah pleads with him to change his mind. Losing Benjamin would break his father’s heart, already broken because he believes his beloved Joseph is dead, says Judah. He begs to be kept behind in Benjamin’s place. And then he speaks the most plaintive words of all: “For how can I go home to my father if the lad is not with me?” (44:34, my translation).
These words finally break Joseph’s heart—and continue to reverberate through the ages. They signal to Joseph that he can finally trust his brothers, that there has been a profound sea-change in their character, that he can finally reveal himself to them. And so we need to ask ourselves what, in fact, has enabled Judah to come forth in this way? What has enabled the change?
The answer cannot be found in any self-help book. Judah most certainly did not take an instant course in “Five Steps to Become a Mensch.” Instead, we can conclude that Judah is able to stand up to Joseph-the-Vizier’s demand because he himself had gone through a painful, embarrassing experience of growth, one made possible through the courageous and determined intervention of his daughter-in-law Tamar.
Reflecting the Torah’s brilliant narrative strategy, the story of Tamar appears right after the brothers have lied to their father Jacob, trying to make it appear as if Joseph has been killed. Jacob rends his garments, puts on sackcloth, and goes into mourning: “His sons and daughters endeavored to console him, but he refused to be consoled, saying, ‘No, in mourning shall I go down to my son to Sheol!”’ (37:35). No sooner does that happen than there is a break in the story, a seeming excursus: the scene switches to the tale of Tamar.
“Around that time,” says the text (38:1), Judah marries the daughter of a man named Shua, and she then bears three sons. The oldest, Er, marries Tamar. But Er dies, with no indication of an emotional reaction from Judah. Following Israelite law, he sends his second son, Onan, to marry Tamar, but Onan refuses to impregnate her and he, too, dies. The law dictates that the third son, Shelah, should now marry Tamar, but Judah delays fulfilling this law, afraid that Shelah, too, will die. Indeed, he waits so long that Tamar, hearing that he is going to a sheep-shearing, presents herself as a harlot on the road. He “couples” with her, not knowing who she is. When rumor later reaches him that his daughter-in-law is pregnant, he demands that she be taken out and burned. Only when she is brought to him and shows him the signet and staff that he had left with her in lieu of payment, does he realize what has transpired. He then admits: “She is more in the right than I, for certainly I did not give her to my son Shelah” (38:26).
Tamar’s achievement lies in more than insisting that her father-in-law right his wrongdoing. Her act also becomes the galvanizing force that enables him to face, and thus finally overcome, the trauma of losing two of his sons and the paralyzing fear that he would lose his third, just as his own father Jacob had feared sending Benjamin to Egypt because he was the only son of Rachel left (42:38). Through the intervention of Tamar, Judah’s heart is “tenderized” by his recognition of the wrong that his inchoate fear of loss had caused. That is why he is now able to plead for compassion before the seeming might of Egypt.
Judah’s experience illustrates that there are no instant transformations, no <i>Five Easy Self-Help Steps to Wisdom.</i> Instead, the Torah teaches that only by fully confronting ourselves—by being open to what we learn from one another—do we grow, only thus are we truly able to change.

Vayechi

V<small>A-Y’CHI SPEAKS OF BLESSINGS</small>, of a grandfather blessing his grandsons, a father blessing his sons. Imagine the scene at the end of the Torah portion: Jacob, whose name has been changed to Israel, calls his twelve sons to his deathbed and blesses each one of them. But his real concern, according to our rabbis, is that his sons will abandon his God after he has died. In the Midrash, his sons respond to this unstated fear with words that have become familiar to us: “<i>Sh’ma Yisrael</i> (Listen, [Dad—whose name is] Israel!): יהוה is our God, only יהוה.” Hearing this, the dying patriarch sighs quietly: “<i>Baruch shem k’vod malchuto l’olam va’ed</i> (Blessed is the glorious Name whose kingdom is forever and ever)!” (Midrash <i>B’reishit Rabbah</i> 98.4). Each time we say the <i>Sh’ma</i>, we are rehearsing this moment. We are the children acknowledging the God of our own father, and we are pledging our own loyalty to the tradition of ancestors.
This farewell scene cannot fail to move us. But it is also confusing. Jacob also has daughters, and the one named Dinah is no longer in the story. Is she not worthy of blessing?
The question of blessing our daughters emerges by way of omission. Jacob and the rest of his family have been reunited with Joseph after many years (Genesis 46). The beloved child Joseph, whom Jacob thought was dead, is not only still alive, but he is a father, with children of his own!
Now, facing death, Jacob says: “I never thought I’d see your face again, and look, God has enabled me to see the face of your children!” (48:8–12). Joseph brings his sons close to his father, with Manasseh, the elder, first. Jacob crosses his arms, putting his right hand on Ephraim’s head, and his left on Manasseh’s. Joseph intervenes, “Not that way, Father! This is my first-born; put your right hand on his head.” But Jacob wants to put Ephraim ahead of Manasseh. Then Jacob blesses them both together with these words: “By you shall the people of Israel give their blessing, saying, ‘May God make you like Ephraim and Manasseh’” (48:18–20).
Why does Jacob bless his younger grandson first? It is hard to imagine this blessing without recalling the earlier moment when Jacob himself stole the blessing that his father Isaac meant for his older brother Esau. In blessing his grandsons, is Jacob repairing his own history, doing intentionally what Isaac did by accident? Is Jacob asserting through his act of blessing that birth order no longer determines one’s destiny—and that blessing is an act of will as opposed to an accident of chance?
The story raises other questions. Jacob’s blessing of his grandsons has become over the centuries the blessing bestowed regularly upon boys; but what is it about Ephraim and Manasseh that merits our blessing our sons in their name? And what about our daughters?
We do not know much about these two young men. We meet them first when they are born (41:51–53), and we encounter them again at this moment of blessing. They are children of an Egyptian mother and a father who is one of the most powerful men in Egypt. They are children born in the Diaspora, not only Egyptian but also Israelite—children living in two worlds.
So why do we bless our sons in their name? Could it be because, like so many Jews throughout history, they grew up in the Diaspora and still remained Jews? Could it be because we imagine that they followed in their father’s footsteps—being part of Egyptian culture and politics—and yet still connected to their grandfather, part of Israel’s community?
Or perhaps we invoke Ephraim and Manasseh because these are the first two siblings in the Bible who do not fight. With Ephraim and Manasseh, the family pathology that unfolds in the book of Genesis, in which siblings struggle with each other, finally comes to an end. They teach us that we do not have to fight over blessings: there are enough of them to go around.
In the Middle Ages, the customary blessing of children took place before Kol Nidrei—the time when we are most aware of our mortality—a time reminiscent of Jacob’s deathbed blessings. In recent centuries, the tradition expanded to include blessing the children every Shabbat evening and on the evening of holidays. Whereas we continue to bless sons by reference to Ephraim and Manasseh (“May God make you like Ephraim and Manasseh”), the tradition for our daughters is different; we bless them with these words: “May God make you like Sarah, Rebecca, Rachel, and Leah.”
Why are the blessings so different? Rabbi Richard Levy suggests the following contemporary reason for interpreting the difference:
“Just as Ephraim and Manasseh received their merit not through any acts of their own but only because they were alive and were descendants of Jacob (as are we all), so Jewish boys need not feel that their parents’ love is dependent on their accomplishments; they are beloved just because they are children. For Jewish girls, however, who might be inclined by society’s prejudices to think that because they are girls they need not set their sights very high, the blessing holds them up to the highest models: May God make you like the greatest women the Torah knows—Sarah, Rebecca, Rachel, and Leah” (“Parashat Vayechi,” in <i>Learn Torah With…,</i> 1996, Vol. 2, No. 12).
As our community mores continue to evolve, one might claim that we now expect <i>both</i> our daughters and our sons to set their sights high. We also hope to create an environment where <i>both</i> daughters and sons feel valued simply because they are alive—and are our children. So perhaps there is yet another way to interpret these blessings, one that accounts for changes we value in our contemporary world.
Maybe we can understand Jacob’s blessing of his grandchildren this way: “Ephraim, may God help you become the best that Ephraim can be; Manasseh, may God help you become the best that Manasseh can be!” Maybe we should fill in the names of our own children as we bless them. So I would say to my daughter: “Elana, may you be fully Elana!” And to my son I would say: “Joshua, may you be fully Joshua!” Or, in the words of the modern Jewish poet Marcia Falk: “Be who you are…and may you be blessed in all that you are” (<i>The Book of Blessings,</i> 1996).

Shemot

P<small>ARASHAT</small> S<small>H’MOT SETS THE STAGE</small> for the drama that plays out not only in the rest of the book of Exodus but around tables worldwide as Jewish families gather year in and year out for Passover seders. The Exodus and the experiences connected with it—the slavery of the Israelites, their liberation from Egypt, the covenant at Sinai, and the journey in the wilderness toward the Promised Land—are indelibly stamped on the Jewish collective memory and imagination. North American Jews relish, arguably more than any other holiday, the festival of Passover whose symbolic foods serve as props for retelling the tale of Israelite bondage that ceases with God’s redemptive miracles. The story is fantastic in every sense of the term: fanciful, remarkable, unreal, and superb. The biblical writers are at their best in these passages, crafting a gripping narrative inscribed with timeless ethical imperatives, such as “You shall not wrong nor oppress a stranger, for you were strangers in the land of Egypt” (Exodus 22:20), and theological conundrums, like why does God repeatedly harden Pharaoh’s heart—thereby preventing the necessary redemption without plagues befalling Egypt? This story has sustained generations of Jews, from esteemed commentators of yore to today’s questioning sons and daughters with mouths full of matzah and <i>maror</i>. Jews of all stripes rally to the Exodus cry; even those with mere peripheral knowledge of things Jewish resonate to “Let my people go!”
So why is it that the most unbelievable of Jewish stories is that which is most believed in? Why does the Exodus charm and beguile liberal Jews, even Reform Jews, who are products of a movement of leaders who early on dismissed what the 1885 Pittsburgh Platform calls “miraculous narratives” of the Bible as “reflecting the primitive ideas of its own age…”?
Indeed, on one level, the popularity of the Exodus is baffling. One might imagine that its lack of historical veracity would knock it off its pedestal. After all, biblical scholars, whose stock in trade is comparative materials of contemporaneous ancient Near Eastern cultures and archeology, inform us that few of the book’s details can be substantiated by cold, hard facts.
Take, for example, the matter of dating. Based on chronological indications in the text itself, the Hebrew Bible would have us believe that the Exodus took place in about 1446 <small>B. C.E.</small> One of the mathematical “proofs” for such a claim depends on the following information provided to the biblical reader in various places: Exodus 12:40 claims that the Israelite slavery in Egypt lasted 430 years (a figure that contradicts the prediction of an Egyptian sojourn of 400 years or four generations; Genesis 15:13, 16). I Kings 6:1 states that the Temple was constructed 480 years after the Exodus, during the fourth year of Solomon’s forty-year reign (I Kings 11:42), which scholars date as 966 <small>B. C.E.</small> According to these calculations, the Israelites were enslaved in Egypt between 1876 and 1446 <small>B. C.E.</small> Moreover, if, as the text indicates, the Israelites wandered in the wilderness for forty years before entering the Promised Land, the conquest of Canaan would have begun in approximately 1406 <small>B. C.E.</small>
Besides the fact that the Torah texts do not agree with one another on the length of Israelite enslavement in Egypt, these numbers do not add up against the evidence of extra-biblical sources. In fact, the first clear historical proof of an Israelite presence in Canaan at all is the inscription on the so-called Israel Stele of the pharaoh Merneptah, dating to about 1207 <small>B. C.E.</small> In other words, the biblical claim of a 15th-century Exodus is off by 200 years when compared to the archeological evidence. Moreover, ancient records demonstrate that Egypt controlled Canaan in 1446, a fact that makes an escape from Egypt to Canaan at that time rather unlikely.
Another aspect of the story that troubles modern readers is the purported size of the Exodus. The biblical claim of 600,000 men (Exodus 12:37), which including their families would total nearly 2 million people, is hyperbolic at best. Plus, many of the sites appearing in the detailed itinerary of the Israelites’ route from Egypt to Canaan (see Numbers 33) cannot be verified.
Certainly, scholars like the preeminent Nahum Sarna have argued convincingly that corroborating evidence suggests a “plausible context” for the Exodus story. Many have confidently asserted that a group of people who later became Israel went down to Egypt from Canaan, settled there, and became oppressed as foreigners. At some point, it can be presumed, they were conscripted into labor and oppressed as foreigners. Some of them later escaped and professed to a transcendent experience with a divine being in the desert. Still later, they or their descendants entered Canaan, where, according to Sarna, they were joined by other peoples and became the biblical nation of Israel.
From my perspective as a professor of Jewish history and a Reform rabbi, dismissing the story because it conflicts with historical data misses the point. Holding the Torah to critical standards of historiography is unfair, because it is not intended to be a history book containing scholars’ attempts to re-create an impartial rendering of what occurred in the past. Instead, the Torah is a knitting together of narratives composed to cultivate a particular spiritual and moral point of view. So when God parts the Reed Sea, I can no more expect myself to nod in faithful assent like an open-mouthed child than when reading a book like <i>Harry Potter</i>.
As a non-literalist, non-fundamentalist, liberal, and committed Jew, I ascertain the message behind the medium. To me, the text asserts God’s ability to subvert nature as a means of demonstrating God’s vital interest in the welfare of the Israelites, which extends through time—indeed, I fervently hope, to our own time. To my students’ question, “But is it true?” I respond, “Yes!” and “No!” The Exodus’ visible and venerated place in the Jewish calendar assures that it will be believed in, year in and year out, to our rational consternation and spiritual delight.

Vaera

T<small>HE SIGNS AND WONDERS</small> (or “plagues”) described in <i>parashat Va-eira</i> must have been extremely frightening for both the Egyptians who suffered and the Israelites who bore witness to God’s might for the first time. Thirteenth-century Kabbalists believed that when the Children of Israel braved the agonies of slavery and the ten displays of divine might that devastated Egypt, they did not do so alone. Rather, the Israelites knew that the <i>Shechinah,</i> the pre-eminent feminine aspect of God, dwelled alongside them in Egypt. Medieval Kabbalists often portrayed the feminine <i>Shechinah</i> as a loving mother who suffers along with her children Israel in exile. She toils with her children while they are slaves in Egypt and protects them in the wilderness after they are liberated.
This association between the <i>Shechinah,</i> the supernal mother, and human mothers is given a biological dimension in the <i>Zohar,</i> the most popular work of medieval Kabbalah. The <i>Zohar</i> understands God as a power that is utterly transcendent and—at the same time—wholly immanent in our world. The Deity is comprised of the <i>Ein Sof</i> (“Without End”), which lies beyond the realm of human cognition, and ten lower <i>s’firot</i> (aspects) that emanate forth into the realm of being. Kabbalists believed that everything on earth reflects this divine realm.
The <i>Zohar</i> represents the realm of the <i>s’firot</i> in a myriad of different ways. It often compares the <i>s’firot</i> to an inverted tree or to the days of the week.
Perhaps the most popular symbol, however, is <i>gufa</i> (the body). Genesis 1:26 states that God made humans in God’s image and after God’s likeness. Kabbalists understood this verse literally. If human beings are in the form of an <i>anthropos</i> (human body), and if human beings were made in the image and likeness of God, then God must be an <i>anthropos</i> too. Human anatomy and physiology reflect this divine reality. Hence, women and men engage in sexual intercourse because two <i>s’firot—Tiferet</i> (the sixth <i>s’firah,</i> symbolically understood as the King and Groom) and <i>Shechinah</i> (the tenth <i>s’firah,</i> symbolically understood as the Queen and Bride)—desire harmony and union. Women conceive and give birth because the <i>Shechinah</i> receives the effluxes or emanative powers of the higher <i>s’firot.</i> And women have a monthly flow because the <i>Shechinah</i> menstruates when she comes under the influence of the demonic “other side” (<i>sitra achra).</i>
Medieval halachah (Jewish law) required women to separate from their husbands for twelve to fourteen days every month: the five- to seven-day period of menstruation plus another seven “clean” days. The <i>Zohar</i> traces the source of this halachah to the myth of the <i>Shechinah.</i> The <i>Zohar</i> considers Egypt to be the ultimate symbol of the <i>sitra achra.</i> When the <i>Shechinah</i> dwells with the Children of Israel in Goshen, She becomes influenced by the “other side” and begins to menstruate. Therefore she must separate from her husband, <i>Tiferet,</i> for the duration of her blood flow; as a consequence, she is exiled or banished (literally <i>niddah)</i> from the forces of the Holy. Although her flow ends as soon as the Children of Israel flee Egypt, the <i>Shechinah</i> is not ritually pure yet. In keeping with the dictates of halachah, she must separate from her husband for another seven clean days. The <i>Zohar</i> conceives of these seven “days” as seven weeks—the seven weeks of the counting of the <i>Omer</i> between Passover and Shavuot.
After forty-nine days of travel, the <i>Shechinah</i> and her children rest at the foot of Mount Sinai, where she at last undergoes the final purificatory ritual: immersion in a supernal <i>mikveh</i> (pool). Like a newly adorned bride, the ritually pure <i>Shechinah</i> meets her husband, <i>Tiferet,</i> at the crest of Mount Sinai. They engage in divine union on the eve of Shavuot. On Shavuot day, the <i>Shechinah</i> gives birth to the two tablets of the Covenant. Ever the devoted mother, the <i>Shechinah</i> gives these tablets to Moses for her children Israel (<i>Zohar</i> 3:96b).
The <i>Shechinah</i> figures prominently throughout the <i>Zohar.</i> Consequently, many Jews understand Kabbalah to be the only haven for gender equality in rabbinic Judaism. Unfortunately, this is not the case. Indeed, it would be extraordinary if it were. The <i>Zohar</i> is the product of a 13th-century worldview. Its author, Moses de León, and his circle lived in a world in which women’s physical and intellectual inferiority was believed to have been proven scientifically. It would have been inconceivable for them to develop a mythology of the <i>Shechinah</i> that defied societal norms. Hence, the <i>Shechinah</i> is most often represented as a passive vessel with “nothing of her own.” When she acts righteously, she sometimes changes gender and becomes male; when she comes under the sway of the <i>sitra achra,</i> she always remains female.
There are passages, however, that we can read as more sympathetic to feminist views. When we read the <i>Zohar</i> through the prism of history, we can differentiate between the different shades of prejudice to create a new meaning. The Kabbalistic story of the <i>Shechinah’</i>s exodus from Egypt is a case in point. There are many troubling notions in this passage—the association between menstruation and demonic possession being one of the most egregious. Nonetheless, valuable insights that can enhance our spirituality are embedded in this story. The <i>Shechinah</i> as caring mother, basing the <i>Omer</i> on a female biological function, and the notion of the giving of Torah (<i>matan Torah)</i> as a birth are notions that we can reclaim and make our own. The notion that the <i>Shechinah</i> gave birth to the Torah tablets gives an entirely new meaning to the notion of “Torah from Sinai.” Indeed, I believe that the custom of eating dairy on Shavuot can be traced to this very myth. After all, dairy foods symbolize the lactating <i>Shechinah</i> who nourishes her children Israel with the Torah.

Bo

G<small>OD’S HARDENING OF</small> P<small>HARAOH’S HEART</small> in Exodus 10:1 presents a theological problem on two levels. First, if God is the agent of Pharaoh’s behavior, what does that imply about Pharaoh’s free will? Second, if God hardens Pharaoh’s heart in order to demonstrate God’s power, we must ask: At what price the Israelites’ liberation? Indeed, the ultimate result of Pharaoh’s stubbornness is the murder of every first-born Egyptian male. Even if we consider this to be retributive justice, payback for Pharaoh’s earlier order to kill all newborn Hebrew males, we still must ponder: Does one heinous crime justify another? And how do we come to terms with killing innocent children?
Commentators, equally bothered by this thorny moral dilemma, have provided inspired interpretations. With regard to the question of free will, some interpreters note that during the first five plagues, Pharaoh hardens his <i>own</i> heart. Only afterward does God take over, starting with the sixth plague (9:12), suggesting that Pharaoh has foregone the chance to operate independently. Modern psychoanalyst Erich Fromm writes, “The more man’s heart hardens, the less freedom he has to change; the more he is determined by previous action…there comes a point of no return, when man’s heart has become so hardened…that he has lost the possibility of freedom” (<i>You Shall Be as Gods,</i> 1966, p. 101). This is an astute insight into human behavior, but it begs the question of the text’s plain meaning, which is that God causes Pharaoh’s stubbornness.
The hardening of Pharaoh’s heart might also be viewed as a paradigm for what Fran Burgess calls the “transformative power of adversity.” According to this view, Pharaoh’s stubborn resistance is the condition necessary for Moses and the Israelites to emerge from their straits (the Hebrew name for Egypt, <i>mitzrayim,</i> is very close to the Hebrew for “straits,” <i>metzarim).</i> Indeed, it often takes facing overwhelming odds to make radical change. As Tour de France winner Lance Armstrong said, “Before cancer, I just lived. Now I live strong.” Pharaoh thus serves as a tool for the Israelites’ psychological and moral development. However keen, this interpretation too satisfies only on the level of metaphor.
Perhaps the most satisfactory approach is to keep the theological problems ever-present. In <i>The Particulars of Rapture: Reflections on Exodus</i> (1995), Avivah Gottlieb Zornberg suggests that the liberation story of the Israelites, what she calls the “master narrative,” gives rise to “counter-narratives” that throw the justification of God’s triumphal power into question. Indeed, as Zornberg argues, the master narrative of God as loving and benevolent redeemer of the Israelites is challenged by the killing of the Egyptians’ first-born, including “the first-born of the captive who was in the dungeon” (12:29). This prompts a counter-narrative from the perspective of the plague’s victims that asks: What sin could the babies and the captives possibly have committed to deserve this punishment? The answer posits an evil God. This narrative appears again later, in the story of the Golden Calf, when Moses convinces God not to murder the Israelites for their transgression, arguing that otherwise, the Egyptian story will prevail: “Let not the Egyptians say, ‘It was with evil intent that he delivered them’” (32:12). Although the Midrash attempts to silence and “neutralize” potentially heretical answers to such queries, Zornberg maintains that “the Torah, even God’s quoted words, gives rise to interpretations that radically contradict its own master-narrative, and that cannot, moreover, be totally repudiated by its accredited expositors” (p. 143).
For Zornberg, an alternative for dealing with the dissonance between narrative and counter-narrative is “the model of endless questioning, in which the answer does not totally silence the questioner” (p. 143). In fact, implicit and explicit questions play an important role in this parashah. God mandates that the story of the Exodus be told in response to children’s queries: “And when your children ask you…, you shall say..(12:26–27). This is the basis for the Passover <i>seder</i>’s custom of the Four Questions. Further, two more verses from this parashah and one from Deuteronomy instruct us to answer our children’s questions about the Exodus. The Rabbis understood all these verses as referring to four kinds of children, the Haggadah’s Four Sons, each with varying aptitudes, each eliciting a different perspective on the narrative: the Wise Son (Deuteronomy 6:20–21), the Wicked Son (Exodus 12:26), the Simple Son (13:14), and the One Who Is Unable to Ask (13:8).
Through questions, we might call forth another counter-narrative: the experience of women during the exodus and its subsequent retelling. Noting that the traditional Haggadah assumes a conversation between a father and four sons, contemporary feminist Haggadot fill in for the absence of women’s voices. The <i>Ma’yan Haggadah</i>, for example, includes the Four Daughters. The daughter “in search of a usable past” asks, “Why did Moses say at Sinai, ‘Go not near a woman,’ addressing only men, as if preparation for revelation was not meant for us, as well?” The daughter “who wants to erase her difference” wonders about the importance of women’s issues. The daughter “who does not know that she has a place at the table” asks, “What is this?” And the daughter “who asks no questions” is told: “From the moment Yocheved, Miriam, and the midwives questioned Pharaoh’s edict until today, every question we ask helps us leave Egypt a little farther behind” (Tamara Cohen, Sue Levi Elwell, and Ronnie Horn, eds., <i>The Journey Continues: Ma’yan Passover Haggadah</i>, 1997).
Just as the women defied Pharaoh, so we too as readers must confront and challenge troubling aspects of our sacred narratives. The persistent hardening of Pharaoh’s heart results in the Israelites’ night of redemption, but we must never forget that this same night was one of horror for the Egyptians. We must continue to ask the questions that preserve our awareness of the Other’s story. Did the Israelites hear the <i>tzaakah</i> (cry) of the Egyptians (12:30)? Did it remind them of their own cry—the <i>tzaakah</i> in 3:7, which brought God’s attention to their plight? Year after year, as we recall at our seder table the wonders God performed for us, we must remember the price the Other paid for our liberation.

Beshalach

T<small>HERE ARE MOMENTS</small> that define us: unexpected or unplanned moments when the decisions we make, the actions we take, determine all that will follow. Crossroads come disguised in many forms. Many are unmarked, without a hint of what is ahead.
<i>B’shalach</i> describes such a crossroads. The crossing of the Sea of Reeds was not only the crossing out of Egypt and out of slavery, but also the entrance into an unknown future, made possible by a moment of extraordinary faith.
At the far bank of the sea, triumph rings out in instrumental music and in song, led by both Moses and Miriam. Yet earlier, with Egyptians in pursuit and the waters ahead, according to the Rabbis it was neither Moses nor Miriam who took center stage, but Nahshon ben Amminadab. Nahshon is a curious hero. Briefly mentioned as Aaron’s brother-in-law (Exodus 6:23), the Torah neither notices nor lauds him. Yet the Rabbis praise him for his initiative, the one who first entered the billowing waves, leading all of Israel to safety.
Nahshon’s heroism is a literary deduction. In Numbers 7:12, Nahshon, the prince of the tribe of Judah, brings the first offering to dedicate the Tabernacle. The Midrash surmises: “When it was time to dedicate the tabernacle, Moses confessed to the princes of the tribes, ‘The Holy One has commanded you to bring offerings, but I do not know who should go first.’ The princes looked at Nahshon, saying, ‘This man has sanctified the name of the Holy One at the Sea of Reeds. He is worthy to bring the <i>Shechinah.</i> Let Nahshon go first’” (<i>B’midbar Rabbah</i> 12.21).
At the Sea of Reeds, according to midrashic tradition, Nahshon stood at a crossroads—whether to have faith and plunge into the water, or be gripped by fear and remain on the shore. What was that moment like? If we were on the shore of the sea that fateful day, how would we have acted? Confidently? Timidly? Would we have entered the water gingerly or with fury? Flailing or swimming? How do we approach the sea crossings in our own lives? Are we coerced by an army from behind, or pulled ahead by the unknown?
Some think of Nahshon as fearless, determined to be the first into the water. In <i>Midrash T’hillim</i> 114:8, Nahshon reputedly pelts his brothers with stones to assure his place of primacy. The daredevil confidence of this Nahshon contrasts sharply with another vision of this moment (<i>M’chilta, B’shalach</i> 5). Huddled together, a terrified crowd looks behind at the Egyptians and forward toward water. As they yell, “I don’t want to go into the sea!” Nahshon jumps up in fear; losing his footing, he falls into the waves. Overcome with terror, he cites Psalms, “Save me, O God, for the waters have reached my neck” (Psalm 69:2). Here, Nahshon—a fearful, drowning man—cries for God’s help. The midrash alternately envisions Nahshon as hapless victim, brash show-off, or eager leader.
As she emerges from the water, Miriam, too, faces an array of alternatives—an internal sea crossing of her own. Was it the time to forge ahead, adrenaline still coursing from their narrow escape? Was it the occasion to mourn the loss of the known, the familiar if oppressive Egypt? Was it the instant to comfort those catching their breath, those who had needed to run and swim faster than they believed possible? Was it safer to hang back and let others take their rightful place as leaders? Or was this the moment to lift up the hand-drum and triumphantly sing and dance, giddy with gratitude for God’s redemption?
Miriam had the foresight to bring her hand-drum. Miriam had the wisdom to gather her sisters to acknowledge and affirm the miracle, to mark the moment when their tenuous hope broke forth in joy— the birth of her community as a people touched by God.
Like Nahshon, Miriam’s leadership is surprising. <i>Kol ishah,</i> the voice of a woman, Miriam’s strong voice, had been heard previously only as a sister and daughter. Yet, at her sea crossing, emerging from the waters, she does not wait for someone else to change the world. She does not demur that she was not bred for greatness. She does not blend into the crowd. Instead, Miriam’s voice rings out for all to hear.
Miriam is a leader: a prophet who speaks to and binds others to God. Like a large <i>tallit</i> on small shoulders, she is one upon whom the mantle of authority does not fit snugly, one who might have been surprised at her own influence, but one who nevertheless conscientiously undertakes responsibility for contributing to God’s purpose—much like contemporary women leaders. In the waters of transition, Miriam sparks innovation, creativity, and hope, rooted in the past yet focused on the future—just like contemporary women leaders. Like Nahshon before the waves and Miriam after them, we ask: how do we navigate waters never traversed before? How do we create rituals that reflect the tradition yet give voice to our experience? How do we speak new words that include the familiar in a Holy tongue?
Like Nahshon and Miriam, today’s women face our own sea crossing. We too can choose to enter the water: with quiet certitude, brash impulsiveness, or terror at what lies ahead. Or, we may decide to hang back, looking around for someone else to go in first. Eventually, when we enter—however we enter—we, and our world, are transformed.
In our time, the sea crossing may be when we hear a cry for social justice, when we unexpectedly find our voice waxing prophetic; it may come as we read a book, converse with a friend, or witness a scene in which we are seized with understanding about our place in the world. As we enter the water, if we speak and act out of awe and gratitude, if we look around and trust our vision, we may discover that we are bathed in and buoyed by the presence of God.

Yitro

R<small>EAD FROM</small> a feminist perspective, <i>Yitro</i> contains one of the most painful verses in the Torah. At the formative moment in Jewish history, when presumably the whole people of Israel stands in awe and trembling at the base of Mount Sinai waiting for God to descend upon the mountain and establish the covenant, Moses turns to the assembled community and says, “Be ready for the third day: do not go near a woman” (19:15). Moses wants to ensure that the people are ritually prepared to receive God’s presence, and an emission of semen renders both a man and his female partner temporarily unfit to approach the sacred (see Leviticus 15:16–18). But Moses does not say, “Men and women do not go near each other.” Instead, at this central juncture in the Jewish saga, he renders women invisible as part of the congregation about to enter into the covenant.
These words are deeply troubling for at least two reasons. First, they are a paradigm of the treatment of women as “other,” both elsewhere in this portion and throughout the Torah. Again and again, the Torah seems to assume that the Israelite nation consists only of male heads of household. It records the experiences of men, but not the experiences of women. For example, the tenth commandment—“You shall not covet your neighbor’s wife” (20:14)—presupposes a community of male hearers.
Second, entry into the covenant at Sinai is not just a one-time event, but an experience to be reappropriated by every generation (Deuteronomy 29:13–14). Every time the portion is chanted, whether as part of the annual cycle of Torah readings or as a special reading for Shavuot, women are thrust aside once again, eavesdropping on a conversation among men, and between men and God. The text thus potentially evokes a continuing sense of exclusion and disorientation in women. The whole Jewish people supposedly stood at Sinai. Were we there? Were we not there? If we were there, what did we hear when the men heard “do not go near a woman”? If we were not there originally, can we be there now? Since we are certainly part of the community now, how could we not have been there at that founding moment?
Given the seriousness of these questions, it is important to note the larger narrative context of Moses’ injunction to the men not to go near a woman. When the Israelites arrive at Sinai on the third new moon after leaving Egypt, Moses twice ascends the mountain to talk with God. After he brings God the report that the people have agreed to accept the covenant, God gives Moses careful instructions for readying everyone for the moment of revelation: “Go to the people and warn them to stay pure today and tomorrow,” God says. “Let them wash their clothes. Let them be ready for the third day; for on the third day יהוה will come down, in the sight of all the people, on Mount Sinai” (19:10–11). It is striking that <i>God’s</i> instructions to Moses are addressed to the whole community. It is <i>Moses</i> who changes them, who glosses God’s message, who assumes that the instructions are meant for only half the people. Thus, at this early stage in Jewish history, Moses filters and interprets God’s commands through a patriarchal lens. His words are a paradigm of the treatment of women, but a complex one. They show how Jewish tradition has repeatedly excluded women, but also the way in which that exclusion must be understood as a <i>distortion</i> of revelation.
Interestingly, the Rabbis seem to have been disturbed by the implication of women’s absence from Sinai, because they read women into the text in a variety of ways. <i>B’reishit Rabbah</i> 28.2 understands Exodus 19:3 (“Thus shall you say to the house of Jacob and declare to the children of Israel”) to mean that “the house of Jacob” refers to the women and “the children of Israel” refers to the men. According to the midrash, the order of the verse suggests that God sent Moses to the women with the Torah <i>first.</i> Perhaps, the sages speculate, God regretted the mistake of not directly giving Eve the commandment concerning the forbidden fruit and so resolved not to repeat it. Besides, the Rabbis note, women are more careful in observing religious precepts, and they are the ones who will instruct their children. Rashi, commenting on the Mishnah <i>(Shabbat</i> 9:3; BT <i>Shabbat</i> 86a), interprets Exodus 19:15 (“Do not go near a woman”) as a stricture specifically designed to enable Israel’s women to be present at Sinai. Since semen loses its power to create impurity after three days, Moses’ instruction to the men guarantees that women will remain ritually pure, even if they discharge residual semen during the Revelation. In other words, without ever naming Moses’ distortion of God’s words directly, the Rabbis sought to reverse its effects.
Several lessons can be drawn from this. One is the inseparability of revelation and interpretation. There is no revelation without interpretation; the foundational experience of revelation also involves a crucial act of interpretation. Second, we learn that the process of interpretation is ongoing. What Moses does, the Rabbis in this case seek to undo. While they reiterate and reinforce the exclusion of women in many contexts, they mitigate it in others. Third, insofar as the task of interpretation is continuing, it now lies with us. If women’s absence from Sinai is unthinkable to the Rabbis—despite the fact that they repeatedly reenact that absence in their own work—how much more must it be unthinkable to women and men today who function in communities in which women are full Jews? We have the privilege and the burden of recovering the divine words reverberating behind the silences in the text, recreating women’s understandings of revelation throughout Jewish history.

Mishpatim

P<small>ARASHAT</small> M<small>ISHPTIM CONTAINS</small> the Torah’s first law collection, which—unlike all other ancient Near-Eastern law collections—begins with regulations concerning slavery. The Torah seems unable to imagine an economy without slaves, but it frowns upon Hebrew slavery. Consequently, for Israelites in debt, Exodus 21:2–6 prescribes indentured servitude, but limited to six years. If a man enters debt-slavery while married, the master must let his wife go when he is released. However, if the master gives him a slave wife, the master retains the wife and children. What happens if the debt-slave declares, “I love my master and my wife and children: I do not wish to go free” (21:5)? He then has his earlobe pierced with an awl, and he becomes a slave in perpetuity, which the Rabbis interpret to mean until the Jubilee, or fiftieth, year.
Liberal readers are often sympathetic to this noble fellow who relinquishes his freedom to stay with his slave wife and children. But how would this case look from the perspective of the slave wife? I will argue that it looks much different. Who is this slave woman? She is not the <i>amah ivriyah</i> (Hebrew indentured servant) the text speaks about in 21:7–12. In that case, a girl has been sold by a presumably impoverished Israelite parent into a wealthier family on the understanding that she will eventually be married to the master or one of his sons as a free woman. This practice is well attested in other ancient Near Eastern documents. Should the man take another wife, he must continue to support her. An Israelite woman may not be resold if her owner is displeased with her; instead, she must go free without any compensation to the master. Her servitude, too, is time limited.
In contrast, the slave woman in Exodus 21:5–6 is most likely a foreign bondswoman. As a non-Israelite, she will not become part of the master’s family, and her slavery is perpetual, not limited. As property, she and a male Israelite slave can be mated by the master to breed more slaves, which cannot be done to an Israelite handmaiden. The foreign bondswoman does not choose her husband and cannot reject him. Both he and her children can be taken from her. As we learn from Exodus 21:20, 26–27, her very body is at risk, for masters may beat their own slaves without legal interference as long as they do not kill them or destroy a major body part. (Slave narratives from different parts of the world confirm that slaves were, and are, routinely battered and then expected to work. They may work less efficiently, but historically this has not been a sufficient disincentive to masters. The law cannot be said to permit battery of slaves; it is simply uninterested in such battery unless it results in major damage or death.)
While the Israelite slave must be freed at the start of the seventh year, how might the foreign bondswoman obtain her freedom? There are three options: First, she could save money given to her as a reward or a wage. If, with her owner’s permission, she contracts herself out for pay after finishing her other work, she might be able to accumulate money to buy her freedom. Mesopotamian records show that slaves were able to gain extra money as artisans and agents (see Gregory Chirichigno, <i>Debt-Slavery in Israel and the Ancient Near East,</i> 1993, p. 54); this practice might have existed in ancient Israel as well. Second, she could run away. Deuteronomy 23:16–17 says that a fugitive slave may not be returned to the owner. Third, an Israelite slave husband once released could buy his slave wife and children and free them. African-American history shows examples of former slaves who bought spouses and children or arranged for them to be secretly stolen and led to freedom. Harriet Tubman, whose code name was “Moses,” had a long career of gathering slaves and leading them North. Implicit in these narratives is a desperate determination to be free.
In contrast, what does the Israelite slave husband accomplish by pledging himself to perpetual slavery? When he declares that he loves his wife and children, it is not a happy, free family he is talking about. He cannot insure that his family will remain intact. His wife and children could be sold at any time. Even when his family is united, all will suffer the terrible humiliations of slavery: lack of choice, being objectified as property, being brutalized without recourse. Will the slave-wife appreciate his sinking into helplessness and hopelessness alongside her, especially if she was counting on his determination to free her once he was freed?
When the debt-slave professes his love for his master (whom he mentions before his slave family in v. 5), what kind of love is this? It is a love of dependency, of not having to make decisions, of not having to struggle for a living, to choose a wife, or take responsibility for one’s children. Beyond that, embracing slavery undoes the liberation from Egypt and rejects the liberating God. In BT <i>Kiddushin</i> 22b, Rabbi Yochanan ben Zakkai explains why this man’s ear is pierced with an awl: “The Holy One says, ‘The ear that heard on Mount Sinai when I said, ‘the people of Israel are my servants and not servants of servants’ and went and got himself a human master, let that ear be pierced.’”
The bondswoman is not where she is because she volunteered to be a slave. Most likely, she is a captive taken in war, well schooled in the corrosive bitterness of slavery. She might see the Hebrew slave’s renunciation of freedom not as a romantic gesture, but as a naïve, even stupid one. He has surrendered his power to free her or their children. He may have been her best chance for freedom.
The Torah is truthful with us, although that truth does not always make us happy. Ancient Near Eastern law could not imagine a world without slavery; yet Israelite law wanted the people to remain free of all human appropriation. That dilemma resulted in the preservation of this vignette about the conflicting loyalties of the Israelite slave. By highlighting the shadowy woman in the background, we get a rare, ironic glimpse of the dilemma from her usually invisible point of view.

Terumah

P<small>ARASHAT</small> T<small>’RUMAH FOCUSES</small> on building the symbolic core of the Israelites: the Tabernacle (<i>Mishkan),</i> which will become the central shrine and sacred symbol of God’s dwelling amidst the people. The <i>Mishkan</i> will be a physical entity, but it will spiritually link the Israelites into a nation through God’s divine Presence. This portable structure is considered the forerunner of the Temple built in Jerusalem many generations after the wilderness experience. Today, the synagogue, with its distinct reminders of the Tabernacle and Temple, functions as the communal focal point for the Jewish people. It, too, serves as the spiritual center connecting Jews of all generations to our history, people, and covenant.
The building of the <i>Mishkan</i> will force the Israelites to work together in order to fulfill a common goal and prepare for a common future. Although they have just been given the Decalogue—the precepts that bind the Israelites to God and one another—the people’s participation in the making of the Tabernacle will unify the nation in a different way. It will elevate the seemingly mundane work of construction into a sacred vocation, dedicated to the service of the One God who freed them from Egypt and revealed the terms of the covenant.
These former slaves are no strangers to building monuments and cities. The backbreaking labor of the Israelites in Egypt glorified the pharaoh and the Egyptian gods; but this certainly was not a sacred endeavor. In contrast, constructing the Tabernacle and all its finery will be holy work that aims to create sacred space and sacred instruments of worship.
<i>Parashat T’rumah</i> goes into great detail about the various parts of the Tabernacle, describing the Ark of the Covenant, the special table for the bread of display, the menorah, the curtains of the tent, the <i>parochet</i> (partition that screens off the sacred inner sanctum), and the altar for delivering offerings to God. In this Torah portion and the ones that follow, the design of the Tabernacle and its contents are laid out with precise measurements and great specificity. A number of these objects can be found in contemporary synagogues, reminders of the sacred structures of our biblical ancestors. Then and now, the ark stands as the epicenter of God’s presence and the container for the divine word. Many arks contain a special curtain or partition called a <i>parochet,</i> as in the Tabernacle. In sanctuaries today, the menorah shines as a symbol of the Jewish people, just as the <i>ner tamid</i> (27:20; understood as an eternal light) provides a sign of God’s indwelling presence.
According to <i>parashat T’rumah,</i> the Israelites— women and men alike—provide not only the labor, but also the raw materials for the <i>Mishkan.</i> Their gifts, brought as voluntary offerings, are gathered and transformed into a place for God to reside in their midst. Imagine how these former slaves felt as they became both builders of a nation and builders of a dwelling place for the Divine!
God instructs Moses: “Tell the Israelite people to bring Me gifts; you shall accept gifts for Me from every person whose heart is so moved” (25:2). This kind of giving, a freewill offering, does not come through guilt, coercion, or competition, but from the deepest recesses of the soul. The Israelites bring yarns, precious metals, cloth, and tanned skins—an array of earthly objects that will eventually become the sacred space where Israel can seek God’s presence.
Today, it is important for all of us to continue to make freewill offerings to the institutions that unify the Jewish people. Along with <i>tzedakah</i> (required giving), <i>t’rumah</i> (voluntary giving) is vital for sustaining our community. Synagogues, Jewish centers, and Jewish communal agencies cannot survive on membership fees or dues alone. As they struggle to meet their financial needs, these institutions require our heartfelt support through the freewill gifts that are necessary to fulfill the good and holy work of these organizations.
The synagogue, in particular, lies at the intersection of the earthly and heavenly realms. The heir to the <i>Ohel Mo’ed</i> (Tent of Meeting), the contemporary synagogue is the place where Jews most often seek out God. Through study, prayer, and communal gatherings, the synagogue provides the necessary environment for Jewish connection, renewal, and survival. When we bring our voluntary gifts of money, time, and other resources, we bring the realm of the holy into our lives.
Just as our ancestors were transformed from ordinary slaves into builders of God’s home on earth, we too are transformed through this sacred endeavor. We bring more peace, more hope, and more faith into our own lives and the life of our community when we support and build the synagogue. We strengthen the Jewish people even as we strengthen ourselves as Jews.
Voluntary giving is different for each and every person; it is not simply a percentage or flat rate. A person of substantial means has the ability to give greater sums, while a person of more modest means might not have the capacity to give at such large levels. Nevertheless, each person can and should give significantly. The definition of a “meaningful gift” varies for each individual, depending on one’s circumstances. But regardless of the <i>quantity</i> of the offering, the <i>quality</i> is the same: giving a meaningful voluntary offering to a synagogue or other Jewish institution is a privilege, not a burden. This kind of giving—be it of money or time and effort—is cheerful giving, giving that makes a difference, giving that matters. Our parashah teaches that the <i>t’rumah-</i>gift is an offering that comes from the deep recesses of the heart. Then and now, it is a privilege to be involved in the sacred work of building community and constructing a dwelling place for the Divine.

Tetzaveh

M<small>OST YEARS</small>, this Torah portion is read during the week preceding Purim. The connection between the parashah and Purim is not immediately apparent. <i>T’tzaveh</i> is filled with exacting details about the assembly of the priestly garments and the ritual role Aaron and his sons are to perform as anointed priests. The book of Esther is a melodramatic tale of threat, intrigue, and ultimate redemption through plot twists and the reluctant heroism of a beautiful queen.
While the plots and purposes of these texts are vastly different, each in its own way, asks us to confront an absence. <i>T’tzaveh</i> is the only parashah from the beginning of the book of Exodus until the end of Deuteronomy where the name of Moses does not appear. And Esther is one of only two books of the Bible where the name of God does not appear. These absences are cause for abundant commentary in each individual case, but the relationship between the two texts seems to receive only passing mention.
What insight can this parallel <i>presence of absence</i> convey?
Many commentators speculate as to why Moses’ name is absent from <i>parashat T’tzaveh.</i> One theory is that the omission is meant to acknowledge the anniversary of his death, which is said to be the seventh of Adar, just one week before Purim. Another theory is that Moses’ name is left out as divine admonishment for his jealousy over Aaron’s appointment as chief priest. Still others maintain that in his humility and self-effacement, Moses graciously cedes the role to his brother and absents himself from the narrative, so to speak, to make this clear.
Regardless of the reaction that Moses may or may not have experienced when his brother became the head priest instead of him, the narrative suggests that although his name is not mentioned, Moses remains God’s agent—the enabler for all that is to happen. This is made evident through an unusual grammatical formulation found in the parashah’s opening verses. Elsewhere in Torah, God’s commands to Moses are stated in the simple imperative: “instruct” (<i>tzav)</i> or “speak” (<i>dabber</i>). In <i>T’tzaveh,</i> however, three instances of an additional pronoun appear, giving extra emphasis to the actor responsible for the actions. Translating the text more literally, the first verse of the parashah (27:20) reads: “And <i>you, yourself</i> shall command the children of Israel.” Shortly thereafter, we read: “And <i>you,</i> bring near <i>to yourself</i> your brother Aaron, with his sons, from among the Israelites, to serve Me as priests” (28:1). The same grammatical form appears two lines later: <i>“You, yourself</i> speak to all who are skillful, whom I have endowed with the gift of skill, to make Aaron’s vestments” (28:3). The 16th-century commentator Moshe Alshekh suggests that this repeated double emphasis is God’s way of saying to Moses, “It’s all really you. You have a greater share in it than anyone. All fulfill themselves through you” (cited in Nehama Leibowitz, <i>Studies in Shemot,</i> 1980, p. 526). Perhaps such language means to tell us that Moses is not absent at all. Rather, his presence is momentarily diminished so that other leaders can step forward to serve the broader needs of the community.
Just as we can see Moses as a behind the scenes mover in the parashah, so too, can we see God as filling a similar role in the Purim narrative. While many interpret the Purim story as an instance when the Jews achieved victory through their own actions—without waiting for divine intercession—the classic rabbinic interpretation is that God was hidden from view, but not absent. In BT <i>Chullin</i> 139b, the Rabbis made this point through a biblical proof text, asking: “Where is Esther indicated in the Torah? In the verse ‘I will surely hide (<i>astir</i>) My face’ (Deuteronomy 31:18).” The Hebrew word <i>astir</i> (“I will hide”) serves as a wordplay on Esther’s name.
We can extend the wordplay even further by considering that the Hebrew word <i>m’gillah</i> shares the same root as the verb “to reveal” (<i>g-l-h).</i> Thus, <i>M’gillat Ester</i> (“Scroll or Book of Esther”) can be read playfully as “revealing the hidden.” God’s presence is revealed through Mordecai’s conviction and Esther’s courage. God’s presence is revealed in the triumph of good over evil, in the flawed but ultimately responsible actions of human beings.
In a typical Purim twist, the biblical text also reinforces the <i>presence of God’s absence</i> by pointing out the consequences of the <i>absence of God’s presence.</i> The story opens with a drunken debauchery hosted by King Ahasuerus, where “he displayed the glory of his kingdom and the richness of his magnificent splendor for many days, for 180 days” (Esther 1:4). The words used to describe the “glory” and “splendor” of his kingdom are the same words, <i>kavod u’tiferet,</i> that are used in <i>T’tzaveh</i> to describe the priestly garments (28:2, 40; there translated as “dignity and adornment”). In <i>T’tzaveh,</i> the lavish garments are designed to serve and honor God. In Esther, the King’s wealth is evidence of his corruption. The midrash draws an even more powerful connection by claiming that the riches of Ahasuerus’ kingdom were made up of the spoils of the Temple, including the priestly garments themselves (<i>Ester Rabbah</i> 2.1).
The Purim message that sometimes gets lost in all of the revelry is that a sense of God’s presence in the world, even if hidden and obscure, gives us the strength and moral purpose to cope with uncertainties and imperfections. <i>Parashat T’tzaveh</i> paints a picture of the detail and exacting effort it took for the Israelites to feel God’s presence in their midst. Today, we have no priests and no Temple. The only vestige we have of this experience is the <i>ner tamid,</i> the eternal light, the first thing that God instructs Moses to establish in the opening verses of the parashah. This light has come to symbolize the light of Torah. For us, then, the glory and splendor of God’s presence must be felt through the study of Torah and the constant striving to live in its light.

Ki Tisa

Y<small>EARS AGO</small>, my boyfriend and I climbed the alleged Mount Sinai, with the shower of Perseus streaking the Egyptian night sky with shooting stars. At the summit, as God pulled the sun up from the fragrant desert floor, Jonathan held up a ring and proposed. It is written in <i>Pirkei Avot,</i> “Every day a voice goes forth from Sinai” (6:2). That dawn, I heard the reverberation of a sacred voice in the words, “Would you be willing to spend your life with me?”
The revelation at Mount Sinai was a wedding—an eternal, loving joining between God and Israel. The story we read is but a veil covering a radiance we must allow ourselves to know.
This Torah portion, <i>Ki Tisa,</i> begins with Moses taking a census. God then chooses Bezalel to be the artisan of the Tabernacle. Moses climbs Mount Sinai, shrouded in mist and mystery, while the Israelites below build their golden idol. When Moses sees this, he breaks the stone tablets, grinds up the golden calf, and makes the Israelites drink it. Moses ascends the mountain a second time. When he descends, his face is so radiant that he must wear a veil.
But a light <i>ruach</i> (wind) blows from the west, disturbing the mist, and we see the radiant face just beneath the veil of text.
Moses is the master alchemist. He climbs the mountain, hides in the cleft of the <i>tzur</i> (rock). He speaks with the philosopher’s stone face to face. He holds the two tablets of prime matter in his hands. When he grinds up the calf into a fine powder, stirs it into water, holds it up into the air, a brilliant liquid shimmering with flakes of gold, he creates a dizzyingly potent potion, a love potion, an elixir of life. A toast!
We drink of it. Our eyes are opened to see beneath the veil. <i>Ki Tisa</i> is not about frenzied idol worship, but the detailed description of a spectacular wedding feast between God and the people Israel. God-the-Lover and Moses-the-beloved take a census of who shall be invited, and they make the long guest list: 600,000 and growing. Bezalel is singled out to decorate the Tent, arrange the flowers, and adorn the feast.
Time passes, and we find ourselves in the whirl of the banquet festivity. There is dancing and singing, and in the very center, what seems to be a golden calf. But blink your eyes! It is the glittering pile of precious wedding gifts.
High on the <i>bimah</i> (platform), under a <i>chuppah</i> (wedding canopy) of cloud, God presents Moses with the marriage contract, our <i>ketubah.</i> One commentator points out that 31:18, which is translated “Upon finishing (<i>ke-challoto</i>) speaking with him…[God] gave Moses the two tablets,” could also be read, with the slight change of one vowel: “And [God] gave Moses as [God’s] bride (<i>ke-challato)…</i> the two tablets.” Moses, our symbolic bride, turns around in the <i>chuppah</i> and faces the guests. He lifts the contract for all to see—and then smashes the glass beneath his foot.
Now it is time for <i>yichud,</i> when husband and wife are alone together for the first time. In 33:12–23, we read excerpts from a conversation between God and Moses that sound particularly romantic: “Pray let me know Your ways, that I may know You and continue in Your favor” (v. 13). “You have truly gained My favor and I have singled you out by name” (v. 17). “Oh, let me behold Your Presence!” (v. 18). “I will make all My goodness pass before you,” (v. 19). And, at the end, God’s hand reaches out for Moses (v. 22).
Moses comes down from the mountain blushing, a crimson glow in his cheeks. Earlier, when he went into the Tent to meet our Love, he removed his veil, so only God should see his glowing face; but when he leaves the Tent, he lowers the veil.
But this is only one way to imagine this mythic wedding. Instead of seeing <i>Moses</i> (representing all the Israelites) as the bride and <i>God</i> as the groom, some commentators understand <i>Israel</i> to be the groom and <i>Torah</i> the bride. In <i>Midrash HaGadol,</i> for example, it is written:
<i>In the third month…they entered the wilderness of Sinai</i> (19:1).…[This may be compared] to a king who betrothed a woman, and set a time [for the marriage]. When the time arrived they said: “It is time for the woman to enter the <i>chuppah</i>.” Similarly, when the time arrived for the Torah to be given, they said, “It is time for the Torah to be given to Israel” (Elliot R. Wolfson, <i>Circle in the Square</i>, 1995, P. 4).
Here, Torah is the bride and Israel is the groom.
On the summit of the mountain, within the curtain of cloud, the question of who is marrying whom is enveloped in dreamlike fog. We might even wonder if the true union taking place upon Mount Sinai is perhaps the revelatory union of heavenly <i>Adonai</i> with earthbound <i>Shechinah</i>: God’s masculine and feminine Presence united through Israel, in love.
When the potion wears off, the children of Israel look around them. Once again they are in the desert, long dragged-out footsteps stretching behind them. And they say one to the other, “Love is in this place, and we did not know it! What have we been doing all of this time? Where have we been? Is this the desert, or is it <i>gan eiden</i> (Garden of Eden)? Are we lost and alone, or are we this moment caught up in a fierce union with God? Are we wandering with sandals filled with dust, or are we soaring on eagles’ wings?”
We look from one to the other—and wonder what is the face beneath the face beneath the face we wear every day. Sometimes the beauty of the other is as allusive as a sunray on the water. We seek the radiant face beneath the veil.
Messy world. Angry, idolatrous world. Tired, hungry, sick, and sorry world. But if we could lift the sooty, splattered veil…we might see…
This thing between God and Israel—it is not that we are in <i>covenant.</i> It is that we are in <i>love.</i> Every day a voice comes forth from Sinai and begs your answer, “Would you be willing to spend your life with Me?” <i>Yes</i>.

Vayakhel

P<small>ARASHAT</small> V<small>AYAK’HEIL GIVES US</small> a detailed description of the construction and furnishings of the Tabernacle; in fact, more than most of us wish to hear. Why include this data? why does it matter? It matters because in the ancient world, a temple was a model of the cosmos (Mircea Eliade, <i>The Myth of the Eternal Return,</i> 1954). How the temple is designed and furnished and where objects are positioned express symbolically what its builders believe about the nature of the cosmos. <i>Vayak’heil</i> gives us the specifications for these symbols, but it cannot tell us all that they mean. Symbols and metaphors exist precisely because they point toward what cannot be entirely expressed. Moreover, symbols and rituals are not static. They grow and change along with the people who use them, acquiring new layers of meaning along the way.
As an example, let’s look at a symbolic object from the Tabernacle that we recognize, the <i>Menorah</i> (lampstand). what does it mean? The <i>Menorah’s</i> function is to give light, and light is an important element in our own ritual acts as well. we kindle lights for <i>Shabbat, Havdalah, Yom Tov</i> (holiday), <i>yortsayt</i> (or <i>yahrzeit,</i> memorial occasion). The philosopher Ernst Cassirer says that the creation of light, which begins many creation myths, represents the creation of consciousness (<i>Language and Myth,</i> 1946). Perhaps, when we ritually kindle light, we reenact the dawning of consciousness that enables us both to know God and to be aware of ourselves. Is the <i>Menorah</i> a lamp representing the light-giving or knowledge-giving aspect of the cosmos?
The <i>Menorah</i> is not just any lamp, however. It is a giant lamp of unusual design, so tall that a priest must ascend a ramp to light it. Twice, in 25:31–40 and then in our parashah (37:17–24), the <i>Menorah</i> is painstakingly described: a golden base, a tall shaft, six golden branches issuing from the sides, each branch bearing cups shaped like almond blossoms, detailed with calyx and petals, plus more blossom-cups on the shaft itself. Atop these branches are seven golden lamps.
Clearly the <i>Menorah</i> embodies some kind of metaphor. But metaphor has rules, just like tennis or Scrabble®. One rule is that there has to be some link between the <i>tenor</i> (the topic under discussion) and the <i>vehicle</i> (the concrete object to which it is being compared). what, then, is tall, has a <i>kaneh</i> (stem), with <i>kanim</i> (branches) extending from it, and <i>p’rachim</i> (flowers) intermixed with bud-like swellings (<i>kaftorim</i>)? The <i>Menorah</i> is a representation of a flowering almond tree!
The almond tree is distinctive not only in that it blossoms early, but also in that it then rapidly buds leaves, develops new branches, and forms its sustaining fruit—all before the flowers’ calyx drops off (Nogah Hareuveni, <i>Nature in Our Biblical Heritage,</i> 1980, p. 130). Its Hebrew name, <i>shaked,</i> means “the early waker,” and it may symbolize God’s watchfulness or the speed with which God responds (see Jeremiah 1:11). It is also the legitimating emblem of the Aaronite priesthood. At the end of Korah’s rebellion in Numbers 17, Moses deposits the staffs of all the Israelite chieftains in the Tent of Meeting, “and there the staff of Aaron…had sprouted: it had brought forth sprouts, produced blossoms and borne almonds” (17:23).
Trees, as well as light, are associated with consciousness for Jews. Our moral consciousness comes from having eaten the fruit of a tree (Genesis 3). The Torah is “a tree of life to all who hold fast to her” (Proverbs 3:18). Trees are elders of the living earth. Their rootedness, endurance, and capacity for renewal is a blessing extended to the righteous: “The righteous shall flourish like the date palm” (Psalm 92:13). The righteous too shall be trees of life.
But the <i>Menorah</i> is yet a different sort of tree, because its branches are crowned with bowls filled with oil that are lit regularly by the priests. who ever heard of a tree perpetually on fire?
He gazed and there was a bush all aflame, yet the bush was not consumed God called to him out of the bush: “Moses! Moses!” He answered, “Here I am.” And [God] said, “Do not come closer! Remove your sandals from your feet, for the place on which you stand is holy ground!” (3:2–5).
In his book <i>Sinai and Zion</i> (1985), Jon Levenson describes how the religion of Sinai was transformed into the religion of Zion. In the <i>Tanach’s</i> account of the settlement of the Land of Israel, Sinai—the wilderness mountain of the <i>s’neh</i> (thornbush), the site of Israel’s revelation and covenant—was refashioned as Zion, the holy mountain of the Jerusalem temple. The Burning Bush itself was reproduced as a golden tree lit by priests. Levenson speculates that the emblem of the deity of Sinai was some sort of tree. He points out that the blessing in Deuteronomy 33:16 identifies God as <i>shochni s’neh,</i> “the Presence in the Bush.”
The feminist theologian Nelle Morton describes metaphor as an explosive process with a trajectory, like a meteor (<i>The Journey is Home,</i> 1985). The tree on fire that is not consumed—this is an image on an immense journey. The metaphor has traveled from Sinai to Zion, to Exile and beyond, and we have not even begun to exhaust its resonances.
A tree on fire embraces what we misperceive as antitheses: earth and heaven, matter and energy. what we are accustomed to polarize is revealed to us in blazing union. A tree on fire unconsumed proclaims that what is material, temporal, perishable, can sustain what the Christian theologian Rudolf Otto calls the “fearsome and fascinating mystery” of the presence of God (<i>The Idea of the Holy,</i> 1923). If we were only able to see, the whole earth would appear to us like a tree on fire, and we would see a tree on fire in every human frame.
We cannot relive the moment when a startled shepherd sees a terrible and wonderful sight: a tree on fire, unconsumed. we can only make a memory-tree to remind us of that moment, an artifice that we ourselves ceremoniously set afire amidst song and liturgy. The memory tree is a tree of wonder only and not a tree of terror. we take our chances, stubbornly continuing to set our memory-tree on fire—real fire, with all its potential for enlightenment and danger, reproducing the encounter with that fiery presence we seek and yet fear: the revealer of mysteries, the dweller in the bush.

Pekudei

F<small>OR THE FIRST TIME</small> in the Torah, with the completion of the <i>Mishkan,</i> the presence of God has a regular home, an earthly residence. And this home is not only for God; it is a “Tent of Meeting” for Israel as well. When God’s presence enters the <i>Mishkan,</i> it is clear that Israel’s work in building this sacred structure has been blessed. For the first time, by learning from past mistakes, Israel—all Israel—has a place to experience God.
In other words, the same Israelites who once sought to contain power and divinity within the idol of the Golden Calf (Exodus 32) now create the <i>Mishkan</i> (Exodus 35–40), which, while made of the same materials and by some of the very same processes, emphatically does not attempt to contain God. Having been given an explicit opportunity to fall again into the trap of deifying something material, having been handed the opportunity to make a cage for God, the people instead create the <i>Mishkan</i> and regard it only as a space, not as a stand-in or a container for God (Avivah Gottlieb Zornberg, <i>The Particulars of Rapture,</i> 2001, pp. 480–481, 330–333). Once this purpose is established, God’s presence dwells in the <i>Mishkan,</i> in their midst; the process of <i>t’shuvah</i> (repentance) is complete.
Given the prohibitions against making images of God, the disaster of the Golden Calf, and the lesson the Israelites have begun to learn that God cannot be represented physically, we might expect the presence of God in the <i>Mishkan</i> to be without form altogether, invisible. Wouldn’t God’s complete lack of form at this moment make perfect sense in light of the Israelites’ newfound awareness and understanding?
However, God’s presence is manifested in the <i>Mishkan</i> in not one but two different ways: as a cloud by day and fire by night. Why does God come to the Israelites (and to us, as we read) in these very common forms? Wouldn’t the lesson of the Golden Calf be more clearly enforced if now God’s presence remained untainted by any physical form?
Perhaps these manifestations exist precisely in order to teach the Israelites that an experience of God can exist within the visual and tangible realms. That is, the problem with worshipping the Golden Calf was not that the calf could be seen; it was that the Golden Calf was worshipped as if it contained God entirely, as if God was nowhere else. Here, the Israelites learn that an encounter with God does not have to be so abstract, so removed from their sensory experience that they are left without any means of comprehending or describing it. In other words, the divine experience can include things seen. However, it must also transform our grasp of the seen object, our understanding of God, and, by extension, the act of seeing and the seer.
Remember the narrative of the Burning Bush that was on fire but not consumed (3:1–4). This phenomenon is contrary to our understanding of what happens when a bush catches on fire. For Moses, the very existence of the Burning Bush not consumed awakens the possibility that there is something divine in that fire. God could just have easily come to Moses without a Burning Bush; however, this is what enables Moses to find evidence of God’s presence. Before God even addresses Moses, he sees the fire acting differently and realizes that there is more to the world than what he knows.
Later, we read about two pillars that accompany the Israelites as they leave Egypt: a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night (13:20–22). The cloud is a signpost and the fire an illuminated guide in the darkness; both show Israel the path to follow on their journey through the wilderness. But note that neither object acts naturally. The cloud does not blanket and obscure, as we expect clouds to do; instead, it is contained in a pillar and provides direction for the Israelites. Similarly, the fire does not spread and destroy whatever is in its path, as we expect fire to do; like the cloud, the fire is contained, a giant torch. In both of these manifestations, the Israelites began to see, just as Moses saw in the bush, the possibility of natural things, things of-this-earth, being bent and shaped in unnatural, divine ways.
Focusing on our parashah (40:34–38), God’s presence now dwells in the completed <i>Mishkan,</i> not as something invisible to Israel, but as something very familiar. Just as before, God’s presence is manifested as a cloud by day and fire by night. Here, too, the familiar acts in an unusual way. The cloud remains in the <i>Mishkan</i>; it does not drift or dissipate. Even more remarkably, the fire burns night after night and does not consume anything; each morning, the <i>Mishkan</i> remains intact (Zornberg, p. 492). These manifestations—these miracles—allow Israel to find and perceive God’s presence but still remain aware that their perceptions cannot begin to encompass the totality of that presence.
Had God dwelt invisibly in the <i>Mishkan,</i> had the Israelites never seen God’s presence there, they might have assumed that seeking visual encounters with God is a form of idolatry. By appearing “in the view of all the house of Israel” (40:38), God teaches that the problem with worshipping idols is not the visual experience itself; the problem occurs when the act merely confirms our preconceptions about God (Zornberg, p. 482). The Israelites see God’s presence in natural, familiar forms that then transcend and undermine those forms. This seeing, and this dissonance, tests their understanding of the world and leads to a more complex relationship with God.
So it is for us: We need not be wary of looking for visual evidence of God’s presence in the world around us. Seeking God’s presence with our eyes is not idolatrous; it is only idolatry when we “know” in advance what we will see, when our expectations restrain us. Unfortunately, we may have been so afraid of making idols that we have limited ourselves to divine experiences that are abstract and often detached, expecting ourselves to develop a relationship with God without using our eyes. What would happen if we started looking for God’s presence in fire and clouds once more? How much do our relationships with God stand to gain from our actually seeing what may have been there all along? At the very least, we will benefit from the search alone, from our looking day and night. And at best, it is possible that if we look, we will see. And then, we will never see the same way again, for we ourselves will have changed.

Vayikra

“A<small>ND</small> A<small>ARON</small>’<small>S SONS</small>, the priests, shall offer the blood” (1:5). That is pretty much how <i>parashat Vayikra</i> introduces Leviticus, a book that sits smack in the center of the Torah like a tough vein of gristle that runs through a tender, juicy steak. Most of Leviticus is hard to digest. <i>Vayikra</i> is an instruction manual, and technical writing rarely yields compelling drama or inspiring ethical teachings. The language of our portion is formal, stylized, repetitive, precise. Yet the dryness of language cannot quite disguise the essential problem with what transpires here: the portion is slippery with blood. Rising up from the page are the screams of dying animals, the pungent stink of smoke and burning flesh.
The priestly passages in the Torah not only arouse anxiety in the squeamish—they often seem to be among the most irrelevant we encounter in our sacred text. After all, the major skills of Levites and <i>kohanim</i> (the priests), technicians of the sacred, became obsolete almost two thousand years ago when the Temple went up in flames. While Jews with the status of <i>kohanim</i> survive in our own day, their role is marginal even in traditional synagogues, and Reform Jews have virtually eliminated their special status. Yet the Torah promises that Israelites who are faithful to the covenant will become <i>mamlechet kohanim</i>—a kingdom of priests; it envisions an entire people which serves in a priestly role (Exodus 19:6).
No doubt many of us would have preferred that the Torah command us to become “a kingdom of prophets,” collectively denouncing the world’s inequities, speaking out for justice and defending the downtrodden. But it is to the priesthood that we Jews are taught to aspire, and the priesthood from which we must seek instruction in <i>parashat Vayikra.</i> What can we learn from the role of the priests—and from these methodical instructions for the slaughter and dismemberment of animals for ritual offering on the altar?
If human beings were gentle and benevolent by nature we might not need the stern, disciplinary teachings of the priesthood. The Torah’s insight is that priestly service is what our homicidal proclivities demand and deserve. So the descendants of Phinehas, a family whose origins are murderous and full of rage (see Numbers 25:1–14), are taught to (re)direct their zealous energies to the service of God. They turn from uncontrolled aggression to the discipline of ritual slaughter, hedged about with myriad laws and regulations. As officiants at the altar, their killing is tamed and domesticated, their dangerous proclivities neutralized. Stripped of the normal male prerogatives of land ownership and military service, they become, as my teacher Melila Hellner-Eshed suggests, “God’s housewives”—feminized men who dress in skirts and busy themselves with the domestic work of cooking and cleaning in God’s holy dwelling.
Sublimation of aggression may, in fact, underlie the entire sacrificial system of worship. A <i>korban,</i> an offering to God, is more than an act of violence. It is violence transmuted into something higher; it is God re-shaping a destructive human drive into productive, creative energy. Through bringing offerings to the altar, the fierce passions of the ego are not indulged but controlled and transcended. Animals, valued possessions and markers of wealth, are given selflessly to God—and thus the worshiper learns gradually to overcome narcissism and greed. Animal blood is dashed on the altar, but human blood may not be shed; substitution trains the worshipers to restrain their own innate savagery.
The opening of our parashah reads: <i>Adam ki yakriv mikem korban l’Adonai</i>—“When any of you presents an offering of cattle to יהוה” (1:2). A Hasidic commentator offers an interpretive reading: “One who wants to become <i>karov</i>—close to God—must bring an offering <i>mikem</i>—that is, from oneself.” And what is the offering? It is the beast within ourselves—the part of ourselves that is capable of cruelty and brutality, even to those we love (<i>Itturei Torah,</i> IV, 1998, p. 10). The ritual of animal sacrifice, understood symbolically, conveys the struggle of flawed human beings to become more humane.
The Israelites approached the altar in order to attain closeness to the Divine—to experience what we today would call spiritual elevation, a consciousness of being lifted up to something higher than themselves. They drew nearer to God not by denying the body and its drives but by raising the physical to a sacred purpose. From the rituals of worship set forth in <i>Vayikra</i> we learn that aggression need not be extinguished in the personality in order to lead a holy life; it may instead be channeled in constructive directions and employed for the good.
A Talmudic passage reminds us that certain traits may be inborn, but character is never determined by fate. All human energies are ours to activate as we wish, in accordance with our freedom. Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak observed: “One who is born under the sign of Mars will be a shedder of blood.” Rav Ashi did not see such a prediction as necessarily bad, for as he pointed out, one could “shed blood” for a good cause—by becoming “either a surgeon,…a ritual slaughterer <i>(shochet),</i> or a circumciser (<i>mohel</i>)” (BT <i>Shabbat</i> 156a).
So we may aspire, even today, to be a kingdom of priests—a people committed to elevating and sanctifying even the darkest forces within the psyche. If we closely read the seemingly dry instructions and bloody details of <i>parashat Vayikra,</i> we learn that through the discipline of our faith we can redeem what is broken and flawed within ourselves, transforming barbaric urges into opportunities for blessing.

E<small>LIZABETH</small> E<small>HRLICH WAS ONCE</small> a comfortable “cultural Jew.” The practice of Jewish religion held little attraction for her. <i>Miriam’s Kitchen: A Memoir</i> (1997) is Ehrlich’s report on a year spent learning from her mother-in-law, Miriam, a Polish Holocaust survivor, the details of domestic religion—the laws and the lore. As the year passed, Ehrlich grew increasingly interested in becoming a ritual specialist in her home. She wanted to “infuse the minutiae of everyday life with something more.” She recognized that someone would have to make this a “priority mission,” and that that someone would be her.
We can draw an arc from Elizabeth Ehrlich’s kitchen back to the Torah portion before us. Many contemporary Jews find this portion among those that make their eyes glaze over. Reform theologian Rachel Adler reports that when she was growing up she never heard the word “ritual” without it being prefaced by the word “meaningless.” Likewise, Arnold Eisen, a scholar of contemporary Judaism, for many years kept his sights on so-called higher things (like faith and covenant) in lieu of studying the sacrificial system <i>(Taking Hold of Torah,</i> 1997, p. 71). If the rituals of sacrifice in the sanctuary (6:1–7:48) seem to be of little interest, the elaborate rites for ordaining priests (8:1–36) appear to be both archaic and problematic in their exclusion of women from spiritual leadership.
Over the years Adler, Eisen, and many others have come to appreciate the power of the rituals described in this parashah. As we learn about ritual as a human phenomenon, we come to understand it as a language of its own, uniquely meaningful. To do justice to the sacrificial system, we need to contextualize Israelite sacrifice with the help of anthropology, sociology, comparative religion, and even neurobiology. We can ask also how this ritual of sacrifice was transformed in Christianity and in Judaism. When we consider the Jewish transformation of the sacrificial system, the question of gender, power, spirituality, and leadership can emerge in a more nuanced light.
Anthropologist Mary Douglas, who has been called “the mother of ritual studies,” shows that Leviticus has a specific way to approach the subject of spirituality and the body in relation to sacrifices (see the introduction to 1:1–3:7).
Christianity transformed sacrifices by bringing sacrifices’ symbolism right into the heart of its worship service. Priests prepared and congregants ate and drank the Eucharist, the body and blood of the ultimate “lamb” of God. Carolyn Walker Bynum documents that although women were marginalized, in the Middle Ages nuns and upper-class lay women found their way into this system of sacralized food through rituals of fasting and in ecstatic feasting <i>(Holy Feast and Holy Fast,</i> 1987).
After the destruction of Jerusalem’s Temple, the Rabbis replaced the sacrificial system in two ways. The first was to commune with God through prayer and study. The second was via a system that maintained sacrifices in a new form, hinted at in 7:22–27: The whole complex of laws and rituals around preparing and eating food became another way in which the sacrificial system lived on. With this change, women became the ritual specialists for what was once temple sacrifice in its domestic transformation—because women in traditional Jewish society, as in many cultures, control food resources.
The Talmud says that the table upon which we eat is like the altar of the Temple (BT <i>B’rachot</i> 55a). We are bidden to wash our hands before breaking bread not simply to cleanse them, but because the priests washed their hands before they offered a sacrifice. When making bread, the baker takes a small piece of the dough <i>(challah)</i> and burns it to represent the sacrifice. On the Sabbath, the <i>challot</i> represent the showbreads sacrificed at the Temple.
Guarding the traditional food taboos, taking <i>challah,</i> preparing the home for holidays and for the Sabbath (literally “making Sabbath”), and distributing food to the poor—all of these are areas in which women have controlled and executed significant ritual functions. There is an old saying quoted by Hayim Soloveitchik: “A <i>yidishe bale-boste</i> (Jewish home-maker) takes instruction from her mother only.”
Susan Starr Sered, an anthropologist of religion, conducted a study of illiterate Kurdish Jewish women who were living in Jerusalem. That research led her to challenge preconceptions about the nature of spirituality and the holy. In her book <i>Women as Ritual Experts</i> (1992), she reports that these women developed religious culture alongside the Judaism of text and synagogue practiced by the men. As she notes, what anthropologist Robert Redfield calls the “little tradition” was based in the home, where women were the ritual experts. The domestic religion used many of the same symbols and ideas of the “male” Judaism but applied them to sanctify the daily tasks of the women, in the domain that they controlled. In Sered’s study, food preparation loomed large, from maintaining the laws of kashrut in the home to distributing cookies at the graves of ancestors after prayers had been answered. These women had developed what she called a “devotional autonomy.”
During the Holocaust, some Jewish women who were interned in Terezin compiled a cookbook from memory. The Terezin prisoners recalled and wrote down their recipes for chocolate torte, breast of goose, plum strudel, and other traditional dishes while surviving on potato scraps. Their effort was a kind of spiritual revolt, an act of resistance against brutality, calling to mind the everyday world they had known and presided over. These half-forgotten recipes, scribbled on scraps of paper, became the texts that helped them to transcend their situation. Decades later, their book found its way to the daughter of one of the authors who had died in the camps. The book was published as <i>In Memory’s Kitchen</i> in 1996 by Cara de Silva.
Elizabeth Ehrlich—the kitchen apprentice to her mother-in-law—learned something surprising about spiritual leadership. This is not to say that women today should accept exclusion from the realms of study or politics and retreat back to home and hearth. Rather, as we seek lives of spiritual integrity, we would do well to widen our gaze beyond the so-called higher things, to recall the power of the home through which Jewish women—against great odds—have powerfully continued connection to God and community across generations.

Shmini

A<small>LL</small> I<small>SRAEL IS</small> a kingdom of priests (Exodus 19:6). Some among them are priests of priests. At the top of the priestly pyramid stands Aaron, the <i>kohein gadol</i> (high priest). The <i>kohein gadol</i> is vested with considerable power and responsibility. Though everything is new—and no models exist for him to follow—Aaron carries out his role with great competency and dignity as he offers up the first sacrifices to God.
In <i>parashat Sh’mini,</i> we find ourselves with Aaron and his family at an exhilarating moment. It is the climactic eighth day of dedication of the Tabernacle. Exultant and joyful, Aaron and his sons bless the people—and the glory of God appears before all. A fire of heavenly origin consumes the sacrifices in their entirety; the people fall on their faces in awe and love of God. Aaron’s joy must surely be overflowing.
Suddenly, the scene turns into heartbreak. Though not commanded to do so, Nadab and Abihu, Aaron’s elder sons, put incense into pans and bring it as an offering. Instantly, a fire of God leaps out and consumes them. Aaron is devastated. These two sons were outstanding young men: they were deemed worthy of ascending Mt. Sinai in a most prestigious order—after Moses and Aaron, and before the 70 elders—and worthy of participating in the festive meal at which God’s face was shown (Exodus 24:1, 9–11).
What could have happened? We struggle to understand. Was this a punishment from God, or a random accident? What crime could they have committed that was so heinous as to warrant death by flash fire? Perhaps they were acting out of enthusiasm and desire to serve. Perhaps they were overcome simply by the pure joy of being in the presence of God—and wished only to increase awe in the hearts of the people. And even if they were guilty of not following God’s word to the last, did not their father Aaron have credit in the storehouse of good deeds? Was there not some milder punishment that could have been meted out on the scale, such as that meted out to other miscreants in the Torah?
Yet despite the fact that they performed everything else properly and created a glorious Tabernacle celebration, despite their father’s merit or their own, they are swiftly cut down.
When I was growing up, my high school Torah teacher, Mar Yerushalmi, communicated unequivocally to his students that Nadab and Abihu were punished for the grave sin of eating in the place where they should not have. Whenever a student would be caught chewing gum in class as we studied Torah with Rashi’s commentary, Yerushalmi would remind her of Nadab and Abihu. On the one hand, this devout teacher was implying that the sons were guilty and deserved what they got; on the other, likening their crime to a teenager’s act of chewing gum in the wrong setting was his way of subtly suggesting to a class of impressionable teenagers that he, too, felt the punishment did not fit the crime.
The Torah narrative teaches us that Moses struggles with the same issue, trying to find an explanation. He wants to offer consolation to his beloved brother and closest friend, yet he takes care not to betray his responsibility as the leader who must teach the people to follow God’s law “This is what יהוה meant by saying, ‘Through those near to Me I show Myself holy’” (10:3). Moses’ delicate message to the people—and his only consolation to Aaron—is that this was not a random act but a sentence decreed on those closest to God, who are thus held to a higher standard. What was Aaron’s response? Two simple words: <i>vayidom Aharon</i> (“And Aaron was silent”). The word <i>vayidom</i> means more than he kept quiet—<i>vayishtok.</i> Aaron responded with a profound, shattering silence, a stunning silence, a shocked silence. He does not justify the cruel decree by blaming his sons and accepting their fate as punishment for their sins. Yet, neither does he revolt or protest God’s action. Total silence.
Aaron’s response is the profoundest human and religious response to the reality that there are times when good people die unjustly or are consumed in tragedies that seem to be arbitrary, shocking, without justification, and with nothing to ameliorate the pain and loss of those who love them.
A few years ago, in 2002, my beloved son JJ, age 36, was killed while riding a bicycle in Israel. He had arrived the night before to celebrate the holidays with the whole family and was bicycling with his brother to visit his sister in Zichron Yaakov, when a young driver ran a yellow light with great speed—and took JJ’s life in an instant. JJ loved Israel, family, Judaism, athletics, God, nature, and life; and he was celebrating all of these loves when his life was snuffed out.
When my husband and I sat <i>shiva,</i> most people came with no forethought agenda or explanation, though a few—out of good intention and compassion—tried to justify God or soften the loss by giving it some meaning. “He was so good that God needed him by His side” was one such attempt, to which on one occasion—unable to hold back my words—I responded, “But we on Earth need him more!” Most people understood at the deepest level that there was nothing that could justify, nothing that could offset the pain or soften the blow, and they wisely remained silent. And we ourselves were silent, as there were no words we could speak that would make any sense of it.
At times, devout members of religions that affirm an afterlife are tempted to say that the deceased is “in a better place—living a better life in a better world”; or they are tempted to suggest that there must be some sin or error or judgment that has brought this fate upon the victim. Such persons cannot tolerate the thought that what has happened is unjustified, for it violates their deepest principles about good and evil, reward and punishment. They need somehow to internally rationalize and justify a reality in order to bring the world back to proper equilibrium.
The Jewish laws of bereavement, so exquisitely tuned to the needs of the mourners, stipulate that the <i>shiva</i> visitor should not speak until the mourner speaks. I had always thought that the point of that precept was to ensure that the conversation would flow to the place the mourner needs it to reach. But I now understand that the halachah enjoining the comforting visitor to hold back in silence serves a different function: to caution against offering a rationale for the decree of death. The deeper human religious response is to be silent, to live with the contradiction, and to affirm that we need not force meaning into tragedy. Sometimes, the deepest response of love is to be silent.

T<small>O PLUNGE INTO</small> the <i>mikveh</i> (Jewish ritual bath) is to plunge into fresh connections with Creation and with our spirituality.
The Rabbis derived their laws that require an immersion in the <i>mikveh</i> in large measure from Leviticus (see at 12:1–8, 15:16, and 11:36). They rooted the laws in a need to purify oneself ritually after certain conditions such as menstruation, male seminal emission, certain skin diseases, or contact with the dead. Removing impurities was a precondition for coming into contact with the holy, such as in approaching the sanctuary. With the destruction of the Temple, these laws remained mandatory for women and optional for men (see <i>Sh’mini,</i> Post-biblical Interpretations). While traditional Jews continue to use the <i>mikveh</i> for “family purity,” most liberal Jews rarely enter the <i>mikveh.</i> When they do, they often enter the <i>mikveh</i> for different reasons. What might prompt liberal Jews to immerse in the <i>mikveh’</i>s waters?
<i>Creation.</i> The <i>mikveh</i> takes us back in time, as we immerse ourselves in the world of Creation. The root <i>k-v-h</i> that forms the word <i>mikveh</i> appears for the first time in Genesis (1:9): “Let the waters beneath the sky be collected [<i>yikavu</i>] in one place.” Further, in the next verse emerges the expression <i>mikveh hamayim,</i> the name given to the seas, where <i>k-v-h</i> connotes “the gathering.” This first <i>mikveh</i> is filled with <i>mayim</i> (water).
In the most archaic Hebrew script, the letter <i>mem</i> is a zigzagging line, drawn like waves that recall water. It is interesting to note that in many languages, the phoneme <i>“m”</i> is associated with “mother” <i>(ima, umm, mutter, mère, madre, mama,</i> etc.). The person who plunges into the ritual bath of the <i>mikveh</i>—entirely surrounded by water, nude, without any barriers, and without touching its sides—resembles the fetus in the mother’s womb. The immersion in the <i>mikveh</i> becomes a return to the sensations of the uterus, a return to our source and an act of renewal.
You cannot know who you are without knowing whence you came. This return to what happened before is sometimes a way of softening the traumas of the past, to start anew after a difficult life experience. Conversely, sometimes it is a way to celebrate something precious in one’s life or something new. The word <i>kav</i> means “to be strong” or “strength” in Aramaic. The return to our source reinforces us.
<i>Spirituality.</i> Water appears first in the second verse of the story of Creation: “God’s spirit (<i>ruach</i>) glided over the face of the waters” (1:2). Thus, from the very beginning, water is forever linked to the divine, to the spiritual. Spirituality in relation to water is not necessarily about “purity.” Purity was originally attached to the mission of the Temple; since the Temple exists no more, purification need not apply to contemporary immersion in the <i>mikveh.</i> Going to a <i>mikveh</i> is not only a means of washing away the past, of removing the legacy of some “sin,” but also of preparing for the future. This is how the <i>mikveh</i> functions when used to prepare for Shabbat and holidays or important moments in life. In this case, <i>mikveh</i> is practiced by both women and men.
Traditional Jewish law requires that only women go to the <i>mikveh.</i> However, when the immersion in a <i>mikveh</i> is part of a couple’s sexual life, if both partners go to the <i>mikveh,</i> they together assert that they are taking charge of their sex life. Making a visit to the <i>mikveh</i> a regular part of the cycle of a couple’s sexual life does not imply a denial of sexuality, but rather a couple’s decision to set temporal boundaries to their sexuality. Jewish tradition honors sexual impulses. The Talmud (BT <i>Yoma</i> 69b) tells us that without passion the world would cease to exist. However, sexuality, like water, must be channeled in order for life to flourish fully. Passion is exhilarating, but it is not a permanent condition. Moreover, it may gain in intensity when limits are set, as is true with music—where the silent notes underscore the melody. So it goes with sexuality: the downtime (which could be confined to menstruation in the case of women), punctuated by the <i>mikveh</i> utilized by both partners, is a form of suspension—a Sabbath—of sexuality. It can leave the space necessary to discover a different face of the other, in a more disciplined tension.
In Genesis 1, God creates the world by separating the waters and then withdrawing them to make space for earth and life to appear. The Akkadian root <i>ku’û</i> (one of the possible antecedents of the Hebrew word <i>kav)</i> means “to wait for, to stretch, to underscore the tension of enduring or waiting.” Oscar Wilde said: “In this world there are only two tragedies; one is not getting what one wants, the other is getting it.” Expectation is the romantic framework of love and desire. The <i>mikveh</i> reintroduces the other as a friend; the lover becomes a friend again—and the friend, a lover.
The <i>mikveh</i> likewise reintroduces spirituality into our lives in a habitual manner. The rabbinic sages capture the power of habits in their determination that frequently occurring rituals take precedence over infrequently occurring rituals (BT <i>Sukkah</i> 54b, 56a; <i>P’sachim</i> 114a; <i>M’gillah</i> 29b; and elsewhere). We are called upon not to build life upon the exceptional but rather to renew the ordinary; such is perhaps one of the secrets of one’s being together with another in partnership.
When one plunges into the <i>mikveh,</i> the links with Creation and with our spirituality extend even further. When we remember that we are created in the image of God, <i>mikveh</i> becomes a reminder of the infinite within the finite, the immortal within the human, the limitless options offered to humanity. It is not surprising then that the Torah is compared to water in rabbinic literature. To immerse in water is also to plunge into the “Universe of the Torah,” the infinite source of transformation of the world.

T<small>HEOLOGIAN</small> E<small>LIZABETH</small> D<small>ODSON</small> G<small>RAY</small> notes: “Women’s bodies may be the hardest place for women to find sacredness” (<i>Sacred Dimensions of Women’s Experience,</i> 1988, p. 197). Our society sends negative messages to women from earliest childhood about the expected perfection of their physiques and the disappointments of any flaws in the female form. <i>Parashat M’tzora,</i> then, with its focus on menstrual impurity (15:19–24), seems to impart the same kind of unfavorable sense. Rejecting our own received biases and patriarchal assumptions about menstruation, however, can help us form a contemporary view of these so-called taboos.
What the Torah deems as <i>tamei</i> (“impure”) or <i>tahor</i> (“pure”) is not actually attached to cleanliness, even though they are often translated as “unclean” and “clean.” These Hebrew words are ritual terms, meant to designate those in a physical and spiritual state unable to enter the <i>Mishkan</i> (Tabernacle; and in later times, the Temple), or those able to do so. Those who are considered <i>tamei</i> are taboo (which is not what we think of as “bad”), meaning that they cannot enter the sacred space; and the thing that causes them to be ineligible to enter is also understood to be taboo. Anthropologists note that taboos are the system by which a culture sets aside certain objects or persons as either sacred or accursed. Such objects or persons inspire both fear and respect. Penelope Washbourn writes: “Menstruation symbolizes the advent of a new power that is <i>mana</i>…‘sacred.’…A taboo expresses this feeling that something special, some holy power, is involved, and our response to it must be very careful” (in <i>WomanSpirit Rising,</i> 1989, p. 251). This mixed message of fear and power, contact and avoidance, actually dominates all the Torah’s passages around blood. Blood, which is to be avoided in the realm of eating and sex, is the same substance that atones for the community in the sacrificial system, and it binds the individual male child to the Israelite covenant through circumcision. Blood both sustains and endangers; it is the medium of plague or deliverance. Thus blood— like every potent symbol—has the double quality and the twin potential of birth and decay, purity and impurity.
So too with menstrual blood. We who are often uninspired and unaffected by our bodies should reject the negative connotation of taboo—and explore, instead, the positive and sacred aspect. Surely a religion that has a blessing for an activity as mundane as going to the bathroom should have a blessing for the coming and going of menstruation. Since the male composers of the liturgy, living in a world where modesty was central and women’s bodies were a mystery at best, were not able—or more likely, not willing—to imagine such a blessing, we must be the first generation to do so.
More than thirty years ago, I did just this: I wrote a blessing for menstruation and have been writing about it and teaching it ever since. When I crafted my <i>b’rachah,</i> I reappropriated the difficult and offensive morning blessing in the traditional prayer book, which reads: “Blessed are You, Adonai our God, Ruler of the Universe, who has not made me a woman.” (Traditionally, women say instead, “who has made me according to Your will.”) Each month, when I get my period, I say: <i>“Baruch atah Adonai, eloheinu melech haolam, she’asani ishah</i>: Blessed are You, Adonai our God, Ruler of the Universe, who has made me a woman.” Saying the blessing becomes a revolutionary moment, for this slight change in wording—changing the negative “who has not made me a woman” into the positive “who has made me a woman”—affirms my holiness and sanctity within the context of menstruation, not despite it.
I believe it is possible to rescue the aspects of mystery inherent in menstruation. While we reject menstrual huts, a separation from the sancta, and antiquated notions of cleanliness, we can still emerge with a sense of the overwhelming mystery of life and death that is embodied in our corporeal female selves. While many women associate menstruation with physical pain and discomfort, the experience nonetheless involves a degree of power. We should reject the notion that menstruation makes a woman “unclean” and instead think of this time as a period of intense electrical charges—the charge of life and death—pulsing through our bodies. Blu Greenberg urges us to focus more on the positive, “to restore that element of holiness to our bodies, our selves” (<i>On Women and Judaism,</i> 1981, pp. 118–120).
We can also consider a connection between menstruation and covenant. The prophet Zechariah speaks to “daughter Jerusalem” and “daughter Zion” about “your covenant of blood” as that which releases prisoners from the dry pit (9:9–11). It does not say “the covenant of blood,” as most translations render it, but rather emphasizes that blood is the focus of the covenant. The address to the feminine persona suggests that all “daughters of Zion” have that covenant of blood. It is through menstruation—from puberty when we accept our responsibilities as Jews, through the elder years when bleeding stops and deep wisdom starts—that the entire world is saved from the dry pit of death, in which there is no water, no womb, no regeneration, no rebirth.
See menstrual blood, then, as women’s covenantal blood—just as the blood of <i>b’rit milah</i> (ritual circumcision) is men’s. The possibilities for rituals around this abound. For women too have a <i>b’rit</i> (covenant) inscribed in our flesh as an “everlasting covenant” (Genesis 17:19): not just once, at eight days old, but every single month. And <i>M’tzora,</i> in its ancient and perhaps awkward way, attempts to remind us.

Achrei Mot

 L<small>EVITICUS</small> 18 <small>IS</small> one of two passages in the Torah (the other being Leviticus 20) that consists of sexual regulations meant to distinguish Israel from the surrounding nations and make it a holy people. Although the prohibitions in our passage have had a profound impact on Western sexual morality, its assumptions are remote from—and in some cases even abhorrent to—contemporary sensibilities.
First of all, Leviticus evaluates sexual behaviors not in terms of the emotional and relational dimensions of sexual experience that are so central to judgments about sexual morality today, but in terms of the categories of purity and pollution. The purpose of anti-pollution laws is to impose structure on the chaos of experience by ensuring that social and symbolic boundaries are respected and that things conform to their proper class. Leviticus 18 forbids a series of discrete behaviors that supposedly cause defilement and thus disrupt the social/religious world, but it offers no <i>positive</i> understanding of holy sexuality.
Second, if we look at the social order that the Levitical anti-pollution laws protect, it seems to consist of extended patriarchal families in which the honor and authority of male heads of household is the primary social value. Verses 7 and 8 do not forbid the father to sexually violate his child but rather <i>forbid the son to violate the sexuality of his father</i> by committing incestuous adultery with the father’s wife. The verses instruct the less powerful party not to dishonor the powerful by treating the wife’s sexuality simply as her husband’s possession. Some of the incest prohibitions, such as the outlawing of marriage with two sisters (v. 18), work to the benefit of women, but it is not women’s concerns and interests that animate the text. The striking absence of the most prevalent incest violation, namely that between father and daughter, makes clear that it is not the purpose of Leviticus in this case to protect the weak and defenseless.
Third, the marginalization of women within the social world presupposed by Leviticus 18 is underscored by the prohibition of sex with a menstruant in v. 19. On one level, this prohibition fits quite seamlessly into the purity-related concerns of Leviticus. The book earlier defines many bodily emissions as defiling, placing menstrual blood in a similar category with semen and other discharges from the penis, as well as nonmenstrual discharges from the vagina (Leviticus 15). On another level, however, the proscription of sex with a menstruating woman is part of a larger symbolic complex in which menstrual blood has particularly negative associations. The prophets liken adultery, idolatry, and murder to menstrual impurity (see Ezekiel 36:17, for example), while the book of Lamentations describes conquered Jerusalem as a menstruating woman whose “impurity clings to her skirts” (1:9).
Fourth, the passage in Leviticus 18 most often cited today, namely the prohibition of male anal intercourse in v. 22, serves as a major justification for homophobia in current religious and political debates and also helps to maintain gender hierarchy. A man who penetrates another man “as one lies with a woman” is guilty of mixing or confusing kinds. He treats another man as one should treat only a woman, thereby moving a male body into the category of female. In the world of Leviticus, doing so both unmans the particular man who is the penetrated partner and threatens the notion of penetrative intercourse as a defining aspect of gender difference.
It seems then that, despite its attempts to promote holiness, Leviticus 18, far from fostering holiness in sexual relations, reflects and reinforces many of the structures of domination that support sexual and family violence. The passage contains important insights that contemporary Jews can affirm: we need some boundaries in sexual relationships; sexual behavior is not simply a private matter; individual behavior is connected with the ethical character of our social world. Leviticus 18 seeks to implement these ideas in its own time and place. But we need to find ways to express these insights in the context of an ethic of sexual holiness appropriate for the 21st century.
We can see Leviticus 18 not as a static document that we must either accept or reject but as a part of Jewish tradition that grapples problematically with ongoing human problems. If so, we can also use it as a starting point for raising hard questions about our own sexual values. What should be included on a list of forbidden and permitted relationships today? Are there certain “bottom lines” that we would want to be part of any statement of sexual norms? How do we balance the need to safeguard those with less power in sexual relationships with the desire to lay out a constructive vision of holy sexuality? How might we articulate a person-centered ethic that focuses on qualities of human connection rather than on the intrinsic nature of particular sexual behaviors? How do we ensure that our sexual values reflect fundamental ethical values such as honesty and justice that ought to guide all human interactions? What place do we give to feelings as a dimension of holy sex? How should pleasure figure into our ethic, for example? How do we attend to the social structures that undergird and make possible holy and sustainable relationships? What social rights and obligations might we see as fundamentally connected to the ability to create satisfying relationships?
A contemporary response to Leviticus 18, in other words, requires both criticism and transformation. It requires careful examination and rejection of those presuppositions of Leviticus that produce and support sexual injustice. But it also involves imagining an alternative ethic that brings in the concerns and questions of those whose perspectives are erased or marginalized by Leviticus itself—as well as by our culture today. Such a response seeks to create the foundation for a sexuality and sensuality that is life-giving for all.

Kedoshim

 P<small>ARASHAT</small> K<small>’DOSHIM PLACES</small> before us one of the most difficult commandments in the whole Torah—not kashrut or Shabbat, nor even the rules of sexual conduct, but rather the admonition and expectation to “be holy.” Throughout the Torah, we are given rules and statutes that tell us what to do. Here we are told what to be. We find a similar statement in Exodus 19:6, commanding us to be a “kingdom of priests and a holy people.” But what does it mean to be holy? <i>K’doshim</i> does not tell us. The guidance that the parashah gives us is in the specifics: the “who, when, why, and how” of the injunction.
First, <i>who</i> is to be holy? The entire people is addressed: <i>kol adat b’nei yisrael;</i> all Israel is told: “You shall be holy, for I, your God יהוה, am holy” (19:2). Not just the priests or Levites, not only the women or men, but everyone is part of this command to be holy. The 16th-century commentator Rabbi Moshe Alshech asks why such important rules as the ones that follow upon this verse are not taught person by person, group by group, rather than to one large assembly. He suggests that the opening of <i>K’doshim</i> emphasizes the ability of any Jew to attain even the highest and noblest principles of Judaism; thus these laws, and the paradigm of “holiness,” are not only for a select few, but for everyone.
<i>When</i> are we to be holy? The verb <i>tih’yu</i> in verse 2 can be read—and is often read—as a command (“be holy!”). But it is grammatically a future form (“you shall be holy”). The implications are: “Be holy—now! And you shall be holy—in the future.” Thus holiness is a daily struggle, in the here and now, as well as a future yearning.
<i>Why</i> are we to be holy? Because God is holy. The 16th-century commentator Rabbi Obadiah Sforno notes that this verse teaches us that we are to remember and act “in the image of our Creator,” as much as that is possible. Philosophers refer to this concept via the Latin term <i>imitatio dei.</i> We try and “imitate” the Divine. As God cares for the widow and orphan, so do we. As God rests on the seventh day, so do we. In imitating God we can achieve a higher sense of purpose and our actions will reflect the ongoing concern of the Divine for the world. In imitating God’s holiness we make holiness our behavioral ideal.
In much of the Torah, it is God who sanctifies—as we read in Genesis 2:3: “Then God blessed the seventh day and made it holy.” But in <i>K’doshim,</i> the command to make things holy is addressed to humanity. The task of sanctifying our lives is placed upon us, as an act of partnership between human beings and God. This is one way that we strive to act in God’s image.
The <i>how</i> to be holy is what follows—as the parashah lists a wide-ranging series of ethical laws, including honoring one’s parents, respecting the elderly, justice for the stranger, love of one’s fellow human, and more. But note that even though the parashah enumerates the specifics of holy behavior, it never defines what it means by the word <i>kadosh</i> (“holy”). Many commentators have tried to understand the term <i>kadosh</i> as indicating a state of being. Rashi (11th century) and Ramban (13th century) both interpret “you shall be holy” as meaning “you shall be separate.” For them, holiness requires standing apart as Jews, with a firm set of boundaries. The end of <i>K’doshim</i> underscores their point: “You shall be holy to Me, for I יהוה am holy, and I have set you apart from other peoples to be Mine” (20:26).
This concept of separation is critical to understanding Jewish spirituality. For example, in the classic Jewish marriage formula, the phrase <i>harei at m’kudeshet li</i> means “you are set apart for me from others.” (Wedding officiants are fond of claiming that it means “you are sanctified to me,” which is a more midrashic derivation.) In the Talmud, <i>hekdesh</i> is money or goods set aside or separated for tithing or donation. Holiness seems intrinsically linked in Judaism to separation (<i>havdalah</i>), making distinctions: milk or meat, Shabbat or weekday, Jew or gentile, female or male.
But does this concept of spirituality ring true for women? Would there be a different kind of <i>imitatio dei</i> for women? Do women experience holiness differently? For those women who carry life inside, attached to another being who is—at the same time—part of them, separateness does not equal spirituality. For those women who breastfeed—who nurture and sustain from their very own bodies—connection is more at the root of holiness. For those women who form bonded friendships from earliest memory, or who bring the family together, who are the cohesive force in a group, a definition of holiness is needed that does not imply building fences. Thus, though <i>parashat K’doshim</i> demands holiness, it is up to us to define holiness in a way that is truthful for both women and men.
As is apparent, then, Rashi’s definition of <i>kadosh</i> as “separate” presents a fundamental feminist challenge. The challenge is evident as well throughout rabbinic Judaism where authorities have portrayed the mitzvot as drawing lines between “us” and “them,” lines that demarcate who is <i>in</i> (for example, circumcision marking a Jewish boy) and who is <i>out</i> (for example, the halachah of not counting women in a minyan). While feminists have challenged specific mitzvot, finding a way “in” through creative rereading and even reinventing, we have not yet sufficiently challenged the very notion of mitzvot that rest upon the “spirituality of separation.” This notion is at the heart of much that Jews do—including kashrut, Shabbat, and the marriage ceremony, just to name a few. Redefining the mitzvot as connectors rather than as boundaries, as dialogue rather than as answers, is a first step toward addressing the question of how we as women will be <i>kadosh.</i> Although we are still at the beginning of exploring what a fully developed feminist notion of being holy might look like, the opening words of this parashah—<i>k’doshim tih’yu</i>—carry both a command for now and promise for the future: we can and we will find ways to be holy.

Emor

 A<small>LTHOUGH THE DESTRUCTION</small> of the Temple (70 <small>C. E</small>.) eliminated the conditions that required priests to preserve certain laws of purity, the influence of such laws nevertheless continues. According to <i>Emor</i>, a priest (<i>kohein</i>) has to guard against possible defilement at all times. A movie produced by several religiously observant students at the Ma’ale School of Television, Film, and the Arts in Jerusalem illustrates some consequences of these laws for their contemporary circles.
Entitled “Cohen’s Wife,” this film concerns Rivki Cohen, a young ultra-orthodox woman who opens the door slightly for a strange man who has come asking for <i>tzedakah</i> (charity). The stranger then forces his way in and rapes her. This crime renders Rivki ritually impure to her husband. The film deals with how the husband approaches the rabbinical court as to whether he—a <i>kohein</i>—must divorce his wife because she is now defiled.
This deeply moving film depicts a loving couple that desperately wants to remain married, while at the same time wanting to observe Jewish law. The wife turns out to have the key to saving the marriage—by not saying the words “I was raped,” and certainly not to her husband. Thus, since there was no witness, the husband could seek a sympathetic set of rabbis who simply would pretend that the rape had not taken place, thus allowing the couple to remain intact.
The problem, of course, is the guilt and confusion that both the wife and husband feel after the rabbinic decision; have they themselves resolved the problem or not? Will they be able to live their lives in peace with their guilty secret? This movie, like most made at Ma’ale, exposes viewers to the human conflicts, tragedies, and even comic situations that arise when people wish to live both according to Jewish law and to their honest feelings.
While we can expect the laws of Leviticus to have a strong impact primarily in certain religious circles, other ideas in <i>Emor</i> continue to have subtle ramifications for general society. One example is the stress found in <i>Emor</i> on the ideal of physical “perfection.” Leviticus 21:17–20 disqualifies a descendant of Aaron from carrying out the rituals of the priesthood if he is subject to certain physical deficiencies or disfigurations. Physical imperfection, it seems, impairs holiness.
While the priest’s bodily perfection may no longer be a Jewish necessity, the idea and expectation of bodily perfection have become a cultural goal of the wider American Jewish population, with terrible consequences—particularly for women, regardless of age. By now most people are aware that many American Jewish girls starve themselves or over-exercise to become thin, or they have surgery on their noses and elsewhere to be more beautiful. So too, older Jewish women undergo a wide range of plastic surgery to remain attractive. On this drive among young girls to be pretty at all costs—and to be intolerant of those who are not—see <i>The JGirl’s Guide: The Young Jewish Woman’s Handbook for Coming of Age</i> (co-authored by me, Penina Adelman, and Ali Feldman, 2005). Mothers pass the goal of beauty on to their daughters, and men reinforce it. By manipulating women’s self-confidence about their appearance, the beauty industry has become a highly lucrative business. The point is that each girl or woman considers herself to be defective or imperfect, no matter what she does. This idea derives from the notion that there <i>is</i> such a thing as bodily perfection, a concept presented in <i>Emor.</i>
The motivation to be beautiful by any means should not be dismissed out of hand as misguided, however. After all, the Bible and much of Western culture frequently equate beauty with goodness.
Several admired matriarchs—Sarah and Rebekah, for example—are beautiful, even “very beautiful.” In fact, one term for beauty in the Bible actually uses forms of the word <i>tov</i> (good), further promoting such associations. Thus, kindly Rebekah is <i>tovat mar’eh</i> (“exceedingly beautiful,” Genesis 24:16). And Esther is touted for her beauty, which enables her to carry out later virtuous deeds. Based on these cases and many others, I suggest that the Torah’s preference for beauty is a clear theme that appears in many places, including the <i>Emor</i> section on the necessity for physical perfection among priests.
By and large it is not only the preference for beauty that has spilled into Western culture, but also the equation between beauty and goodness. Children’s fairy tales typically feature the beautiful princess who is good, the handsome prince who is also good, and the ugly witch who is evil. Psychologists have found that people who are attractive are trusted more than those who are not; handsome people are likely to rise in the ranks of their organizations and be elected to office. Physically attractive individuals, research shows, are perceived as more intelligent, sociable, talented, and moral. There is even a term for this prejudice: beautyism—the idea that what is beautiful is good, and what is not beautiful is bad. Beautyism is a danger to the self-esteem of those who are not physically attractive and can lead to arrogance among those who are. While efforts to urge children to look beyond physical appearance may address race and disability, they almost never deal with beauty. This silent prejudice is thus able to persist and be reinforced throughout popular culture, religious instruction, and the education system.
Some passages in the Bible, however, do not equate beauty with goodness, possibly in an attempt to counteract the heavy emphasis on the subtle equation elsewhere. Ruth, for example, is a model of goodness but is never called beautiful. More notable is the description of the “woman of valor” <i>(eshet chayil)</i> in Proverbs 31, which explicitly repudiates beauty as a criterion for virtue: “Grace is deceptive, and beauty is illusory; it is for her fear of יהוה that a woman is to be praised” (31:30). Yet the negation can be also read as an admission that the cultural norm is otherwise.
<i>Emor</i>’s implication that a priest must not remain married to his wife if she is raped is a case of punishing the victim. So, too, <i>Emor</i>’s exclusion of a blind descendant of Aaron from priestly activities punishes the handicapped. Contemporary society tries not to punish rape victims or disabled individuals. While it is true that we have tried to distance ourselves from these two ancient ideas, we have made hardly any progress with regard to the obverse, that is, unfairly rewarding those who are physically beautiful and punishing those who are not.

Behar

 I<small>N PARASHAT</small> B<small>’HAR</small>, God declares to Moses that the land is a sacred trust and commands the people to observe periods of comprehensive release. This parashah invites us to consider how, in each generation, we can best serve as guarantors of this trust, respect the duty to rest ourselves and our natural resources, and experience “release.” The legislation in <i>B’har</i> presumes the value of balance and regulates a balance among productivity, rest, and relinquishment. Inasmuch as punctuating productivity with long pauses lends perspective to life and encourages us to express gratitude for the earth’s bounty, we may wonder what regulations we require today to help us nurture ourselves, one another, and the planet. As women join men in leadership positions and in the work force, it is becoming a Jewish communal priority to effect social and institutional adjustments that allow for a healthy balance between people’s needs and obligations.
<i>B’har</i> affirms that the land belongs to God, and it must be permitted to observe its Sabbaths. The sensibility that the Land of Israel has a responsibility all its own to the Creator recognizes nature’s independence from humanity. The land must be permitted, just like human servants, to praise creation through Shabbat. In the psalmist’s words: <i>kol han’shamah t’halel Yah,</i> “All that breathes praises God” (Psalm 150). The earth must speak its own gratitude.
In the Torah, the earth is an expressive organism. We read that when Miriam died, “the community was without water” (Numbers 20:2). Observing, as it were, its mourning for a heroine whose miracles were all associated with water, the earth dries up. To hear the speech of the earth is a blessing; but if we do not listen, the consequences of our deafness to the planet are traumatic. The ecology movement reminds us of what our biblical forebears understood: the independent consciousness of nature.
Nature’s independence is trumpeted on Yom Kippur after a fifty-year countdown. This is when we must (as the Liberty Bell translates the verse) “proclaim Liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof” (Leviticus 25:10). We more closely translate <i>dror</i> (“Liberty”) as a proclamation of “release,” a letting go. Counting toward release, we can celebrate release—or we can live in fear of it. And so the liturgy tells us <i>limnot yameinu,</i> to count our days (Psalm 90:12), by which we are meant to understand that since our days are numbered, the trick is to make them count. Our duty is not to scramble tirelessly, but to be grateful and generous, to assume our small place in creation, and to join the trees in praise. Underlying the laws of <i>B’har</i> is an obligation to take care of each other, to leave no one homeless: “Do not wrong one another, but fear your God” (Leviticus 25:17).
The laws of the sabbatical year echo biblical Creation. The rhythm of the work week undergoes a cosmic magnification: people, imitating the Creator, are productive for six days and then rest. Nature is productive for six years and rests; and then geometrically, after the land has maintained this rhythm for seven cycles of seven: jubilee. The <i>yovel,</i> the jubilee, is a call to restore primal order: indentured servants are freed, debts are forgiven, and property is restored to its original owners. Here is a caution against struggling to amass more, and against warring over real estate—reminding us that all things are, eventually, released (one way or another) from our possession and control. After the divine promise to Noah that humanity would never again be destroyed by flood, God devises the jubilee as a peaceful strategy for restoring the world to its original state.
Appreciating that freedom must be learned, a midrash teaches that the Israelites wandered in desert circles for forty years to make the short trip from Egypt to Canaan because it took that long for the slave population to learn how to manage its freedom. Today, it behooves us to reflect on the substantial gains of the women’s movement and admit that, as <i>B’har</i> teaches, we suffer the consequences of depletion if we do not adequately regulate our hard-won freedoms. Not only do many of us live unbalanced lives, but schools and charities have not corrected for the absence of an earlier generation of volunteer women, to the detriment of children and the poor. Society needs to effect adjustments so as to make two-career families more viable; and we risk perpetuating conditions of stress at work and home if we do not emphasize to rising generations the need to change existing institutional structures and correct continued gender inequities. One wonders whether, in the years since the onset of the contemporary women’s movement, we have been panting from exertion without having paused often enough to ask about the meaning of life. High-achieving adolescents too often suffer from depression, and teenage girls suffer from diminished self-worth. Perhaps we have been communicating an unbalanced definition of adulthood—adulthood without sabbatical and jubilation.
The land, our possessions, our bodies, our children, and we ourselves are a sacred trust, and it is not our right to be infinitely demanding on them. We are commanded to rest, not when we are exhausted or having a breakdown, but regularly, as we count the days to <i>Shabbat,</i> to the seven years to the land’s sabbatical, and to the forty-nine years to the releases of jubilee.
Organizations such as Ma’yan: The Jewish Women’s Project (at the JCC in Manhattan) and Advancing Women Professionals and the Jewish Community (AWP, founded by Shifra Bronznick) are addressing unhealthy patterns by exploring how to create humane workplaces that foster living balanced lives. Projects like these articulate demands for institutional change and new regulations that honor the spirit that informs <i>parashat B’har.</i>

Bechukotai

 T<small>HERE IS SOMETHING</small> profoundly unsettling about <i>B’chukotai.</i> It seems to posit a world that we know, empirically, does not exist. It claims that there is a direct correlation between our actions and the natural order of the universe. Leviticus 26:3–5 promises unambiguously: “If you follow My laws and faithfully observe My commandments, I will grant you rains in their season…you shall eat your fill of bread….” Verses 14–16 warn just as clearly: “But if you do not obey Me and do not observe all these commandments…I will wreak misery upon you….” The seeming system of reward and punishment that these biblical passages proclaim appears to contradict the troubling reality that we witness, in which good people suffer, and evil people often prosper.
Passages like these seem to provide justification for those who reject both faith and God. How often do we hear, in the face of personal trauma or tragedy, “I can no longer believe in God” or “I can’t believe in a God who would do this”? How are we to understand God’s threats and promises?
According to the biblical scholar Nehama Leibowitz, our ancestors regarded blessings and curses, such as those in <i>B’chukotai,</i> as forms of prayer: these are the things that people hoped for, even willed to happen, in their longing for a world in which justice would visibly prevail. Perhaps this parashah is telling us, in its own theological language, that there is a moral order to the universe that is intrinsically connected to the natural order of the universe—and that the two orders are mutually dependent. In these teachings, it is as if God gives humankind every opportunity to discern that human action is intrinsic, and essential, to the proper functioning of the cosmos. Over and over again, the Torah enjoins us to act, to do, and to be because we “were slaves to Pharaoh in Egypt” (Deuteronomy 6:21), because we “know the feelings of the stranger” (Exodus 23:9), and through these experiences have been given the opportunity to glimpse this truth. This is why we were chosen to bear witness to God’s revelation that “I, your God יהוה, am holy” (Leviticus 19:2). We are created in God’s image and we, as God’s partners, were chosen for a sacred task. This is our heritage and our responsibility; this is what it means to complete the work of Creation. But what if we forget, neglect, or ignore our sacred task of following the commandments?
The catalogue of threats and promises is a biblical way to explain how intimate the connection of the natural realm of the universe is to the moral realm. The two realms do not function independently of each other. There is a moral order to the universe as surely as there is a more easily observable natural order of “rains in their season.”
And it is in the moral realm where God cannot function alone. God never could—and so kept looking for partners. What did we expect of a God who created the natural universe? That the moral dimension was an afterthought? Our sages believed it pre-existed. God did not neglect the moral realm. On the contrary, humankind did. God kept expecting humankind to behave morally and was constantly disappointed—with Adam, with Noah, with the generations after the Flood. Finally, God found Abraham, the person who engaged God as an equal on ethical ground: “Must not the Judge of all the earth do justly?” (Genesis 18:25), and the process of Revelation began.
The essential unity of all aspects of God’s Creation appears as well in Lurianic Kabbalah’s formulation of the universe. Isaac Luria’s theory of <i>Sh’virat Hakeilim</i> (Shattering of the Vessels) seeks to explain the brokenness of our world, and to advance the means to restore it to its original unity. For Luria in the 16th century, it was the great cosmic shattering that had brought about our exile from God and from God’s Creation. Luria not only understood the primordial unity of God’s intention but also yearned for a return to it. In God’s promise of “rains in their season [and presence] in your midst,” Luria could see the opportunity for humankind to repair the world, to release the sparks, to play a role in the restoration of the universe through the performance of mitzvot.
In Judaism, the mystic does not seek to transcend or deny the material world. Rather, the mystic’s goal is the objective of this Torah portion: to restore the world, materially and spiritually, to a “single divine reality.” As Lawrence Fine describes that goal in his study of Luria, <i>Physician of the Soul, Healer of the Cosmos</i> (2003), it is the “dream that collective human effort can mend a broken world.” This is the vision of <i>B’chukotai.</i>
In these final verses of the book of Leviticus, God describes—in the most tactile, physical, understandable terms possible—the relationship between God’s Creation and humankind’s responsibility. It is simultaneously bribe and promise, exhortation and encouragement. At the foundation of it all is the essential understanding of Torah: the physical and ethical dimensions of God’s Creation are wholly dependent upon each other, and we ignore that relationship at our peril. There is no quid pro quo for individuals in the world—God’s scheme is far grander and more subtle than that. The issue is not one of personal reward and punishment. It is the unity of God, the unity of the prophetic vision as rendered in the Reform liturgy: “On that day, all the world shall be One and God’s name shall be One” (Zechariah 14:9). It is the ultimate fulfillment of Torah—as expressed in Leviticus 26:46: “These are the laws, rules, and <i>torot</i> that יהוה established <i>beino uvein b’nei Yisrael</i> (in relationship with the Children of Israel).” This is the partnership that must one day bring about the fulfillment of our hopes, dreams, and strivings—the sparks released as heaven and earth, heart and mind and soul are united at last.

Bamidbar

 T<small>HERE IS POWER</small> in taking a census. When God commands Moses to do so at the beginning of <i>parashat B’midbar,</i> only male Israelites over the age of 20 who are able to bear arms are considered. In the text, Moses is told to tally up <i>kol adat b’nei yisrael,</i> literally “the whole community of the Children of Israel.” But do able-bodied males over 20 years old represent the <i>whole</i> community? While <i>adat</i> is often translated as “community,” it can also refer to an “assembly, band, company, or faction,” hence only one segment of the larger population. This nuance allows us to recognize all who are <i>not</i> counted: women, minors, the elderly, and the physically, mentally, or emotionally challenged. In Torah, these people are usually missing from numerations as well as narrations. Those who are counted have a special worth to the society, while those who are not may be considered less valuable and are, therefore, less visible.
There is also danger in taking a census. This parashah is all about enumerating people, as the English name of the book, “Numbers,” suggests. However, the Talmud asserts that “it is forbidden to count [the nation of] Israel even for the sake of a commandment…[because] whoever counts Israel transgresses a prohibition, as it is written, ‘The number of the children of Israel shall be like the sands of the sea, not to be measured’ (Hosea 2:1)” (BT <i>Yoma</i> 22b). Rashi explains that we must count something each person gives (like the half-shekel) rather than count actual people, because then “there will not be a plague among them, for the evil eye can affect that which is counted—and a plague may come upon them as we found in the days of David” (Rashi on Exodus 30:1). Is Rashi merely superstitious, or is he suggesting that it is dangerous to trivialize a person’s essence? His comment teaches us that we must value each human as one who is made <i>b’tzelem Elohim,</i> in God’s image (Genesis 1:27). A number can measure whether an army has enough people, but it can never measure the worth of the individual people in that army.
Today, American society is obsessed with numbers, censuses, and demographic studies. Now when we calculate our Temple membership, for instance, we include everybody: the women and the men, the young and the old, the “typical” and the challenged. We can look at sum totals, categories, and sub-categories of these studies; and while they provide valuable information, they still may not show us who or what really counts. Can we say that all people matter when our Jewish institutions are not accessible to every individual? Taking the synagogue as an example, do we value each person when a member in a wheelchair cannot come up to the Ark to take the Torah? Do we include everyone in worship services when we do not offer large-print prayer books or when we do not provide hearing aids to those who need them? Do we validate those with different learning styles and abilities when we hire inexperienced educators for our Religious School classes? If we compare our raw data with the facts within the synagogue walls, who really matters—the ones who are counted, or the ones for whom we take extra measures? While numbers may be essential, they do not represent the sum total of what is truly important. But what does?
In <i>B’midbar,</i> one could argue that the number of troops is what really counts, since they are the ones included in the census. But when we read between the lines, when we ask who is not included, we can see how the untold stories of the unmentioned people matter too. For instance, what about the woman who might have wished to fight? Or how about the 19-year-old man, just months short of his 20th birthday, eager to serve God and his people? And how about the 23-year-old male Israelite who can count the right number of years but not the right number of limbs since one of his was lost in a childhood accident? And the pregnant soldier’s wife who calculates the number of weeks until her baby arrives, knowing that the baby’s father’s days may be numbered? There may be contextually legitimate reasons why these people are omitted from the census, and, ultimately, from the Torah text, but their exclusion means we miss the opportunity to see what they can offer the community.
We all hear stories about those who lose one thing and gain something even greater through their loss. There is an urban legend about violin virtuoso Itzhak Perlman, who taught that lesson by happenstance when he played a concerto at Avery Fisher Hall in New York City with a broken string. One might think it impossible to play with just three strings a concerto written for violin, but Perlman did it and did so with great fervor. Upon completing his dazzling performance, he (so the story goes) said humbly to the audience, “You know, sometimes it is the artist’s task to find out how much music you can still make with what you have left.” Perhaps this is true for all of us, not only artists. Losses can lead to inner strengths and life changes that we did not dream were possible. We are more than the sum total of our parts.
The Israelites may have needed parameters for whom to include and whom to exclude from the census described in <i>B’midbar,</i> but we must remember why even those not tallied do, in fact, matter. Today we may count every individual in our community, but may still discount how much they have to offer. The missing members in this parashah can teach us to reconsider what it means to count. As the numerous stories in the Bible and in our lives remind us, even those not included are important, and all those we now seek to include genuinely are individuals with much to gain from and offer to our communities.

Nasso

 T<small>HE</small> S<small>OTAH RITUAL</small> (5:11–31), in which a man suspects his wife of adultery and subjects her to an ordeal, has been notoriously difficult for contemporary readers, especially from a feminist perspective. The unequal application of the ritual to women and not men, the lack of due process, the physical and emotional humiliation—all of these combine to make this passage a challenging place in which to find meaning.
As such, this passage keeps company with a number of other biblical texts that are problematic, even painful, to read. Rabbi Rebecca Alpert offers a valuable model for confronting such troubling teachings. In her book <i>Like Bread on a Seder Plate: Jewish Lesbians and the Transformation of Tradition</i> (1997), Alpert presents a number of approaches for dealing with traditional texts on homosexuality. She suggests that we can understand these texts by interpreting them in the context of their own time and place. We also can try to wrest new meaning from them, or we can simply acknowledge the pain that they have caused—and continue to cause. These approaches are not, of course, mutually exclusive, and they can apply also to this parashah.
Certainly in the case of the <i>sotah,</i> we can analyze it in light of its historical context. Comparing this passage with other ancient Near Eastern texts reveals it to be in keeping with other laws contemporary to Torah times.
In terms of the pain the passage has caused, we can easily imagine its effect on women thousands of years ago, but we ourselves are spared direct impact. Modern readers have long taken solace in the fact that this practice is no longer in force—and thus is far from the purview of synagogue ritual committees. In fact, it is unclear whether this ritual ever took place. Even in the Torah, the law is given without a connection to any particular incident. The Mishnah states that an early rabbinic leader discontinued the ritual of the <i>sotah (Sotah</i> 9:9). The entire body of rabbinic literature cites only one example of its implementation. Regarding the medieval period, a little-known fragment from the Cairo Geniza still gives instructions as to how to perform the ritual in one’s neighborhood synagogue; but there too, no record has been found of anyone actually doing so. (For details, see Lisa Grushcow, <i>Writing the Wayward Wife: Rabbinic Interpretations of Sotah,</i> 2006, pp. 297–300.)
When we try to understand the <i>sotah</i> ritual in context, we can be relieved that it has not been implemented for at least two thousand years. But how can we wrest meaning from this difficult text? Interestingly, the very discontinuation of the ritual—and the rabbinic explanation of its abandonment—may give us a way to find meaning. The official suspension of the <i>sotah</i> ritual provides an example of how religious and legal change happens, and how such change is explained. For those of us who are committed to the Torah and also see Judaism as a path that embraces change, this is a crucial issue.
Some modern scholars assume that the ritual of the <i>sotah</i> disappeared because of the destruction of the Temple. Others argue that the ritual was abolished as a bold rabbinic move, to remove a practice that was seen to be unfair. But when one looks closely at the rabbinic texts, neither of these reasons is found. Rather, the explanation given is that things were getting worse—either more people were openly committing adultery, or more husbands were sinning in such a way that the <i>sotah</i> ritual did not then work on their wives. The Rabbis account for these and other examples of decline by claiming that the deaths of certain sages led to the disappearance of certain qualities from the world (see for example, Mishnah <i>Sotah</i> 9:9).
Thus, in these rabbinic texts, <i>change results from a world that is getting worse.</i> It is also worth noting that we find a similar outlook in the Greco-Roman world that surrounded the ancient rabbis. From that perspective, religious and legal changes were a response to moral, sexual, intellectual, or political collapse.
Coming back to the <i>sotah</i> ritual, then, it seems that our ancestors did not abolish the ritual because they found it morally objectionable. Instead, they used the best conceptual tools of their time to make sense of why change had happened, and those tools explained change as the product of decline.
Our modern paradigm, in contrast, is fundamentally based on the assumptions of science, the Enlightenment, and Emancipation: <i>we believe that it is possible for humanity to make changes based on progress,</i> not decline. The optimism of the Enlightenment has been tempered by the Holocaust and other tragedies of modern times, but the fundamental shift remains. For us, change can be positive, even holy. We believe that God continues to speak to us. Living in accordance with our new understandings of gender and sexual identity has enriched our clergy and communities. Living in a world more openly diverse has taught us the importance of outreach and inreach for our communities, in all their diversity. Scientific insights spur us to find new ethical and spiritual answers to questions of life and death. The existence of the modern state of Israel challenges us to live richer Jewish lives, wherever we are in the world. These changes and others are celebrated, not lamented as evidence of decline.
Ultimately, then, the <i>sotah</i> ritual is most powerful as a teacher of change: how we understood change in the past, and how we might understand it now. Just as the Rabbis of the Mishnah and Talmud used the best conceptual tools of their time to understand change, so must we—with the tools of our own time. Such an approach is not abandoning our tradition; it is being true to it.
The end of the Babylonian Talmud’s tractate on <i>sotah</i> gives us a glimmer of possibility: some of our ancestors might also have had a different perspective on change and decline. Mishnah <i>Sotah</i> 9:9 ends with the statement that with the death of Rabbi Judah haNasi, humility and the fear of sin disappeared. In the Talmud’s commentary, this statement is challenged. “Do not teach that humility is gone,” says Rav Joseph, “for I am still here!” “Do not teach that the fear of sin is gone,” says Rav Nachman, “for I am still here!” (BT <i>Sotah</i> 49b). Rav Nachman’s self-proclaimed fear of sin—not to mention Rav Joseph’s self-proclaimed humility—suggests that our ancestors, like ourselves, thought that they still had something to add.

Beha'alotcha

 B’<small>HAALOT</small>’<small>CHA IS OVERFLOWING</small> with complex ritual and detail: the lighting of the lamps; the purification and consecration of the Levites; the elaboration of the <i>pesach</i> sacrifice; the carefully choreographed journey through the wilderness; the mutiny of meat, manna, and quail precipitating a plague for those who were led by their appetites; the challenge of Moses’ siblings to his leadership; and finally, the sudden onset of his sister Miriam’s disease. Yet amidst these richly detailed stories, we find one contrasting, stark, parsimonious prayer: <i>“El na r’fa na lah”</i> (“O God, pray heal her!”).
Five words—eleven Hebrew letters—are all that Moses speaks (12:13). Except for God’s name, each word ends in a vowel, as if each word were an unending cry. It is as if each word is punctuated with an exclamation point, the brevity of the syllables giving voice to the tortured helplessness of the supplicant: “God! Please! Heal! Please! Her!” In the midst of catastrophe, the verb of consequence—the bull’s-eye of the prayer—is the central plea: heal! Indeed, the prayer is nearly a palindrome—reading the same forwards as it does backwards—homing in with laser precision on that most urgent desire: heal!
This prayer has few words but much resonance. It is a primal cry, capturing fear, powerlessness, and incomprehensibility in the face of sudden illness, accident, or injury. It is not the entreaty of the one beset by the catastrophe, but rather that of the witness, the powerless onlooker, the potential caregiver absorbing the shock, the one who is overwhelmed and stymied about how to help.
When illness, accident, or injury comes to those we love, it is up to us—those who are comparatively healthy and able—not only to beseech but also to provide hope and healing. For the caregiver, there is time only for truncated and hurried prayer, time only for stolen moments of naked cries and yearnings of hope. For the caregiver shouldering the burdens of action—making the loved one comfortable, researching treatment, running interference with physicians, reporting news, calming fears—prayer is a blessed moment of calm in an otherwise turbulent time.
When one whom we love is in danger, not only our loved one but also we ourselves face darkness. According to Jewish tradition, the first person who prayed in darkness was young Jacob, on the eve of his exile from home. The Midrash describes the confluence of physical and metaphorical darkness this way: “In order to speak to Jacob in private, God caused the sun to go down—like a king who calls for the light to be extinguished, as he wishes to speak to his friend in private” <i>(B’reishit Rabbah</i> 68.10). So, too, the prayer of the caregiver is private, conspiratorial, hidden from the one who is the object of supplication, yet revealed to the One who can respond. We want to protect the one who is suffering from the compounded weight of the caregiver’s distress. But in the darkness, it is safe to give voice to our fear of dreadful scenarios and of the unknown. In the darkness, it is a relief to relinquish the weight of trying to hold up another’s spirits, and to acknowledge that Someone with far more power than we possess is the ultimate caregiver. In the darkness, it is possible to renew courage, to find new paths, to discover the equanimity essential to living with the terror of catastrophe.
Medical sociologist Alexandra Dundas Todd begins <i>Double Vision,</i> a memoir of her son’s treatment and recovery from brain cancer, with this reflection:
“The Chinese word for crisis consists of two characters: danger and opportunity. When my son, Drew, a senior in college, was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer bordering his brain, the danger was clear; the opportunity was less apparent. Danger flashed through our lives daily, while opportunities lay waiting in murky waters, to emerge only tentatively. Family closeness, the ability to savor each moment, to find strength and courage where we didn’t know they existed, to discover new methods of treatment that complemented all the surgeries and radiation and eased both body and mind, all contributed to making the unbearable bearable, turning an assault into a challenge” <i>(Double Vision: An East-West Collaboration for Coping with Cancer,</i> 1994, p. xiii).
It does, indeed, take “double vision” to see both blessing and curse, to picture opportunity amidst danger. Courage grows through hope, through the willingness to look for unknown possibilities and to grasp them, through refusing to see only <i>danger</i> in darkness when its counterpart, <i>opportunity,</i> may be waiting in the shadows. The prayer of the caregiver, the cry of the distraught parent, the reassuring whisper of the loving spouse, can help to wrest some measure of opportunity out of danger.
<i>El na r’fa na la.</i> In its simplicity and raw clarity, this prayer of healing recognizes that more than double vision, the vision of the Divine is immeasurable, and the capacity of the Healer is limitless. In response to Moses’ prayer, God reveals the duration of Miriam’s exile to the wilderness of disease. Her fortunate loved ones have only to wait out a time of disequilibrium and uncertainty; they have received Sacred reassurance that all will be well. Yet in anticipating her return, the Torah conveys a truth well known to the loved ones of someone contending with affliction and crisis—<i>v’haam lo nasa ad heasef miryam</i> (“and the people did not march on until Miriam was readmitted,” 12:15). Life does not go on with any sense of normalcy or progression while one whom we love is endangered; the caregiver’s attention and effort revolves around the one who is stricken. Time and space are altered. The yearning for healing expands to fill both.
Our present rituals may not be as formulaic as those described in <i>B’haalot’cha</i>; our contemporary prayers of healing may have become longer and more specific; our modern understanding of treatment may be more nuanced and comprehensive; but Moses’ wisdom abides. The essence of what we seek is still found in his direct and eternal prayer. <i>El na r’fa na la:</i> God! Please! Heal! Please! Her!

Sh'lach

W<small>HEN</small> M<small>OSES SENDS</small> the scouts to survey the land of Canaan, he gives them a list of very specific things to investigate. He charges them: “Go up there into the Negeb and on into the hill country, and see what kind of country it is. Are the people who dwell in it strong or weak, few or many? Is the country in which they dwell good or bad? Are the towns they live in open or fortified? Is the soil rich or poor? Is it wooded or not?” (13:17–20). Twelve emissaries go out and return after forty days, reporting on what they saw in this exotic new land. All but two of the scouts are punished later; victims of a plague, they die in the wilderness.
What is their sin? According to our tradition, they sin by not trusting God’s vision and not having faith: “How long will this people spurn Me, and how long will they have no faith in Me despite all the signs that I have performed in their midst?” (14:11). Furthermore, they sin because they “caused the whole community to mutter against him [Moses] by spreading calumnies about the land” (14:36).
I question not only the nature of their sin, but also Moses’ approach to their mission. Moses’ instructions divide the world into either/or categories that ignore the nuances within a complex reality. Instead of asking such specific questions, what if he had said to them, “When you return, tell us what you see. How did you experience this new place? What was the land like? How were the people?” Perhaps these kinds of open-ended questions would have led the scouts to bring back a different report. At least these sorts of instructions might have given them more room to develop their own stories in a less dualistic fashion; the scouts might have been inspired to bring back a different description of what they saw.
Or is it simply a matter of perspective? After all, the twelve emissaries all observe and experience the same things, and yet two of them return with an account that is entirely different from that of the other ten. What is it that enables Joshua and Caleb to see the Promised Land through different eyes?
In his book <i>The Courage to Create</i> (1975), Rollo May writes, “We are called upon to do something new, to confront a no-man’s-land, to push into a forest where there are no well-worn paths and from which no one has returned to guide us. This is what existentialists call the anxiety of nothingness…. To live into the future means to leap into the unknown, and this requires a degree of courage for which there is no immediate precedent and which few people realize.” He asserts that “if you do not express your own original ideas, if you do not listen to your own being, you will have betrayed yourself. Also you will have betrayed our community in failing to make your contribution to the whole” (pp. 12–13).
The ten emissaries start their report with a positive statement about the land overflowing with milk and honey; they then switch to the negatively colored description of the fortified cities and powerful people (13:27–29). The Rabbis describe this as the way slanderers speak: “They begin with flattering and end with evil” (BT <i>Sotah</i> 35a). Or, in more modern terms: the pessimist observes a situation, generalizes about the bad aspects, and interprets them as a permanent and constant feature. In contrast, the optimist observes the same situation and sees the bad aspects, but particularizes them and interprets them as a temporary obstacle that can be overcome.
This then is the sin of the scouts: their failure to contribute to their community because of their negative attitude and narrow perspective. They seemingly lack the courage to leap into the unknown and confront “no-man’s-land.” Where the ten see potential failure and defeat, Joshua and Caleb see potential success and possibility. They had the courage to leap into the unknown and envision a new reality. While they acknowledge the challenges that lie ahead, they are able to “listen to their own being” and trust in the people’s ability to overcome those challenges with God’s promised help and protection: “The land that we traversed and scouted is an exceedingly good land. If pleased with us, יהוה will bring us into that land, a land that flows with milk and honey, and give it to us; only you must not rebel against יהוה. Have no fear then of the people of the country, for they are our prey: their protection has departed from them, but יהוה is with us” (14:7–9).
As Harvey Fields wrote, we too can “conquer ‘Promised Lands’ when we have regard for our talents and believe in our creative powers. The sin of the spies grows from their failure of self-love and self-respect…. Only Joshua and Caleb, who refuse to see themselves as ‘grasshoppers,’ are worthy of entering the Promised Land” <i>(A Torah Commentary for Our Times,</i> 1993, p. 42).
These, to me, are the challenges of <i>Sh’lach L’cha</i>: First, the challenge to perceive the world in all its nuanced complexity—and not reduce it to simplistic either/or, black/white categories. Second, and more central to the parashah, the challenge of really loving ourselves and trusting our instincts, the challenge of not making ourselves into anything less than we truly are (since this would diminish the One in whose image we are created), and the challenge of living with the “anxiety of nothingness” in order to create a new reality.
As long as we see ourselves merely as grasshoppers up against giants, we will set ourselves up for failure. If we want to create anything new and to enter into the Promised Land, then we have no choice but to leap into the unknown, to believe in ourselves, and to trust in God’s faith in us. This voice of optimism and hope is what separates Joshua and Caleb from the other scouts. This is what—in spite of a long history filled with good reasons to see ourselves as grasshoppers and to give up—has enabled the Jewish people to continue and to thrive.

Korach

W<small>HAT A DRAMATIC</small> power struggle we have just witnessed in this parashah! A cabal of influential rebels tries to take power from Moses, daring to risk their lives to promote their own self-interest over the sacred destiny of their people. Their downfall is stark and dreadful.
Yet, the Torah teaches, even though Korah dies, his descendants live on (Numbers 26:11). We certainly see them today: cynical political, religious, and communal leaders cloaking self-interest in the language of democracy, nationalism, or God. In wielding power in such shortsighted ways, these modern-day rebels present an even greater threat to God’s creation than Korah did to Moses’ leadership. This Torah portion urges us to be vigilant, lest such persons undermine the communities that we are called to create and sustain.
But it is not only public leaders who play Korah’s role today. We, too, live with an ongoing conflict between an “inner Moses” and an “inner Korah”—between humility and arrogance, between selflessness and selfishness. And until we can hear the difference between those two voices, our actions will not be effective in countering the power of the Korahs at large in the world. We need to be clear when it is the voice of our needy, small-minded self that advises us to act, or when it is the wise voice that speaks from our deepest and best values and truth. We need a practice of reflection to discern which voice is guiding us. Happily, we can also find some guidance in this parashah.
In our tradition Moses is seen as humility embodied—the true servant of God. The <i>S’fas Emes,</i> a 19th-century Hasidic master, understood Moses as being so far from pride in his bearing that people could not fathom his modesty. In <i>parashat Korach,</i> we see Moses in that place of humility, able to lead because he loves God and the Israelites with every fiber of his being, despite his constant frustration with both of them. Twice he falls on his face—before Korah and before God—trying to stop the rebellion and to prevent God from destroying the persistently disobedient Israelites. Moses acts from the deep understanding that Korah’s challenge has nothing to do with him; it is a challenge to God. He knows himself to be the vessel through which God’s vision for the Israelites could become manifest, not the man who has to prove himself superior to an insolent competitor. Throughout the journeys of the Israelites, we see Moses grow as a spiritual leader: from a reluctant young man who struggles with anger and lack of self-confidence to become the quintessential leader—one who is able to overcome his own ego in order to serve a much greater cause. Finally, he becomes one who accepts God’s decision that he will die—and that he will die outside the land of Israel.
Korah is different. His challenge to Moses is rooted in personal ambition, not love of God or of the Israelites. Unlike Moses, who hesitated to take the leadership that God offered, Korah seeks to grab it for himself. Tradition interprets the opening of the parashah—literally “And Korah took”—to mean that he took himself <i>apart from the people</i> (Tzvi Hirsch Kalischer; <i>Torah Gems,</i> 1998, p. 77). Korah would have done nothing to stop God from destroying the Israelites, for he would have loved to be the sire of a whole new people. Unlike Moses, Korah sees the whole story as being about himself and the role he wants to play as a powerful chief priest.
Reading this parashah, I ask: how do I recognize Korah in my own thoughts and actions, and how do I liberate the consciousness that Moses had? In my job as the director of a wonderful non-profit institute, I find that Korah seems to pop up most frequently when I am afraid. What if I don’t succeed at raising enough money? What if I don’t succeed at making our work known? What if I am not good enough? What if this work fails because of my incompetence? In such moments of doubt, I make myself the central actor on stage, starring in the “The Tragedy of Rachel.” In that place of fear, I separate myself from the community doing the work, and I clutch for some way to feel in control. I can’t see the whole. There is no way to make wise decisions.
But if I make time, like Moses, to fall on my face—to breathe and reflect—I can hear the “I” shouting out in all its grandiosity. I reply, <i>“Rav l’kha</i> (Enough of this), Korah!”—acknowledging that once again I have made the story about me and my fears. In that space, Moses can emerge and call me back to humility—to the recognition that I, like everybody else, am but a bit player on this stage. I can rekindle the trust that I have in the wisdom of the unfolding of the work and in the wisdom of my colleagues to figure out what will flow from this moment.
The Korah in all of us gets triggered by different emotions: fear, anger, anxiety, greed or doubt. When this happens, we lose sight of the whole and become caught up in our own inner dramas. Our needs eclipse the needs of others.
Moses’ path—and ours—is to move from the narrow place of doubt, fear, anger, and jealousy to an expansive covenanted life in a community of mutual care and responsibility. In such a community, all people are holy. They—we—can remind each other that what matters is not the ambition of the self, but the work of helping to make the soul, the home, the office, and the world a safer, wiser, more compassionate place for all. Such a perspective helps each of us to come closer to being a humble servant of God.

Chukat

M<small>IRIAM, LIKE</small> M<small>OSES AND</small> A<small>ARON</small>, was a child of Amram and Jochebed, both of the tribe of Levi. The prophet Micah recognizes all three siblings as Israel’s leaders when he proclaims in God’s name: “I redeemed you from the house of bondage, and sent Moses, Aaron, and Miriam to lead you” (Micah 6:4). Although the Bible preserves only a few direct references to Miriam, her importance to the Israelites’ story shines through even this leanest of biographical sketches. First, Miriam is called a prophet (in Exodus 15:20, although her prophetic teachings are not recorded. Second, she sings and leads the women in song to God following her people’s safe passage across the Sea of Reeds (Exodus 15:21). Third, she (along with Aaron) speaks out against Moses about his wife and his authority (12:1–2). Fourth, she is shut out of the camp when she is stricken with skin disease; tellingly, the Israelites refuse to move on until she returns (12:10–15). Finally, she dies and is buried in Kadesh (20:1), a place name that evokes the holy <i>(kadosh).</i> These few references to Miriam are but clues to the larger story of her life and importance.
Let us imagine that larger story by creating a midrash. Picture Moses as he climbed Mount Nebo to see the Promised Land he would never enter and to experience God’s drawing out his soul as gently as a kiss draws out the breath (Deuteronomy 34; on God’s kiss, see Post-biblical Interpretations, at “Miriam died there”). What was he thinking at that moment? In the midrash we are creating we may imagine that this inspiring leader thought about the future of his people and about who would preserve the Covenant for future generations. First, he considered Aaron’s son Eleazar, who would carry on the priestly functions; he could reassure himself that the priests would preserve the teachings of the Torah. Indeed, for a time, the priests did maintain their role. However, following the destruction of the Second Temple, the priests no longer played a central role in the people’s observance of the Covenant. Moses then thought of Joshua, who was chosen to lead the Israelites into the Promised Land. He could reassure himself that through the land, the faith would be preserved. Yet for nearly two millennia, the people of Israel would live in exile from the Promised Land. Finally, Moses then thought of Miriam. But failing to recognize earlier what she had contributed to preserving the faith, he realized that he had made no effort to ensure that her function be taken up by someone else.
Was there a leadership role that was lost with the death of Miriam? If the Israelites were to remain true to their religion in the generations to come, it would be because the women passed their faith and traditions on to their children. Moses’ efforts had gone into legislating primarily for the Israelite men and had largely neglected to consider the roles of women, who were often invisible in the legal codes. In our midrash, however, Miriam had seen to the women and the education of the children. What qualifications would there be for Miriam’s successor? Eleazar was destined for his priestly role by virtue of his lineage. Joshua had been chosen because he was judged to be a capable military commander. But whoever was to succeed Miriam would have to qualify directly through God’s gift, because no one had thought to name a successor. Moses, in that one prescient moment, understood that a vital piece of the community might have died with Miriam.
But it did not die, although it became obscured. Miriam’s legacy, which we are just beginning to retrieve, models our capacity to care for those more vulnerable than ourselves (as she did for her infant brother), to intervene in history regardless of our position (as she did when she approached the princess and when she challenged Moses’ conduct and leadership), and to dance as well as to sing publicly as a form of worship.
In our parashah, we learn something else as well: “The Israelites arrived in a body at the wilderness of Zin on the first new moon, and the people stayed at Kadesh. Miriam died there and was buried there. The community was without water, and they joined against Moses and Aaron” (20:1–2). Rabbinic tradition, recognizing that something of major import was lost with the death of Miriam, found in the juxtaposition of Miriam’s death with the peoples’ crying out for water a powerful symbol for this loss. A midrash tells us that throughout the Israelites’ sojourn in the wilderness, a well followed them. With the death of Miriam, the well dried up. How can we best understand what Miriam’s Well represented?
Israel in the Bible had two main centers of practice: the Tent of Meeting (or Tabernacle, later replaced by the Temple) and the home. The rules governing the Tent of Meeting take up much of Leviticus, but the life that is to be conducted in the home receives relatively little mention. Moses, we might say, had focused on institutional religion. But in our midrashic rendering of the story, Miriam’s gift was to raise up the personal practices of the Israelites and to help the women of Israel recognize and claim their homes as a sacred place. Each woman’s own Sabbath table became like an altar. While Moses showed the Israelites the God who spoke to them from the top of Sinai, Miriam enabled the women to see that God could also be found around the cooking fires in their own tents.
Miriam also helped the women change their idea of holy space (from the set-apart Tent of Meeting to their own homes). In a time when the male leaders were focusing on all that was separate and distinct, Miriam taught the women to find the holy wherever they were open to it, whenever they could be responsive.
And just as her imagined teachings sought to move beyond separation, her own tradition is not to be found in a separate text but in the words that mothers have told their daughters and sons since then: God is found in and through all that we remember, all that we experience, all that we hope for. Miriam’s Well stands for what is nourishing and life-giving—it stands for the dining table, the cradle, and the welcoming embrace of our loved ones.

Balak

I<small>N THE MIDST</small> of our book of wandering, we read of how a Moabite sovereign engages a seer from a distant land in the hopes of cursing and thus defeating the Israelites. In the central irony of a fanciful tale that opens with “[he] saw” (22:2), neither King Balak nor his hireling Balaam are able to “see” the Israelites. Balaam and Balak position and re-position themselves in an attempt to assess the multitude that “hides the earth from view” (22:5). The two travel from point to point without gaining the perspective they seek.
Only when the Holy One opens his eyes can Balaam see more than a portion of the people he has been sent to curse. He sees the tents that are the homes and the gathering places of the women, children, and men who live as a community marked by care and mutual respect. Seemingly stunned by his newfound perspective on the Israelite compound, Balaam describes the people in language that evokes Eden: “Like palm-groves that stretch out, / Like gardens beside a river, / Like aloes planted by יהוה, / Like cedars beside the water; / Their boughs drip with moisture, / Their roots have abundant water” (24:6–7). Have the eyes of the desert diviner cleared sufficiently so that he can see a people who one day would have the power to make the desert bloom? Do his words reflect dreams of cities with palm-lined boulevards and garden neighborhoods that would, in the future, challenge and transform the arid landscape?
For a moment, Balaam sees a community as it can be: a society of mutual dependence and trust, a community where each person is treated with dignity, and he exclaims: <i>Mah tovu ohalecha, Yaakov</i> / <i>mishk’notecha, Yisrael</i> (“How fair are your tents, O Jacob, / Your dwellings, O Israel”; 24:5). But when Balaam extends his description, the utopian vision fades, and the people become just like any other who seek domination over their foes. He concludes, “Blessed are they who bless you, / Accursed they who curse you!” (24:9). As in the beginning of this portion, the world is divided into two: those who seek to maintain power, and those who attempt to usurp it—the victors and the vanquished, the blessed and the cursed.
The concluding story of this portion (25:1–9) illustrates the tragedy of seeing the world dichotomized in this way. Exhausted from a journey that seems to have no end, the Israelite men forget who they are. They forget their privileged relationship with the One who brought them out of slavery.
Balaam’s recognition of Israel’s goodness has become part of our liturgy known as the <i>Mah tovu</i> (literally “how good are”): <i>Mah tovu ohalecha, Yaakov</i> / <i>mishk’notecha, Yisrael</i> (“How fair are your tents, O Jacob, / Your dwellings, O Israel!”). The Rabbis who created our liturgy recognized the power of this sentence, and so they intentionally positioned it as the opening of a daily prayer sequence that fixes the individual in the context of the community of Israel. They expand Balaam’s blessing with four verses from Psalms written in the first person. In so doing, they enable each worshipper to claim a place as a member of the collective.
I, through Your abundant love, enter Your house;
I bow down in awe at Your holy temple (Psalm 5:8).
יהוה, I love Your temple abode,
The dwelling-place of Your glory (Psalm 26:8).
Let me bow down and kneel before God my maker (Psalm 95:6).
As for me, may my prayer come to You, O יהוה,
At a favorable moment;
O God, in Your abundant faithfulness,
Answer me with Your sure deliverance (Psalm 69:14).
With these phrases, the Rabbis transform Balaam’s God of war into a God of <i>chesed.</i> (loving-kindness), and each Jew who utters these words becomes the prayer. In the parashah, Balaam follows his original utterance of the verse with two descriptions of Israel: an Israel that lives in a lush and verdant world, and a nation that is victorious against enemies. But Balaam’s utterance is also incomplete, which is why our liturgy expands it—and also shifts the focus to the relationship of the individual with God.
I propose a third reading, one that returns to the evocation of the community as a source of power and that extends it, connecting the people with God and with their unique challenge.
Consider the following combination of 24:5 with the words from the book of Isaiah:
How fair are your tents, O Jacob,
Your dwelling places, O Israel! (24:5)
I, the Holy One, have called you in righteousness,
and taken you by the hand.
I am the One who created you
and made you a covenant people,
a light to the nations:
to open eyes that are blind,
to bring the captive out of confinement (Isaiah 42:6–7).
This clear challenge invites us to move beyond the narrow, dichotomous thinking that blinded Balak and Balaam in this portion. These verses from Isaiah anticipate—and fulfill—the subsequent prophetic call about tents and dwellings: “Enlarge the space for your tent (<i>oholech</i>); / do not spare the canvas for your dwelling place (<i>mishk’notayich</i>)” (Isaiah 54:2). Here the prophet urges Jerusalem—personified as a woman—to widen her tent with joy and make room for the multitudes who will enter the capital city. An expanded tent in a gracious and open city reflects the utopian and achievable goal of moving beyond oppositional concepts of native/stranger, friend/foe, chosen/rejected, male/female.
Are we ready to open our tents and our hearts to those who wish to dream—and then to build sacred communities that not only tolerate diversity and difference but also celebrate them? Can we move beyond narrow, divisive definitions and descriptions that are no longer useful? Might we transform our communities by welcoming those who come into our houses of worship with words that describe what our community can be? When our dwelling places become sanctuaries for all seekers of peace and justice, when our homes welcome all who no longer objectify the other, then we can truthfully declare, <i>Mah tovu</i>—how good, how fair, are our tents.

Pinchas

T<small>HE STORY IN</small> <i>parashat Pinchas</i> about Zelophehad’s five daughters—Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah (Numbers 27:1–11)—encapsulates the challenges that women faced and what they had to do in order to affirm their rights with dignity. Numbers 26 describes a census taken of all males over the age of 20 (v. 2). As part of the list of the various clans, we read that “Zelophehad…had no sons, only daughters” (v. 33). As the census was concluded, God instructs Moses: “Among these shall the land be apportioned as shares” (v. 53). “Among these” refers to the males listed in the census; hence, we can conclude that Zelophehad’s daughters were not counted in the census and also were not to receive any land as inheritance.
We might expect that women, heirs to Egyptian slavery and then put under law that frequently favors men, might react by keeping silent, by accepting as natural the rule decreed for them to follow. We might expect women in those days to stay close to their tents, remain out of sight, and not go far from their families. So how and why did Zelophehad’s daughters write a new chapter in history? First, they dared to “go out” from their living place, from their social space, from the destiny imposed on them. The text states: “The daughters of Zelophehad…came forward. The names of the daughters were Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah. They stood before Moses, Eleazar the priest, the chieftains, and the whole assembly, at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting” (27:1–2).
Let’s imagine the scene: the Israelite camp is formed of tribes, each of whom has a determined place, with the Tabernacle in the middle; and in the center stand the main authority figures, all of them men: Moses, the priest Eleazar, and the chieftains. Imposing as this structure may have been, the five sisters decide to claim their rights. Together, they go out of their tents, without being called by anyone, to the place where only the high-ranking men congregate, to the place where the Tablets from Sinai rest in the Ark, to the place of holiness and authority, to a place where women did not have authority. These men must have been overwhelmed when they saw such a startling, unprecedented situation!
But this is not all that the five sisters do. They not only come forth, but also they speak with determination: “Our father died in the wilderness. He was not one of the faction, Korah’s faction, which banded together against יהוה, but died for his own sin; and he has left no sons. Let not our father’s name be lost to his clan just because he had no son! Give us a holding among our father’s kinsmen!” (Numbers 27:3–4). Let’s analyze what this text reflects about these women. First, note that these women know their law and history. They use the fact that their father was not involved in Korah’s rebellion (Numbers 16) as evidence to support his—and their—claim to the land. They know that the continuity of family name depends on inheritance of the land; and they realize that the current law is not adequate, for it does not take into account the unusual circumstances of a man without sons. They possess the acumen to recognize this omission—in God’s law! But because they consider God’s law to be just, or to aim to be just, they show no hesitation in pointing out the unfair nature of the present situation with complete confidence and supporting their claim with compelling arguments.
How does Moses react? The following verse states: “Moses brought their case before יהוה” (27:5). Moses discloses his inability to assess the claims of these sisters. He takes the case to God, who responds by unequivocally supporting the sisters’ demand and even by promulgating a new and permanent law to secure inheritance for any daughters in such circumstances (27:6–8). Thus, the sisters’ claim leads to the law of inheritance’s being changed forever.
As stated above, a key to the sisters’ success is their full awareness of God’s laws and the people’s history and story. They insist on change by engaging Israelite traditions effectively, something the rabbinic sages recognized when they described the women. According to the Talmud (BT <i>Bava Batra</i> 119b), Zelophehad’s daughters were wise (<i>chachamot),</i> astute interpreters (<i>darshanyiot</i>), and pious (<i>rachmanyiot)</i>: “wise” because they spoke in the precise moment when the decision was issued; “interpreters” because they in essence said, “If our father had a son, we would not have spoken—because he would have the inheritance”; and “pious” because they did not want to marry men who were not worthy.
The achievement of Zelophehad’s daughters was a landmark in women’s rights regarding the inheritance of land, from those days up to now. In addition, however, the story of these five women offers a compelling lesson for all those who believe that their destiny is fixed or that divine justice has abandoned them. It encourages us to think differently—and provides a message of hope for all those faced with obstacles.
Perhaps the most important legacy of Zelophehad’s daughters is their call to us to take hold of life with our own hands, to move from the place that the others have given us—or that we have decided to keep because we feel immobile—and to walk, even to the most holy center, to where nobody seems to be able to go. After all, nothing is more sacred than life itself and the fight for what we believe is worthy. Thus, this parashah inspires us to discover that we too have the ability to know what is right for ourselves and what our rights ought to be. When we believe in our capacity to shape our history, to the point of being able to change even a law that came from the Revelation at Sinai, then we pay a tribute to Zelophehad’s daughters.
In our era, we can see this legacy in women such as Judith Eisenstein, who was the first to become a bat mitzvah in 1922, and in the first women ordained as rabbis: Regina Jonas (in 1935), Sally Priesand (Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion in 1973), Sandy Sasso (Reconstructionist Rabbinical College in 1974), and Amy Eilberg (Jewish Theological Seminary in 1985). Like Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah, they and the many other courageous women who followed in their footsteps came forth and opened the future for all women seeking to reclaim their Jewish inheritance in new and powerful ways.

Matot

I <small>HAVE ALWAYS</small> been amazed by the power of Kol Nidrei, the prayer that introduces the evening service on Yom Kippur. Each year, I marvel at the sheer number of people who put aside all other commitments in order to be in synagogue, to be present to hear these ancient words. What brings us in the doors? Is it the haunting melody? Is it the threefold repetition of the prayer that moves us toward an emotional crescendo? Or is it the message of this prayer, which promises to absolve us of our responsibility for any vows that we may make in the coming year?
When we make vows, we put into speech our deepest fears and most profound hopes. Like Hannah who vows to dedicate her son to the sanctuary if God grants her a son (I Samuel 1:11), many of us make various commitments to do certain things or give up certain things that we cherish, in order to avert danger or bring about a hoped-for future. Yet some vows are rash, regrettable, or unrealizable; some are made under duress. Kol Nidrei reminds us that we have the choice to keep or annul our vows, thus affirming our most basic rights to self-expression and self-determination. This is part of what gives both the prayer and its recitation its profound power.
<i>Parashat Matot</i> enumerates various regulations concerning the status of women’s vows (30:3–17). It also describes the circumstances under which a woman’s vow may be annulled. We read that if her father or husband hears the vow on the day that she makes it, the vow can be nullified. The woman’s personal status—whether she is a child, married, or divorced—will determine the status and power of the vow and whether she may fulfill it. Although she possesses the ability to make a vow, she may have to abandon her oaths and vows if the male authority figure in her life hears them. Given that fact, what are her options? She could take her chances with vowing and being heard. Or, to avoid her vow being annulled, she might either choose not to take on the responsibility involved in making an oath or a vow, or she might opt to make her vow but without anyone hearing her; in both of these options, she would be forced to follow, and be complicit in maintaining, the culture’s attitude toward her desire for personal expression. She herself thus participates in her own silencing, because only by vowing without being heard, will she fulfill the mandate that her vow establishes. She acts by pretending that she has not acted. She can transgress the restrictions only by forcing herself to take part in them at the same time. She must betray herself to be true to herself.
While we think we are free from these kinds of constraints, this is often not quite true. As mothers, when we chose to take emotional and physical care of our children, we voluntarily relinquish the freedom we might have enjoyed at an earlier time. Similarly, we may accept professional positions that do not sufficiently reflect our capabilities, in order to be available to support a beloved spouse, partner, or aging parent. We may not explicitly associate such situations with vow making or breaking, but in a certain important way, the relationship to vows exists. Like vow-making in the Bible, women’s aspirations, spoken or not, are promises we make, even if only to ourselves. When we give them up because of external pressures, we pay a price.
On the one hand, we live in a time when, as women, we are blessedly free from the kind of controls that Numbers prescribes. On the other hand, we find ourselves within a web of relationships where we often give up what we had promised to ourselves, or we redirect our abilities. The stereotype of the Jewish mother may represent, in some ways, a woman’s efforts to take power through the very vehicles that entrap her—by making a nice home, cooking gourmet meals, and having successful children.
Some may see these concessions as choices; others may see them as abandonment of self. We want to fulfill our responsibilities and live up to our expectations as spouses, mothers, and daughters; but we also want to be heard, to play an active role in our communities, to see ourselves and to be seen as powerful. We are aware that our culture could not survive if we sometimes did not voluntarily place our own needs as secondary. Yet, we are not always aware of the price some of us pay for that choice.
We see in our society rising rates of depression, eating disorders, premature sexuality, and self-destructive behaviors. A 2002 report of the American Psychological Association indicates that of the 17 million Americans who suffer from depression yearly, “women are twice as likely as men to experience a major depressive episode. Depression may occur at any age during a woman’s life with certain events like puberty, pregnancy, perimenopause, trauma, substance abuse and quality of relationships.” The report also notes that current research shows that women typically “place their needs secondary to those of others.” One cannot simplistically attribute depression to a single cause, but it is difficult not to wonder to what extent the thwarting of one’s longings and hopes, either by implicit social pressures or explicit ones, plays a role.
How can we can stimulate and support, rather than stifle, women who long to fulfill their ambitions and dreams, so that their vows to themselves—and others—can become a reality? As a Jewish community we are still working on answers to such questions, both in the personal and institutional realms. We no longer need to be complicit in the denial and abandonment of self that pervades our culture. Instead, we can speak honestly and openly about our lives and our choices. No longer must we voice our desires in an undertone, hoping that no one will hear. Instead, we can search to find—whether in studying the Torah or participating in the world—the truth of our lives that will help us to find the truth in God’s teachings, so that we can live in a more just relationship with our loved ones and with our God.

Masei

 T<small>HE LAST PARASHAH</small> in the book of Numbers ends with a second story about the five daughters of Zelophehad—Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah. The first story, in Numbers 27, shows how the sisters demanded and received a promise—from God, no less—that they will inherit their family’s ancestral land (since their father died without leaving a son). Here in <i>parashat Mas’ei,</i> the daughters’ male relatives challenge the women’s inheritance right in order to protect ownership of tribal land. Moses responds <i>al pi Adonai</i>—“at God’s bidding” (36:5), by amending the new law. The change requires women who inherit ancestral land to marry into a family of their father’s tribe (36:6), thereby limiting these women’s choice of spouses, but keeping the property within the tribe. The parashah and the book end by confirming that the sisters did marry accordingly.
This sequel in Numbers 36 appears to be a setback after the daughters’ startling triumph in <i>parashat Pinchas</i> (Numbers 27), where they won significant inheritance rights for themselves and for their “sisters” in the future. The five sisters in particular, and Israelite women in general, walk away from <i>parashat Mas’ei</i> with less than they had before. As some scholars observe, when the sisters marry their first cousins, they essentially hand over their inheritance to the same men who would otherwise have inherited the land had the women never stood up for themselves (Hara E. Person, “Masa’ei: Boundaries and Limits,” in <i>The Women’s Torah Commentary,</i> 2000, p. 327; and Jacob Milgrom, <i>Numbers,</i> 1990, p. 298). Moreover, in giving up some of their gains for the sake of larger familial and communal needs, they seem to perpetuate the all-too-familiar situation of women foregoing their own needs for the sake of others in the family.
Nevertheless, while the decree in this parashah certainly is a step back from the full rights given to the daughters previously, it is not a full retreat; they still end up with more than they had in the first place. To begin with, the sisters marry from a position of strength, not dependency. What would have happened to the sisters had they not stepped forward to ask for their inheritance? Given the frequency with which the Torah reminds us of our societal obligation to care for widows and orphans, we can guess what might have happened to Zelophehad’s daughters had they remained landless. Furthermore, the daughters’ actions and triumph eliminate a whole category of dependent orphans (the girls and women who until then did not inherit).
The story of Zelophehad’s daughters invites us to reflect on the roles that family members and community play in one’s life. Our freedom as women to make choices and demands stems in part from our Jewish heritage in which women such as Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah stood together to argue for equal rights, convincing leadership—human and divine—of the justness of their cause.
Today our individual commitments and decisions from the everyday to the profound (taking a class at night, accepting a board position, making a career change) affect our partners and our children, regardless of who makes them. Likewise, our seemingly private decisions launch a whole range of new communal developments. For example, working and studying mothers and their partners require, and therefore initiate, new structures for childcare that were not available to the previous generation. Such choices compel (or inspire) others to “think outside the box” to accommodate new challenges.
Especially in egalitarian relationships, each person’s words and visions, choices and decisions, actions and reactions, construct an unfolding dialogue, evergrowing and often life-changing in much wider circles than one would have envisioned. What began as a seemingly private demand by five sisters for their share of land became a new law to protect all women in unforeseen circumstances.
In <i>parashat Mas’ei,</i> at the end of the Israelites’ journey in the wilderness, the amending of the ruling for Zelophehad’s daughters (along with the concomitant change in inheritance laws in perpetuity for all Israelites, 36:8–9) teaches modern lessons for intertwined lives: in a society, community, or family, one person’s needs and desires must be weighed against those of others. Final authority should not belong to one member only, nor should laws be made based on the interests of only one party.
The amendments in Numbers 36 also emphasize the need for lawmakers to look always at the rights of <i>all</i> citizens, and not just at the issues brought by lobbyists. The women’s movement, like all movements of liberation, discovered long ago that the most effective and enduring changes are those that create justice for <i>all</i> members of society.
This observation does not negate the need to speak out for special interests. Just as the prayer of our matriarch Hannah became for the rabbis of the Talmud the model of how to pray (I Samuel 1:10–11; BT <i>B’rachot</i> 31a–b), so in their own time, the daughters of Zelophehad model how to be an advocate for one’s own rights. Had Hannah not prayed or the sisters not spoken up, no change would have taken place. Speaking out opens up a public space where the diverse needs of community members can be examined in order to negotiate for equitable resolutions. Because the original ruling given in <i>parashat Pinchas</i> benefited the daughters but not the tribe, the amendment here in <i>parashat Mas’ei</i> demonstrates how an idea may require fine-tuning even after it becomes law.
The ending of the book of Numbers sets the stage for processes of change, showing us that even within the Torah itself, lawmaking is an inexact science requiring flexibility to change as issues arise and society evolves. We honor the sisters’ ability to speak up, and their grace to concede when their gain is shown to be against community interests. We are the inheritors of their chutzpah and their quest for equal rights.

Devarim

 T<small>HE BOOK OF</small> D<small>EUTERONOMY</small>, dramatically set just outside the land of Canaan, is comprised of a series of farewell addresses delivered by Moses as he prepares to die, forever barred from the Promised Land. Unlike the previous four books of the Torah, which are narrated in the third person, Deuteronomy is narrated almost entirely in the first person, the “I” of Moses persistently addressing a “you.” However, the “you” that Moses addresses is not always the same: sometimes it refers to all the Israelites who left Egypt, none of whom is still alive to hear these final words; other times it refers to their children, the generation of the wilderness, those now listening to Moses; still other times, it refers to a small group of Israelites, such as the twelve scouts, the two-and-a-half tribes who have chosen to settle on the east bank of the Jordan, or just Joshua and Caleb.
In fact, the word “you” punctuates this parashah like a drumbeat, appearing more than 100 times in slightly more than 100 verses, plus many other instances if the imperative verb form is included. Throughout, Moses primarily focuses on his I-You relationship with the people; yet the relationship is characterized more by conflict and alienation than by intimacy. As he recalls their journey, trying to make sense of the past forty years, he rewrites history, blaming the people for proposing that he send scouts to the land (an action commanded by God in Numbers 13:2) and for provoking him into delegating judicial authority (an idea suggested by his father-in-law Jethro in Exodus 18:17–23). Worst of all, Moses blames the children for the sins of their parents. Although it is the slave generation who has disappointed him, it is the next generation who now suffers Moses’ rancor and regret.
Despite the fact that Deuteronomy is an ancient book, the insights revealed in this parashah resonate with our modern ideas about human psychology. Contemporary psychologists describe a process known as counter-transference, whereby a therapist projects onto her patients certain conflicts still unresolved within her own life story. Parents, too, can be guilty of such unconscious projection, ascribing to their children their own youthful errors and defeats.
Therefore, we can read this first farewell speech as the presentation of a leader who engages in a kind of counter-transference when he reflects back to the people what has transpired between him and them over the past four decades. Standing before them now on the threshold of death, he wonders: What has happened to this people that I led out of slavery? What has happened to our shared resolve? What has happened to me, who was to serve as God’s emissary and representative? Why have the people doomed me—through their lack of faith, their ingratitude, their waywardness—to die without enjoying God’s promise? We can see in Moses’ flawed recollections and chastisement of the people a final attempt to reshape his life story so as to justify the past actions of this metaphoric parent.
Each year at the Passover seder, we Jews re-enact a similar drama, warning the next generation not to act the part of the <i>rasha,</i> the wicked child, in the haggadah’s parable of the Four Children. If we look closely at this exchange between the parent and the wicked child, we can hear in the former’s rebuke of the latter echoes of what we hear in this parashah. As some versions of the haggadah phrase the dialogue: “The wicked child asks: ‘What is this service to <i>you?…</i> And because these children exclude themselves from the community, you should chastise them, saying: ‘Because of what God did for <i>me</i> when <i>I</i> came out of Egypt.’ ‘For me’ and not ‘for them,’ for had they been there, they would not have been redeemed.” This is a painful text for many Jews. Who among us does not know a contrary child, perhaps our own, who feels so alienated from Judaism that she is willing to be excluded from the community?
In order to truly understand what this vignette in fact conveys, we need to probe further. When we look up the original context of the <i>rasha</i>’s question (Exodus 12:26), we discover that the Rabbis have twisted words out of context. In their original setting, these words were intended to reinforce the tradition, not disparage it; indeed, the Torah instructs <i>all</i> Jewish children to pose this question. Why then did rabbinic tradition put this question only in the mouth of the <i>rasha</i>? Weren’t they living proof that it is precisely this kind of personality—skeptical, provocative, contrary—that would best guarantee Jewish survival?
Like the parent of the <i>rasha,</i> Moses (as <i>parashat D’varim</i> presents him) seems ambivalent about his contrary people, and perhaps about himself. During much of his speech, he separates himself from the Israelites, addressing them as “you”; but on occasion he uses “we,” as when reminiscing about battles they fought together (3:12). For that brief moment, he regards them as equals who have shared important decisions about the distribution of land. But before he even finishes the verse, he pulls back, telling them four times how “I [that is, Moses] assigned” the regions of that apportioned land.
The parashah invites us to see that, like most parents, Moses has loved his children even when they have acted the part of the <i>rasha.</i> And like most parents, he has sometimes felt rejected and betrayed when his children have asserted their autonomy. As he now prepares to let them go into the new land, he must decide what his final message to them should be. Tellingly, the parashah concludes with his encouraging words to Joshua, “Do not fear…for it is your God יהוה who will battle for you” (3:22). In the end, Moses recognizes that this is a new generation about to enter the land, and they need his blessing as well as God’s.

Vaetchanan

 T<small>HE SECOND ACCOUNT</small> of the Decalogue (“Ten Commandments”) described in this portion has long been scrutinized for how it differs from the first version in <i>parashat Yitro.</i> One obvious difference is the reason given for observing the Sabbath. Exodus 20:11 states that we should rest on the seventh day in imitation of God at Creation, but Deuteronomy 5:15 focuses on our need as humans to rest. Another discrepancy is that Exodus 19 situates the revelation at Sinai, while 5:2 refers to this sacred site as Horeb. But the most significant difference between these two texts lies in the Israelites’ own state of mind.
When the Israelites stand at Mount Sinai in Exodus 19–20, they have successfully fled the Egyptians, crossed the Sea of Reeds, and been fed in the wilderness on manna; the danger is behind them. When they hear the first of the “Ten Words”—“I יהוה am your God who brought you out of the land of Egypt”—each of them has a personal understanding of the God they have known and experienced.
In Deuteronomy, however, the danger lies ahead. Of those hearing Moses’ recitation of the commandments this time, almost none actually fled Egypt themselves. Earlier, they may have witnessed their rebellious parents’ refusal to fight for the Promised Land (Numbers 13–14); but now, precious few of them still has a living parent. The giants of their youth—Moses, Aaron, and Miriam—are either dead or soon will be. The Israelites themselves, untested, will have to battle their way into the Promised Land in order to settle there. In Exodus, the Israelites are preoccupied with the present; in Deuteronomy, they are focused on the future.
Religion promises us a meaningful world. If we are not free, whether because of physical or psychological enslavement, then life may not be meaningful. But death also threatens meaning, so one of religion’s major tasks is to reconcile us to the losses we experience and, ultimately, to our own mortality. Our religion must convince us that although death exits, meaning abides. We are finite not only because we die, but also because we have chosen the particular life we live. A people’s story spreads over a large canvas and lifts up everyone who participates in its story. When we identify with those who came before us and when we are invested in those who will come after us, then we are part of something much larger than our individual lives and efforts.
While religion can help us find meaning in the face of death, the experience of bereavement transcends our cognitive experience. In particular, with the death of one’s parents comes a feeling of loss and, subsequently, a quest for enduring values. During the final years in the wilderness, after their parents have died, the members of the generation about to enter into the Promised Land go through a gradual reassessment of their parents’ identities, trying to figure out who their ancestors were and who they are themselves. As Moses recounts all that has transpired since the Israelites escaped from Egypt, he emphasizes that the prior generation died because they lacked faith: disillusioned, they had doubted God’s plan to fulfill the covenant of the ancestors and settle them in the Promised Land. Now, standing in Moab, poised to complete the forty-year journey, the current generation comes to admire and appreciate the stark honesty of their parents, who had passed on the history of their own inadequacies so that their children would not “be like their ancestors, a wayward and defiant generation, a generation whose heart was inconstant, whose spirit was not true to God” (Psalm 78:8).
How much deeper their understanding of their parents must have become when they themselves became adults and assumed the formidable task of raising the next generation! Now they face the awesome but voluntary task of carrying on the chain of tradition. After all, if they do not do so, no one else will. Their parents’ passing likely led them to understand that they are part of something larger than themselves, as well as to realize that they are merely a brief but significant moment in the life of the Jewish people. It is said that we become fully human and adult when we touch death. The loss of our parents makes us aware that we, too, are part of a generation that will die.
As the Israelites listen to Moses repeat the Decalogue, their biological parents are gone and their parent figure, Moses, will soon die. How can they find the invincible parent? Somehow, the people must internalize their ideal parent—in other words, they must parent themselves—and then raise the next generation. Their focus must shift to the next generation, the one without grandparents. The experience makes us better appreciate why the concept of <i>l’dor vador</i> (“from generation to generation”) is so central in our tradition.
Since mourning is a creative process, we can ask what new growth there is in the Israelites’ understanding of the Decalogue. Its commandments initially were addressed to those who had directly experienced the exodus from Egypt. If these words were to have the same force for subsequent generations, they must understand the word “Egypt” to represent all the ways in which they are constricted, degraded, and enslaved. And so, as those about to enter the Promised Land hear Moses repeat these words, they think of the “Egypt” of loss and the long “hard labor” of mourning. The God who had brought them out of Egypt becomes the God who comforts them, dries their tears, and encourages them to continue on their way after their parents have been buried in the wilderness. The God of comfort becomes a crucial addition to the ways in which the Israelites understand the One who freed them “from Egypt with a mighty hand” (6:21). As they prepare to settle in the Promised Land and face the vicissitudes of the next part of their formation as the Jewish people, this revelation of the Divine will prove to be particularly important.

Eikev

 S<small>CRIPTURE DESCENDS</small> to speak to us, using metaphor to reveal the holy. In <i>parashat Eikev,</i> we find references to the “mighty hand and the outstretched arm” by which God liberated the Israelites from Egypt (7:19). When the Torah uses the human body as a code to decipher God, we glimpse through ourselves the presence of the One in whose image we are created. Knowing that God is incorporeal, some find such physical descriptions of God inadequate and turn to the natural world. Thus we may imagine God as a rock (<i>hatzur,</i> as in 32:4), as dew (Hosea 14:6), or as a spring of living water (Jeremiah 17:13). Nevertheless, if we look closely at the corporeal imagery in <i>parashat Eikev,</i> we discover that its imagery hints at the luminous potentiality of our bodies to experience God.
The portion begins, “And if (<i>eikev</i>) you do obey these rules and observe them carefully, your God יהוה will maintain faithfully for you the covenant” (7:12). Why is the term <i>eikev</i> (here translated as “if”) used to introduce the conditional clause, instead of a word more commonly employed for that purpose (such as <i>im</i> or <i>ki</i>)<i>?</i> The unusual language that begins our parashah invites the early medieval commentator Rashi to engage in word play, linking <i>eikev</i> to the noun <i>akeiv</i> (“heel”). Rashi writes that if we heed even minor commandments that are easy to trample over with our heels (in other words, commandments that we are likely to treat lightly), then God will keep the promises given to our ancestors. Read in this manner, the portion opens with a warning about not allowing thick skin to divert us from the path on which we walk toward God. Like Moses who takes off his sandals to experience holiness emanating from the earth, so we too are called to remove all barriers between God and ourselves.
The next verse states, “[God] will favor you and bless you and multiply you—blessing your issue of the (literally: your) womb” (7:13). What is interesting here is that the Hebrew wording is all in the masculine singular. Are men imagined as having wombs, or more darkly, as owning women’s wombs? Perhaps we can generously understand the verse as a suggestion that empathy can allow anyone to feel the blessing of a full womb. We know God first as the Creator, the womb of the world. The organ that nurtures potential life may be found in only half the population, yet the Torah suggests that both men and women celebrate pregnancy and birth.
If we accept this idea, then women can look at a later verse in our parashah that speaks in an unequivocally male metaphor and not feel excluded. Although our translation reads, “Cut away…the thickening about your hearts” (10:16), a more literal translation of this verse is, “Circumcise…the foreskin of your heart.” In other words, remove that which obstructs your heart and keeps you from following God’s teachings; open yourself up to experiencing “the great, the mighty, and the awesome God” (10:17). The foreskin in this expression can be likened to the thick skin on our feet that keeps us from feeling our connection to the Holy most intimately. Women and men alike can have a heart that is tender, loving, and open to the Divine, not just those who have literally been circumcised.
The metaphor that calls for a naked heart may help us to understand a deeper reason for the mysterious—and frankly disturbing—ritual of <i>b’rit milah</i> (circumcision). Native American and Mayan beliefs align with Kabbalah in understanding the left side of the body as feminine and the right as masculine. Since the heart rests on the left side, circumcising the heart brings feminine energies into play. Would the addition of a circumcised heart bring into a balance the masculine and feminine energies? Perhaps the metaphor found in <i>parashat Eikev</i> hints that the purpose of the ritual is to remind both men and women to keep the heart tender, for this is not only a woman’s quality.
The circumcised heart is not gender specific. All of us are called to bring forth creative and nurturing energy within ourselves and to act with an empathic heart. Some say that the reason girls do not have an equivalent physical ritual to <i>b’rit milah</i> is that they are born circumcised, the implication being that they are born with unveiled hearts. <i>B’rit milah,</i> then, becomes a spiritual catch-up for boys to approach the openhearted potential of girls.
Being a mother of sons, I have trouble with this explanation, yet we know that women walk through the world with circumcised hearts by their very place in many cultures. They reveal themselves because they often have less power and therefore less to lose. When we think of the hardened, calloused heel that feels little under it, experience shows that women do not have the luxury of stepping without looking carefully. Every misstep becomes a reason for others to keep us back; it becomes an accusation of our iniquity or incompetence.
Rabbi David Mark sees <i>b’rit milah</i> in a broadened mythic context when he compares the phallus to the ancient symbol that the Greeks called <i>ouroboros,</i> the mystical snake that rolls through eternity with its tail in its mouth. He asserts that removing the foreskin from the phallus is like when the snake—a symbol of eternal life—sheds its skin. As a result, through the act of <i>b’rit milah,</i> we incorporate God’s promise of eternal life for the Jewish people directly into the male organ of reproduction. When applied to <i>parashat Eikev,</i> this interpretation helps us to see that a circumcised heart, possible for all of us, allows for growth and expansion, and provides a model for sloughing off gratuitous, constraining defenses.
Torah gives us a language that speaks beyond the physical world and gender. Both women and men embody God in their ordinary lived experience. Just as when we are in danger or despair we reach for another person to lift us up, so we understand that God is reaching for us with an outstretched arm to free us from slavery. In our female and male bodies we find God, and in this discovery we know ourselves to be more than physical beings. All of us are called upon to be creative, transparent, and loving before God.

Re'eh

 “Y<small>OU ARE WHAT YOU EAT,”</small> the common expression goes. I sometimes think of this saying in relation to kashrut (that is, keeping kosher). What do the choices that we make about what we eat reveal about who we really are? Many Jews today view kashrut as an outdated vestige of ancient Israelite practice, expanded upon by rabbinic Judaism, but no longer relevant to modern day life. However, the presentation of the prohibitions associated with kashrut in <i>parashat R’eih</i> challenges us to consider anew the purposes of kashrut.
Deuteronomy 14 tells us what animals, fish, and birds we can and cannot eat. It instructs us not to boil a kid (a young goat) in its mother’s milk, an injunction that became the basis for the rabbinic separation between milk and meat (14:21; see also Exodus 23:19 and 34:26). While many Jews today believe the biblical prohibitions against certain meat and fish to be for health reasons, <i>parashat R’eih</i> makes no such claim. In fact, if this were the case, the explicit permission to give the stranger and the foreigner the foods we are forbidden to eat (14:21) would be frankly immoral. Rather, <i>parashat R’eih,</i> as the Torah does elsewhere, identifies the articulation of eating prohibitions strictly as part of the Israelites’ particular path to holiness: “for you are a people consecrated to your God יהוה” (14:21). What is it about these prohibitions that can make us holy? Interestingly, the prohibited foods are identified as <i>tamei…lachem</i>—ritually impure “for you” (14:7, 8, 10). For this reason, it is perfectly acceptable for other people to eat them, just not for the people Israel.
Traditional and modern commentators have offered various explanations as to why particular fish, poultry, and animals are considered <i>tahor</i> (“ritually pure”) and therefore acceptable to eat. But perhaps more important than the meaning of each of the details of the prohibitions is the simple fact that we are given a list of dos and don’ts that govern what we are to consume daily. According to the Torah, God asks that we abstain from eating certain foods, not because they are unhealthy or intrinsically problematic, but simply as an expression of our devotion. As with other <i>chukim</i> (laws that the rabbinic sages define as being without rational explanation), these prohibitions are like the requests of a beloved: we may not understand them, but we are, in essence, asked to follow them purely as an expression of our love. Daily, the observance of kashrut calls us back to a personal relationship with God.
The laws of kashrut offer a Jewish spiritual discipline that is rooted in the concrete choices and details of daily life—to be practiced in an area that seems most “mundane.” In fact, part of the beauty of kashrut is that regardless of our age, personal interests, or geographic location, we all eat, and most of us do so several times a day. While we may sometimes choose to dine alone, eating is almost universally enjoyed as a social activity. A spiritual discipline around eating is one that carries the clear message that spirituality is about far more than what we do in synagogue and on holidays; it extends into every area of our lives, every single day.
Kashrut reminds us again and again that Jewish spirituality is inseparable from what one might term “physical.” It teaches us that Jewish spiritual practice is about taking the most ordinary of experiences—in all aspects of our lives—and transforming them into moments of meaning, moments of connection. Kashrut provides a model for doing just that, around issues of food preparation and eating. It’s time to cook dinner: What will we make, and how will we prepare it? Will we be driven by an empty stomach or considerations that extend beyond it as well? In these moments, kashrut can connect us to Jewish tradition, to other Jews, and to God. We are hungry and sit down for a meal, but before digging in, we recall that Jewish tradition offers us the practice of pausing for a blessing and a moment of gratitude. We may take this a step further and decide to put aside <i>tzedakah</i> regularly at dinnertime, as some of us try to do. This can be seen as a practice similar to the tithing performed in ancient times, as outlined in the verses immediately following the rules of kashrut in our parashah (14:22–29). In stead of just wolfing down our food and moving on to the next activity, we can learn from Jewish rituals to pause and turn the act of eating into a moment of heightened spiritual awareness.
Increasing numbers of Jews today are expanding their kashrut practice to incorporate additional ethical and environmental considerations. Was the food produced under conditions that respect persons and the environment? Were the workers who picked or prepared the food paid a living wage? Did the processes of production treat animals humanely? In addition to allowing these questions to influence our choices about what to eat, we can direct our <i>tzedakah</i> money to organizations that address these issues, like environmental and farmworker advocacy groups.
From the time of the Torah onward, Jewish tradition teaches us that the spiritual realm encompasses all of life. Kashrut and the other Jewish practices related to eating exemplify this teaching and extend beyond themselves: they stand as daily reminders to look for additional ways to turn the ordinary into moments of deeper connection and intentionality. Every moment has the potential to be one of connection. Through other <i>mitzvot,</i> such as the laws governing proper speech and interpersonal ethics, as well as through the less well-known but rich Jewish tradition of cultivating <i>middot</i> (personal qualities such as patience and generosity in judgment), we can seek to deepen our connections with each other and with God. A Jewish spiritual discipline around eating, practiced with intention, can set us on this course every day. “You are what you eat.” That is, what you choose to eat and how you choose to eat it says a lot about who you are and what kind of a life you are striving to achieve.

Shoftim

 P<small>ARASHAT</small> S<small>HOF’TIM IS ONE OF</small> our most neatly packaged Torah portions, beginning with commandments about the necessity for appointing “magistrates and officials” (16:18) and concluding with a procedure aimed to ensure that people do “what is right in the sight of יהוה” (21:9). From its opening words to its concluding phrases, this parashah is about righteousness and justice. Yet these concepts are meaningless unless rooted in concrete particulars so they can permeate the lives of those who wish to find meaning in the Torah. These are clearly universal values, but where do we find out about the ways women approach such values and concerns?
Among the commandments recounted in this portion are those about warfare. Can we retain humanity in time of war? The parashah asks us to attempt every other possible measure before war is undertaken, literally to “call her [that is, the city] to peace” (20:10), which indicates that war should be considered a last resort in resolving a conflict. All world leaders should familiarize themselves with this ethical teaching: negotiate before fighting by actively calling out in peace to one’s opponent. This recalls the active language about Aaron the priest and his sons in <i>Pirkei Avot</i> 1:12, “Be like the disciples of Aaron: love peace and pursue it.” Real peace needs strong verbs of “calling” and “pursuing”—and real attempts to forge it.
This concept of calling out in peace would seem to be a place where a value of negotiation rather than fighting has permeated the ways in which the society approaches war. In discussing 20:10, <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> 503, a medieval compilation of mitzvot, states, “The quality of mercy (<i>rachmaniut)</i> is a good quality; and it is fitting for us, the holy seed, to behave thus in all matters even with our enemies, worshippers of idols.” This notion that we should always behave with <i>rachamim</i> (mercy)—even to an enemy—is one that continues to apply to daily life, as well as to national crises. This would mean that we first would call to that person in peace, prior to arguing or becoming angry, difficult as it may be.
Are there any biblical examples of this mode of discourse? One example concerns a woman who saves an entire city from destruction (II Samuel 20:14–22). That passage tells how Joab, a warrior acting on the king’s behalf, pursues Sheba son of Bichri, the leader of a group that has rebelled and fled to the town of Abel of Beth-maacah. When Joab besieges the city, a “wise woman” employs persuasive rhetoric and feminine imagery to avert war, warning Joab that he risks destroying a “mother city in Israel” (v. 19). Joab assures her that if the people hand over Sheba, he will not attack the city. The woman makes sure that this happens when she convinces the townspeople to cut off Sheba’s head and toss it over the wall. In this case, the wise woman’s sense of mercy and calling out in peace means that one life is sacrificed for the greater good, to avert large-scale bloodshed and ruin.
<i>Parashat Shof’tim</i> tells us that if war cannot be avoided, there are humane ways to go about it: “When in your war against a city you have to besiege…you must not destroy its trees” (20:19). Why not? The verse continues, <i>“ki ha-adam etz ha-sadeh,”</i> which can be read either as “Are the trees of the field human?” or, alternatively, as “for a human is like a tree.” Trees have the ability to draw water into themselves, and nourish themselves. What will sustain and nurture us? An answer may come from the end of the book of Deuteronomy, when Moses charges all the people—men, women, children, and strangers—to listen to and learn “every word of this Teaching (<i>torah)”</i> (31:12). Just as we may not cut down fruit trees so they may continue to bear fruit, so we must actively study and teach Torah, striving to incorporate it into our hearts and our minds. That way, the quality of mercy will envelop and permeate our individual lives and our society as a whole.
Are there distinct ways that women strive to infuse our world with more mercy and peace? Professor Galia Golan, who has studied Israeli-Palestinian dialogue groups for twenty-five years, has found that dialogue groups composed of all women differ in certain respects from mixed-gender groups (“Reflections on Gender in Dialogue,” <i>Nashim</i> 6, 2003). She has observed that women tend to start from their shared experiences, beginning the conversation not with an abstract, angry summation of the history of the conflict, but with emotional accounts of their personal experiences. According to Golan, women seem more invested in the ability to “dissolve the psychological barriers obstructing resolution of the conflict, by reversing the dehumanization of the enemy that takes place during a prolonged conflict; expanding understanding of the other’s positions; creating empathy with the other side; and thus paving the way for eventual reconciliation.” Dialogue shows unique ways that women call one another to peace, reminding us that through our words and our actions, we possess the potential to “love peace and pursue it.”
It seems fitting that <i>parashat Shof’tim,</i> which is about justice, ends with a body. The crucial aspect of the perplexing ritual of the <i>eglah arufah</i> (“the broken-necked heifer”) is to force the living to acknowledge their responsibility to the dead. This ritual provides a means to ascertain responsibility for the corpse. According to the Midrash, kindness to a dead person <i>(chesed shel emet)</i> is the truest kindness, for it cannot ever be repaid (<i>B’reishit Rabbah</i> 96.5; see also parashat Va-y'chi). Why do it? It is the right thing to do, both for the collective of society and for the dead individual.
It is only in this state of being a collective that a society can operate with justice. Through the totality of these laws, the parashah defines a just society—true kindness and mercy done to all—whether they are brothers, sisters, or enemies, living or dead, human or tree—so that all may find means of sustenance and peace. These values become societal values when they permeate all aspects of life.
<i>—Beth Kissileff</i>

Ki Teitzei

T<small>HE CENTRALITY OF MEMORY</small> to Jewish self-understanding emerges with great vividness in <i>parashat Ki Teitzei</i>, which repeatedly enjoins us to remember events in ways that affect ongoing behavior and practice: “Always <i>remember</i> that you were a slave in the land of Egypt; therefore…observe this commandment” (24:18, 22). “In cases of a skin affection be most careful to do exactly as the levitical priests instruct you…. <i>Remember</i> what your God יהוה did to Miriam on the journey after you left Egypt” (24:8–9). <i>“Remember</i> what Amalek did to you on your journey, after you left Egypt…you shall blot out the memory of Amalek” (25:17, 19). Clearly, the major events of the Jewish past are not simply history but living, active memory that continues to shape Jewish identity in the present. Through telling the story of our past, we learn who we are and must become.
In insisting on the significance of memory for identity, the parashah shows that memory can serve a wide variety of purposes and can be used to support modes of being that seem to conflict with each other. The memory of enslavement in Egypt is repeatedly yoked with injunctions insisting upon justice and compassion: “You shall not subvert the rights of the stranger or the fatherless; you shall not take a widow’s garment in pawn” (24:17). "When you reap the harvest in your field and overlook a sheaf in the field, do not turn back to get it; it shall go to the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow” (24:19). Because Jews once knew hunger and experienced what it was like to dwell as strangers on the margins of society, we are commanded to create a society in which the marginal are cared for and the hungry are provided with food.
Memories of the deeds of the Ammonites and Moabites and the perfidy of Amalek become the foundation for opposite injunctions, those concerning exclusion and vengeance. Because the Ammonites and Moabites did not provide Israel with food in the wilderness, the descendants of these nations should be excluded from God’s congregation, even to the tenth generation (23:3–4). Because Amalek cut down stragglers in the line of march when Israel left Egypt hungry and tired, the memory of the Amalekites should be entirely obliterated (25:17–19).
The memory of Miriam’s skin condition <i>(tzaraat)</i> is still another kind of memory, a highly truncated one. Already in the book of Exodus when Miriam is introduced, it seems clear that she is not being remembered fully. She appears suddenly, leading the women in song at a central moment of the people Israel’s history (Exodus 15:20–21) as if she materialized out of the desert sands. Later, her death and burial are recorded in one verse (Numbers 20:1). There is no account of her passing or of the community’s response; she vanishes, disappearing, as it were, into the desert sands. In this parashah, her <i>tzaraat</i> is remembered (24:8–9), but not her leadership; her punishment is recalled, but not the challenge to Moses’ authority that she mounts with Aaron (Numbers 12:1–2).
If memory is foundational to Jewish community, then perhaps this one-sided memory of a very important woman in the Torah is part of what creates the preconditions for some of the sexual legislation in the parashah. It makes sense that a community that cannot remember its central female figures in all their roundedness will also have difficulty imagining women as agents of their own sexuality—and thus will repeatedly subordinate their interests to those of fathers and husbands. We read that if a woman is found not to be a virgin when she marries, she is stoned to death on her father’s doorstep (22:13–21); that a virgin who is raped is then forced to marry her rapist (22:28–29); that a wife who ceases to please her husband can be given a bill of divorce (24:1–4); and that a woman who is widowed before she has children must marry her husband’s brother (25:5–10). The Torah in this section offers no store of memories of women’s perspectives and experiences that could provide the basis for an alternative ethic.
What do we do, then, when the demands of memory seem to be at odds with each other—when, for example, the partial and distorted memory of Miriam in this parashah collides with the notion of remembering the marginalized, including the marginalized within the Israelite community?
The process of remembering brings with it an obligation to ethical discernment: which memories do we want to affirm and further develop and which do we want to repudiate or transform? We cannot forget the commandments to exclude the Ammonites or blot out the memory of Amalek because their presence in the Torah reminds us of how easy it is to respond to vengeance with more vengeance, or injustice with more injustice. But we can also consciously cultivate memories that encourage us to stop the cycle of violence and domination. When we remember the courage and initiative of Miriam in helping to save her brother (Exodus 2:1–10), when we appreciate her importance to the Israelites who refused to move on without her (Numbers 12:15), when we honor her insistence that her own leadership be recognized (Numbers 12:2), then we lay the foundations for contemporary communities in which women and other “strangers” can take their full and rightful place.
Perhaps the process of sifting through memory also can help to make sense of the last, enigmatic verse of the parashah that enjoins us to “blot out” all memory of Amalek and yet “remember” at the same time. How is this possible? Having grown up in a Reform congregation in the 1950s in which women were on the <i>bimah</i> only to light candles, I am aware of how the enormous changes in women’s roles over the last half century make such memories of prior injustices difficult to believe. We blot out the memory of Amalek when we create Jewish communities in which the perpetual exclusion of some group of people—or the denial of women’s rights—are so contrary to current values as to be almost incredible. Yet, if we are to safeguard our achievements, we can also never forget to remember the history of inequality and the decisions and struggles that have made more equitable communities possible.

Ki Tavo

 T<small>HROUGHOUT OUR LIVES</small>, we make numerous transitions and undergo various rites of passage, of both a formal and informal nature, consciously or unconsciously. Frequently these transitions are marked by ceremony and ritual of some kind: a <i>b’rit bat</i> or <i>b’rit milah,</i> a bat mitzvah or bar mitzvah, a <i>mikveh</i> immersion, a wedding. These are solemn moments, both for ourselves and for our closest relatives. Often they are accompanied by self-scrutiny, a vow, and a determination to improve, to “turn over a new leaf.” The same is true of the beginning of each new year; indeed, this is the central theme of our prayers on both Rosh HaShanah and Yom Kippur. It also holds good when we move into a new home, freshly decorated, the walls clean and as yet unmarked by greasy fingers, the windows crystal-clear and gleaming, the empty rooms waiting to be filled with our lives. <i>Parashat Ki Tavo</i> begins with a ceremony that marks the entry into the Land of Israel (26:1–10): as an expression of gratitude, the people are to bring a basket filled with the first fruits of the land’s bounty and to recount the events that led to the long-awaited settlement of the land.
When Benjamin Ze’ev (Theodor) Herzl gave expression to his extraordinary prophetic vision of a Jewish state in both <i>Der Judenstaat</i> (The Jews’ State) and <i>Altneuland</i> (Old-New Land), he described a new community, one in which the land would be developed through science and technology, in which there would be tolerance in all spheres, and which would be organized socially on a cooperative (“mutualist”) basis. The pioneers of the Second Aliyah, motivated by similar lofty ideals, developed precisely this kind of cooperative way of life when they founded the <i>kvutzot</i> and kibbutzim that became a hallmark of the new socialist communities—and eventually of the autonomous State of Israel. The Declaration of Independence drawn up by the founders of the state in 1948 also proclaimed equality of all citizens, irrespective of race, religion, or gender. Fundamental concepts of social justice, many of which are rooted in the precepts of Deuteronomy, ground much of the legislation passed by Israel’s Knesset (Parliament) from its inception. Indeed, Israel was one of the first countries to pass a law stipulating equality between women and men. For most of the first fifty years of its existence, Israel was a welfare state. Underlying this new venture was not only divine promise but also the memory of past suffering, both recent and long gone by. When Herzl had presented his amazing plan to the Rothschild family, requesting their financial help in turning dream into reality, he wrote: “We are talking about a simple old matter—the exodus from Egypt.”
Almost the entire book of Deuteronomy is a reprise, not only of the events of the forty years in the wilderness (which the people Moses is addressing have not witnessed themselves), but also of the commandments first encapsulated in the giving of the Decalogue at Sinai and later elaborated in the long, detailed catalogues of precepts and prohibitions. Now, in <i>Ki Tavo</i> and the passages that follow, the time has come to look toward the entry into the new home, to review the covenant, and to rededicate oneself—individually and as a people—by first acknowledging the fact that God has fulfilled the promise given to our forebears. This is to be immediately followed by an expression of awareness of past suffering—not necessarily one’s own, but that of the collective. Remembrance of things past is an essential part of developing a new identity, beginning a new existence. The formulation of this memory in the First Fruits ceremony, with its reference to the “fugitive” or “wandering Aramean” (26:5), surely stirs within the modern reader recollections of the trials and tribulations of Jews in the Diaspora, which culminated in the unprecedented horrors of the Holocaust. The purpose of these recollections is to stimulate us to behave differently from those who oppressed us—to give to “the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow, that they may eat their fill” (26:12).
Being the favored of God entails duties and responsibilities. Failure to observe is to be cursed; obedience brings blessings, prosperity, fruitfulness. Above all, doing God’s bidding means that Israel will be established as “God’s holy people” (28:9) and will be “the head, not the tail” (28:13). In contrast, the detailed, terrifyingly graphic list of horrors that will be heaped upon the people if they fail to abide by God’s laws ends with perhaps the direst of warnings: to be scattered among all the peoples “from one end of the earth to another” (28:64) and, worst of all, to become slaves once again (28:68).
The message of <i>parashat Ki Tavo</i> applies to us even now, whether we live in Israel or in the Diaspora. To justify Israel’s existence as a Jewish state and homeland, it must forever strive to be a “light unto the nations” and not a state like any other. As a people, wherever we are, we have a remarkable and noble mission—to fulfill God’s precepts, whether they deal with our relationship to the Divine or—more concretely—with our relationships with our fellow human beings, all of whom have been created in the divine image.

Nitzavim

 F<small>OR THE LAST</small> four or five decades, feminist scholars have asserted that the Bible is an androcentric work reflecting a time when men controlled property, politics, and religious life, not to mention women themselves. Those insights de-legitimized the Torah as a source of meaning and authority for many women. How could a sacred text reflect the injustices of patriarchy? It did not seem possible.
However, the extent to which patriarchy de-legitimizes the Bible as a sacred book for women has become more nuanced in recent scholarship. While the Bible’s male-centeredness generally goes undisputed, at least in academic circles, various scholars (such as Phyllis Trible, Tikva Frymer-Kensky, and Carol Meyers) have highlighted a number of potentially mitigating or even redemptive elements concerning women. First are the powerful and highly delineated female characters in the Bible, most notably Sarah, Rebekah, Tamar, Miriam, Rahab, Deborah, and Ruth, all of whom are leaders who transform the private or public realms in which they act. Second are the Bible’s commandments that express a clear concern for the care of the marginal and/or impoverished in society: the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow. Third are the deep covenantal principles articulated in the Torah that can be used for feminist purposes. <i>Parashat Nitzavim</i> exemplifies this, with its rich, powerful—even revolutionary—concepts that can be used to further the creation of a feminist Judaism.
The parashah begins: “You stand this day, all of you, before your God יהוה—you tribal heads, you elders, and you officials, all the men of Israel, you children, you women, even the stranger within your camp, from woodchopper to water drawer—to enter into the covenant of your God יהוה ” (29:9–11). Let’s take a close look at the language surrounding women. First of all, from the nature of the list, one can pretty safely assume that the women were not tribal leaders, elders, woodchoppers, or water drawers. The crucial fact, however, is that they are included. They are standing before God as full members of the covenantal community. In many other instances in the Torah, only the men are addressed or female inclusion is ambiguous—eclipsed by the nature of the Hebrew language itself, which retains a grammatically masculine form whether addressing or referring to an all-male group or a mixed male and female group.
Secondly, the “women” listed belong to the “you” being addressed. (The word is often translated as “your wives,” as if the women are not part of the “all of you” in v. 9.) But here “women” are not the only ones subject to belonging. Every individual belongs to a household, a clan, a tribe. In the Hebrew Bible, belonging <i>is</i> what constitutes a people. In this particular passage, leadership and power do not set one apart as an autonomous individual. No one, not even the most powerful male tribal leader, stands alone. For better or for worse, everyone is held in an inescapable web of interconnectedness and belonging.
With all of that, one might still dismiss the applicability of the text to us as contemporary women. Yet I believe we should not overlook the value of this text for women “this day” (29:9). Perhaps the historical context can account for some of the dispiriting force of androcentrism. The biblical authors could not imagine women in roles other than daughters who then became wives (or widows, a state also defined by marriage). Women simply were not necessarily visible if they did not fulfill wifely or maternal duties. Here we can summon the traditional concept of “the Torah spoke in the language of human beings” (<i>dibrah torah kilshon b’nei adam).</i> An alternative translation of this saying would be: “The Torah spoke in the language of <i>men.”</i> It is for us, as students of Torah and members of the covenantal people, to help construct our very lives in a way that takes text out of its historical context, out of its male dress or costume, and applies it to our own time. In this way, we redress Torah—and address it to ourselves and our own community, much as the Rabbis who authored the Midrash and Talmud did. It is time to do no less than to dress the Torah in the language of women.
The Torah itself is explicit about the fact that this covenant is not a thing of the past. As 29:13–14 makes clear, this covenant was intended for each one of us in our own time.
The covenant is made not only with those who stood in Moab listening to Moses’ words, but also with future generations. Every Israelite since that day, and every Jew to come into this world in the future, is directly and personally included in this covenant. Thus are we—those reading the Torah now—empowered to forge our own relationship to the contents of the ongoing revelation. The tradition is not fixed; quite the contrary, it is our very active and receptive listening that gives this text its meaning and its very sanctity. The text gains its <i>k’dushah</i> (“holiness”) from those in every generation who read it and add their voices to the endless, sacred conversation about what this all means. If women exclude themselves from that process, the full power, relevancy, and truth of the Torah are diminished.
To underline that point, the Torah itself adds words of encouragement further on in the parashah concerning our ability to apprehend this text: “Surely, this Instruction which I enjoin upon you this day is not too baffling for you, nor is it beyond reach…No, the thing is very close to you, in your mouth and in your heart, to observe it” (30:11, 14). The Torah belongs to every one of us, not just to experts or to certain segments of the community; it does not belong to men alone. As this parashah reminds us, the Torah is far more democratic, fluid, and subjective. We await revelation—and yet revelation is right here, precisely where we stand. “It is not in the heavens…No, the thing is very close to you” (30:12, 14)—exceedingly close.

Vayeilech

 I<small>T WAS THE MOMENT</small> for which Moses had prepared nearly all his life. Reared in Egyptian luxury, mothered by a princess, Moses might have lived out his 120 years in careless splendor, unconcerned with the fate of hordes of Israelite slaves who labored outside his palace. Yet, from the moment that Moses—still a young man—slays the Egyptian taskmaster, he chooses to cast his lot with the slaves. For their sake—and their God’s—Moses spends forty years traversing the wilderness, leading a complaining and defiant people, interceding with an inscrutable and demanding Sovereign, and somehow transforming the despised and oppressed into witnesses of miracles and keepers of revelation. The work is almost finished. God and Moses have brought the people to the edge of the Promised Land, a place Moses will not reach. He will gaze upon it from the heights of Mount Nebo, but he will die before he enters it.
Why will Moses forgo the glorious completion of the task into which he has poured his very life? In <i>parashat Vayeilech,</i> Moses himself explains: “I am now one hundred and twenty years old, I can no longer be active” (31:2). Translated more literally, Moses says, “I can no longer go out and come in.” Either way, the message seems clear: Moses is tired out; he is no longer feeling strong or vigorous. So he will remain on this side of the Jordan River, take a peek at the Promised Land, and then die a peaceful and contented death. It may seem strange that he is willing to miss this crowning achievement; but this appears to be his choice.
Except, of course, that he has not made such a choice. As the verse continues, Moses adds what might seem to be a secondary explanation, an after-thought—yet it contains some crucial information: “Moreover, יהוה has said to me, ‘You shall not go across yonder Jordan’” (31:2).
After all, isn’t this the real reason that Moses will not enter the Promised Land? The Torah itself is quite clear that what Moses had done at a certain point prompted God to forbid him from crossing the Jordan. We read the unequivocal divine decree first in Numbers 20:12. After devoting his life to serving God’s chosen nation, Moses shall not set foot in God’s chosen land.
Moses’ fate is painful, even tragic. Standing before the people he has so steadfastly led, he prepares not to shepherd them triumphantly into the Promised Land, but to install a new leader who will bring them to their destiny. It is, for Moses, a moment of enormous loss. He may speak as if he has a choice—as if he could lead the Israelites into the Land if only he were a little younger, a little stronger—but truly there is no choice at all. He may act as if he has freely decided to stay behind, but it is clear that the choice was made for him.
Today, we like to make our own choices. We live in a time when almost every institution, every career, every level of leadership beckons us. We swell with pride and optimism as we see women serving in the highest echelons of government, in our universities and in our armed forces, as respected doctors, artists, scientists, teachers, philanthropists. We prepare ourselves and our daughters for lives in which every possibility is open to us. We can choose the life we want to live—except when we cannot.
Except when a 14-year-old girl falls prey to our society’s unspoken message to young women—“You are not pretty enough. You are not popular enough. You are not thin enough”—and spends her adolescence battling hateful voices in her head. She may tell you that she chose to watch her weight and eat very little. But in many ways, that choice has been made for her.
Except when a wife endures an abusive relationship, convinced that she is worthless and unable to make her own way in the world. When her husband begins to threaten their children, she finally gathers her courage and flees. Without money or marketable skills, she earns only substandard wages. She may tell you that she chose to go it alone, to work for low pay because she needs a job, to do without health care for herself so that she could provide for her family. But in many ways, that choice has been made for her.
Except when a woman devotes countless eighty-hour workweeks to her career and so is only a year or two away from a prestigious promotion when she and her spouse have a baby. When she returns to the office, her appeals for flexible hours, the chance occasionally to work from home, even a private place to express breast milk, are refused. She may tell you that she chose to quit her job and not work in an unsupportive environment, chose the rewards of at-home motherhood over the rewards of professional life. But in many ways, that choice has been made for her.
We find women all around us submitting to pressures and expectations that undercut our right to choose the life we want to live. And yet, the pressures and the expectations that we encounter are not God’s will. Whereas Moses’ ability to choose his destiny ended when God made known the heavenly decree, our choices should not—must not—be bound by earthly decrees that dishonor and punish women, that teach young girls they are not good enough, that refuse to assist a persecuted victim in need, that force a mother to decide between her career and her child. Acknowledging the injustice of the choices women often face is surely the first step toward changing the pattern.

Ha'Azinu

 P<small>ARASHAT</small> H<small>AAZINU TROUBLES US</small> with its extreme, opposing images of deity. Paradoxically, God is envisioned as comforting and frightening: the eternal guardian of Israel who eventually will redeem the people, and the jealous and judgmental deity who threatens to wreak vengeance on those who violate the covenant and turn to other gods. As Moses maintains, God is the giver of life and death, who heals as well as wounds (32:39–40). Thus, in his song to the Israelites contained in this parashah, Moses includes both a solemn warning that their lives as individuals and a people rest on their observing “faithfully all of the terms of this Teaching” (v. 46) and a final message of hope that God will one day deliver them from their enemies and they will “long endure on the land” given to them by God (v. 47).
As a contemporary reader I am prompted to ask numerous questions. For instance, why, in imagining God as comforter, does Moses use the image of an unmoving, unchanging rock (32:4, 15, 18, 30, 31)? Commentators view the metaphor of the rock as a vehicle for communicating the message that God’s righteousness and loyalty to Israel never waver, or for highlighting the superior, incomparable nature of Israel’s God. However, in spite of how the metaphor is used in the context of the Song, one could just as easily argue that this metaphor imagines God as a cold, unfeeling natural object, incapable of entering into a relationship with anyone or anything.
Moreover, why does Moses describe God anthropomorphically as a warrior whose “flashing blade / And…hand lays holds on judgment” (v. 41)? Where is God’s compassion for God’s people and for their enemies (who, after all, are also God’s creations)? Is it not possible to influence and protect one’s people without ruthless killing or threats of killing? Is the price of our deliverance the death of others?
Several feminists suggest that we respond to these questions by re-imagining our relationship with God. For example, in the place of God as rock or warrior, one might reclaim God as a parent who holds us in his or her arms, cares for us, and feels our pain. Some metaphors in the Song suggest such a perception, as when Moses speaks of God as a nursing mother (v. 13) who went through labor to bring forth Israel (v. 18; see also the indirectly maternal metaphor in Numbers 11:12). Jewish medieval mystics envisioned God as <i>Shechinah,</i> God’s feminine presence who went into exile with the Jewish people, weeping with them and sheltering them in her wings (see <i>Va-eira,</i> Contemporary Reflection). More recently, this image has been invoked by some Jewish feminists. Identifying <i>Shechinah</i> as “She Who Dwells Within,” Rabbi Lynn Gottlieb envisions God as a Being who connects all of life, expresses our longing for wholeness, and like the God of Deuteronomy, ultimately calls us to justice <i>(She Who Dwells Within: A Feminist Vision of a Renewed Judaism,</i> 1995, pp. 25–48).
Some contemporary theologians have insisted that non-anthropomorphic images of God can also be images of intimacy, love, and creation. Marcia Falk, for example, draws on biblical phrases or concepts to “serve as fresh metaphors for Divinity.” She has created new images drawn from traditional Jewish sources and composed of the basic elements of Creation (earth, water, wind, and fire), such as <i>ein hachayim,</i> “well-spring or source of life,” <i>nishmat kol chai,</i> “breath of all living things,” and <i>nitzotzot hanefesh,</i> “sparks of the inner, unseen self.” Through these images, she hopes “to help construct a theology of immanence that will both affirm the sanctity of the world and shatter the idolatrous reign of the lord/God/king” (“Toward a Feminist Jewish Reconstruction of Monotheism,” 1989, pp. 53, 56).
Judith Plaskow pursues a different path. While writing frequently about the importance of new, anthropomorphic images of deity, she maintains that “the traditional image of God as place (<i>makom</i>) evokes both the presence of the world in God and the extraordinary presence of God in particular places.” She continues, “Lacking personal communal images to refer to God, we use this richly ambiguous term to point to community as a special place of God’s self-manifestation” <i>(Standing Again at Sinai,</i> 1990, p. 165).
Viewed within its historical context, the God imagery of <i>parashat Haazinu</i> is understandable, even justifiable (see Another View). But its problematic vision for our time encourages us to create new images of the Deity that make the poem’s underlying messages concerning the nature of God and the relationship between God and the Jewish people more compelling. This leads us to ask: What can we derive from <i>parashat Haazinu</i>? How else does it speak to us today? How can these images lead us to greater responsibility?
One clue may lie in the mention of Sodom and Gomorrah in v. 32. As part of the announcement of the punishment in store for Israel’s enemies, this verse states: “Ah! The vine for them is from Sodom, / From the vineyards of Gomorrah.” Through the metaphors in this verse, the Song maligns the nations as corrupt and foreshadows their fate. This calls to mind when God threatens to destroy those cities, prompting Abraham to protest: “Must not the Judge of all the earth do justly?” (Genesis 18:25). Perhaps <i>parashat Haazinu</i> can be seen as an invitation for us to act like Abraham and protest against what seems to be an indiscriminate, wholesale destruction. It is an opportunity to raise questions such as: Where is Your compassion, God, not only toward us but toward all of Your creation? Why frighten us with your threats? Will such threats make us abandon other deities or, just as likely, will they lead us to reject You? Such questions express what it means to be covenantal partners, willing to challenge God. Thus, beyond protesting against what we now deem unacceptable, this parashah can prompt us to examine who we mean by God. It also can remind us of what is required in order to create a just society and uphold a covenantal relationship.

V'Zot HaBerachah

 M<small>OSES’ FINAL BLESSING</small> to the tribes of Israel forms the coda for the five books of the Torah traditionally attributed to Moses. Often in Deuteronomy, Moses has admonished the people of Israel, sometimes threatening or even bullying them. Throughout the book, however, he also has offered the people blessings and a vision of God’s love and potential rewards. Now, at the very end, Moses fills the people with hope and promise as he speaks to their best selves. As the greatest of teachers, Moses puts into words what they instinctively know they long for but cannot quite articulate.
Moses and Israel began together as an erstwhile prince leading a band of slaves to freedom. Now, the people Israel are not only free, but also they are about to be responsible for their own lives in their own land. As they become a sovereign people, Moses (as it were) stitches them together, tribe after tribe, weaving a dramatic finale: “Thus Israel dwells in safety, / Untroubled is Jacob’s abode” (33:28). This stunning statement confirms the Israelites’ greatest hope, as well as ours today, envisioning a time even beyond the battles that lie ahead, when they finally will live in security and safety.
This parashah contains Moses’ last blessing, indeed his last words to the entire people, one nation with many attributes and possibilities. Our Jewish religious tradition of blessings is not one of passive acceptance or recognition; instead, blessings demand action. This is why, for the most part, we recite a blessing before we carry out an action.
Some say that the Hebrew word for blessing (<i>b’rachah)</i> shares the same root as the word for knee (<i>berech</i>), as in “bend the knee.” (Although there are scholars who dispute that theory, certainly our rabbis delighted in such wordplays.) When we recite a blessing, we bend ever so slightly, diminishing ourselves so as to affirm the Other and look deep into ourselves. Through prayer, we express our gratitude, ask for more blessings, and strive to reach beyond our present limitations. Acknowledging that which is not necessarily in our control, we hope for God’s gifts of a healthy, secure, and bountiful life, a life of purpose and meaning. This is Moses’ <i>b’rachah</i> to us, then and now: to gather the best within and around ourselves so as to fulfill the “promise” of the Promised Land.
After Moses blesses the tribes, he then stands atop Mount Nebo and surveys the entire land. Viewing the Negev and the valley of Jericho—city of date palms—south to Zoar, perhaps Moses is able to discard all the what if’s, should have’s, maybe’s, and if only’s. Perhaps he feels some sense of closure, an acceptance of what he could and could not accomplish in a lifetime. There is a certain humility in knowing our limits and recognizing when it is time to move on.
Part of Moses’ blessing involves the ability to dream of what he will not see or experience directly. Affirming the future is what leadership is all about: knowing and accepting that our best dreams may be realized by others who come after us. Moses’ words remind us that we need to pray and work for the blessings of justice, equality, and peace in order to fulfill our promise as individuals and to build the best family, community, society, and country that we can. We learn from Moses that sometimes we have to scale mountains in order to come closer to these blessings.
The late Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. invoked the scene on Mount Nebo in the famous speech he delivered in Memphis the day before he was assassinated (1968). He said: “Well, I don’t know what will happen now. We’ve got some difficult days ahead. But it doesn’t matter with me now. Because I’ve been to the mountaintop. And I don’t mind. Like anybody, I would like to live a long life. Longevity has its place. But I’m not concerned about that now. I just want to do God’s will. And He’s allowed me to go up to the mountain. And I’ve looked over. And I’ve seen the promised land. I may not get there with you. But I want you to know tonight, that we, as a people, will get to the promised land” (“I See the Promised Land,” April 3, 1968). This speech turned out to be Dr. King’s last. Like Moses, his final words were a blessing for justice and peace in the service of God. This legacy of hope and vision of who we can and must become urges us on, reminding us of the dreams that remain for us to actualize.
Whenever we finish a book of the Torah in the synagogue’s cycle of readings, those who are present respond immediately with three words: <i>Chazak, chazak, v’nitchazek!</i> “Be strong, be strong [in the singular] and we will be strong [in the plural].” My late father, Rabbi Wolfe Kelman, taught: Why do we say <i>chazak</i> twice, when once would be enough? It is to tell us that if you and I each are strong, then together we are even stronger. In other words, this is a true “win/win” situation: I need you to be strong so I can be strong too.
My father’s lesson is especially true for the Jewish people today. As Jewish women, we need to be strong so that we can experience and contribute to the fullness of our Jewish tradition. Women’s entry into the leadership of Jewish life and their involvement in every aspect of communal, religious, and intellectual life is the blessing of the last 30 years. Women have opened new vistas, introduced innovations in every vital sphere of Jewish living, and empowered themselves and their daughters and granddaughters. The Jewish world has been profoundly reshaped; yet there is still a way to go. Future generations of women must continue to redefine family and work, renew ritual, scale new horizons of scholarship, write liturgy and poetry, and make music, all the while recreating the Jewish community and its structures. The Jewish people can only be strong when it embraces all of its members; it takes the involvement of both Jewish women and Jewish men to make our community fuller and more vibrant.
Thus, the reading of the Torah ends with blessings and the charge to strengthen ourselves and our community. Moses teaches us to reach for blessings for ourselves and others, to strive for the humility to know our task, and to dream of how to transform what <i>is</i> to what <i>can be.</i>

Genesis



Chapter 1



Verse 1

<i>The First Creation Story</i>
CREATION OF WORLD, TIME, AND LIFE (1:1–2:3)
Genesis 1 unfolds in a rhythmic, poetic fashion, depicting an orderly creation of the world and life in six days. Genesis does not offer a scientific account of creation but an interpretation and a systerm of values that encodes from the start three essential ideas: the power of language, especially God’s word; the goodness of God’s world; and the orderly nature of the world. Creating the world begins with a series of separations—from chaos to differentiated bodies—that, with one exception (day 2), are pronounced as “good.” In the first three days God creates a context for life. In the last three God creates heavenly and earthly bodies to inhabit the space. The movement of each day, from evening to morning, replicates a journey from darkness to light.
<b><i>When God was about to create.</i></b> The more familiar expression “In the beginning” has been replaced by the more accurate translation. As Rashi noted, the opening verses do not claim creation out of nothing.

Verse 2

<b><i>chaotic waters’.</i></b> The feminine noun <i>t’hom</i>, often translated as “the deep,” echoes the name of the Mesopotamian goddess Tiamat. According to the Babylonian creation myth, Tiamat was brutally killed by her rebellious offspring in the process of creating the world. See also at 7:11, “great deep.”

Verse 3

<b><i>God said.</i></b> God’s use of language contrasts with some other ancient Near East creation stories that emphasize battles among the gods. By privileging language as a source of creative power, the Torah identifies tools for renewal in times of military defeat.
<b><i>“Let there be light!”</i></b> As the first of God’s creative acts, light becomes not only a physical phenomenon but also a symbol of clarity and illumination that extend beyond the physical.

Verse 4

<b><i>God saw how good.</i></b> This phrase repeats in similar form six times in this passage, expressing the basic goodness of God’s creation.
<b><i>God divided</i></b> God brings order out of chaos by separating the swirling mass into coherent bodies (land, contained water, sky), which will provide a habitat and sustenance for life.

Verse 26

<b><i>26–30.</i></b> Day six, the most complex and detailed, first describes the emergence of land creatures from the earth (vv. 24–25). Thus far, each species has been endowed with the capacity of reproduction and renewal (vv. 12, 21, 25). The narration now dwells the most on the creation of humankind (vv. 26–27), indicating its importance in the created realm.
<b><i>“Let us make.”</i></b> God is speaking to the divine entourage; compare Genesis 6:4 and Job 1:6, which envision <i>b’nei Elohim</i> (literally “sons of God”) as divine beings subordinate to God.
<b><i>“human beings.</i></b>” Heb. <i>adam</i>, a singular noun, stands here for a collective, like the English words “fish” or “fowl.” It refers to humankind as a whole, including both females and males (compare 5:1–2). Older translations render it as “man,” often meant in its gender-neutral sense—a usage that is sometimes misunderstood and thereby misleading. In fact, the noun <i>adam</i> is almost always a generic term, employed when gender is not germane. Apart from the thirty references to the particular <i>adam</i> of the Eden story (who gives rise to the name “Adam”) and one to the progenitor of a lineage (Joshua 14:15), none of the Bible’s 530 other occurrences of <i>adam</i> refers to a particular individual (David Stein, “What Does It Mean to Be a ‘Man’?” 2006–7, § VI:B; <i>“adam,” Semantic Dictionary of Biblical Hebrew</i>, 2007; Alison Grant, <i>“’adam</i> and <i>’ish:</i> Man in the OT,” 1977, pp. 5, 11).
Here, the preceding verses have narrated the generic creation of other earthly creatures, a context that now evokes the correspondingly generic sense of <i>adam.</i> Thus, the Hebrew text unambiguously presents female and male as co-created and equal.
<b><i>“our image, after our likeness.”</i></b> These tantalizing attributes are uniquely bestowed upon human-kind as a whole. They introduce a new way for the divine to be manifested in the world through every human being. The notion that all humans are in the divine image is in sharp contrast to ancient Near East traditions where only kings represent the divine. This radical idea from the Hebrew Bible proved to be a fundamental notion in Western history.
<b><i>“hold sway.”</i></b> See at 1:28 and 9:1–7.

Verse 27

<b><i>human beings.</i></b> This translation resorts to the plural to avoid using misleading masculine pronouns later in the verse. Literally the Hebrew has: “And God created the <i>adam.</i> In the image of God he created <u>him/it</u>; male and female he created <u>them</u>” (shifting the object pronoun from singular to plural). By referring to <i>adam,</i> the text is not describing an individual but a new class of beings that comprises female and male from the start, both of them in God’s image. This idea is repeated more clearly in 5:1-2. The shift from singular to plural does not convey that man was created before woman. (That the singular pronoun is masculine can be explained as necessary for grammatical gender agreement in the Hebrew language.) Rather, it seems to say that our humanity, as <i>adam,</i> precedes our division into sexual categories. Our humanity comes first; our sexual identity next.
<b><i>male and female.</i></b> This passage explicitly proclaims the co-creation of female and male, both in God’s image. It establishes the goodness and gender balance as the foundation for all that follows. The terms male (<i>zachar</i>) and female (<i>n’kevah</i>) designate biological categories, thus relevant to fertility, a major theme in this passage. The word <i>zachar</i> evokes the Hebrew word for “remembering,” and <i>n’kevah</i> evokes the word for being pierced.

Verse 28

<b><i>God then blessed them.</i></b> Female and male receive the same blessings.
<b><i>“Be fruitful and multiply.”</i></b> The harsh conditions and the fragility of life in the ancient world make fertility a most valued gift and necessity. The plain sense of the text is that this “first commandment” is issued to both female and male.
<b><i>“hold sway.”</i></b> This promise surely brought comfort to early readers who lived at the mercy of the natural world, who were vulnerable to its unpredictability, and who had reason to fear becoming prey to wild beasts. It is not a mandate to exploit nature. See 9:1-7 where this dominion is altered.

Verse 29

<b><i>“I have given you,”</i></b> See at 9:2–4.

Verse 30



Verse 31

<b><i>it was very good.</i></b> The final survey, which affirms the goodness of all that God has created, comes only after humankind appears.

Chapter 2



Verse 1



Verse 2

<b><i>the seventh day.</i></b> The number seven in the Bible signifies completeness. Only the seventh day, not yet designated as Shabbat, is holy. Time, not space, is thus consecrated, which (as A. J. Heschel notes) becomes a hallmark of Judaism. The sequence from lesser to greater, culminating with the Sabbath, is relevant to assessing the creation of woman. Last does not mean least in Genesis.

Verse 3



Verse 4

<i>The Second Creation Story</i>
FROM THE “HUMAN” TO “WOMAN AND MAN” (2:4–25)
Genesis 2 offers a second perspective on creation, focusing on humankind. Genesis is unique in ancient Near Eastern literature in giving special attention to the formation of woman. In Greece, however, Hesiod (8th century <small>B.C.E.</small>) claimed that the first woman, Pandora, was created to ensnare men to their death. In contrast, Genesis 2 envisions the creation of woman and man for mutual benefit: “It is not good for the <i>adam</i> to be alone” (2:18). In contrast to Genesis 1, here the gender identity of the first <i>adam</i> is ambiguous (see at “the man,” v. 7); therefore, the status of woman in Genesis 2 remains open to different interpretations.
Many Jews and Christians over the centuries have interpreted the early portions of Genesis to mean that woman was secondary and thus subordinate, created merely for man’s benefit. Three factors argue against such interpretations. (<i>1</i>) The term <i>adam</i> is generic, not specifically “a man,” complicating the notion of the gender identity of the first person. (<i>2</i>) Even if one interprets this particular <i>adam</i> as male, last does not mean least. (Indeed, in Genesis 1 human beings are created last, a sequence that some interpreters consider a sign of superiority.) (<i>3</i>) God creates human partnership, not hierarchy, in Genesis 2. (For a different interpretation, see Contemporary Reflection.)
THE FIRST HUMAN (2:4–7)
This verse bridges the text’s first two units. (The present translation places it with the second one.) Its first clause concludes the first story of Creation, and its second begins the story that follows.
<b><i>.יהוה</i></b> The first time in the Bible that God’s name—<i>YHVH,</i> liturgically read as <i>Adonai</i>—appears. Later traditions consider this name to represent specific qualities of God, such as compassion (in contrast to the term “God,” which emphasizes justice). Most translations use “the L<small>ORD</small>” (so the New JPS) or “the Eternal” (<i>The Torah: A Modern Commentary,</i> revised edition). Some translations have used “Jehovah” or “Yahweh” in an attempt to capture the sound of the name. Like <i>The Contemporary Torah</i> (2006), we have chosen to retain the original Hebrew name. In the post-biblical period, Jews came to believe that God’s name is too sacred to be pronounced. This has led to substituting the reverential euphemism <i>Adonai</i> (a grander form of the word for “my Lord”) for God’s actual name. The name itself shows no marks of gender. Some scholars have understood it as a form of the verb “to be,” although this explanation is now disputed and far from certain. An abbreviated form of the name appears as “Yah” in names (Jeremiah) or words such as “Hallelujah.” (See also at Exodus 3:15.)

Verse 5

<b><i>there was not a soul.</i></b> Literally, “no <i>adam</i>” —no human being.

Verse 6



Verse 7

<b><i>man…from the soil</i></b>. Or, “soul…from the soil,” to express the word play between <i>adamah</i> (soil; earth) and <i>adam</i> (a human being, an “earthling”). In contrast to Genesis 1, <i>adam</i> is created before the animals and set in a fertile place to care for it.
<i><b>God…breathed</b></i>. The human being is infused with divine breath (literally “in-spired”).
<i><b>breath.</b></i> Heb. <i>n’shamah,</i> often translated as “soul,” is the life force that comes from God.
<i><b>man.</b></i> Heb. <i>adam,</i> which can be rendered as “human beings,” as it is translated in Genesis 1:26–27 and 5:1–2. In those verses and elsewhere in the Bible, <i>adam</i> designates a generic human being or a collective noun but sometimes refers also to an individual person, as here.
However, in the present case <i>adam</i> is ambiguous with respect to gender. On the one hand, <i>adam</i> may continue to convey an inclusive sense of the term (as in 1:26–27); this would imply that this second story of creation views the first human as either neuter or androgynous until the division into man and woman, at which point specific words for man <i>(ish)</i> and woman (<i>ishah</i>) appear for the first time (2:23–24). Such a gender-neutral or non-gendered progenitor of humankind was familiar to the ancient world. It appears, for example, in Plato’s <i>Symposium,</i> which describes humans as not gendered initially but divided later into three types of pairs: man and woman; man and man; woman and woman. The myth thus accounts for different sexual affinities as persons seek their specific “other half.” On the other hand, <i>ha-adam</i> (“the adam”) in 2:7–3:30 designates a particular individual whom the early readers may have understood as male. David Stein suggests that <i>ha-adam</i> in this story functions as an etiology “not of human biology but rather of lineage” (<i>The Contemporary Torah,</i> 2006, p. 394). This presumption works well with the narrative flow—in which even after the creation of woman, the term <i>ha-adam</i> continues to be used to refer to the man. On those grounds, he renders <i>ha-adam</i> as “the Human” while using male pronouns.
These gender ambiguities may express the writer’s attempt to express complex ideas about the position of male and female in God’s plan, and the tension perceived in cultural reality. Although the precise intention remains unclear, this story certainly presents—as Phyllis Bird notes—“a portrait of humankind in which the two sexes are essential to the action and are bound together in mutual dependence” (“Bone of My Bones and Flesh of My Flesh,” <i>Theology Today</i> 50/4 [1994], p. 524).
In this verse, the immediate emphasis falls on the person’s earthiness: the word <i>adam</i> is juxtaposed with <i>adamah,</i> which means “earth.”

Verse 8

HUMANKIND’S FIRST HOME:
THE GARDEN OF EDEN (2:8–17)
<b><i>a garden in Eden.</i></b> The place name <i>eden</i> (pleasure) evokes a moist, luxurious garden.

Verse 9

<b><i>good for fruit.</i></b> The Hebrew words <i>maachal</i> (fruit, literally “food”) and <i>achal</i> (eat) together appear more than twenty times in the Eden narrative, evidence of an overriding concern among the text’s earliest audience with procuring food.
<i><b>Tree of All Knowledge.</b></i> The familiar, literal translations “knowledge of good and evil” or “knowledge of good and bad” preserve an ambiguity that seems intentional. The phrase “good and bad” could stand for “everything,” but it also could imply intellectual comprehension (everything from <i>A</i> to <i>Z,</i> or from good to bad), moral judgment, or —perhaps best—experience, meaning a direct encounter with good and bad. It is the latter that seems to have befallen humankind as a result of eating. Elsewhere, “to know” refers to intimate, often sexual relations (see at 4:1).

Verse 10

<b><i>10–14.</i></b> The four <b>rivers</b> express the superabundance of the garden. In the land of Israel, water was a scarce and precious commodity. The names recall actual rivers but the locations of some is problematic. Pishon and Gihon are small rivers in the land of Israel.

Verse 11



Verse 12



Verse 13



Verse 14



Verse 15



Verse 16



Verse 17

<b><i>you may not eat.</i></b> The momentous prohibition concerns only the tree of knowledge.

Verse 18

THE CREATION OF HUMAN PARTNERSHIP (2:18–25)
<b><i>“It is not good.”</i></b> God proclaims (discovers?!) the first “not good”: human isolation.
<i><b>“man.”</b></i> Heb. <i>adam;</i> see at v. 7, “the man.” <i><b>“helpmate.”</b></i> Heb. <i>ezer k’negdo,</i> literally “a helper as if opposite [or: in front of] him/it,” that is, “a helpful counterpart.” In the Bible the word <i>ezer</i> (helper) typically refers to God and thus lacks any overtone of inferiority. And <i>negdo</i> (opposite him/it) suggests a spatial and metaphorical otherness, someone whom one confronts. Psalm 16:8 envisions God in this position, illustrating the positive sense of the word.
Some scholars who assume that God seeks a remedy for human loneliness conclude that God creates woman to comfort and ease man’s life. But God’s solution implies that what is not good about aloneness concerns the human need for a counterpart. Since the <i>adam</i> both is inferior to God and superior to the animals, neither suffices as a partner. Only an equal who is both “other” and “alike” provides the necessary dialogue for human maturation, meaning, and joy.

Verse 19



Verse 20

 The first human task is naming the world. God’s unsuccessful experiment to discover a partner reveals God as one who learns from experience in the interaction with humankind, not one who foresees and plans all with precision.

Verse 21

<b><i>ribs.</i></b> The word more accurately means “sides,” meaning a more substantial part of the <i>adam.</i> Elsewhere in the Bible, the term typically designates a side of a building, a large section necessary for stability.

Verse 22



Verse 23

<b><i>the man.</i></b> Although the word <i>ha-adam</i> (“the <i>adam”)</i> is still utilized here, context indicates a reference to the male. It will be used that way until 3:22, when the inclusive, generic sense—the human being—briefly resumes.
<i><b>“This time.”</b></i> Human encounter elicits human speech. The man’s exclamation is poetic, celebrating both similarity and difference.
<i><b>“Let this one be called.</b></i>” This is not an act of naming or domination but rather an acknowledgement and interpretation of the man’s perception.
<i><b>“woman…taken from man.”</b></i> Only after surgery in Genesis 2 do woman (<i>ishah</i>) and man <i>(ish)</i> appear, marked by gender-specific terms. If one understands <i>ha-adam</i> (“the <i>adam”)</i> beforehand to refer to a non-gendered person, then this remark describes the division into two human categories: woman and man. Here <i>ish</i> designates “a (male) member of the human species,” and <i>ishah</i> “a (female) member of the human species.” Both are fully and equally human. The man’s proclamation indicates what the woman means to him; it also serves as an etiology to explain how women and men are related to each other. In addition, the etiology explains why <i>ishah</i> and <i>ish</i> sound so much alike.

Verse 24

<b><i>a man will leave his father and mother.</i></b> Typically in biblical texts, women join their husband’s household. Most likely this statement does not refer to a man’s residence but to his establishing a new alignment, with the couple as a new unity that supersedes the relation to parents. In the ancient world such a separation from a man’s parents frees the woman from the control of her husband’s family.
<i><b>wife.</b></i> Heb. <i>ishah.</i> The Hebrew word for “wife” is identical to the word for “woman” (v. 23).

Verse 25

Nakedness describes the human couple’s ease with their bodies—and sets the stage for the next scene in the garden.

Chapter 3



Verse 1

<i>Temptation, Transgression, Transformation</i>
IN THE GARDEN OF EDEN (3:1–24)
Genesis 3, one of the most controversial passages in the Bible, seeks to explain why a wholly good world, created by a caring God, is nonetheless rife with hardship and inequality. It resolves the problem by placing responsibility on humankind. In this drama, woman plays a leading role. Yet she and her mate are equally held responsible.
The story reflects two possible theologies about God and knowledge. God may be perceived as a protective parent, ambivalent about exposing vulnerable humans to the full range of experience that knowledge brings; but God could be understood also as a protector of divine prerogatives against the human desire to have more than is permitted. Either way, the story also cautions about the danger of “premature knowledge”—a message especially pertinent to our own day, where knowledge (as information) is easily separable from maturity.
Although most later interpreters have made this story of transgression the turning point in human events, in Genesis this is but the first of several encounters between God and human beings in which both sides learn about the perils and possibilities of the human condition. There is no mention of an original sin, perpetually present in humankind. The word “sin” does not appear here at all in this episode. Nowhere does the writer imply that humanity is doomed to make bad choices. There is no “Fall of Man.” Nor does God curse humankind. Rather, the story makes clear that transgression, namely disobedience, carries consequences.
TEMPTATION AND TRANSGRESSION (3:1–6)
<b><i>serpent.</i></b> Its role here is perhaps a polemic against other traditions, where serpents—representing healing wisdom—become objects of idolatry. Compare the bronze serpent in Numbers 21:6–9 and its destruction in II Kings 18:4. (Note also the ancient roots of our modern medical symbol, the caduceus, with its intertwined serpents.)
<i><b>cunning.</b></i> The word (in the singular here) is the same as the one for “naked” in 2:25, one of several puns that run through the narrative.
<i><b>“Did God really say…?”</b></i> The Hebrew is ambiguous, but the intent is clear: a question to draw attention to the one prohibited tree.
<i><b>“You may not.”</b></i> The “you” is plural, including the man who (according to 3:6) is with her. Why the man remains silent is left to the reader’s imagination.

Verse 2



Verse 3

<b><i>“God said.”</i></b> The woman is the first human to speak of God and to engage in dialogue. She will invoke God in almost every one of her statements (also 4:1, 25). In contrast, the man does not mention God in his speeches.
<i><b>“do not [even] touch it.”</b></i> God does not prohibit touching the tree in 2:17. If the woman adds this element herself, she anticipates the Rabbis whose rulings later create a “fence around the Torah,” meaning additional prohibitions to prevent an accidental violation of Torah laws.

Verse 4

<b><i>“You…will not die!”</i></b> The woman and man live long after their transgression.

Verse 5

<b><i>“God knows…you will be like gods.”</i></b> This new information will prove true—God confirms it in v. 22. Those who criticize the woman argue that the wish to be like God—a usurpation of divine power—prompts her to transgress God’s command. The next verse, however, debunks this claim by offering a rare biblical description of a person’s motive. Hers includes a desire for wisdom.
<i><b>“all things.”</b></i> Literally, “good and bad.” See at 2:9.

Verse 6

<b><i>the woman saw.</i></b> Genesis lists three reasons why the woman reaches for the fruit: it is good to eat (healthful); visually attractive; and a source for wisdom. (No motive is ascribed to the man. He will simply take and eat.) The desire for knowledge, rather than immortality, distinguishes this story from other ancient traditions such as Gilgamesh.
<i><b>its fruit.</b></i> The type is not identified; the fig is the only kind of tree specified in the story (v. 7). Some later traditions championed the apple, which has since come to the fore in the popular imagination.
<i><b>she gave…to her man who was with her.</b></i> Only now does the reader learn that the man was with the woman all along (note also “<i>her</i> man”). The silence concerning the man’s motive is all the more problematic if he (alone) was directly warned by God in 2:17. Most earlier translations unfortunately omit “with her,” letting readers assume that the man was ignorant of the exchange and thereby innocent. Genesis, however, portrays both woman and man as culpable. The woman takes the first step toward what modern interpreters call consciousness-raising. If the tree entails “knowing all things,” then woman is bringer of civilization, not death. As for giving the fruit to the man, Carol Meyers observes that this reflects Israelite agrarian families, where women doled out the food. Note the emphasis on eating in this etiological tale. (See <i>Discovering Eve: Ancient Israelite Woman in Context,</i> 1988.)

Verse 7

THE TRANSFORMATION (3:7–21) The four relationships that constitute the human being—with the land, the animals, each other, and God—suffer a severe blow but prove enduring nevertheless.
<b><i>they were naked.</i></b> As the serpent promised, their eyes open, leading to a new awareness.
<i><b>made themselves skirts.</b></i> Possibly modesty and shame resulted from eating the fruit. At any rate, knowledge discloses to them their vulnerability, exposing them to the precariousness of life and to consequent fear.

Verse 8



Verse 9

<b><i>“Where are you?”</i></b> God’s first question is more than a mere request for location; it is an opportunity to accept responsibility.

Verse 10

<b><i>“I was afraid because I was naked”</i></b> The fear could imply a moral awareness stemming from transgression, an awareness of vulnerability, or both.

Verse 11



Verse 12

<b><i>“The woman whom You gave me.”</i></b> An opportunity for repentance (“I did so, and I am sorry”) is used instead for double blame: the man blames the woman and also God. As a result of his refusal to accept responsibility, his disobedience alienates him from both God and the woman.

Verse 13

<b><i>“The serpent tricked me.”</i></b> The woman likewise shifts the blame, but not to God.

Verse 14

<b><i>“you…are under a curse.</i></b>” While all three culprits pay a price for their transgression (and the humans’ unwillingness to own up to it), only the serpent is explicitly cursed. The narrator presents God as one who considers the serpent the most culpable. This emphasis is overlooked by later interpreters who focus on the woman as cause.

Verse 15

<b><i>“between you and the woman.”</i></b> Enmity destroys a harmony between humankind and animals.

Verse 16

 God’s words to the woman have been misinterpreted in ways that disadvantaged women dramatically. The pronouncements to the woman (v. 16) and to the man (v. 17) are largely parallel, which implies parallel consequences. But for several centuries the key term has been typically rendered one way regarding the woman and another regarding the man, in a manner that intensifies the punishment for the woman, prompting the claim that her culpability must have been greater than the man’s.
<i><b>“your toil and your pregnancies.</b></i>” Older translations and some recent ones translate this pair of nouns differently. The New JPS version has “your pangs in childbirth,” and Chaim Stern’s translation of Genesis in <i>The Torah: A Modem Commentary,</i> revised edition, has “your pains of pregnancy.” (This verse and the next are the only places in this book where we have changed Stern’s translation.) The Hebrew noun <i>itzavon</i> (from <i>etzev</i>), is here translated as “toil.” In ancient Israel women regularly worked long hours—in food preparation and storage, in the manufacture of clothing, in farming alongside of men, and more. For the Torah’s original audience, this story would have brought such labors readily to mind. The word can also be rendered as either “sorrow,” “hardship,” or “anguish.” All these meanings appear elsewhere in Genesis (for example, “hard labor,” 5:29). Indeed, <i>itzavon</i> does not mean “pain” elsewhere in the Bible. For more details, see Another View.
The writer in vv. 16–17 is accounting for the hardships of human existence and especially the creative aspects of life: procreation and production of food. Earlier ease is now mingled with hardship: “good” comes with “bad.” <i><b>“anguish.</b></i>” The word here is <i>etzev,</i> a term related to <i>itzavon</i> in the previous line; it predominantly means “sorrow.” Those whose experience is conveyed by <i>etzev</i> include: God, when humankind does not meet expectations (Genesis 6:6); Jonathan, when his father humiliates him (I Samuel 20:34); and David, when his son dies (II Samuel 19:3). Most instances of this verb in narrative pertain to sorrow in connection with family members.
Our translation as “anguish” rather than “toil” (as for <i>itzavon</i>) aims at differentiating the nuances between two related Hebrew terms. (The King James Version of 1611, which has been authoritative for centuries in English-speaking countries, translates both <i>etzev</i> and <i>itzavon</i> as “sorrow.” Other translations, including Chaim Stern’s, substituted forms of “pain” for “sorrow,” presumably in recognition that childbirth is often painful.)
Genesis 3:16 neither imposes physical pain upon the woman nor condones it. The passage describes the hardship that often accompanies birthing and raising children. Unlike the pronouncements to the serpent, which speak of perpetual enmity, nothing suggests that this <i>etzev</i> is a continual condition. Thus along with her joy in being a parent (4:1), the first woman will herself experience—and express—sorrow and the need for comfort after her first-born kills his brother (4:25). On the etiological function of this pronouncement, see Another View.
<i><b>“desire.”</b></i> Heb. <i>t’shukah</i>. The word appears only three times in the entire Bible—twice in Genesis (see also 4:7) and once in Song of Songs (7:11). Here it acknowledges woman’s desire or passion. It may seek to account for why women are able and willing to overcome (or overlook) the hardship of childbirth. It may also suggest that the woman’s desire is what places the woman under the man’s control; compare God’s warning in 4:7. (Song of Songs, which celebrates equality and mutuality between man and woman, reverses the relationship, describing in 7:11 the man’s desire for the woman.)
<i><b>“he shall rule over you,”</b></i> God’s words should not be read (as they have in both Jewish and Christian traditions) as an unqualified mandate for males’ general control over females. In this verse, “ruling” is confined to situations in which desire is at work. The writer may be communicating the power of desire to make one person subservient to another.
Another view is that in the ancient context the writer acknowledges a husband’s responsibility for his wife’s sexuality.

Verse 17

<b><i>“Because you hearkened to your wife.”</i></b> Literally, “…to your wife’s voice.” In 21:12 God will command Abraham to hearken to his wife’s voice; thus this notice is not meant as a blanket objection to obeying one’s wife. Oddly, there is no indication earlier that the woman said anything to the man.
<i><b>“I commanded you,”</b></i> God accuses only the man of disobedience (the “you” is singular).
<i><b>“the soil is now cursed”</b></i> The land has done nothing to deserve punishment. But for Israelite farmers the etiology explained why their land was not fertile. Again, neither the woman nor the man is cursed.
<i><b>“toil”</b></i> Heb. <i>itzavon;</i> see at 3:16. Initially, working the land was presented as creative and satisfying labor, and now it also becomes a hardship.

Verse 18



Verse 19

<b><i>to dust.</i></b> Presumably, eating from the Tree of Life would have enabled them to live forever.

Verse 20

<b><i>The man called his wife’s name.</i></b> In the Bible names often disclose the hopes and reality of the naming person, not the named. The man, significantly, becomes aware of the woman as a source of life precisely when the prospect of death is made comprehensible. Faced with inevitable disintegration, he recognizes–and celebrates–her life-bearing ability.
<i><b>Eve.</b></i> Heb. <i>Chavah</i>, a play on <i>chai</i> (life). The narrator explains the word-play and accounts for the woman’s role as child-bearer. The designation confirms the text’s positive depiction of the woman’s role in Eden and beyond.

Verse 21

<b><i>God…clothed them.</i></b> Far from displaying anger, God appears as a concerned protector, re placing the couple’s flimsy covering with sturdy material. Such solicitude indicates God’s continued commitment.

Verse 22

THE EXPULSION (3:22–24)
<b><i>“the humans.”</i></b> Literally, “the <i>adam,”</i> the singular generic term referring to both woman and man. Whatever the ambiguity of the term beginning with 2:7, where it could refer to “the man,” here it is an inclusive category.
<i><b>“are like us.”</b></i> The serpent’s words in 3:5 are confirmed. On the plural “us,” see at 1:26.
<i><b>“knowing all things.”</b></i> See at 2:9 and 2:17.
<i><b>“they may even.”</b></i> Anticipating more dire consequences, God bars human beings from the Tree of Life, the source of perpetual renewal.

Verse 23



Verse 24

<b><i>the humans.</i></b> Literally, “the <i>adam,”</i> referring to the woman and the man.
<i><b>stationing Cherubim.</b></i> These mythological creatures appear elsewhere as God’s entourage. Their sculpted form decorates the holy ark (Exodus 25:18). The gateway to the garden is closed, but the world has opened up.

Chapter 4



Verse 1

<i>Life Outside the Garden</i> (4:1–6:8)
EVE AND ADAM REUNITE: CHILDBIRTH AND NAMING (4:1–2)
Most readers pay little attention to Eve and Adam once they leave the garden. But here, in fact, the Torah gives new, important lessons. The first couple turns back—not back to the garden, but to one another and to God. The man who earlier blamed the woman now enters into an intimate relationship with her, and the woman names their first child in honor of her partnership with God. With these halting steps, they begin to repair the damage of earlier acts.
<b><i>The man now was intimate with his wife.</i></b> Literally, “the <i>adam</i> knew his woman/wife.” Here <i>adam</i> can only mean the man. In Hebrew “to know” includes sexual intercourse; fundamentally it expresses intimate knowledge of the other.
<i><b>saying.</b></i> The woman is the one who names the children and records the history and meaning of the family’s life, both here and again after the death of Abel (see at 4:25).
<b><i>“Both I and</i> יהוה.”</b> Eve is the very first human being to use God’s personal name, just as she was the first human to mention God (3:3).
<i><b>“made a man.”</b></i> Commentators consider this “man” a reference to the son—whose name, Cain (<i>kayin</i>), is a pun on “made” (<i>kaniti</i>). If so, then Eve acknowledges here that giving birth involves God and celebrates the mystery of female creativity. However, Eve could also be referring to her husband as one who became hers with God’s help. The verb <i>k-n-h</i> elsewhere often means “acquired” and typically refers to a man acquiring a wife (see Ruth 4:10). In a surprising reversal here, the woman is acquiring “a man.”

Verse 2

<b><i>his brother Abel.</i></b> The name Abel (<i>hevel</i>) means “mist” or “vapor,” hinting at transience.

Verse 3

THE FIRST SIN: CAIN AND ABEL (4:3–24) In the Torah, the word “sin” only enters with sibling rivalry and the murder that follows (not with Eve and Adam). Murderous conflict among brothers runs throughout Genesis as a theme that finally finds its resolution with the reconciliation between Joseph and his brothers (Genesis 50). Sisterly conflicts result in births (see 30:1–24). | In an ancient Sumerian story about the goddess Inanna, a farmer and shepherd compete for her affection; and she chooses to marry the shepherd. Competition between two modes of life may also account for this story in Genesis. The emphasis on “brother,” which appears seven times in this narrative, may be a literary ploy, a way to say that all humans are “brothers” and thus all murder is “fratricide.”

Verse 4

<b><i>4–5.</i></b> No reason is given for God’s acceptance of Abel’s offering and not Cain’s.

Verse 5



Verse 6

<b><i>“Would you not do well to lift it?”</i></b> The Hebrew is difficult. What seems clear is that God urges Cain to control the temptation to succumb to sin.
<i><b>“sin is a demon.”</b></i> Or “sin is crouching.” The image is of a personified evil ready to pounce; it is external to humans.
<i><b>“you are the one it craves / and yet you can govern it.”</b></i> The sentence echoes closely God’s pronouncement to the woman in 3:16. The idea is similar: the thing or person desired has control over the one who desires. God warns Cain about the danger of succumbing to rage. See at 3:16, “desire.”

Verse 7



Verse 8

<b><i>thought about.</i></b> Literally, “and Cain said”; however, Cain’s fatal words to Abel are missing.
<i><b>killed him.</b></i> The laconic statement only intensifies the horror of this first murder.

Verse 9

<b><i>“am I my brother’s keeper?”</i></b> Cain rejects responsibility, as did his parents before him (3:11–13).

Verse 10



Verse 11

<b><i>“you are cursed”</i></b> This is the first curse uttered against a human being.

Verse 12



Verse 13



Verse 14

 The mention of other people reminds us that this story is mythic rather than historical or realistic. On the literal side, one could conclude that Cain and Abel are not the only children of Adam and Eve. Compare v. 17.

Verse 15

 The sign that God gives Cain as protection is unspecified. Like God’s protection of Eve and Adam, so too God’s actions toward Cain show an overriding compassion toward the newly created, fallible humans.

Verse 16



Verse 17

Like his father, upon leaving his home, Cain turns to his wife. Where did she come from? The writer is unconcerned with the question, another clue that this is not history but a myth attempting to account for the beginning of humankind and its consequences.
<b><i>17–18.</i></b> The genealogy of Cain resembles that of Seth (5:1–32), perhaps preserving old traditions or attempting to suggest parallel lines.

Verse 18



Verse 19

<b><i>19–24.</i></b> The vignette about Lamech and his wives Adah and Zillah breaks the genealogical list to describe the origins of music and crafts in the emerging civilization. The mention of the names of Lamech’s wives and daughter suggests their importance.

Verse 20



Verse 21



Verse 22

<b><i>and Naamah was Tubal-Cain’s sister.</i></b> Naamah is the first female whose mother, Zillah, is also named. Her name may mean “tuneful” and might represent her as the muse of song (so Carol Meyers, <i>Women in Scripture,</i> 2000, p. 129).

Verse 23

<b><i>23–24.</i></b> Lamech addresses his boast specifically to his wives. The bravado with which Lamech flaunts his superior worth vis-à-vis his forefather suggests a tradition about a figure that in time faded from memory. (Should one call him the first “macho man”?) In a second genealogy he features as Noah’s father (5:28).

Verse 24



Verse 25

EVE AND ADAM REUNITE: CHILDBIRTH AND NAMING (4:25–26) The narrative returns to the story of Eve and Adam and their response to the tragedy that has befallen their household. Once again, the first man is intimate with (“knew”) his wife and she conceives. Nothing in these reports of life outside the garden suggests that the woman was subservient to the man. To the contrary: she is the one who speaks; she is the one who names; and she has the power to interpret and preserve the family’s history.
<b><i>she…gave him the name.</i></b> As in 4:1, the woman names the child and interprets the significance of the experience.
<i><b>“given.</b></i>” Heb. <i>shat,</i> a word play on the name <i>shet</i> (Seth).
<i><b>“God has given me.</b></i>” Once again, the woman acknowledges God. Note, in contrast, that the man has not uttered a word since leaving the garden. While affirming her unique role as mother, she nonetheless proclaims God as the bestower of the gift of a child. Later interpreters consider this formulation to be more modest than her earlier claim in 4:1, suggesting that her confidence may have been tempered by loss.

Verse 26

 <i><b>people began to invoke</b></i> יהוה. The beginning of an ongoing relation with God is thus linked with the grandson of Eve and Adam.

Chapter 5



Verse 1

THE RECAPITULATION OF HUMAN ORIGINS, AND THEIR GENEALOGY TO NOAH (5:1–32)
Like other ancient records, Genesis includes distant ancestors who lived extraordinarily long lives. (The biblical account is modest compared to the Babylonians, who recorded life spans in the tens of thousands of years.) The unrealistic numbers express the conviction that the flood constitutes a watershed in human longevity.
<b><i>the human…human beings.</i></b> In this verse, the word <i>adam</i> appears twice. The present translation takes both of these instances in the word’s inclusive sense (as in v. 2, where <i>adam</i> explicitly means both female and male). Alternatively, the first instance could refer to the first man and is often translated as the name Adam (as in v. 3).

Verse 2

<b><i>creating them male and female, blessing them.</i></b> The co-creation of humans as both female and male is reiterated here (as in 1:27–28).
<i><b>“Humans.”</b></i> Heb. <i>adam,</i> making it absolutely clear that this noun is generic and inclusive of both female and male.

Verse 3

 The divine image is now perpetuated through the line of Seth.

Verse 4

<b><i>he begot sons and daughters.</i></b> Those who take the story literally understand the wives of Cain, Seth, and others to come from among such unnamed daughters. This formulaic language about sons and daughters repeats for each subsequent generation (vv. 7, 10, 13, 16, 19, 22, 26, 30). Carol Meyers observes that the “presence of daughters conveys the requisite notion of demographic increase, which depends on the reproductive role of women” (<i>Women in Scripture,</i> 2000, p. 176). Compare at 10:1.

 Noah’s name is a pun on the word “to comfort” (<i>n’chamah</i>). He represents the hope of reprieve from the original cursing of the ground.
<i><b>“hard labor.”</b></i> The word <i>itzavon</i> is the same one used earlier to describe the future fates of woman (3:16) and man (3:17). Here it could also mean “anguish” or “sorrow,” as it does elsewhere.

Verse 30



Verse 31



Verse 32

 In contrast to the other genealogical references in this section, which name only one son and mention anonymous “sons and daughters,” all of Noah’s three sons are named.
<i><b>Shem, Ham, and Japheth.</b></i> In 10:2, Shem will be described as the ancestor of the Semitic peoples, Ham of the Africans, and Japheth of the Greeks.

Chapter 6



Verse 1

THE MARRIAGE BETWEEN HEAVENLY BEINGS AND EARTHLY WOMEN (6:1–4)
The brief story about divine beings and earthly women is unique in the Bible. It reminds one of Greek mythology, which it indirectly opposes. Whereas Zeus’ marriage with women produces heroes such as the venerated Hercules, the Bible portrays such unions as a calamity to be eradicated. The penalty affects human beings alone. Far from gaining immortality, the marriage of heaven and earth reduces human life span. Tikva Frymer-Kensky notes that in the Mesopotamian tradition, the reverse takes place: “Goddesses choose powerful men, particularly kings, as lovers” (<i>Women in Scripture,</i> 2000, p. 177).
<b><i>daughters were born to them.</i></b> Only daughters are mentioned, not sons (who surely were born as well). This detail illustrates the terse biblical style, which focuses only on what is directly relevant to the story at hand.

Verse 2

<b><i>fair.</i></b> Heb. <i>tovot.</i> The word can describe goodness, beauty, health, a source of pleasure, or moral quality. The precise nuance here is not clear, although most interpreters presume that the divine beings were viewing the women lustfully.
<i><b>they took.</b></i> This is the verb used in the Bible for marriage.

Verse 3

 While God’s exact meaning is obscure, the consequences are clear-cut: human lifespan is to be reduced. The purpose, Tikva Frymer-Kensky suggests, is “to keep human and divine separated” (<i>Women in Scripture</i>, 2000, p. 177).

Verse 4

 Heavenly males continue to mate with earthly women and produce giants. (Elsewhere, the Bible equates Nephilim with giants.) Later stories refer to the early inhabitants of Canaan as Nephilim; thus this story serves to cast aspersion on Israel’s predecessors in the land. Here, the great renowned heroes meet with God’s disapproval. Their exploits are not preserved.
<i><b>in those days.</b></i> The writer makes clear the distance between the present account and these ancient stories, another indication that we are reading about the mythic past.

Verse 5

 CONCLUSION: GOD’S REGRET (6:5–8) The parashah that began with the glorious creation of light and life ends with a disappointed God who prepares to start anew. The great experiment has failed, and God has second thoughts. Once again this parashah portrays God as one who learns through interaction with humankind rather than as an all-knowing God.
<b><i>the wickedness of human beings.</i></b> The narrator does not specify here what the evil deeds were, although later they are called “violence” (6:13). The forcible taking of earthly women could be one example of such condemned acts.
<i><b>human beings.</b></i> Heb. <i>adam.</i> See at 1:26.
<i><b>direction.</b></i> Heb. <i>yetzer,</i> which also means “inclination.” Later traditions will speak of <i>yetzer hatov</i> and <i>yetzer hara</i> (usually but somewhat inadequately translated as “the good <i>yetzer”</i> and “the evil <i>yetzer”)</i> as dual or even complementary human impulses. The verbal root <i>y-tz-r</i> means “to create.” <i><b>their thoughts.</b></i> God’s words do not imply that human beings are innately evil.

Verse 6

 <b>יהוה</b> <i><b>regretted</b></i> Human evil causes God to repent, grieve, and destroy. Far from being infallible and all-knowing, God confronts unexpected results and has a change of heart. (Many passages, especially in prophetic literature, illustrate God’s capacity to change in response to changing circumstances. For example, God regrets having chosen Saul to be king; I Samuel 15:11, 35.)
<i><b>was heartsick.</b></i> Literally, “his heart was sorrowing.” In Genesis 3:16–17, God’s pronouncements to the woman and man used noun forms of this verb, <i>e-tz-b.</i> Here, God’s capacity for sorrow (pathos, as A. J. Heschel has put it) mirrors the sorrow or anguish that God proclaims for the humans after they eat the forbidden fruit. This acknowledgement that God can grieve also binds human and divine experience. The Bible portrays God not as a detached figure but rather as deeply responsive to humankind.

Verse 7

Elsewhere in the Bible we find the idea that human sin contaminates the whole of creation. Here, however, God’s determination to destroy utterly seems excessive. God, again, is portrayed as one who struggles with humankind, this time losing patience with it.

Verse 8

<b><i>But Noah found favor.</i></b> Noah, whose name bears the hope of the people (5:29), now also becomes the hope of God—the one whom God favors. This ray of hope will provide a link to the future for both humankind and God.
<i>—Tamara Cohn Eskenazi</i>  

Verse 9

<i>Transgression and Divine Response</i>
NOAH AND THE FLOOD (6:9–9:29)
The Flood Story draws upon other ancient Near Eastern traditions about disastrous floods, such as the Babylonian epics Gilgamesh and Atra Hasis (dated as early as the 18th century <small>B.C.E</small>.). The parallels between the biblical and Babylonian versions are extensive and striking. They share a basic plot: the divine anger leads to a flood aiming to eradicate humankind. Many details are strikingly similar: one individual is told to build a boat to carry a select few to safety; the instructions for the boat, including the requirement for a window, are often parallel; and a raven and a dove go out to test the conditions in the aftermath. There can be no doubt that Babylonian traditions influenced the biblical version. The most significant differences between the two lie in the cause for the flood: in the BabyIonian myth, the gods unleash the flood because human noise angers them; in Genesis, human violence prompts God to unleash the flood. In the Babylonian versions, the hero receives immortality as a gift from the gods. What the biblical hero receives is a covenant from God that promises the “immortality” of humankind. According to Tikva Frymer-Kensky, the biblical flood is not primarily a punishment but “a means of getting rid of the thoroughly polluted world and starting again with a well-washed one” (“The <i>Atrahasis</i> Epic and Its Significance for Our Understanding of Genesis 1–9,” <i>Studies in Bible and Feminist Criticism,</i> 2006, p. 62). The laws that God gives Noah in Genesis 9:1–7 seek to prevent the kind of bloodshed that pollutes the land.
The description of the flood shows an interweaving of separate versions, illustrating a commitment to more than one voice in telling the story. Scholars of the Torah’s historical development identify two major strands: “J” (also called “Yahwist,” a Judean source) and “P” (Priestly source), each with its own characteristics (see the introduction to Genesis).
THE FLOOD (6:9–8:14)
<b><i>Noah was a righteous man.</i></b> Already introduced in the previous parashah as the hope of both humankind (5:28–29) and God (6:8), Noah is the bearer of potential comfort. His father had named him as such, a bringer of <i>n'chamah</i> (“comfort,” a pun on the name <i>Noach)</i> to reverse the cursed condition of the earth (5:29).
<i><b>in his generation.</b></i> Whether this qualification intends to diminish his virtue (meaning, “only when compared to others in that era of utter violence”) or enhance it (meaning “even in the midst of a corrupt generation”) remains unspecified.
<i><b>walked with God.</b></i> The phrase indicates special intimacy. In the Bible, only Enoch (5:22) and Noah receive such a high compliment. God asks Abraham to “walk <i>before</i> me” (17:1), possibly an even more demanding request than walking <i>with</i> God.

Verse 10

<b><i>Noah begot three sons.</i></b> This information was first reported in 5:32. No mother is mentioned, for generational continuity and transmission of property in ancient Israel focused on the male lineage. However, in the context of lineages, it generally goes without saying that women are essential to the household and to society.
<i><b>Shem, Ham, and Japheth.</b></i> Each of the three sons represents a general linguistic or ethnic group in existence when the Torah was composed. According to 10:1–26, Shem is ancestor of the Semites to which Israel and the Arab peoples belong. Ham is ancestor of the African peoples and Japheth of the Greeks. Noah will later establish a hierarchy among them (9:24–27).

Verse 11

<b><i>11–7–7:23.</i></b> In the Babylonian flood stories, the gods are angry at humankind because people have become a nuisance, disturbing the peace. Genesis, instead, makes unchecked human violence the reason for God’s drastic action of wiping out all living creatures—returning the world to primeval chaos.
<b><i>violence.</i></b> Tikva Frymer-Kensky points out that this Hebrew word, <i>chamas,</i> “in the Bible encompasses almost the entire spectrum of evil” (“The <i>Atrahasis</i> Epic,” <i>Studies in Bible,</i> 2006, p. 61). After the flood, God gives Noah prohibitions regarding bloodshed, which suggests that bloodshed was the main concern.

Verse 12



Verse 13

<b><i>13–22.</i></b> The ark that God instructs Noah to build is intended to provide for the future by saving Noah, his family, and the representative animals.
<b><i>God said…“I am going to wipe them off.”</i></b> The narrator had first mentioned God’s decision to destroy humankind in 6:5–7. The report that divine beings married earthly women in what seemed like a violation of the boundary between heaven and earth (6:1–4) may also be a factor in God’s decision.

Verse 14

<b><i>“Make yourself an ark.”</i></b> The word <i>tevah</i> (ark) literally means a box. It appears again only in Exodus 2:3–5, when Moses’ mother makes one for her newborn. In both cases, the ark carries the future, as it were.

Verse 15



Verse 16



Verse 17



Verse 18

<b><i>“With you, though, I will establish My covenant.”</i></b> This first mentioned covenant will encompass all of Noah’s descendants, and thus all humankind, as well as the entire natural world (see Genesis 9:8–17).
<i><b>“go…you, your wife, your sons, and their wives with you.”</b></i> As sole survivors, they constitute all humankind.
For the first time, Noah’s unnamed wife is mentioned, along with the wives of his sons (not <i>her</i> sons or <i>their</i> sons). The wording reflects the patrilineal nature of the ancient society; see above at v. 10.

Verse 19

<b><i>male and female.”</i></b> Provision for continued procreation involves female and male creatures.

Chapter 7



Verse 1

 Noah’s righteousness merits the saving of his entire household, the basic unit of ancient Near Eastern society. Whereas the hero of the Babylonian flood story tries to warn his neighbors and persuade them to join him in the ark, Noah does not attempt to include or reform others.

Verse 2

 God further provides for the future by ensuring the procreation of animals (rather than creating them anew). Pure animals are those fit for sacrifice.
<i><b>“male and its mate.”</b></i> Heb. <i>ish v’ishto,</i> words that are sometimes used in biblical language to designate members of a group, human or otherwise. (See further at 2:23.)

Verse 3



Verse 4



Verse 5



Verse 6



Verse 7

<b><i>Noah, with his sons, his wife, and his sons’ wives came into the ark.</i></b> Noah’s wife and his sons’ wives are mentioned several times without names. See above at 6:18.

Verse 8



Verse 9



Verse 10



Verse 11

<b><i>11–8–8:14.</i></b> The Flood is more than an overflow of water; it represents a return to primeval chaos, with water breaking through the boundaries created in Genesis 1 to form and protect the earth. The floodgates open from above and below, letting the waters wipe out everything. The details of the story show inconsistencies that expose the seams where two accounts are woven together. The actual flood lasts 40 days (7:17), yet waters continue to rise for 150 days (7:24), subsiding for 40 days plus 14 (8:6).
<b><i>the great deep.</i></b> Heb. <i>t’hom,</i> a noun also found in 1:2, echoes the name of the Mesopotamian goddess Tiamat. But now she bursts forth with the ferocity familiar from the Babylonian Creation story Enuma Elish. Primordial <i>t’hom,</i> like the awesome goddess Tiamat, has been often maligned. According to the Enuma Elish, Tiamat’s children, led by the god Marduk, provoke her wrath by killing her husband. When she tries to retaliate, they destroy her and use her body to form the world. In the Bible, <i>t’hom</i> is typically associated with the uncontrollable and immeasurable. Catherine Keller, however, shows the nuanced ways in which <i>t’hom</i> as “the deep,” infinite and fertile, also functions as a partner with God in creation (<i>The Face of the Deep: A Theology of Becoming,</i> 2003, pp. 213–228). See also the positive reference to <i>t’hom</i> in Psalm 42:8, “deep <i>(t’hom)</i> calls to deep <i>(t’hom).”</i>

Verse 21

<b><i>21–23.</i></b> The destruction of all land-based animal life on earth is vividly recorded. Words such as “perished” and “blotted out” make clear that no one survives except “Noah and those with him in the ark” (v. 23).

Chapter 8



Verse 1

<b><i>God then remembered Noah.</i></b> God turns attention to Noah and begins to restore the world to order by reversing the direction of the waters. Remembering connotes acting, as when God remembers Rachel (Genesis 30:22) and she conceives.
<i><b>wind.</b></i> Heb. <i>ruach,</i> the same word as in 1:2 (where it was rendered “spirit”). The Flood reverses Creation, and the aftermath is a new Creation that recalls Genesis 1.

Verse 2



Verse 3



Verse 4

<b><i>Ararat.</i></b> Tradition associates this name with a mountainous district near the intersection of Turkey and Armenia. Explorers who consider the Flood narrative to be history rather than story peri odically claim (unconvincingly) to have found remnants of the ark there.

Verse 5

Verse 11

<b><i>olive branch.</i></b> Returning, the dove demonstrates that plant life is visible again. The olive branch becomes a symbol of renewal and peace in the aftermath of devastation.

Verse 13



Verse 14



Verse 15

TRANSFORMATION, COVENANT, AND RENEWAL (8:15–9:17)
<b><i>“Go out…with your wife, your sons, and their wives.”</i></b> God’s instructions imply that the world again is hospitable to living beings. Whereas the narrator groups Noah with his sons, followed by his wife with the sons’ wives (7:7 and 8:18), God pairs Noah with his wife and the sons with theirs.

Verse 16



Verse 17



Verse 18

<b><i>Noah went out, together with his sons, his wife, and his sons’ wives.</i></b> The writer leaves it to the reader to imagine the feelings of Noah and his family as they disembark. Compare the order in v. 15.

Verse 19



Verse 20

<b><i>20–22.</i></b> God reassesses humankind’s nature and accepts human limitations. The anthropomorphic description of a God who responds and recants at the pleasing smell of sacrifice makes some modern readers uneasy. More striking is the basis of God’s change of heart. The reason for not destroying life again is virtually the same as the reason for the flood: human beings incline to evil from their youth. In other words, God—not humankind—changes as a result of the flood.

Verse 21

<b><i>“inclines to evil from youth onward.”</i></b> God recognizes that the inclination to do evil is part of human beings. God’s observation does not claim that humans are inherently sinful but rather recognizes human limitations. God’s subsequent laws reflect God’s new awareness.
<i><b>“never again will I destroy.”</b></i> The promise is momentous. It will be reiterated in the covenant that follows (see especially 9:11).

Chapter 9



Verse 1

<b><i>1–7.</i></b> The transgressions that led to the Flood transform God’s expectations. They result in new rules to guide humankind and a promise of a perpetual covenant. God’s blessings and God’s new instructions signal a new beginning. Only the command to procreate unites this commissioning with the first one in Genesis 1:28.
New guidelines aim at channeling impulses and containing them. The values are inscribed in the laws: life is precious, human life especially so. Several notable elements differentiate this renewal from the earlier commissioning of humankind. Eating meat (with some qualifications) is now permitted, perhaps as a concession to human need for aggression (9:4). Bloodshed is to be controlled. In particular, the sanctity of human life is announced (9:6). The absence of women in this text contrasts with the earlier blessings in Genesis 1. In split-screen fashion, an inclusive vision is also present meanwhile in the references to <i>adam,</i> the generic human being who is (still) in God’s image (9:6).
Later rabbinic tradition expanded the laws in this section into seven “Noachite laws” that are binding upon all humankind.
<b><i>“Be fruitful and multiply.”</i></b> This exact repetition of the original command (1:28) takes on new poignancy in light of the destruction that preceded; now it stands for regenerating life after deathdealing disasters.

Verse 2



Verse 3



Verse 4

 Eating meat appears as a concession, not a requirement. (The original diet for both humans and beasts was vegetarian in 1:29–30.)

Verse 5

<b><i>“bloodguilt.”</i></b> God singles out human life for special care. God demands restitution for the shedding of human blood.

Verse 6

<b><i>“The shedder of human blood.…”</i></b> The very formulation expresses parity between crime and punishment: the first six words repeat in exact mirror image: <i>spill—blood—human</i> / <i>human—blood— spill.</i> The message is both simple and profound: complete parallel between deed and consequence—no more, no less. This formulation resembles the “eye for an eye” principle (Exodus 21:24). Less clear is how such a guideline is to be carried out.
<i><b>“in the image of God.”</b></i> Because humankind is made in God’s image, murder counts as a crime against God.

Verse 7



Verse 8

<b><i>8–17.</i></b> The covenant emphasizes renewal. It also offers the assurance of security to humankind. The covenant reiterates the perpetuity of its promise (9:9, 12) and its expansive scope, encompassing all living beings (9:9–10, 12, 15, 16, 17). Only Noah and his sons are addressed (9:8). God guarantees that no flood will ever eradicate all life on earth.

Verse 17



Verse 18

THE AFTERMATH : NOAH AND HIS SONS (9:18–29) The misbehavior of Noah’s youngest son Ham leads to the cursing of Ham’s youngest son Canaan. Unfortunately, this episode has been used by white colonizers to justify the exploitation of Africans, since Ham (in Genesis) is the ancestor of the people of Africa. However, it is not God but Noah—one might even add “under the influence”—who utters the curse; and God does not legitimate it.

Verse 19



Verse 20



Verse 21



Verse 22

<b><i>22–25.</i></b> Realizing that his son Ham saw him naked, Noah utters a curse. The story aims at asserting the dignity of the father and rewards those who cover the father’s nakedness. Many details remain unexplained, leaving irresolvable problems that later interpreters attempt to excuse. Why is Canaan punished for his father’s indiscretion? The story does not answer such questions. Rather, it functions as an etiology for Canaanite-Israelite tensions that will appear in later biblical accounts. Contemporary scholars hold that, historically speaking, Israel emerged mainly out of, and sought to distinguish itself from, a Canaanite population. The present story may seek to justify such a separation (compare Deuteronomy 7).
<i><b>nakedness.</b></i> Heb. <i>ervah,</i> which differs from the word for naked in Genesis 2:25 (<i>arumim</i>). <i>Ervah</i> always has sexual connotations; uncovering relatives’ <i>ervah</i> incurs severe punishment under the Sinai covenant (see, for example Leviticus 18:6–19 and 20:10–21).

Verse 23



Verse 24



Verse 25

<b><i>25–27.</i></b> The curse of Canaan and his enslavement by the other two families aims to discredit Canaan, a people who posed a challenge to Israel’s identity.

Chapter 10



Verse 1

<i>The Table of Nations</i> (10:1–32)
Reflecting God’s command to multiply, the list charts patterns of presumed kinship, as well as a linguistic and geographical “map” of the ancient world as understood in biblical times. Some of the information corresponds to known data; some conflicts with available information; and some cannot be identified. Roughly speaking, the divisions correspond to those in Asia (Shem), Europe (Japheth), and Africa (Ham), but the pattern is inconsistent. Seventy names represent the nations of the world.
<b><i>This is the line.</i></b> Biblical genealogies presume that the head of the household stands for the household as a whole, including its women (and subordinate men)—an assumption shared throughout the Bible and the ancient Near East. Thus biblical genealogies rarely mention mothers, wives, or daughters. (Exodus 6:14–25 is one exception.) In fact, however, the women cemented relationships among patrilineally defined groups via marriage.
Women must have been integral to Israelite kinship, for biblical stories take for granted that men who are related to each other only through a woman treat each other as kin (see Genesis 19:12, 14; Judges 9:1–3; II Samuel 13:37 in light of 3:3; 21:4–8). Nor is patrilineage always sufficient to identify oneself: Rebekah and Jacob each mention female ancestry (Genesis 24:24; 29:12). As for biblical law, see at Leviticus 18:10. While female-mediated kinship ties are not recounted in standard genealogical lists, they nevertheless formed part of the social structure (David Stein, personal communication).

Chapter 11



Verse 1

<i>Transgression and Divine Response</i>
THE TOWER OF BABEL (11:1–9)
Oddly, this story of the nations’ dispersion follows the uncontroversial spread of nations described in the previous passage. This interlude, which interrupts the genealogy of Shem, accomplishes a number of things in very few lines: it reiterates the theme of humankind trying to go too far (again), accounts for linguistic diversity, and establishes the ignominious beginning of Babylon, Israel’s eventual oppressor.
Less obviously, the story also expresses a significant theological message about God’s new relationship with humankind. The story’s taut, concise structure depicts divine response as mirroring human action very precisely. In sharp contrast to the indiscriminating response with the Flood, God’s measured retribution demonstrates a system in which the “punishment” fits the “crime” (as noted in 9:6).
The word play on “name” <i>(shem),</i> “sky” <i>(shamaim),</i> “there” <i>(sham)</i> cannot be reproduced in English but pinpoints the issues: humankind attempts to reach the sky <i>(shamaim)</i> thereby to make a name <i>(shem)</i> for itself, instead of spreading out as God has demanded. A contrast with the line of Shem (which also means “name”) is also at work (v. 10).
Contrary to some expectations, God prefers diversity to unity and uniformity (v. 6) and, in this story, actively promotes it.
<b><i>language…words.</i></b> “Language” in Hebrew is a feminine noun also meaning “lip.” Contemporary discussions about the tension between the written and the oral traditions use such distinctions to differentiate between a female culture (“language” as oral) and a male one (“word” as written).

Verse 2



Verse 3

<b><i>“let us.”</i></b> This language will be repeated when God responds, measure for measure.

Verse 4

<b><i>“a tower that reaches the sky.”</i></b> The goal, to reach the sky (<i>shamaim</i>) and make a name <i>(shem)</i> for the builders, doubly offends divine prerogative: it is an incursion into God’s physical domain and also usurps God’s role in bestowing a name, which implies honor and legacy. The tower reflects and ridicules the Babylonian ziggurat, a massive “holy mountain” constructed of bricks that was the hallmark of Mesopotamian cities: it marked the meeting point of heaven and earth.

Verse 5



Verse 6

<b><i>“no scheme…beyond their reach.”</i></b> God identifies human ambition and complete unity as a dangerous mix. Diversity seems to be by divine design.

Verse 7

<b><i>“Let us.”</i></b> In language that closely parallels the human words in v. 3, God dismantles the human project point by point (brick by brick?). God uses the people’s words but with different meanings—most of which cannot be adequately reproduced in English, such as the use of <i>l-b-n,</i> which permutates as <i>libnot</i> (build), <i>I’benah</i> (brick), and <i>n’belah</i> (confuse). (On “us” in God’s speech, see at 1:26.) God’s point-by-point response to human action expresses a new pattern for God’s interaction with humankind, replacing the wholesale destruction by the Flood and confirming God’s covenantal promise in Genesis 9.

Verse 8



Verse 9

 Ridicule aimed at Babylon is unmistakable, accented in the word play of “confuse” (<i>balal)</i> and Babel (<i>bavel</i>).

Verse 10

<i>The Ten Generations from Noah to Abram</i> (11:10–26)
Ten generations spanned the time from Adam and Eve to Naoh (Genesis 5), and now another ten take us from Noah to Abram/Abraham. Coming immediately after another disappointing human act, this genealogy leads to the next attempt by God to “begin anew.”
Until we come to Abraham, this genealogy mentions no wives, whereas it mentions the birth of (unnamed) daughters along with sons (until v. 26). In both respects it resembles the pre-Flood genealogy of Genesis 5. Such mention of daughters is atypical of other ancient Semitic genealogies. On women and biblical genealogies, see at 5:4 and 10:1.

<i>A New Beginning</i>
ABRAM/ABRAHAM AND SARAI/SARAH (11:27–32)
The family of Abram and Sarai represents a new beginning, and women emerge for the first time in this parashah as named individuals. Although Abram will become the chief protagonist later in Genesis, Sarai (later called Sarah) receives more attention in this introduction. Her condition of barrenness creates the challenge that will propel the rest of this couple’s story.

Verse 28

<b><i>Ur.</i></b> Either the Mesopotamian city (in today’s southeastern Iraq) with a sophisticated culture dating as early as 2500 <small>B.C.E</small>., or another Ur mentioned in ancient tablets from Ebla in Syria, as located near the Aramean city of Haran (mentioned in v. 31).

Verse 29

<b><i>Abram’s wife was named Sarai,</i></b> Her name echoes the word for prince <i>(sar)</i> and could mean “princess.” Savina Teubal (<i>Sarah the Priestess: the First Matriarch of Genesis,</i> 1984), who reads the text as reflecting history, speculates that Sarah was indeed a princess, as well as a priestess, who continued to uphold a tradition that was both matriarchal (women as leaders) and matrilineal (genealogy traced through the mother).
Abraham claims in 20:12 that Sarah is his sister through a different wife of his father. If she were his half sister, however, one would expect that information to appear here, especially since Milcah’s genealogical connection to her husband is recorded (see below).
<i><b>Nahor’s wife was named Milcah.</b></i> Her name, like Sarai’s, evokes royalty (<i>malcah</i> means “queen”).
<i><b>daughter of Haran father of Milcah.</b></i> The double identity markers for Milcah draw attention to her unique position in the ancestral lineage. It also discloses that she married her uncle. Rebekah, the second matriarch, will identify herself as Milcah’s granddaughter (24:24), in the Bible’s sole unambiguous mention of someone’s grandmother. This reference highlights her importance.
<i><b>Yiscah.</b></i> Presumably a sister, not brother, of Milcah. However, we learn nothing further about her.

Verse 30

<b><i>Sarai was barren.</i></b> Fertility stands out as a paramount concern in biblical tales, starting with Genesis 1:28. Sarai’s lack of children will become the pivot around which the stories from Genesis 12–21 revolve. | In Genesis 16:2, Sarai will attribute her condition to God. However, the narrator nowhere suggests that God afflicted her with such a condition or that it is a stigma. Fertility of the barren women becomes a symbol of God’s special blessing, without implying necessarily that lack of fertility is a punishment. | Stories about barren women subordinate the role of human beings in fertility and instead highlight God’s role. See further Another View. | This first mention of Sarah/ Sarai, portraying her as a barren woman, contrasts with the Bible’s final mention of Sarah, invoking her as a message of hope for a “barren” people in exile: “Look back to Abraham your father / And to Sarah who brought you forth” (Isaiah 51:2).

Verse 31

<b><i>his daughter-in-law Sarai,</i></b> The Hebrew actually adds also “wife of Abram.” This double mention of Sarai’s identity emphasizes her role in the family and prepares the reader for her continued prominence in the stories that follow. The report about the family’s journey from Ur sets the stage for God’s attempt to “begin anew,” this time with the family of Abram and Sarai.

Chapter 12



Verse 1

<i>The Formation of a Relationship with God</i>
ABRAM AND SARAI BEGIN THE JOURNEY (12:1–9)
<i>Parashat Lech L’cha</i> begins with a transformation in identity and status through a physical, geographical passage. Abraham, here called Abram, is instructed by God to leave the land of his birth and go to the land God shows him (12:1). Two other key players in this early Israelite foundation myth, who like Abram were introduced at the end of the previous parashah, are Sarah (Sarai), who is married to Abraham, and Lot, their nephew (12:4 5). The Deity establishes a relationship with the patriarch through blessings, grounded in covenantal promises of land and descendants (12:1–2, 7). God’s words demarcate who is inside the group versus outside (12:3), as Abraham and his household are pictured wandering and migrating, stopping to set up key markers of presence and possession: the altars that link Abraham and his descendants with God (12:7, 8). Critical aspects of Israelite identity thus emerge from this initial sketch. God reaches out to Abraham, who in turn reaches out to God.
Abraham is treated as the blessed founding father of subsequent generations. Divine blessings are also possible for non-kin who may be “blessed in/by” Abraham (v. 3). A modern appropriator might consider the notion of being blessed through Abraham to be universalistic, perhaps referring to the ethos modeled by Abraham’s life. Within its ancient Israelite setting, however, the phrase more likely affirmed the centrality and importance of Abraham as founder of Israel, covenant partner of God. As portrayed in Genesis, he is the mediator par excellence.
<b><i>1–3.</i></b> These opening verses of this critical passage are rhythmic and rhyming, with repetition on the second person. The words catch the eye and ear as demarcating an important beginning.
<b><i>Abram.</i></b> Variant of Abraham, meaning “exalted father.”

Verse 2



Verse 3

 Blessing and curse depend upon regard for Abraham and his descendants. One thinks also of late-biblical works that imagine an ingathering to Jerusalem at the end-time, or an attempt by foreigners to latch onto Jews as a means of reaching salvation (as in Zechariah 8:20–23). The founding myth dealing with Abraham is thus perceived to have cosmic significance, but the message is meant less to encourage or convert foreigners than to assure the group of its own importance.

Verse 4

<b><i>4–9.</i></b> In this Israelite self-portrayal, the ancestors are pictured as a family group of marginal wanderers from “elsewhere” who travel in response to a divine command and who are not native to the land. Upon arrival, Abram’s first act is to build an altar.

Verse 5

<b><i>Sarai.</i></b> The name means “Princess,” a variant of Sarah. It has been proposed that the name reflects her high status (see at Genesis 11:29).

Verse 6

<b><i>Shechem.</i></b> Located forty miles north of Jerusalem, the city is later associated with covenant renewal in Joshua 24. However, it will also be the place of the so-called rape of Dinah (see Genesis 34). Originally Shechem was a sacred city to the Canaanites. Sacred groves were an important feature of cultic sites (note the tree under which Deborah sits in Judges 4:5). Here the “oak of <i>moreh”</i> (literally, the tree “of the teacher”) is apparently a divinatory site where humans gain knowledge with help from the divine. Abraham is thus portrayed as establishing an altar at this ancient sacred space where people encountered God at a time long before Israelite kings, priests, and the great temple in Jerusalem.
<i><b>Canaanites.</b></i> Ancient inhabitants of the eastern Mediterranean region (modern-day Lebanon, southern Syria, Israel, and Jordan). Their sophisticated culture shared much with that of ancient Israel, although Israel’s writers attempted to distinguish themselves from Canaanites, whom the Bible portrays as the pre-Israelite population of the land.

Verse 7

 A way of marking the land as God’s gift and as the future possession of the people of Israel.

Verse 8

<b><i>Beth EL.</i></b> An ancient town north of Jerusalem and an important locus for Israelite foundation myths (see, for example, Jacob’s dream at Beth El in Genesis 28).

Verse 9



Verse 10

<i>Relations within the Group and Outside</i> (12:10–14:24)
This unit continues to explain how the descendants of Abraham formed as a distinct group. The shaping of what constitutes “inside the group” entails the description of—and separation from— the “other,” as variously defined.
ABRAM AND SARAI AS TRICKSTERS (12:10–20)
This section is a variant of a tale in which the patriarch deceives a foreign ruler by telling him that his wife is his sister. A similar episode is found twice more in Genesis (Abraham and Sarah in 20:1–18; Isaac and Rebekah in 26:1–16). The deception leads to an improvement in the tricksters’ status, but the deception is uncovered and they are summarily dismissed. They depart, however, with their newly acquired goods intact. The tale portrays Pharaoh as a dupe and deals with the “us-them” theme in a humorous and thoroughly traditional way.
This passage is not a tale about unethical behavior, but a story of marginalized persons who succeed in roundabout, unorthodox ways. In both such stories that involve Abraham and Sarah, Sarah proves to be the reason for Abraham’s increased wealth.
<b><i>famine.</i></b> Departure in response to famine is a recurring biblical motif that reflects the ecological reality and agrarian concerns of the biblical writers.

Verse 11

<b><i>“I know what a beautiful woman you are!”</i></b> The biblical writer provides a reason for Pharaoh’s interest in Sarai. While the Song of Songs is rich in poetic expressions of admiration for the lover’s physical beauty, such overt observations about characters’ beauty are limited and terse in the rest of the Bible. Their presence calls special attention to the relationship between the husband and wife.

Verse 12

 Pharaoh, the despot, has no right simply to steal a man’s wife if the woman pleases him, as he himself realizes (v. 18). Abram, as “brother,” is treated as the man in charge of Sarai’s sexuality. (Typically in the ancient Near East, a woman’s reproductive capacity was controlled by a particular man, whether father, brother, or husband.) Here as in the Dinah story (Genesis 34), a special role is envisioned for a “brother.”

Verse 13

<b><i>“Please say.”</i></b> The request is polite. Sarai is asked rather than ordered.

Verse 14



Verse 15

<b><i>15–16.</i></b> As Abram anticipated, beautiful Sarai is transported to Pharaoh’s harem; and wealth is transferred to Abram. An exchange of a woman has taken place. The tricksters’ economic status has increased, explicitly because of Sarai.

Verse 16



Verse 17

 Although Abram and Sarai are willing to overlook her predicament for his sake, God intervenes to protect her—another sign that she is crucial to God’s plans. The plagues upon the Egyptians here prefigure the plagues of the Exodus, but without the latter’s world-altering significance.

Verse 18

<b><i>What have you done to me.</i></b> A formulaic expression of wrong-doing. (See the parallels in Genesis 20:9; 26:10.)

Verse 19

<b><i>take [her] and begone.</i></b> The Hebrew is even more abrupt—literally, “Take! Go!”

Verse 20

 The trickster never fully succeeds in emerging from his marginal status. Revelation of the deception brings a new reduction in status.

Chapter 13



Verse 1

ABRAM AND LOT: DISPUTE AND SEPARATION (13:1–13) Abram and his nephew part ways. The writer thereby provides an explanation to the Israelite audience for the proximity of those nations that were understood to have descended from Lot (see 19:36–38). This passage alludes both to the kinship group that defines Israel and to the “Other” occupiers of land, while foreshadowing the tales of Sodom and Gomorrah that follow in Genesis 19.

Verse 2

Verse 5

<b><i>5–13.</i></b> The amicable separation between the extended household of Lot and that of Abram continues the pattern of separation, distinguishing one group from another. Abram seeks to avoid enmity between kin.

Verse 7

<b><i>the Canaanites and the Perizzites.</i></b> This formulaic twosome is frequently employed to refer to the “native peoples” of the land encountered by Abram and his descendants (for example, Exodus 3:8, 17; 23:3).

Verse 14

COVENANT PROMISES: LAND AND PROGENY (13:14–18) This passage underscores the importance of the land-promise theme in Israelite self-understanding. Whatever Israel’s actual, complex origins in the land, the tradition here insists upon both Israel’s outsider status and the land as a divine boon.

Verse 15

<b><i>15–16. “land… descendants like the dust of the earth.”</i></b> Each of the patriarchs hears similar language of promise (again Abraham in 22:17, Isaac in 26:3–4, and Jacob in 28:13–14). In this case, it reinforces the message of fullness and the predictions’ certainty.

Verse 16

Verse 18

Chapter 14



Verse 1

ABRAM AS A WARRIOR HERO (14:1–24) Throughout the rest of Genesis, Abraham is portrayed as a peaceful patriarch, protected by God: He migrates with family and flocks, establishing ties to the land. Although he has retainers, his major tactic in confrontations is withdrawal under divine protection. This story, however, is different—more like tales in the books of Judges and Samuel than like the stories that surround it. Here Abram is portrayed as an epic hero who skillfully fights to rescue captured kin.
<b><i>1–9.</i></b> Scholars used to seek historical information in these names of kings, but they have largely abandoned the search. This detailed war description includes an intriguing and fanciful mixture of the real, the unverifiable, and the richly mythic. While none of the named kings is known from biblical or extra-biblical sources, some of the places certainly existed, such as Seir, Kadesh, Shinar, and Elam.

Verse 7

<b><i>Amalek.</i></b> A people assigned by biblical tradition to the Negev region and treated as an archenemy and rival for the land (Exodus 17:8–16; Numbers 14:43–45).
<i><b>Amorites.</b></i> A frequent biblical designation for the land’s indigenous population (see Deuteronomy 1:4, 7).

Verse 8

<b><i>Sodom…Gomorrah.</i></b> Treated as two ancient kingdoms or city-states without reference to ethical breaches associated with Genesis 18–19.
<i><b>Admah…Zeboim.</b></i> Like Sodom and Gomorrah, these cities are places of destruction (see Deuteronomy 29:22).

Verse 9

Verse 13

<b><i>Hebrew.</i></b> In Exodus, this word—perhaps related to <i>apiru,</i> a Semitic-language term for stateless folk—may refer to social status rather than to ethnic identity. Here, the term may well have ethnic connotations.
<i><b>oak trees of Mamre.</b></i> Compare 12:6.

Verse 14

<b><i>his kinsman.</i></b> In biblical parlance, the head of a household stands for the entire household, including its women. (See also at 10:1.)

Verse 15

<b><i>15–16.</i></b> Quick narrative strokes cover the battle and victory. Note that the women are listed separately after the possessions, among the spoils of all-too-frequent war.

Verse 16



Verse 17



Verse 18

<b><i>Melchizedek.</i></b> This name, which associates the term for “king” with “righteousness,” becomes symbolically important in the Dead Sea Scrolls and in later Jewish literature. Melchizedek is one of the many enigmatic biblical figures—probably rooted in a richer oral tradition—who appear briefly in the written tradition, and then go on to a fuller post-biblical afterlife. Serah daughter of Asher is another such figure (see Numbers 26:46).
<i><b>Salem.</b></i> Perhaps to be identified with Jerusalem.

Verse 19



Verse 20

<b><i>a tenth of everything.</i></b> Abram appears to engage in an act of tithing, anticipating the Torah’s later prescriptions (as in Leviticus 27:30–33).

Verse 21



Verse 22

<b><i>22–24.</i></b> In contrast to the usual practice of warrior heroes in Judges and I–II Samuel (see Joshua 8:1–3; Judges 8:24–26), Abram refuses to enjoy any of the spoil obtained through his military victory. As in the Book of Esther (9:10), battle is not for material gain but for the righteous cause.

Chapter 15



Verse 1

<i>A Deepening Covenant</i> (15:1–21)
This passage is a version of covenant-formation (see also Genesis 9, 12, 17; Exodus 6, 12). In this literary form, God appears or speaks; the recipient of the message is promised blessings of land and progeny; the Deity self-identifies; and a sign is provided to mark and seal the relationship. Of special note in this scene are the name of the Deity (v. 7); the ritual (vv. 9–17); the prophecy offered (vv. 13–16); and the lack of explicit conditions laid upon the patriarch as covenant partner.
<b><i>1–6–6</i></b> Twin promises of land and children are central to Israelite tales of self-definition; perhaps they reflect the importance of male lineages and patrimonies.
 The divine communication comes in a vision, so that what is “seen” is a poetic blessing that verbally reassures Abram.

Verse 2

<b><i>2–3.</i></b> Abram confronts God, calling attention to the grand yet unfulfilled promises of progeny. Abram has not resorted to the variety of customs in ancient times that enabled householders to ensure their posterity (such as taking an additional wife). See at 16:1–3.

Verse 3



Verse 4



Verse 5



Verse 6



Verse 7

<b><i>7–19.</i></b> Known as the “covenant of the pieces,” this eerie scene testifies to the strongly experiential dimension of the numinous, as Abram encounters the Deity.
 <b>“יהוה.”</b> God self-identifies by this name, which source critics have long considered to be a marker of a particular biblical thread or layer. See also at 2:4.

Verse 8



Verse 9



Verse 10

<b><i>split them.</i></b> In Hebrew idiom, to make a covenant is literally to “cut” one. Drawing parallels with ancient Near Eastern custom and Jeremiah 34:17–22, scholars have suggested that the division of the animal is an implied threat, symbolizing the result of a failure to keep the covenant. An alternate view is that the covenant’s parties belong to one unit, one body; each half is incomplete without its counterpart. Bonds are affirmed through participation in sacrificial ritual—in a common mode of cultural expression.

Verse 11



Verse 12

<b><i>deep sleep.</i></b> The trance-like state signals important transformations. In Genesis 2:21, the first human being was likewise placed in deep sleep prior to the formation of woman.

Verse 13

<b><i>13–16.</i></b> A premonition of the later enslavement in Egypt and the Exodus.

Verse 14



Verse 15



Verse 16

<b><i>“iniquity of the Amorites.”</i></b> The indigenous peoples are declared deserving of displacement. The author apparently seeks to justify biblical tradition concerning the Israelites’ later conquest of the land.

Verse 17

<b><i>smoking oven…fiery torch.</i></b> The Deity is often associated with fire imagery (see Exodus 3:2; 19:18). [The text’s ancient audience perceived certain artifacts to be associated with a particular gender. Ovens, torches, or both may well have been linked with women in particular, as those who bake bread (Leviticus 26:26), or as with Deborah, who is said to be affiliated with <i>lapidot,</i> “torches” (Judges 4:4). Here, such items represent the divine Presence (David Stein, personal communication). —<i>Ed</i>.] <i><b>passed between these pieces.</b></i> See at 15:10. The divine being passes between the halves, demonstrating reliability as a covenant partner.

Chapter 16



Verse 1

<i>The Tale of Hagar</i> (16:1–16)
This passages returns to a problem mentioned earlier (11:30): the barrenness of the patriarch’s wife. That topic is a recurring motif foreshadowing the birth of a hero (see the story of Hannah, mother of Samuel, in I Samuel 1–2). Here, Sarai takes matters into her own hands by giving her husband her female slave as wife. The slave’s children will belong to her mistress by adoption. The passage reveals the ethical and practical difficulties of this sort of surrogate motherhood, and the political dimensions of reproduction in a traditional patrilineal society. Nevertheless, in a world in which having children is a major source of status, Hagar is emboldened by her pregnancy (16:4). Sarai “treat(s) her harshly,” and the girl runs away. The annunciation that follows is a traditional marker of the biography of a hero. Here, as in Genesis 21, the reader briefly feels immersed in a non-Israelite nation’s founding myth.
BARRENNESS AND SURROGATE MOTHERHOOD (16:1–6)
The theme of the barren wife recurs throughout tales of the matriarchs and of the mothers of other heroes—including Rebekah, Rachel, Samson’s unnamed mother, and Hannah. The motif implies that a boy born under such circumstances is truly sent by God, his mother’s condition having received special attention by the Deity. In the Bible, reproductive problems typically concern women, whereas in other traditions either parent may be regarded as infertile. This is another of the Bible’s double-edged swords regarding the status of women. On the one hand, to be infertile is to be marginal, possibly afflicted by God; on the other hand, annunciations of a child’s birth account for most of the few biblical passages in which God communicates with and empowers women. Here the biblical writers deftly draw out the ways in which children connote status in this society. Implicitly, they also point to the powerlessness of slave women whose reproductive capacity belongs to another. Both women—mistress and slave—have their options expanded and yet are also constrained by their cultural roles.
<b><i>an Egyptian slave.</i></b> Hebrew has several terms for female servants or slaves. The term here refers to the lowest level of servitude. Slavery was an accepted part of ancient Near Eastern cultures, Israel included. Although certain biblical laws ameliorate the plight of slaves, especially male Hebrews (see at Exodus 21:2–11 and Leviticus 25:35–54), they do not overtly oppose the institution. According to the Sinai covenant, a daughter sold into slavery was normally not released in the seventh year (Exodus 21:2, 7). In addition to the usual hardships that they shared with male counterparts, women slaves were also used by males in the household for sexual or procreative purposes. Typically, their masters or mistresses had extensive control over their fate. In the story of Rachel and Leah, their father Laban gives a woman slave to each of his daughters (Genesis 29:24, 29); in turn, they assign those slaves—named Zilpah and Bilhah—to their husband, Jacob, in order to produce children (Genesis 29–30). Here, when Hagar becomes Abram’s wife (v. 3), she does not cease to be Sarai’s slave; when Abraham surrenders Hagar to Sarai’s authority (v. 6), he acknowledges that his wife has prior claims that supersede his. (In Genesis 25:6, Hagar appears to be counted among Abraham’s concubines—a status higher than that of a slave but lower than a wife.)

Verse 2

 Sarai acknowledges that fertility is ultimately in the hands of the Deity (see Genesis 30:2), but nevertheless takes matters into her own hands.
<i><b>“maybe I will have a son through her.”</b></i> The Hebrew is more ambiguous since the word “son” does not appear. Instead, Sarai is using a verb that can mean either “I will have a child” or “I will be built”—that is, established—which refers to creating a family and continuity with no reference to the offspring’s gender. | Sarai’s motive is not clear. Is it to ensure her own position, to fulfill Abram’s dream of having a child as an heir (Genesis 15:2–3), or both? | Modern scholars have long pointed to extra-biblical evidence for varieties of surrogate motherhood in the ancient Near East, such as was regulated in the Laws of Hammurabi (¶ 146). Sarai participates in an unspecified version of that widely practiced system and seeks to be empowered within its contours.
<i><b>Abram heeded Sarai’s voice.</b></i> In Genesis 3:17, the first man was chastised for heeding the woman’s voice. In contrast, in Genesis 21:12, God will need to explicitly instruct Abraham to obey Sarah: “Do whatever Sarah tells you”—more literally “All that Sarah tells you, heed her voice.” Here, however, Abram shows no reluctance to follow his wife’s instructions. In household matters, women exercised authority.

Verse 3

<b><i>gave her to her husband Abram as a wife.</i></b> An ancient contract from Nuzi (Mesopotamia, 14th century <small>B.C.E.</small>) prescribes a similar response to barrenness: “Kelim-ninu [a woman] has been given in marriage to Shennima [a man].…If Kelim-ninu does not bear, Kelim-ninu shall acquire a woman of the land of Lulu, and Kelim-ninu may not send the offspring away” (<i>ANET,</i> 1969, p. 220; see also at v. 1).
<i><b>wife.</b></i> Heb. <i>ishah;</i> see at 2:24.

Verse 4

<b><i>became for her an object of scorn.</i></b> Literally, “became lightweight in her eyes.” The status of childless women in antiquity was precarious, socially and economically. Pregnant, and as Abram’s new wife, Hagar has reason to feel that her position has been elevated.

Verse 5

<b><i>Sarai then said.</i></b> The biblical writers are psychologically astute in describing the tension between husband and wife over difficult reproductive issues (see also Genesis 30:1–2).

Verse 6

 The principal wife clearly has certain rights in these situations involving reproduction, as Abram—unquestioning—implicitly recognizes. From a much later Jewish community in Egypt (5th century <small>B.C.E.</small>) we have a document in which one man’s slave becomes another’s wife, and another document in which her master frees her. Such conflicting lines of authority create complexities of which the stories here and in Genesis 21 are a dramatic, even tragic, example. Meanwhile, from a literary perspective, one observes Abram’s frustration and feelings of powerlessness, as well as his desire not to become involved in this world of women.
<i><b>Sarai then so afflicted her.</b></i> [Tikva Frymer-Kensky suggests that this may mean that Sarai simply starts treating her like an ordinary slave <i>(Reading the Women of the Bible,</i> 2002, p. 229). The verb <i>innah</i> (“afflicted”) refers to various forms of coercion. The same verb describes the treatment of the Israelites in Egypt (Exodus 1:11). On the long-term impact of the relationship between Sarah and Hagar, see at Genesis 21:10. —<i>Ed</i>.]

Verse 7

ANNUNCIATION OF THE BIRTH OF A SON (16:7–16) The “Annunciation” is a biblical literary pattern (or “type-scene”) in which a mother-to-be receives information from God or a divine messenger concerning the future birth of a male child. Often instructions or information are given about the hero’s future. The female recipient of this knowledge frequently reacts with fear or wonder (see Genesis 18:9–15 where Sarah learns indirectly about her forthcoming pregnancy, and Judges 13:1–7 where Samson’s mother-to-be learns that she shall have a son).
<b><i>an angel of יהוה.</i></b> This is the first report of a personal encounter between an individual woman and a divine being since Genesis 3; it is also the first time in the story that anyone addresses Hagar.
<i><b>at a spring of water.</b></i> Water sources in the Bible are associated with fertility.

Verse 8

For the first time, Hagar speaks and tells her story, which she does succinctly.

Verse 9

<b><i>“Return.”</i></b> The ethical stance in the scene is one of accommodation to the existing power structure rather than encouragement to acts of self-liberation. In this system, the reward for submission is the promise of progeny.
<i><b>“'I will greatly multiply your descendants.”</b></i> The formulaic blessing elsewhere offered only to patriarchs such as Abraham is here also promised to the heroine Hagar (see 13:16; 15:5; 26:4; 28:14). She thus receives a promise that parallels those to the patriarchs. She is the only woman in the Torah to be informed directly that her descendants (literally “her seed”) will be numerous.

Verse 10



Verse 11

<b><i>“Ishmael.”</i></b> The name means “God will listen”; it is a good omen for the boy, and a comment on God’s attentiveness to Hagar’s plight.

Verse 12

 To be equated with a virile strong male animal is usually a positive metaphor in the ancient Near East (see the references to the bull and the wild-ox in Deuteronomy 33:17). The rest of the blessing should likewise be construed as positive, although this translator understood it differently.
<i><b>“he shall dwell”</b></i> Ishmael will be the father of a people neighboring Israel.

Verse 13

<b><i>“El Ro’i.”</i></b> Literally, “God of my seeing.” <b><i>“Even here…who looks upon me!”</i></b> The clause is difficult to parse precisely. It seems to mean that Hager feels lucky to be alive after a direct encounter with the Deity.

Verse 14

<b><i>Be’er-lachai-ro’i.</i></b> Literally, “the well of the living one of my seeing.” The naming of a place after a theophany is a common biblical motif (cf. 28:19). However, Hagar is the only woman whose experience is enshrined in a place name. None of the matriarchs receive this honor. Such a privilege for the marginalized slave-woman—the outsider—is striking; the narrative views Hagar with sympathy and as having value.

Chapter 17



Verse 1

<i>Covenant and Circumcision</i> (17:1–27)
The Abrahamic covenant (Genesis 15) is now sealed by the rite of circumcision. The incising of the covenant on male bodies is a critical feature of Israelite self-identification and may perhaps be linked with the importance of male lineages in this ancient culture.
COVENANT AND IMPLICATIONS OF CIRCUMCISION (17:1–14)
Motifs of progeny and land appear as the patriarch’s transformation is effected by a name change and bodily marking.
<b><i>“El Shaddai.”</i></b> An ancient name of the Deity, apparently meaning “God of the mountains” or “God of my breasts.” Ancient Near Eastern and other deities are frequently associated with the mountains. The alternate meaning of <i>shaddai</i> as “breasts” perhaps hints at aspects of the feminine contained in the Deity. This name of God often appears in the Bible in a context where fertility is an issue. For example, Naomi uses this name in Ruth 1:20.

Verse 4



Verse 5

<b><i>“Abram…Abraham.”</i></b> The name change marks a change in status. Abram and Abraham are variants, meaning “exalted father.”

Verse 6



Verse 7

<b><i>7–10.</i></b> Five times in this passage, God refers to the covenant’s other party as “you and your descendants” (literally “seed”); this indicates that membership in the covenant is not limited to males, although every male is to bear circumcision as a mark of the covenant. This covenant is with Abraham and Sarah’s offspring regardless of gender. Likewise the entire Israelite people is a party to the Covenant at Sinai, where Shabbat—not circumcision—is the covenantal <i>ot</i> (sign or mark), a sign that explicitly applies to all members of the community (Exodus 31:12–17).

Verse 8



Verse 9



Verse 10



Verse 11

<b><i>“the flesh of your foreskin.”</i></b> That the key ritual for inclusion involves the male procreative organ reflects the male-oriented bent of the material and the worldview behind it. (See also Contemporary Reflection.)

Verse 12

<b><i>“slave.”</i></b> As in v. 27, circumcision marks a man as being inside the group, which includes slaves. (On slavery in Israelite culture, see at Exodus 21:1–11 and Leviticus 25:39–46.)

Verse 13



Verse 14

<b><i>cut off.</i></b> See at Leviticus 7:20.
<b><i>people.</i></b> Heb. <i>ammim.</i> On the gender-inclusive sense of this term, see at Genesis 25:8.

Verse 15

REITERATION OF PROMISES OF A CHILD BY SARAH (17:15–22) God’s power over life is emphasized by the divine capacity to allow a ninety-year-old woman to bear a child. God’s blessing of Sarah parallels that of Abraham, since both will be parents of many significant descendants. However, there are two striking differences. First, the promise is addressed directly to Abraham and not to Sarah. Second, only Sarah’s son is the legitimate heir of the covenant, not any of Abraham’s other sons. (See 25:1–5 for Abraham’s additional sons.)
<b><i>“Sarah.”</i></b> Sarai too receives a name change that marks an alteration in status. She is included in the covenant through her capacity to procreate.

Verse 16

<b><i>“I will bless her.”</i></b> The blessing of Sarah is repeated twice in this verse. Like Abraham, she will be the founder of many nations and kings.

Verse 17

 Like Abraham here, Sarah will laugh when she receives the promise of a son (see 18:12).

Verse 18

 Abraham seems content with his son Ishmael as heir. It is God who insists that only Sarah’s child will become the vehicle for God’s covenant.

Verse 19

<b><i>19–22.</i></b> The repetition of Sarah’s unique role in both of these verses leaves no doubt that she is necessary for the covenant and its blessings. [In other words, the Torah conceives of the Israelite lineage not only in male terms. On women and lineage, see at 10:1 and the introduction to 22:20–24. —<i>Ed.</i>]

Verse 20



Verse 21



Verse 22



Verse 23

ADOPTION OF THE SIGN OF CIRCUMCISION (17:23–27) The parashah concludes with membership in the group defined in terms of male circumcision. This should be read in light of the just-stated promise that the covenant will be bestowed only on Sarah’s child, which makes clear how significant she is in God’s plan.

Chapter 18



Verse 1

<i>Sarah Becomes a Mother</i>
ANNOUNCEMENT OF ISAAC’S BIRTH; THREATS TO CONCEPTION, BIRTH, AND SURVIVAL (18:1–21:7)
Isaac’s future was announced in Genesis 17 but only in this next section does Sarah learn that conception will soon occur (18:10).
DIVINE MESSENGERS VISIT ABRAHAM AND SARAH, ANNOUNCING THAT SARAH WILL BECOME A MOTHER (18:1–33)
Because most of the angels’ visit concerns the birth of Isaac—something Abraham knows about but Sarah does not—informing Sarah is likely the reason for the angels’ appearance.
 <b>יהוה <i>appeared to him.</i></b> The text does not explicitly connect the events of this passage to the previous one where God tells Abraham that he and Sarah will have a child together (17:16), and where Abraham and his household are circumcised (17:23).
<i><b>him.</b></i> [That is, Abraham; see 17:26. —<i>Ed.</i>]

Verse 2

<b><i>three men.</i></b> The reader knows that these are supernatural messengers. It is unclear whether Abraham recognizes this.

Verse 3



Verse 4



Verse 5



Verse 6

<b><i>Abraham then hurried…to Sarah, and said, “Hurry,…”</i></b> Sarah is 90 years old. It is the hottest part of the day and she is expected to do the baking. Is this because Abraham recognizes the importance of these visitors and Sarah’s involvement raises the level of the meal? (On women as bakers, see at Exodus 16:3 and Leviticus 26:26.)

Verse 7



Verse 8



Verse 9

<b><i>9–10. “Where is your wife Sarah?” “There, in the tent.”</i></b> The visitor knows of Abraham’s wife Sarah, asks where she is, and continues speaking in her hearing.

Verse 10

<b><i>“at this time next year…your wife Sarah shall have a son.”</i></b> Since Abraham already knows that Sarah will have a son (17:16–19), the annunciation seems to be primarily for her benefit.
<i><b>Sarah was listening.</b></i> For the first time, Sarah learns about her forthcoming pregnancy. Some use this verse to criticize Sarah for listening to other people’s conversations. But the speaker has asked specifically about Sarah, speaks knowing her proximity, and has information specifically designated for her. Clearly she is his audience.

Verse 11

<b><i>the way of women had ceased for Sarah.</i></b> Sarah no longer menstruates, also meaning that she can no longer conceive. The reference highlights for the reader why she will be surprised by what she hears. [Rachel also refers to menstruation as “the way of women” (Genesis 31:35). See at Leviticus 15:19–24 for details about menstruation. —<i>Ed.</i>]

Verse 12

<b><i>Sarah laughed inwardly.</i></b> Sarah, alone in the tent, responds with no outward sign—as opposed to Abraham, who fell on his face, laughing aloud, while he was in conversation with the Deity (17:17).
<i><b>“pleasure.”</b></i> The word <i>ednah</i> is related to the word “Eden” (as in the Garden of Eden), alluding to a sense of “delight,” with a sexual connotation. Sarah is excited by the thought of an impending sexual encounter.
<i><b>“with my lord so old!”</b></i> Sarah’s reaction reflects her delighted surprise in her husband’s abilities. God suggests a different reason (v. 13). This implies that Abraham and Sarah had stopped sexual relations, highlighting why the visitors inform her that the couple should renew them. Sarah does not doubt the Deity’s abilities, but rather Abraham’s.

Verse 13

<b><i>“Why is Sarah laughing so.”</i></b> Some interpreters have concluded, erroneously, that Sarah’s laughter was derisive. When Abraham heard that he would have a child with Sarah, he “fell flat on his face and laughed, thinking: ‘Can a child be born to a man of 100? Can 90-year-old Sarah bear a child?’” (17:17). Thus Sarah is actually now accused of Abraham’s earlier actions. Since Sarah is alone in the tent when she laughs, is the Deity testing Abraham to determine if he will admit his own actions and protect Sarah? | [Tikva Frymer-Kensky, who considers Sarah’s laughter as an expression of doubt, interprets God’s response to Sarah this way: “God ignores Abraham’s laughter but reacts to Sarah’s. After all, Sarah should understand how important she is.…Sarah’s importance in God’s scheme means that God will have zero tolerance for skepticism from her” (<i>Women in Scripture,</i> 2000, p. 151). <i>—Ed.</i>]

Verse 14



Verse 15

<b><i>Sarah…was afraid.</i></b> Whom does Sarah fear? Most interpreters assume that Sarah is afraid of God. I contend that she fears Abraham. Sarah has no reason to fear God—who apparently comes to her rescue (in the house of the pharaoh, 12:10–18), blesses her and promises that she shall have a child (17:15–16), and has now sent messengers to tell her that she shall soon have her desired son. However, she does have reasons for fearing Abraham. He does not seem to object when she is taken to Pharaoh’s palace (12:14–16); he allows Hagar to treat her with disrespect (16:3–4); and—insofar as the reader knows—has not informed her that they will be having a child.
[<i><b>God</b></i>] <i><b>said, “Ah, but you did laugh!”</b></i> The present translation adds “God” in brackets because the speaker is unnamed. The grammar supports the interpretation that the speaker is not God but Abraham (for details, see Tammi J. Schneider, <i>Sarah: Mother of Nations,</i> 2004, pp. 70–74). Another reason for doubting that God speaks here is that the Deity never speaks with Sarah before or after. And throughout 18:1–14 she is hidden from the visitors’ sight, but not from Abraham’s. Thus it is likely that it is Abraham who speaks these words, even though he has not heard her laugh.

Verse 16

<b><i>16–33.</i></b> The story of Abraham’s attempted defense of Sodom follows directly the one in which he accuses his wife of his own actions.

Chapter 19



Verse 1

DIVINE MESSENGERS VISIT SODOM AND LOT, AND LOT’S DAUGHTERS BECOME MOTHERS OF NATIONS (19:1–38) The visit to Sodom is a “test” of sorts (note Genesis 22) to determine the worthiness of the city and of Lot. Sodom has been mentioned several times already, and never positively (Genesis 1314). Lot and his family are a major focus of this section. Since the parashah concerns establishing the next generation, and Lot is the nephew of Abraham and potential heir, then an evaluation of Lot is critical. [The story of Lot’s daughters and their incestuous intercourse with their father (19:30–38) possibly seeks to account for why Isaac does not marry one of them, who as his nearby cousins would otherwise be prime candidates. —<i>Ed.</i>]

Verse 2



Verse 3



Verse 4



Verse 5

<b><i>“so we can have them.”</i></b> Literally, “so we can know them,” which carries a sexual connotation (see at 4:1).

Verse 6



Verse 7



Verse 8

 Lot offers his daughters instead of the men. His effort to protect the visitors reflects his belief that male rape is worse than female rape, even of his own daughters. | Here, angels will save the women; in a similar incident in Judges 19, another woman is not so fortunate when she and her husband visit and she is offered in lieu of him to a mob. She is repeatedly molested by the mob and dies soon after. The incident triggers a civil war in retaliation.

<b><i>17–23.</i></b> After the city is destroyed, Lot—as leader of his family—appears overwhelmed by the enormity of the situation and unable to guide and protect his family. This seems to be what leads to his wife’s immobilization and his daughters’ risky actions.
<b><i>“Do not look behind you,”</i></b> These words are addressed in masculine singular language; it may be construed that they were spoken only to Lot.

Verse 26

<b><i>his wife looked behind him.</i></b> This is precisely what Lot is warned against. Nowhere does the text indicate that he passes this information to his wife and daughters. The question remains: Does Lot’s wife not know about the warning—or does she look back in spite of it?
<i><b>and became a pillar of salt.</b></i> She is reluctant to ignore what happens to those she leaves behind, and this concern costs her life.

Verse 27



Verse 28



Verse 29



Verse 30

<b><i>30–38.</i></b> Lot’s daughters become mothers of nations that—through him—are related to the line of Abraham. Fearful that humankind has been annihilated, the daughters (the same ones whom Lot offered to the town’s men earlier?) take drastic measures to perpetuate life. Like Tamar (see Genesis 38), they break taboos. Their sons produce the nations Moab and Ammon, Israel’s eastern neighbors.

Verse 31

 The daughters are living in a cave and think they are the only ones on earth. It also means they do not know their great-uncle Abraham’s family is nearby. The motive for what follows: ensure that life on earth continues.

Verse 32



Verse 33

<b><i>33–34. lay with her father.</i></b> Oddly, incest laws in Leviticus and Deuteronomy do not explicitly prohibit sexual relations between a father and his daughter (see at Leviticus 18:6–24). Technically speaking, the daughters break no biblical law. Nonetheless, the daughters do seem to break a taboo (which explains why they first get their father drunk), yet the text does not condemn their actions.
<i><b>“so that we can give life to offspring through our father.”</b></i> The motive of the older daughter is clear: perpetuate life in a world that seems to them to have no other men.

Verse 34

 The older daughter ensures that her younger sister is not without the opportunity to conceive a child. Their cooperation contrasts with the competition between Rachel and Leah (Genesis 29–30).

Verse 35



Verse 36



Verse 37

<b><i>37–38. Moabites…Ammonites.</i></b> Two nations that according to this story are related to Israel. Deuteronomy 23:4 excludes Ammonites and Moabites from joining the Israelite community. The Book of Ruth, however, offers a different perspective in that it portrays Ruth the Moabite as the ancestress of King David.

Chapter 20



Verse 1

ABRAHAM AND SARAH “VISIT” ABIMELECH (20:1–18) For a second time, Abraham hands over his wife to a king (see 12:10–20; compare 26:1–11). His actions here are more problematic both because he has done it before, and because his wife is supposed to bear him a child soon.

Verse 2

<b><i>Abraham said, of his wife Sarah, “She is my sister.”</i></b> In the earlier case, Abraham had been propelled by hunger, and by fear for his life on account of Sarah’s beauty (12:10–13). Here the text provides no reason for Abraham’s movements or for deceiving the king of Gerar, until vv. 11–13.

Verse 3



Verse 4

<b><i>Abimelech had not touched her.</i></b> Presumably sexually. But clearly that is his intention.

Verse 5



Verse 6



Verse 7



Verse 8



Verse 9



Verse 10



Verse 11

<b><i>“There is no fear of God at all in this place.”</i></b> In the previous story, Abraham had argued with God to save a city for the sake of the righteous individuals that he wrongly thought it contained. Here, Abraham believes that a city contains no God-fearing persons, and he is wrong again. This time, however, his error almost causes “a great sin” (v. 9) to be committed.

Verse 12

<b><i>“she is my sister.</i></b> Abraham’s statement is not confirmed either by the narrator, other dialogue, or genealogical source. Both Sarah’s and Abraham’s genealogy appear in 11:27–30, where this fact is not mentioned; see the comment there. The earlier episode (12:10–18) contains no reference to a real brother/sister relationship; if Abraham and Sarah were truly brother and sister, the perfect opportunity to mention it would have been then, before they entered Egypt. Yet unlike Isaac, who claims that his wife and first cousin Rebekah is his sister (26:1–11), Abraham here provides plausible specifics: he and Sarah are related through their father. Note that Deuteronomy 27:22 condemns a sexual relationship between such siblings.

Verse 13



Verse 14



Verse 15



Verse 16

<b><i>“it testifies to your unblemished virtue.”</i></b> Despite Sarah and Abimelech’s innocence, her reputation still needs to be cleared.

Verse 17



Verse 18

 <b>יהוה</b> <i><b>had completely shut every womb of Abimelech’s household</b></i> Paradoxically, this information is imparted only after Abraham prays to the Deity—who heals Abimelech, his wife, and his slave girls so that they bear children. It raises questions: Did Abraham pray earlier for his own wife to conceive? Did she now benefit too from this prayer of Abraham’s? (See the episode that follows.) The next matriarch, Rebekah, will be barren until Isaac pleads on her behalf (25:21).
<i><b>on account of Abraham’s wife Sarah.</b></i> Sarah— not Abraham—is God’s primary concern.

Chapter 21



Verse 1

SARAH BECOMES A MOTHER (21:1–7)
 <b>יהוה</b> <i><b>now remembered Sarah.</b></i> God had spoken with Abraham (17:16, 21; 18:10) and, through the “messengers,” with Sarah (18:10) about the forthcoming child; but God remembers only Sarah here.

Verse 2

<b><i>she became pregnant and bore a son.</i></b> After much discussion about this event (15:4; 17:16–19, 21; 18:9–15), Isaac’s conception and delivery are reported in just three Hebrew words.
<i><b>to Abraham.</b></i> The text is explicit here that the father is Abraham because the preceding episode with Abimelech might raise a doubt about the father’s identity.

Verse 3

 Abraham names the child “Isaac,” a name that means “he laughs.” Usually in the Bible it is the mother who names her son.

Verse 4



Verse 5



Verse 6

<b><i>“all who hear will laugh with me.”</i></b> Sarah responds to maternity with laughter. Earlier the laughter was private (18:12). Now it embraces everyone else.

Verse 7

<b><i>“Sarah shall nurse.”</i></b> Sarah is celebrating her capacity to nurture her child. (For details about the practice of nursing babies in the ancient world and in the Bible, see at Exodus 2:9.)
<i><b>“I have borne a son.”</b></i> In the book of Isaiah, the prophet urges the people to look “to Sarah who brought you forth” (Isaiah 51:2) as a source of hope and renewal. After the exile to Babylon in the 6th century <small>B.C.E.,</small> Sarah’s giving birth apparently exemplified the potential for renewal.
<i><b>“in his old age.”</b></i> Abraham’s age seems to be more of a miracle to Sarah than her own, as she celebrates her capacity to bring forth life.

Verse 8

<i>First Threat to Isaac</i>
TWO MOTHERS CLASH PROTECTING THEIR SONS (21:8–21)
The tension in the family does not end with Isaac’s birth, since there are potential threats to his longevity and success from both his brother and his father.
One of the most poignant parts of the parashah is the story of two mothers, each of whom desires the well-being of her son. Mother Sarah seeks to secure her infant’s future (a future that she will probably not live to see, given her age) by expelling a rival. Hagar then faces the near death of her son. The Torah is sympathetic to both mothers caught in the cross-currents.
The plight here of mother Hagar and son Ishmael will be mirrored by that of father Abraham and his son Isaac in the story immediately following. Certain details connect the stories: In both, the parent rises early, a child is imperiled; and a divine messenger intervenes at the last moment. (Both stories are read on Rosh HaShanah in traditional synagogues.)
SARAH SEEKS TO PROTECT ISAAC: THE EXPULSION OF HAGAR AND ISHMAEL (21:8–13)
<b><i>on Isaac’s weaning day.</i></b> I Samuel 1:23 and II Maccabees 7:27 indicate that in ancient Israel, children were weaned at about three years of age.
<i><b>great feast.</b></i> Weaning apparently was marked by a ritual, the details of which have not been preserved. This life-passage is obviously significant to mother and child.

Verse 9

<b><i>Sarah saw the son…playing.</i></b> Ishmael’s precise action is at issue. All we know for sure is that it triggers a severe reaction in Sarah. The word <i>m’tzachek</i> (“playing”) puns on the name Isaac (<i>yitzchak</i>). It can also mean “mocking,” “fooling around,” and toying with him sexually.

Verse 10

<b><i>“Throw this slave girl and her son out.”</i></b> [From a feminist perspective, the call for the expulsion of Hagar raises troubling questions. The story portrays the oppression of one woman by another; it also places responsibility for the enmity between two peoples—the descendants of Isaac and those of Ishmael—upon women, especially Sarah. As a story about domestic relations, the narrative builds sympathy for Hagar at Sarah’s expense. Some scholars respond by pointing out that Sarah’s concern is legitimate. As an old woman she anticipates her young son’s vulnerable position in the event of her death. She takes steps to protect him by removing the competition for Abraham’s possessions—and possibly also for his affection. Rather than casting a human drama in simplistic terms, the story of Sarah, Hagar, and Abraham poignantly illustrates the dilemma of multiple commitments. Among other things, this passage may seek to sensitize the reader to the plight of the outsider. —<i>Ed.</i>] <i><b>“The son of this slave girl is not going to share in the inheritance.”</b></i> Sarah raises inheritance as the issue, stressing meanwhile that Hagar is a slave. In 17:19, God had earmarked Isaac to receive the covenantal promise, and perhaps Sarah is acting with that knowledge. Ancient law collections from Mesopotamia address inheritance in similar cases, illustrating ancient customs that may lie in the background of this story. In the collection of Lipit Ishtar, the status of the second wife determines whether or not her son inherits. In the collection of Hammurabi, a child of a slave inherits only if the father claims him. The sons of Zilpah and Bilhah—women of a status similar to Hagar—do later inherit along with the children of the primary wives, Leah and Rachel. Perhaps Sarah objects to such an arrangement because her son is so young and she may not be around to protect him.

Verse 11

<b><i>This grieved Abraham greatly, on account of his son.</i></b> The text does not clarify what “this” is, or specify which son he refers to; therefore what bothers Abraham is open to interpretation. One might suppose here that Abraham is not concerned about Hagar, but God’s response in the next verse (“do not be grieved…over your slave”) implies otherwise.

Verse 12

<b><i>“Do whatever Sarah tells you,”</i></b> Abraham is instructed to obey his wife, literally “whatever Sarah says to you, listen to her voice.” In 3:17 the man was chastised for listening to his wife’s voice. [God’s rebuke in 3:17 might lead readers to conclude that listening to a wife’s voice is wrong. God’s instruction in the present passage illustrates that this is not the case. —<i>Ed.</i>] | God supports Sarah’s concern about inheritance. Abraham’s distrust that the Deity will care for both his sons may be the background for the Deity’s decision to test Abraham in the episode that follows this story of Ishmael.

Verse 13



Verse 14

THE RESCUE OF HAGAR AND ISHMAEL IN THE DESERT (21:14–21) Once again, Hagar is in the wilderness (compare 16:7–14). Earlier, she had been pregnant with Ishmael and had left of her own accord. This time she has her son on her back and is sent away.
<b><i>Early next morning, Abraham got up.</i></b> Though not translated identically here, these words in Hebrew are the same as in 22:3, where Abraham rises to sacrifice Isaac. The common phrasing connects the two episodes, both of which deal with the potential death of a son of Abraham.
<i><b>took bread and a waterskin and handed them to Hagar, placing them and the boy on her shoulder.</b></i> Placing the child on Hagar’s back hints that Ishmael is a small child, though, according to the preceding notices (17:23–25; 21:5, 8), Ishmael at this point is at least fifteen years of age. The narrator uses poetic license to depict Ishmael as younger and more vulnerable to make the scene more poignant.
<i><b>cast her out.</b></i> [The verb is used for divorce but more literally means “sent her out.” It will be used when Pharaoh lets the Israelites go from slavery (Exodus 13:17). Tikva Frymer-Kensky points out that Hagar and Ishmael are not sold and suggests that they are freed. They leave Abraham’s household as emancipated slaves (<i>Reading the Women of the Bible,</i> 2002, p. 235). See, however, at v. 10. —<i>Ed</i>.]

Verse 15



Verse 16

<b><i>“Let me not see the child’s death.”</i></b> The scene is heartrending. Watching one’s child die must be horrible; what might be worse is leaving one’s child to die alone.
<i><b>she sat and wept in a loud voice.</b></i> The verse states that she placed her child at some distance, implying that they could not hear each other.

Verse 17

<b><i>God heard the boy’s cry, and from heaven an angel of God called to Hagar.</i></b> Hagar weeps—but the Deity focuses on the boy’s cry. The message of assurance comes to her, however, because she herself has moved so far from him that she cannot hear him.

Verse 18

<b><i>“I am going to make of him a great nation.”</i></b> This statement reiterates the earlier divine promise that her “seed” will be numerous (16:10).

Verse 19



Verse 20



Verse 21

 Unlike most biblical women, Hagar herself finds her son a wife. Ishmael’s wife is from Egypt, like Hagar herself (16:1).

Verse 22

<i>Second Threat to Isaac</i>
ABRAHAM’S “BINDING OF ISAAC,” OR “THE AKEDAH” (21:22–22:21)
ABRAHAM SETTLES IN BEERSHEBA (21:22–34)
<b><i>At that time.</i></b> Abraham’s negotiations over wells near Beersheba seemingly have little to do with Ishmael or Isaac; yet this new residence is on the edge of the desert, not far from where the text just left Hagar and Ishmael (v. 21). Meanwhile, it is the same town to which Abraham will go (22:19) at the end of the next episode, which features Isaac.

Chapter 22



Verse 1

ABRAHAM’S “TEST”: THE BINDING OF ISAAC (22:1–19) In this episode, one of the most famous in Genesis, Sarah the mother is completely absent—a striking absence given that her only son is the subject of God’s instructions. Apparently she does not need to be tested.
<b><i>After these things.</i></b> What are “these things”: Isaac’s birth? Banishing Ishmael? The expulsion of Hagar? Settling near Ishmael?
<i><b>God tested Abraham.</b></i> The text never explains why Abraham needs to be tested. Perhaps his actions thus far have somehow not been adequate.

Verse 2

<b><i>“your only one, the one you love.”</i></b> These touching words to describe Isaac can be challenged. Isaac is not Abraham’s only son. [They might be explained as a recognition that Isaac is now the only legal son because Abraham has banished Ishmael. —<i>Ed</i>.] Nor have we been told that Abraham has expressed any feelings toward Isaac.
<i><b>“Offer him there as a burnt-offering.”</b></i> Abraham, the man who advocates for Ishmael (17:18) and actively negotiates with the Deity for the people of Sodom (18:23–33), is surprisingly silent after receiving the command.

Verse 3

<b><i>Abraham rose early.</i></b> See at 21:14.

Verse 4



Verse 5

<b><i>“We will…return to you,”</i></b> Is Abraham afraid that the servants will try to stop him? Or does he know the Deity will not let him carry out the instructions?

Verse 6



Verse 7

<b><i>“Father!”</i></b> This is Isaac’s first word in the Torah.
<i><b>“Here I am, my son.”</b></i> Abraham’s response— the first time in the Torah that he calls Isaac his son—are words of comfort.
<i><b>“but where is the lamb for the burnt-offering?”</b></i> Isaac is old enough to know what is necessary for a burnt-offering and that they do not have it. Does he sense how much is amiss? Commentators debate whether or not Isaac is aware of what is going to happen.

Verse 8



Verse 9

<b><i>9–10.</i></b> Abraham carries out his actions methodically, with no reported words or emotion—unlike when he lost Ishmael (21:11). Isaac, too, is silent.

Verse 10



Verse 11



Verse 12



Verse 13



Verse 14



Verse 15



Verse 16

<b><i>16–17. “because you…did not withhold your son… I will…make your descendants…numerous.”</i></b> God had promised Abraham numerous progeny even before this test (12:2; 13:16; 15:5; 17:5). What then would have happened had Abraham not attempted to sacrifice Isaac?

Verse 17



Verse 18



Verse 19

 The text mentions Abraham and his servants, but not Isaac. Isaac and Abraham are never represented together again. When Isaac reappears in the text, he is near Be’er-lachai-ro’i (24:62), where pregnant Hagar had gone when she ran away from Sarah (16:14).

Verse 20

<i>Preparation for the Future</i>
REBEKAH’S BIRTH (22:20–24)
Sandwiched between the binding of Isaac and Sarah’s death (in the next parashah) is a paragraph concerning Rebekah’s family. This parashah ends with Isaac safe, and with his future wife born to the right woman from the right lineage. Rebekah, the matriarch for the next generation, appears immediately before the previous one, Sarah, dies. This passage emphasizes the women in the lineage and highlights the importance of women in the “patriarchal” line of the people of Israel. On the role of women in the Israelite lineage, see also at 17:19, 22.
<b><i>Milcah.</i></b> We were told of her marriage to Nahor when she was first introduced with Sarai (11:29), before Abram’s household left the city of Haran for Canaan. Now she is mentioned again—and once more in verse 23—just before Sarah dies (23:1–2). Rebekah will also mention her grandmother Milcah when she identifies herself (24:24, 47). It is not clear why Milcah merits her relative prominence.

Verse 21



Verse 22



Verse 23

<b><i>Bethuel fathered Rebekah.</i></b> The text highlights only Rebekah in her generation. Rebekah is important not only because she will marry Isaac (Genesis 24) but also because she proves to be decisive in arranging for the transfer of the covenantal blessing in the next generation (27:6–13). Although we know the name of Rebekah’s grandmother, Milcah, we never learn the name of her mother.
<i><b>Milcah.</b></i> See at v. 20.

Verse 24

<b><i>Maacah.</i></b> [Probably referring to a daughter rather than a son. In the Bible, this name is borne by at least eight other individuals—all of whom are, or might be, women. Biblical genealogies do occasionally identify a lineage by a woman’s name. Here it seems to represent an Aramean people who lived east of the Jordan (see Deuteronomy 3:14; <i>The Contemporary Torah,</i> 2006, pp. xxii–xxiv). Maacah’s mention perhaps further anticipates the forthcoming union between Isaac and Rebekah in Genesis. <i>—Ed</i>.] —<i>Tammi J. Schneider</i>   

Chapter 23



Verse 1

<i>Sarah’s Death Leads Abraham to Acquire Land</i>
THE PURCHASE OF THE FIELD OF MACHPELAH (23:1–20)
Why does the Torah present such a lengthy description of the purchase of the cave of Machpelah? Biblical narrative is usually sparing of details about realia and daily life, yet the negotiations over the purchase of the field containing the cave of Machpelah are reported fully. It seems that the purchase of the field symbolizes Abraham and his family’s legal ownership of the entire promised land.
Abraham does not wish to purchase just a cave, but rather a whole burial site. He is particularly interested in Ephron’s plot since it is apparently located on the outskirts of the town (23:9 and 17). All this would limit potential friction with Hebron’s residents and ensure him free access to the cave. Abraham struggles to find a resting place not only for Sarah, but also for the generations he hopes would descend from him. This reflects the tension between his presently temporary status (no land and no assurance of descendants in his central line) and the promise that God has repeatedly made to him (a divine promise of land and progeny).
According to the Bible, this site will also become the burial place of Abraham, Isaac, Rebekah, Jacob, and Leah (Genesis 25:9–10, 35:27–29, 49:29–32, 50:13); hundreds of years later, the nearby city of Hebron will also serve as capital of David’s kingdom until he conquers Jerusalem.
SARAH’S DEATH (23:1–2)
<b><i>Sarah lived.</i></b> Though beginning with her life, the chapter actually focuses on her death and burial. However, the notice that the marriage of Isaac and Rebekah is consummated in Sarah’s tent (24:67) suggests that her life continues through the next matriarch.

Verse 2

<b><i>Sarah died.</i></b> No explanation is given as a cause of her death. It is reasonable to assume that it was her age, but as Abraham was last seen in Beersheba (22:19), some distance from where Sarah died, one may ask: Did Sarah know about Abraham’s binding of Isaac (Genesis 22)? Was that a factor in her death? Perhaps Sarah had been living apart from Abraham.
<i><b>Kiriath-arba.</b></i> Another name for Hebron.
<i><b>Abraham proceeded to mourn for Sarah and to bewail her.</b></i> This verse marks one of only two instances where the Torah uses the root <i>s-p-d,</i> to mourn. (The other is in Genesis 50:10, when Joseph mourns the passing of his father Jacob.) This is also the only place where the text mentions details of mourning in connection with a woman’s death. Even Jacob’s mourning over his beloved Rachel is not recorded (Genesis 35:19–20).

Verse 3

ABRAHAM NEGOTIATES FOR A BURIAL GROUND (23:3–18) As soon as Abraham rises from beside Sarah’s body, he seeks out her burial place. Abraham addresses a representative body of town citizens that is called “the Hittites” but also “the people of the land” (v. 7) and “the town leaders” (literally “those who entered the gate of the city”; v. 10). Hittites are associated with an ancient empire that was centered in today’s Turkey.
As Abraham declares at the outset, he is a resident alien (a “foreigner living for a time” among the native population) and thus dependent upon the good will of the local landowners. He makes it clear that he wishes to acquire an entire burial site, including field, cave and trees—not only a cave. This language reflects Abraham’s attempt to realize God’s first promise to him, of land. It also foreshadows his steps to realize God’s second promise, of progeny (Genesis 24).

Verse 4



Verse 5



Verse 6

<b><i>“a mighty prince in our midst.”</i></b> The Hittites address Abraham with a respectful title.

Verse 7

<b><i>7–9.</i></b> The courtesy, respect, and ready response of the Hittites allow Abraham to specify that he is particularly interested in the cave within the plot of Ephron, and that he wishes to purchase it at whatever price they require.
 <i><b>12–13.</b></i> Abraham makes it clear that he does not want a grant or gift; rather, he desires legal rights to the entire field through full purchase of the property.

Verse 8



Verse 9



Verse 10



Verse 11



Verse 12



Verse 13



Verse 14

<b><i>14–15.</i></b> Ephron takes advantage of the situation and demands an exorbitant sum.

Verse 15



Verse 16

<b><i>16–18.</i></b> Abraham does not haggle, but hastens to pay the required sum, high as it might be. The purchase is made according to legal custom in the presence of the town’s leaders, at the city gate, which is the traditional seat of justice and place to notarize transactions. The text emphasizes that the purchase includes the field and all it contains. Similar declarations recur afterward (25:9–10, 49:29–32, 50:13), indicating the importance of the purchase.

Verse 17



Verse 18



Verse 19

CONCLUSION: SARAH’S BURIAL (23:19–20) More time is devoted to the negotiations than to the burial itself (on burial customs, see <i>Va-y’chi,</i> Another View). After Sarah is buried, the text reiterates that the field and all within it became Abraham’s rightful possession. Thus Sarah’s grave is the first permanent, legal presence in the land promised to Abraham and to their descendants.

Chapter 24



Verse 1

<i>Abraham Ensures the Covenant’s Continuity</i>
REBEKAH BECOMES ISAAC’S WIFE (24:1–67)
The major factor that motivates the story of Rebekah’s betrothal is Abraham’s concern with preventing his son Isaac, his designated heir to the divine promise, from establishing blood ties with the Canaanites in the land. The story turns upon divine providence and God’s covert intervention. God is present behind the scenes, planning and directing the course of events.
Concerns with group identity and its relation to the surroundings continue throughout the patriarchal and matriarchal narratives, which repeatedly stress ties with the land of Israel. Thus Abraham takes pains to obtain his servant’s promise not to allow Isaac to return to the land Abraham left behind. At the same time, Abraham sends his servant to bring a wife for Isaac from his extended family in the distant homeland, preferring family ties over those with the natives of the land. In contrast to this attitude, the story of Joseph will later report, with no hint of criticism, that he marries the Egyptian daughter of an Egyptian priest (Genesis 41:45). In other words, Genesis integrates apparently conflicting positions alongside each other—as is found throughout the Bible. One tendency calls for keeping separate from the other nations (see Deuteronomy 7:1–4, 23:4–9; Ezra 9–11), while the other outlook is universalistic and open to the stranger (see Exodus 12:38; Ruth 1–4).
This story also reflects the seemingly dual (even contradictory) positions that women hold throughout the <i>Tanach:</i> at times as passive characters, and at others as decision makers who assert their will on others. The text introduces Rebekah to the reader through a narrative account (24:15–16); but Rebekah introduces herself to the servant using her own words (24:24). At first, Rebekah’s brother and father, Laban and Bethuel, give Rebekah to the servant so that she might marry Isaac (24:51). However, Rebekah is the one whose consent is needed before the caravan can depart (24:58). When Isaac wanders into the vicinity of Rebekah’s camels (24:63), the story again focuses on Rebekah. At this point, she acts of her own volition.
This chapter, with 67 verses, is the longest in the book of Genesis. Its length is a direct result of the artistic use of repetition. Verses 15–20 report how all that the servant prayed for in vv. 13–14 actually transpired, and vv. 35–48 reiterate all that happened to the servant in vv. 2–26. The repetitions are not verbatim; rather, they display considerable alterations that shed light on the character of the servant, Rebekah, and the members of her family.
EXPOSITION: ABRAHAM AS BLESSED (24:1)
This verse emphasizes Abraham’s wealth.

Verse 2

ABRAHAM COMMISSIONS HIS SERVANT TO BRING A WIFE FOR ISAAC (24:2–10a)
<b><i>2–3.</i></b> The thigh represents the male organ. Apparently, one who touches this member when swearing an oath is obliged to uphold that oath on pain of either sterility or death of offspring. That Abraham insists on such a grave oath illustrates the importance of the “right” wife for Isaac.

Verse 3

<b><i>“daughters of the Canaanites.”</i></b> See at 28:1.

Verse 4

<b><i>“a wife for my son.”</i></b> The word for “wife,” <i>ishah,</i> also means “woman.” It recurs frequently in these verses, emphasizing Abraham’s fear that Isaac will marry the “wrong” woman.

Verse 5

<b><i>“Suppose the woman does not care to.”</i></b> Literally, “perhaps the woman will be unwilling.” The servant’s question implies that the woman can legally choose to refuse. A woman cannot simply be “taken.”

Verse 6

<b><i>6–8.</i></b> Abraham’s response introduces a key biblical concept: the special bond between the family of the patriarchs and the land of Israel.

Verse 7



Verse 8

<b><i>does not care to follow.</i></b> See at v. 5 above.

Verse 9



Verse 10

THE SERVANT MEETS REBEKAH AT THE WELL (24:10b–27)

Verse 11



Verse 12

 <b>“יהוה,</b> <i><b>God of my master Abraham, please bring me luck today.</b>”</i> The turn of events is even better than the servant has reason to expect. The developments appear to be the result of chance, but actually the reader has enough signs to understand that they are directed by God.

Verse 13

<b><i>“the daughters of the townspeople are going forth to draw water.”</i></b> A well figures in two other biblical stories as the meeting place where the hero encounters the woman he will marry (Jacob meets Rachel in Genesis 29:1–14; Moses meets Zipporah in Exodus 2:15–22). It is likely that this motif is rooted in ancient social reality, in which the well served as a place of meeting and assembly (Judges 5:11). In the framework of this motif, the characters’ behavior by the well is tested. In the present story, the girl’s hospitality surpasses the servant’s expectations. [Drawing well water appears to be the task specifically of the households’ daughters, who proceed unchaperoned (see also v. 11; I Samuel 9:11). —<i>Ed.</i>]

Verse 14



Verse 15

<b><i>Milcah.</i></b> See at 11:29 and 22:20.
<i><b>going forth.</b></i> As soon as Rebekah is introduced, she is an active character.

Verse 16

 Rebekah possesses three virtues that neither Abraham nor the servant had stipulated.
<i><b>marriageable age.</b></i> The word <i>b’tulah</i> is often translated as “virgin” but has a broader meaning than a biological one. In the ancient world, women often married shortly after puberty; therefore, one can assume that Rebekah is very young. Isaac, her future husband, is forty years old (25:20).
<i><b>whom no man had yet known.</b></i> To “know” in the Bible often refers to sexual relationships. This phrase indicates that Rebekah is a virgin (see at 4:1).

Verse 17



Verse 18

<b><i>18–19.</i></b> Once the servant asks Rebekah for “a little water” from her jar (v. 17), she assumes the role of primary actor. Rebekah’s response portrays her as an energetic and resourceful woman, one ready to engage in conversation with a total stranger rather than retreat from such an encounter. Nothing suggests that Rebekah, or other women, were expected to be in seclusion, away from men’s gaze or contact, as would become customary later in the Middle East (see also 29:1–10).
<b><i>“Drink, sir!”</i></b> Rebekah instructs him gently.

Verse 19

<b><i>“I will draw some for your camels, too.”</i></b> Given the amount of water a camel drinks, this is no easy task.

Verse 20



Verse 21



Verse 22

<b><i>22–27.</i></b> Based on this impressive display of character, the servant presents Rebekah with adornments even before she informs him that she is the granddaughter of Abraham’s brother. Her lineage is additional and decisive proof of divine intervention.

Verse 23



Verse 24

<b><i>“I am Bethuel’s daughter; [he is] the son of Milcah, whom she bore to Nahor.”</i></b> Rebekah introduces herself by naming her grandmother Milcah (compare v. 15). Rebekah’s mother remains unnamed in the story, even though she plays a role in the marriage negotiations (24:53).

Verse 25



Verse 26



Verse 27



Verse 28

THE SERVANT MEETS LABAN (24:28–31) Rebekah’s brother Laban is the negative counterpart to Rebekah’s character. While she displays gracious hospitality toward the stranger, Laban is impressed first and foremost with the adornments she received from the stranger. Only then does Laban hasten to greet him.
<b><i>her mother’s household.</i></b> Although the servant asked about her <i>father’s</i> house (24:23), Rebekah goes to her <i>mother’s</i> house. At the end of this chapter she will move into Sarah’s tent (24:67). The mention of women’s domain (tent or house) occurs only in Genesis 24, the book of Ruth (1:8), and Song of Songs (3:4, 8:2)—texts in which we find women of strong character. The expression “mother’s household” <i>(beit em)</i> emphasizes that the household is associated with women’s activities. (For details about women’s roles and households, see further Women in Ancient Israel—An Overview.)

Verse 29



Verse 30



Verse 31



Verse 32

REBEKAH’S BETROTHAL (24:32–54a) All the members of Rebekah’s family take part in this encounter.

Verse 33



Verse 34



Verse 35

<b><i>35–49.</i></b> The servant emphasizes divine intervention in order to convince his hosts that his mission is in accordance with divine will—so that they will entrust Rebekah to him. The servant is also aware of the human weaknesses of his hosts; he therefore expands his description of Abraham’s wealth (v. 35) and stresses that Isaac is his master’s sole heir (v. 36). He also reverses the order in which he asked the name of the girl and presented her with ornaments so they would not say, “How could you give her [the jewelry] when you did not yet know who she was?” (Rashi).
 <i><b>50–51.</b></i> After the servant’s speech, it is wholly fitting that those present admit that the matter is in accordance with divine will, and that they therefore agree to place Rebekah in the servant’s care.

Verse 55

<b><i>Her brother and mother.</i></b> [These two family members conduct the negotiations regarding the marriage that was approved in vv. 50–51. —<i>Ed.</i>]

Verse 56



Verse 57



Verse 58

<b><i>“I will go.”</i></b> Rebekah’s decision to leave her homeland and her family, go to a new place, and live with a man unknown to her, is reminiscent of Abraham, who left everything behind him in order to fulfill a divine command (12:1). Women’s contribution to the fulfillment of national destiny finds its expression not only in their role as childbearers but also in their ability to take bold and vital action at critical moments. Rebekah’s actions will later find an echo in Ruth’s leaving her father, mother, and land of her own accord. When Ruth joins her fate with that of her mother-in-law, Naomi, and subsequently marries Naomi’s kinsman Boaz, Ruth too contributes to fulfilling the national destiny, in that King David would be the future offspring of that union.
The apparent role of chance in both stories, as expressed by the Hebrew root <i>k-r-h,</i> links the book of Ruth and the story of Rebekah. The servant requests of God “please bring me luck today” (24:12), while of Ruth it is written “as luck would have it, it was the piece of land belonging to Boaz” (Ruth 2:3). Divine providence seems to direct the fate of both these women. Moreover, when the servant learns Rebekah’s identity, he blesses God, saying, “Blessed is יהוה, God of my master Abraham, whose faithful kindness has not deserted my master” (Genesis 24:27). Likewise, when Naomi learns where Ruth gleaned, she pronounces a similar blessing, “Blessed be he of יהוה, who has not failed in kindness…!” (Ruth 2:20).

Verse 59

REBEKAH DEPARTS (24:59–61) The family’s blessing of Rebekah serves to reinforce her role in fulfilling the divine promises God made to Abraham—not only the blessing of progeny, but also a continued blessing of land.
<b><i>her nurse.</i></b> [Heb. <i>menekta</i> (her wet nurse). From Exodus 2—where Moses’ mother is hired to nurse him for Pharaoh’s daughter—we learn that wet nurses were sometimes paid (see at Exodus 2:910). Carol Meyers points out that most Israelite women (and their ancestors) probably nursed their own children, except perhaps for women in elite classes (<i>Exodus</i>, 2005, p. 41). | In this account, the nurse apparently has remained in the household long after Rebekah was weaned, implying that they have a special bond; she might function as a surrogate mother or companion for young Rebekah in a foreign land. Genesis 35:8 will mention this nurse again by name, with a notice of her death and burial in Beth El; see comment there. —<i>Ed.</i>]

Verse 60

<b><i>“may you become thousands of myriads.”</i></b> Jews traditionally use this first part of the blessing in the <i>bedeken</i> ceremony before a wedding, when the groom places the veil upon the bride’s face.
<i><b>“may your descendants.”</b></i> [The family blesses Rebekah with the identical blessing that God’s messenger used for Abraham in 22:17. —<i>Ed</i>]

Verse 61

<b><i>servant girls.</i></b> [Their mention, like that of a wet nurse, implies that Rebekah’s family is affluent. —<i>Ed.</i>]

Verse 62

REBEKAH MEETS ISAAC (24:62–66) The text reintroduces Isaac by explaining that he had returned from the vicinity of Be’er-lachai-ro’i, the place where God has been revealed to Hagar (16:13–14). Yet as soon as Isaac sees the approaching camels (24:63), it is she who becomes the subject of the verbs (24:64).

Verse 63



Verse 64



Verse 65

<b><i>“my master.”</i></b> This is the first time that the servant calls Isaac “my master” and not “my master’s son.” <i><b>Taking a veil, she covered herself.</b></i> Rebekah’s action may signal modesty. Is it because of her new status as a married woman? Not enough is known about the role of veils in ancient Israel.

Verse 66

 As if the presence of Rebekah as wife elevates Isaac to the role of master, the servant tells Isaac (not Abraham) all that had occurred. Isaac is now fully established as the legitimate successor to his father.

Verse 67

CONCLUSION: REBEKAH MOVES INTO SARAH’S TENT (24:67) The appearance of Rebekah, who is brought to his mother’s tent, comforts Isaac for the death of his mother and hints to the reader to expect the continued fulfillment of the divine promises to the line of Abraham, through Isaac and Rebekah. This final verse, which focuses on Isaac’s emotional connections to his mother and to his new wife, reasserts the central role that women play in realizing God’s covenantal promises. Sarah’s death had inspired Abraham to purchase the field of Machpelah as a burial site (chapter 23), while Rebekah’s marriage to Isaac will soon allow the family to be blessed with more children.
<i><b>tent of his mother.</b></i> The combination of “tent” with “mother” appears only here. (On the similar combination of “household” with “mother,” see at 24:28.)
<i><b>she became his wife and he loved her.</b></i> This is the first time that we read about a man’s love for a woman. Biblical literature only twice mentions women’s love of men (Michal’s love for David in I Samuel 18:20 and 28; and the Song of Songs). Men’s love appears more frequently, as for example Jacob’s love for Rachel (Genesis 29:18), Shechem’s love of Dinah (34:3), and Jonathan’s love for David (I Samuel 18:1, 3). In many of those cases, as in ours, the use of the verb “love” implies a sexual relationship.

Chapter 25



Verse 1

<i>Abraham’s Descendants and His Death (25:1–18)</i>
The final unit reports Abraham’s additional marriage to Keturah, his additional offspring by Keturah, and their settling in the land of the East (vv. 1–4); Isaac’s favored position (vv. 5–6); the length of Abraham’s life, his death, and his burial (vv. 7–11); and finally the genealogy of Ishmael’s descendants, their dwelling-place, the length of Ishmael’s life, and his death (vv. 12–18).
In the previous story, Abraham’s concern was providing Isaac with a wife. In this unit, he takes steps to ensure that his other sons shall have no portion in the inheritance of the land of Canaan, which is destined for Isaac’s hands alone. In this manner, he fulfills Sarah’s demand that others will not inherit with her son Isaac (21:10).
THE DESCENDANTS OF KETURAH (25:1–4)
Some interpreters see Keturah as one of Abraham’s concubines, since v. 6 mentions “the sons of Abraham’s concubines.” Such is in fact stated in I Chronicles 1:32. The name Keturah is connected in Hebrew to incense and fragrant spices (see Song of Songs 3:6). The Bible gives no further information about her (but see Post-biblical Interpretations).

Verse 2

<b><i>2–4.</i></b> The names of the sons of Keturah are those of nomadic desert tribes.

Verse 3



Verse 4



Verse 5

ISAAC’S STATUS (25:5–6) The fact that Abraham wills what he owns to Isaac, while only leaving gifts to the sons he had with his concubines, further asserts Rebekah’s central role as replacing Sarah (see 24:67).

Verse 6

 Abraham’s grant of gifts to his sons is reported before his death is, indicating that he took care to dispose of the inheritance in his lifetime.
<i><b>concubines.</b></i> [The reference seems to be to Hagar and Keturah. Hagar is also described as Sarah’s slave (25:12). The Hebrew word <i>pilegesh</i> (concubine) may derive from Greek. It refers to women with a status between a wife and a slave: technically independent, with sustenance coming from the man or men in the household, yet free to leave (compare Judges 19:1–3). A 3rd-century-<small>B.C.E</small>. Greek source (Demosthenes) observes that men have concubines “for the care of the body,” namely, for sexual relations. Often the children of concubines were excluded from inheriting, as here. —<i>Ed.</i>]

Verse 7

ABRAHAM’S DEATH AND BURIAL (25:7–11)
<b><i>7–10.</i></b> The description of Abraham’s burial emphasizes the cooperation between Isaac and Ishmael. If the two half-brothers had felt some emotional distance from each other beforehand, we can presume that they reconciled at this point.

Verse 8

<b><i>gathered to his people.</i></b> [In this expression the text’s original audience would have understood the kinship term <i>ammim</i> in a gender-inclusive sense, as the translation here reflects (“people”). Despite the Bible’s reliance on patrilineal genealogies and on patronymics, female relatives counted as kin. See at Genesis 10:1 and Numbers 31:2; see also <i>The Contemporary Torah,</i> 2006, s.v. “predecessors,” p. 408. —<i>Ed.</i>]

Verse 9



Verse 10

<b><i>there Abraham and his wife Sarah were buried.</i></b> The reiterated note about the legitimate purchase of the cave of Machpelah emphasizes the importance of acquiring property through purchase in the land of Israel. The mention of Sarah’s burial is a reminder of the critical role that she played not only in Abraham’s life, but also in his realization of the divine promise of land.

Verse 11



Verse 12

HAGAR’S DESCENDANTS (25:12–18)
<b><i>borne by Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah’s slave.</i></b> Ishmael’s line is credited to his mother, whose identity is fully recalled. The sons of Ishmael are nomadic tribal peoples who dwelt on the southwest and southeast fringes of the land of Israel.
<i>—Yairah Amit</i>   

Verse 13



Verse 14



Verse 15



Verse 16



Verse 17



Verse 18



Verse 19

<i>Rebekah Becomes the Mother of Twins</i> (25:19–19)
The opening unit focuses on Rebekah’s pregnancy: how it came about, what was its nature, what steps she took, and what was the result. Twenty years after we first meet her in Genesis 24, Rebekah again proves resourceful and energetic, as she seeks God to inquire about her distressing situation.
<b><i>Abraham begot Isaac.</i></b> The last mention of Isaac highlighted his bond with his mother (24:67), yet the formulaic genealogical note here does not reflect Sarah’s importance in Isaac’s life.

Verse 20

<b><i>he took as his wife Rebekah daughter of Bethuel the Aramean of Paddan-Aram, the sister of Laban the Aramean.</i></b> Rebekah has been identified several times in Genesis 24. By adding place names, her personal lineage emphasizes that she is now far from home. Absent from this list is Milcah, Rebekah’s grandmother, whom Rebekah herself mentions when she first identifies herself (24:24; see also 24:15).

Verse 21

<b><i>Isaac pleaded.</i></b> We do not learn about Rebekah’s feelings concerning her childlessness, nor are we told that she does anything to try to change the situation. Isaac could have taken other wives to solve the problem of continuity (see at “childless,” below), but he apparently does not. Isaac’s sensitivity to Rebekah stands out in contrast to Jacob, who chastises his barren wife Rachel when she asks for children (30:2).
<i><b>on behalf of his wife.</b></i> Literally, “in front of his wife,” implying that Rebekah is present. Why does she not pray herself? Hannah is the exemplar of a woman who prays to have a child (I Samuel 1).
<i><b>childless.</b></i> Heb. <i>akarah,</i> the same word translated as “barren” in describing Sarah’s condition (11:30) and Rachel’s (29:31). In contrast to stories about these other matriarchs or Hannah, we are not told that Rebekah resorts to “extreme measures” to ensure fertility. Ancient Near Eastern documents describe adoption as one of the strategies for handling the social and economic problems resulting from lack of progeny. Another potential solution is reflected in Genesis 16, where Sarah gives Abraham her handmaid Hagar in order to produce an offspring. Elsewhere in the Bible, women resort to prayer (Hannah in I Samuel 1) or a presumed fertility plant (see Rachel bargaining with Leah for mandrakes in Genesis 30:14). For more on barrenness, see <i>Noach,</i> Another View.

Verse 22

<b><i>The children pressed.…She thought.</i></b> Although there is no mention that Rebekah turned to God when she could not conceive, she does so in response to her pregnancy.
<i><b>“why do I exist?”</b></i> Literally, “why am I?” Interpreters often say that Rebekah is bemoaning her physical pain. However, the text mentions only that the pregnancy is unsettling, not that it is painful. Instead, what prompts her question may be the prospect of multiple children, which in the Bible typically signals a special destiny. Far from complaining about her condition, Rebekah is wondering about her role in such destiny. God’s answer (v. 23) confirms such a reading, since it refers to the children’s future.
<i><b>inquire.</b></i> Heb. <i>lidrosh,</i> a verb that usually designates a formal consultation, in this case with God. The text pointedly omits any mention of mediated communication, which suggests that Rebekah addresses God directly, and that God responds to her with equal directness (v. 23). The earlier picture of Rebekah as gutsy, independent, and resourceful (Genesis 24) thus continues. Yet many interpreters both ancient and modern have distanced Rebekah from a direct contact with God. One rabbinic commentator claimed, for example, that she went to a house of study (see, Post-biblical Interpretations). Some modern feminist commentators have speculated that she receives the information in a dream (see citations in Alice Beilis, <i>Helpmates, Harlots, and Heroes,</i> 1994, pp. 82–83).

Verse 23

 <b>יהוה</b> <i><b>said to her.</b></i> God replies to Rebekah directly, informing her—not Isaac—about their sons’ future. Two other biblical mothers to whom God discloses their son’s future are Hagar (16:10–12, 21:17–18) and Samson’s mother (Judges 13:3–5).
<i><b>the elder shall serve the younger.</b></i> The poetic Hebrew is more ambiguous than the translation indicates—literally “elder serve younger,” which could also mean that the younger shall serve the elder. The text may seek to suggest that Jacob’s subsequent preeminence results from Rebekah’s interpretation. | The election of the younger over the elder is a theme that pervades Genesis. It may reflect a conflict relating to the audience’s national identity and the formation of a people in which newer traditions are integrated with older ones.

Verse 24

<b><i>When the time came for her to give birth.</i></b> The focus remains on Rebekah’s experience. The description of Isaac’s role in the conception has been limited to pleading.
<i><b>lo—she had twins in her belly!</b></i> A nearly identical expression appears again with the birth of Tamar’s twins (38:27). Each of these women eventually uses subterfuge in order to ensure what she believes is the right outcome: Tamar, in order to have a child (Genesis 38); Rebekah, to secure the future of the son she considers most worthy (Genesis 27).

Verse 25

<b><i>Esau.</i></b> The etymology of this name is unclear. Esau is also known as Edom (25:30, 36:8), which relates to “red” (<i>adom</i>). He will become the ancestor of the Edomites (36:9), a nation with which Israel has frequent conflict, according to later books of the Bible.

Verse 26

<b><i>Jacob.</i></b> Heb. <i>Yaakov,</i> which echoes the word “heel” (<i>akev</i>) and can also be translated as “he will act crookedly.”    

Verse 27

<i>Favoritism and the Selling of the Birthright</i> (25:27–27)
Beginning with the story of Cain and Abel (Genesis 4), favoritism plagues the subsequent generations (see Noah’s sons, 9:18–27; Isaac and Ishmael, 21:9–14; Joseph and his brothers, 37:3–35).

Verse 28

<b><i>favored.</i></b> Literally, “loved” (<i>ahav</i>). We are told why Isaac loves Esau: His son the hunter brings Isaac his favored meal of fresh game.
<i><b>Rebekah favored Jacob.</b></i> Rebekah’s love is left unexplained. Her favoritism of Jacob does not appear to depend on any self-gratification. Possibly her love serves as a compensation for Isaac’s preference of Esau, or perhaps is a response to Jacob’s nature as a “homespun man” who apparently stays close to home (v. 27). Her preference may also be related to how she interprets God’s words in 25:23; she favors the son she thinks has been selected by God.
There is only one other biblical narrative that mentions a woman’s love. In I Samuel 18, we read, “Michal, daughter of Saul, loved David” (I Samuel 18:20, 28). In both instances, the women eventually resort to deception to protect the one they love. (Michal rescues David from her father’s wrath and lies to her father about it; see I Samuel 19.) Love will soon spur Rebekah into deceiving Isaac in order to secure Jacob’s destiny (see Genesis 27).

Verse 29



Verse 30

<b><i>30–33.</i></b> Jacob’s manipulation of his short-sighted brother reflects poorly on both characters. Of the two, Jacob places value on what endures—a quality that may, in part, account for Rebekah’s machinations on his behalf. | Possessing the birthright, Jacob is now entitled to Isaac’s special blessings. The Hebrew term <i>b’chorah</i> (“birthright”) usually refers to the status of successor as head of the corporate household, which entails special economic and religious responsibilities as well as privileges. Normally in the ancient Near East, a first-born son possessed this status automatically, although he could barter it away or be stripped of it by the paterfamilias. Deuteronomy 21:15–17 presumes that the first-born son receives a disproportionate share of the inheritance.

Chapter 26



Verse 1

<i>Isaac and Rebekah “Visit” Abimelech</i>
ISAAC AT THE CENTER (26:1–33)
The Torah repeatedly portrays Isaac as a passive figure; he is largely overshadowed by other members of his family. Only in this passage does Isaac appear as the chief actor. Even here, however, his father looms large. In all these episodes Isaac walks in his father’s footsteps, performing deeds similar to his father’s but with different results. First, God’s blessings are bestowed upon him due solely to his father’s merit. Second, his lie that Rebekah is his sister (repeating Abraham’s “wife-sister” deceptions in Genesis 12 and 21) backfires. Third, the wells he digs are repeatedly taken away (Genesis 26:15; contrast with Abraham who stands his ground in Genesis 21). And yet, Isaac gains a moral victory and comes away blessed (see 26:29). In this fashion, he represents another mode of Jewish survival: compliance rather than confrontation.
ISAAC RECEIVES THE COVENANT PROMISE (26:1–5)
Isaac receives the covenant only on account of his father’s merit.
<b><i>Abimelech.</i></b> This is the name also of the king whom Abraham had deceived with the “wife-sister” ruse in Genesis 20.

Verse 2



Verse 3

<b><i>3–5. “I will be with you… because Abraham hearkened to My voice and kept My charge.”</i></b> God bestows blessings upon Isaac because of Abraham’s (not Isaac’s) merit, further underscoring his stature vis-à-vis his more distinguished father.

Verse 4



Verse 5



Verse 6

ISAAC PASSES HIS WIFE OFF AS HIS SISTER (26:6–11) This “wife-sister” episode, like those of Abraham and Sarah (Genesis 12 and 20), portrays a patriarch fearful for his life, protecting himself by posing his wife as his sister. The difference from Abraham and Sarah’s story is that Isaac thinks his wife is irresistibly attractive, but apparently no one else does. Nonetheless, Isaac and Rebekah receive royal protection.

Verse 7

 Like his father (20:11), Isaac pretends—out of fear—that Rebekah is his sister in order to protect himself.
<i><b>“she is so good-looking.”</b></i> The same description of Rebekah appears when the narrator introduces her in 24:16 (translated there as “exceedingly beautiful”). Narrative sequence implies that this visit takes place decades later. Apparently Isaac still considers Rebekah alluringly beautiful.

Verse 8

<b><i>his days there stretched out.</i></b> Sarah’s beauty prompted kings to take her to their palace (12:14–15; 20:2). However, in this episode, contrary to Isaac’s fears, no one takes Rebekah. Is it because she is not as attractive as Isaac supposes, or because King Abimelech learned his lesson with Abraham and Sarah? What follows indicates that Isaac continues to find his wife appealing and cannot keep himself away from her as time passes.
<i><b>Isaac fondling.</b></i> In an ironic twist, Isaac is caught “playing” with his wife. The verb <i>m’tzachek</i> is a pun on his name, <i>Yitzchak.</i> Here the term connotes laughter and playfulness of the sort that spouses engage in. It is identical with the verb used of Ishmael with Isaac in 21:9, where the connotations were less clear (see there).

Verse 9



Verse 10



Verse 11

 Rebekah’s position is not compromised. Isaac’s wealth results from his efforts and from God’s blessings.

Verse 12

ISAAC DIGS WELLS, LOSES THEM, PERSISTS, AND PROSPERS (26:12–33) Isaac’s peaceful disposition is apparent in the patience with which he digs and re-digs wells. When his ownership of wells is challenged, he relinquishes them, whereas Abraham had stood his ground (Genesis 21). Later, Isaac’s passivity and persistence pay off when Abimelech recognizes his merit and concludes a treaty with him (26:29).

Verse 34

<i>Esau Marries Canaanite Wives</i> (26:34–35)
The marriage of Esau brings consternation to both his parents. In 27:46, Rebekah claims that Esau’s marriages cause her despair. Isaac does nothing. One gathers that the fact the women are Canaanite is problematic (see at 28:1). Is this marriage one of the reasons why Rebekah chooses the drastic measures to pass the blessings to Jacob? Is it Isaac’s passivity in the face of what both consider a problem that moves her to take action?
<b><i>Judith.</i></b> This name’s debut in Esau’s family is surprising in light of its subsequent use: The masculine form, Judah, will come to designate the main tribe in Israelite history, becoming the basis of the Hebrew word for “Jew.” (The enduring popularity among Jews of the name Judith comes from a different source: the heroic central character in an ancient Jewish post-biblical book of the same name.)

Chapter 27



Verse 1

<i>Rebekah Ensures the Transmission of the Covenantal Blessings to Jacob</i> (27:1–28:9)
Rebekah appears to be in charge of the events in this episode, actively putting her plan into action. In order to implement what she understands as the divine plan, she must ensure that it is Jacob who receives the blessing from Isaac. Not being the head of the household, she lacks the authority to give Jacob the blessing directly. Rebekah thus works through Isaac, albeit without his explicit knowledge or consent. She creates a way to usurp his authority and use it for her own ends. If Rebekah had possessed the authority to work through the formal structures of inheritance, she would not have needed to use subterfuge and to pit brother against brother, son against father. Subterfuge is what women and men in positions of powerlessness, or of limited power, use to meet their rightful needs. See, for example, Tamar’s daring encounter with Judah (Genesis 38), and young David’s deception of King Achish (I Samuel 21:11–16). Because women generally lack certain authority in biblical narrative, they sometimes work out unusual tactics to resolve problems and achieve results. They take on the daring plots that dramatically alter the course of events. In biblical narratives, their acts are usually recognized as beneficial: lives are saved, the right side wins, the right son inherits, the family line continues.
Although the rabbinic sages primarily praise Rebekah for her actions, modern biblical scholars are more mixed in their readings of her actions. Some see her as a laudable trickster who must use stratagems to bend the male power structure to her purpose. Others see her as a manipulating schemer whose actions here fit into stereotyped expectations of female behavior, and who is punished for her behavior by never seeing her favorite child again. Adrien Bledstein offers an alternate reading of the episode, suggesting that Isaac is in fact the trickster: he is not deceived by Rebekah but rather has her do his dirty work for him (“Binder, Trickster, Heel…1993). (For a range of opinions on Rebekah, see Beilis, <i>Helpmates, Harlots, and Heroes</i>, 1994, pp. 80–84.)
ISAAC PREPARES TO BLESS ESAU (27:1–4)
<b><i>Isaac had grown old.</i></b> Isaac’s growing incapacity may play a role in Rebekah’s decision to shape the course of events.
<i><b>his elder son.</b></i> Throughout this episode, Esau is repeatedly identified in relation to his father and brother, and less so to his mother (see 27:6,11,42,44).

Verse 2



Verse 3



Verse 4



Verse 5

REBEKAH ARRANGES FOR JACOB TO RECEIVE ISAAC’S BLESSING INSTEAD (27:5–17)

Verse 6

<b><i>her son.</i></b> In contrast to Esau, Jacob is referred to several times as “her son” (see also v. 17). The language used here seems to exclude Esau from the kind of close relationship that Jacob has with Rebekah.
<i><b>“your father.”</b></i> In this chapter Isaac is never referred to in relation to Rebekah; he is called “father” (vv. 6, 9, 10, 14), but not Rebekah’s husband. Isaac’s importance to Rebekah seems to recede into the background, and her most primary relationship is with Jacob her son. Rebekah and Isaac converse only at the very end of the tale, when Rebekah intervenes (again) for Jacob’s sake (27:46). While Isaac is reported to have loved Rebekah upon seeing her (24:67), the narrative never states that Rebekah returns this love. The language in this section of the text connects her directly to her son Jacob, but not to Isaac.

Verse 7



Verse 8

<b><i>“listen to me.”</i></b> Rebekah will tell Jacob twice more to listen to her (vv. 13 and 43). She repeats herself to make sure that she has his attention. Carol Meyers notes that <i>authority</i> is the ability to control situations and decision-making through official channels and systems, whereas <i>power</i> involves doing so through more informal and unofficial avenues <i>(Discovering Eve: Ancient Israelite Women in Context,</i> 1988, p. 41). Here, Rebekah does not have the proper authority, but she has power. She cannot formally bestow the blessing upon Jacob, but she can ensure he listens to her.
<i><b>“instructing.”</b></i> Heb. <i>m’tzavah,</i> literally “command.” Because of their close relationship, Jacob is one person over whom Rebekah can exert some limited power—and, as his mother, also authority. She commands him to do as she directs.

Verse 9

<b><i>“likes.”</i></b> Heb. <i>ahav,</i> literally “loves”; compare 25:28.

Verse 10



Verse 11



Verse 12

 In going along with Rebekah’s plan, Jacob knowingly takes on the role of trickster vis-à-vis Isaac; in the process, Jacob learns from his mother how to achieve a goal by the use of subterfuge. Later, he himself will be tricked by Laban, his father-in-law, who will again use the ploy of covering up the truth to manipulate Jacob into marrying not his beloved Rachel, but her sister Leah (29:25). In turn, Jacob will refine his trickster status by convincing Laban to agree to an arrangement by which Jacob will depart with a significant percentage of Laban’s flock (Genesis 30).

Verse 13

<b><i>“Any curse that you get will be on me, son.”</i></b> Rebekah assures Jacob that if anyone is blamed or punished for what he is about to do, it will be she and not he. Her readiness to take responsibility can be seen as her understanding that what she is doing is not deception for personal gain, but the fulfillment of God’s plan as revealed to her during her pregnancy (25:23). The deception they are about to carry out is for the greater good, a case of “the ends justifies the means.”

Verse 14



Verse 15

<b><i>that she had in the house.</i></b> Images of domesticity fill Rebekah’s story. As Carol Meyers notes, women in ancient Israel held major roles within the household. They had the primary responsibility for educating the young as well as for transforming unprocessed ingredients into cooked, consumable food (<i>Discovering Eve,</i> 1988, pp. 145–146). Rebekah moves confidently throughout her family’s domain. She is in control of its clothing and of the preparation of its food. She decides when its livestock is to be slaughtered. Her tools for survival are the items immediately and easily available to her. Such things mark this as a woman’s story.
<i><b>dressed up her younger son Jacob.</b></i> The covering up of Jacob is the central element of Rebekah’s act of subterfuge. Like Tamar in Genesis 38, who covers herself with a veil, Rebekah can be successful only through the act of covering up, not by acting directly and out in the open.

Verse 16

<b><i>she wrapped.</i></b> The narrator repeatedly emphasizes Rebekah’s actions.

Verse 17

<b><i>she put the tasty food and the bread that she had made.</i></b> As with the clothing in v. 15, Rebekah uses what is on hand in the female sphere. The seemingly harmless domestic items of food or bread become the tools she uses to influence the course of events. The verse is clear that these are items whose preparation Rebekah has personally directed (and perhaps has undertaken herself), emphasizing her purposefulness in executing the plan.

Verse 18

JACOB STEALS ESAU’S BLESSING (27:18–29) The climax of this episode occurs when Jacob goes to Isaac posing as Esau and receives the blessing intended for his brother. In a dramatic scene between father and son, Isaac asks several times for reassurance that this is indeed Esau before him. Isaac, who cannot see well, uses all his other senses in trying to make sure this is the right son: he touches Jacob (vv. 22, 26), he listens to his voice (v. 22), he tastes his food (v. 25), and he smells him (v. 27). Isaac’s blessing of Jacob in this scene establishes Jacob as the heir to the covenantal promises. Although Isaac is depicted as a weak and passive dupe, the overly exaggerated and repetitive details presented here beg the question of how complicit Isaac is in the ruse.
<b><i>“which son of mine are you?”</i></b> Isaac asks the critical question. Rebekah has worked hard to cover up Jacob’s identity, dressing him in Esau’s clothes and putting in his hands the food made under her supervision (vv. 15–17).

Verse 19



Verse 20



Verse 21

<b><i>“Are you really my son Esau?”</i></b> Isaac is not only physically blind, but on a deeper level he refuses to recognize what would be clear to any parent. Can his knowledge of his children truly be so superficial that he can only distinguish between them visually? His question indicates doubt, yet he seems to want to believe this son before him.

Verse 22



Verse 23



Verse 24



Verse 25

<b><i>and he ate.</i></b> Although a lover of Esau’s hunt and cooking (25:28; 27:4, 9), Isaac seems unable to distinguish Esau’s cooking from Rebekah’s.

Verse 26

<b><i>“Pray come near and kiss me, son.”</i></b> For the third time, Isaac wants to make sure this is the right son. Is he really being fooled by the costume, as he was fooled by the food in the previous verse, or is he willingly allowing himself to be led through a charade? Perhaps Isaac is allowing himself to be misled; he is blind to what he chooses not to see.

Verse 27

<b><i>scent of his clothes.</i></b> Isaac smells not the son before him, but the clothes in which Jacob has disguised himself.

Verse 28

<b><i>28–29.</i></b> Isaac’s blessing to Jacob fulfills the prophecy given to Rebekah during her pregnancy (25:23), in accord with her apparent earlier interpretation of it: Jacob will be the primary son.
The manner in which the story is narrated up to this moment leaves open the possibility that Isaac not only knows that Jacob has the qualities needed for proceeding with the covenantal plan but also lets Rebekah arrange for Jacob to received his blessing. He could, however, be genuinely deceived.

Verse 29



Verse 30

ESAU DISCOVERS THE DECEPTION (27:30–40) The narration spotlights Esau’s heartbreaking cry as he begs his father for a blessing, which evokes the reader’s sympathy for the eldest son’s plight.

Verse 31



Verse 32



Verse 33



Verse 34

<b><i>“Me too, Father!”</i></b> Esau’s cry here echoes Jacob’s answer to Isaac in v. 18. They are both his sons; they both deserve his blessing.

Verse 35

 Although Rebekah had assured Jacob that any blame would be on her (v. 12), Isaac holds Jacob responsible for his actions. Adrien Bledstein reads this as Isaac’s acknowledgement that Jacob is, like himself, a fellow trickster (“Binder, Trickster, Heel…,” 1993, p. 288).
<i><b>“deceit.”</b></i> Heb. <i>mirmah,</i> which appears only once more in the Torah, when Jacob’s sons deceive Shechem and Hamor in Dinah’s story (34:13).

Verse 36

<b><i>“Jacob…cheated.”</i></b> Heb. <i>yaakov…vayakveini,</i> an obvious play on Jacob’s name (<i>Yaakov).</i> In using this specific word, Esau, too, places the blame squarely on Jacob’s shoulders. According to Esau, his sibling has not merely tricked him; Jacob is—as his name implies—a cheater by nature.

Verse 37



Verse 38



Verse 39



Verse 40



Verse 41

REBEKAH CONVINCES ISAAC TO SEND JACOB AWAY (27:41–28:9) The immediate consequences of the theft include Esau’s hatred of Jacob, Rebekah’s clever rescue of Jacob, and Esau’s marriage to an Ishmaelite woman. This will also be the only time in this episode that Rebekah addresses Isaac directly.

Verse 42



Verse 43

<b><i>“get going.”</i></b> Rebekah gives up what she loves most, her son Jacob. Like so many mothers, she sacrifices her own desires to ensure her child a future.

Verse 44



Verse 45

<b><i>“I will…bring you back from there.”</i></b> As this episode comes to a close, Rebekah remains a woman with a plan. Her hope is that Jacob leaves only temporarily, until it is safe to return. Yet once Jacob leaves home, they never meet again.
<i><b>“why should I be bereft of the two of you…”</b></i> Rebekah encourages her son to leave by saying that it is better for her if he does, a statement calculated to release Jacob from the fear that he is abandoning her.

Verse 46

 Rebekah addresses her words to Isaac, providing a reason to for him to send Jacob away. This way, Jacob is able to leave with Isaac’s blessing and permission. Once again, Rebekah has created a situation in which it seems that Isaac is in control, while she pulls the strings. She has done what had to be done, but now her beloved Jacob will be gone.

Chapter 28



Verse 1

 As the people of Israel formulates its own identity in tension with surrounding cultures, its traditions frequently express anxiety about Israelite men marrying Canaanite women. Thus with regard to Isaac, Genesis 24 strongly advocated endogamy—that is, marriage within the family’s kinship group. In this parashah, Esau’s marriage to Canaanite women upsets his parents (26:35, 27:46, 28:8). The concern seems less when the foreign woman comes from a non-Canaanite family (see, for example, Deuteronomy 21:10–14).

Verse 2

<b><i>“your mother’s father…your mother’s brother.”</i></b> Isaac’s way of referring to Jacob’s destination further highlights the bond between mother and son.

Verse 3



Verse 4



Verse 5



Verse 6

<b><i>6–9. When Esau saw.</i></b> The text portrays Esau as one who still wants parental approval. Whereas Jacob leaves on the advice of his mother and his father (28:7), Esau seeks only his father’s approval (28:8) in choosing a non-Canaanite wife. At the end of this parashah, Rebekah recedes to the shadows, now that she has seen to the continuation of the Covenant.

Verse 9



Verse 10

<i>Departure of the Hero Jacob</i> (28:10–22)
Jacob’s flight and return serve as the frame of this parashah, which recounts how the people of Israel were built up through the intersecting struggles and wills of Rachel, Leah, and Jacob. When Jacob departs from home with the intangible gifts of the blessing and the birthright, he exhibits his youthful adaptability by using a stone for a pillow and sleeping alone in the mountains blanketed in darkness. These mountains—which form the western boundary of the Jordan River Valley—serve as a threshold to the realm of the Divine that Jacob recognizes as he sleeps. As he awakes and speaks, the confidence and self-certainty of the young Jacob become apparent. This vision where Jacob sees the angels of God will be balanced and extended by his nocturnal wrestling with a divine being on the east side of the Jordan prior to his eventual return home (32:4–33). The transformation that he undergoes is evident in the change of tone in which he speaks to God on either side of the Jordan. The youthful Jacob stipulates a list of terms (28:20–21) while the older Jacob pleads to God to save his family despite his unworthiness (32:10–13). A parallel transformation is evident in Rachel and Leah, who initially employ language as the means of their competition, but ultimately speak with one voice when deciding to embark on a journey away from home.
<b><i>10–11.</i></b> The journey begins. Previously, Jacob’s mother, Rebekah, had secured his father’s blessing for him through a stratagem; then she had ensured her son’s safe passage from home. In so doing, Rebekah had voiced two intentions for Jacob’s departure: safety and a wife (27:4–28:4). Thus he now journeys with the dual intent of finding safety in his uncle Laban’s house and finding a suitable wife. On his way from Beersheba to his uncle’s in Haran, Jacob stops at an unidentified place.

Verse 11



Verse 12

<b><i>12–15.</i></b> Scholars have noted that the ladder in Jacob’s dream is most likely a ziggurat, a tower known from the temples of Mesopotamia. This “ladder” serves as a bridge between heaven and earth upon which angels ascend and descend—thus indicating the dialogic nature of communication between the two realms. Thus Jacob has begun a double journey: a dream journey toward increasing proximity to God parallels his physical wanderings across the horizontal plane of space. Jacob encounters his angels while traveling. The stations between home and exile have a corollary in the rungs between heaven and earth.

Verse 14



Verse 15



Verse 16

<b><i>16–22.</i></b> Jacob’s deal with God follows his dream.

Verse 17



Verse 18



Verse 19

<b><i>He named that place Beth El.</i></b> The vision results in a new perception of his environment as “the house of God” and “the gate of heaven.” Accordingly, Jacob names it <i>Beit El</i> (House of God). Beth El—as it is known in English—later became the national sanctuary of the Northern Kingdom of Israel, although one that some prophets maligned (Amos 3:14; 4:4; 5:5–6; Hosea 10:15). In ancient Israel the account of Jacob’s vision likely justified and sanctified the Beth El temple.

Verse 20

<b><i>20–21.</i></b> Jacob drives a hard bargain with God. Jacob wants real-life indicators that God will watch over him wherever he goes, and will return him to his native soil. He pledges that if he meets with success on his journey, then the God of his father’s household will be his God, his pillow will become the cornerstone of a temple, and he will sacrifice a tenth of his bounty.

Chapter 29



Verse 1

<i>Temporary Home for Jacob, Leah, and Rachel</i> (29:1–30)
It is one of the Torah’s great paradoxes that the divine imperative to engender descendants and produce a great nation reaches fruition first in the land of Aram (Syria) and later in Egypt. In this episode, Jacob finds refuge in his uncle’s home and meets his counterpart, Rachel, thereby satisfying the wishes of his mother. In a foreign land he also engenders a family and becomes wealthy, thereby bringing God’s promises into being.
JACOB AT THE WELL (29:1–8)
The well is the Torah’s famed meeting place, a romantic topos. Here Abraham’s servant finds Isaac’s bride, Rachel and Jacob meet, and Moses first encounters his future wife, Zipporah. (On wells as symbols of fertility, see at 16:7 and 24:11.) It is also the place where Jacob goes to seek information about his relatives.

Verse 4



Verse 5



Verse 6

 In the midst of Jacob’s inquiry, Rachel appears guiding the flock.

Verse 7



Verse 8



Verse 9

MEETING RACHEL (29:9–21)
<b><i>she was a shepherd.</i></b> The first description of Rachel does not emphasize her beauty—as is sometimes the case when a female character is introduced (Rebekah, Genesis 24:16; Abigail, I Samuel 25:3; Bathsheba, II Samuel 11:2). Rather, it declares her occupation. Rachel’s very name means “ewe.”

Verse 10

<b><i>rolled the stone off the well’s mouth.</i></b> In this occasion of biblical humor, Jacob is so overwhelmed when Rachel appears that—in superhero fashion—he single-handedly rolls the stone cover off the mouth of the well. The reader is particularly impressed with this, having just been informed that the act required the efforts of all Haran’s shepherds.

Verse 11

 One cannot help but wonder about Rachel’s response to the stranger who kisses her, weeps, and then declares that he is her cousin.

Verse 12

<b><i>he was Rebekah’s son.</i></b> Jacob identifies himself only as Rebekah’s son, not Isaac’s. (On the place of women in the kinship ties of Israelite social structure, see at 10:1.)
<b><i>she ran.</i></b> The text, tending toward silence about emotions, speaks only of her acts of running and announcing the arrival, as did Rebekah when Abraham’s servant revealed his identity at the same well (24:28). Rebekah, however, ran to her mother’s house.

Verse 13



Verse 14

<b><i>“Truly, you are my bone and my flesh!”</i></b> Laban’s effusive statement of recognition and solidarity will soon become ironic as uncle and nephew prove equal in chicanery.

Verse 15



Verse 16

<b><i>Now Laban had two daughters.</i></b> In the pasture Rachel had been identified as a shepherd, but at home she is marked as the younger of two sisters. When Leah is introduced, Rachel’s beauty becomes a cause for further distinction in the face of Leah’s “weak eyes” (v. 17). Jacob has fallen in love with Rachel and soon attests to his willingness to sustain the love for seven years (v. 18). In the ensuing scenes, the focus falls on Rachel and Leah; Laban’s sons are not mentioned until they voice their resentment at Jacob’s success (31:1).

Verse 17

 Leah and Rachel are described as different in appearance. Earlier, the text had contrasted Jacob and Esau also on the basis of their respective occupations (25:27, where <i>yoshev ohalim</i> seems to mean “raising livestock”; compare 4:20).

Verse 18

<b><i>“seven years for your younger daughter.”</i></b> In the social world of the Bible, a bridegroom or his family needed to compensate his bride’s household. Apparently, part of this payment would normally accrue to the bride herself. (See <i>Chayei Sarah,</i> Another View, and at 31:15.)
Two biblical motifs are evident here: of love directed to a younger child (Rachel), and of seven (years) as a number of wholeness.

Verse 19

 Laban speaks of Rachel as a gift that he will bestow on his nephew and says nothing about the work extracted from Jacob. Laban’s manipulation of Jacob begins with his appeal to familial bonds, asserting that it is within his power to “give” Rachel to whomever he desires.

Verse 20

<b><i>a few days.</i></b> Heb. <i>ke-yamim achadim.</i> Jacob’s perception of his seven years of labor as “a few days” recalls the <i>yamim achadim</i> (“a while,” literally “a few days”) that his mother, Rebekah, had recommended that he spend with Laban (27:44).

Verse 21



Verse 22

JACOB’S MARRIAGE TO LEAH AND RACHEL (29:22–30) In Jacob’s mind the marital relationship with Rachel will be enacted by his initiation of the sexual act. Where Jacob imagines an act of intimacy, Laban plans a public feast.
Laban substitutes his older daughter for the younger. The provocative question that arises from this bed-trick is the same as that raised by Rebekah and Jacob’s earlier deception of Isaac: does human subterfuge disrupt the divine plan—or advance it? In this case Laban’s trick enables the building of the house of Israel through the combined efforts of the two sisters and their two maids. It is precisely the interfamilial competition that renders the household productive.

Verse 23



Verse 24



Verse 25



Verse 26

<b><i>26–29.</i></b> The unfolding scenario—in which Jacob weds two sisters—is an instance where a biblical law (the prohibition against marrying a woman’s sister during her lifetime, Leviticus 18:18) is contradicted by an episode in biblical narrative.

Verse 27



Verse 28



Verse 29



Verse 30

<b><i>[Jacob] made love with Rachel, too.</i></b> Literally, “he also came into Rachel,” which is a biblical way of indicating a sexual intercourse. At long last Jacob is united with his beloved Rachel.
<b><i>he loved Rachel…so much more than Leah.</i></b> The preference of one wife over the other reintroduces the theme of favoritism that begins with Cain and Abel (Genesis 4) and continues as sibling rivalry throughout Genesis. Such preference, while promoting strife within the family, leads in the sisters’ case to productivity and the realization of the divine blessing in the human realm.

Verse 31

<i>From Barrenness to Fertility</i>
LEAH AND RACHEL BIRTH THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL (29:31–30:24)
The narrative focuses on how each matriarch negotiates the terrain between barrenness and fertility, which offers cherished insight into the individual characters of these biblical women. Where the male heroes seek to conquer, claim, and sanctify land, the female heroes strive to inscribe their memory on the bodies of their heirs; the acts of birthing and naming function as the counterpart to those of inaugurating and settling territory. The matriarchs go to extreme lengths in order to initiate and improvise their own Covenant. The female journey spans the poles from barrenness to fertility and affords the matriarch the opportunity to wrestle with other persons, God, and social position. The steps of this journey are: barrenness, statement of protest, direct action, encounter with God, conception, birth, and naming.
COMPETITION BETWEEN SISTERS (29:31–30:13)
Whereas Jacob has split from his brother, Rachel must live alongside her sister as co-wife. Previously, the narrator has emphasized that Jacob “loves” Rachel by mentioning it three times (29:18, 20, 30). In this section, according to the narrator, God infers that Leah is in contrast “disfavored” (in Hebrew, literally “hated”; v. 31) and intervenes by making Leah fertile.

Verse 32

<b><i>bore.</i></b> As the translation reflects, the directness of the Hebrew root <i>y-l-d</i> points to the action of birthing. It thus emphasizes the agency and volition of the matriarchs. In contrast, the usual English idiom “to give birth” focuses more on the <i>outcome</i> of birthing, namely, the child.
<b><i>32–35–35</i></b>. Rachel’s infertility becomes doubly bitter in the shadow of Leah’s celebrations of the births of her first four sons. Through the names, Leah exults that “יהוה saw my plight” (Reuben, a pun on “See, a son!”) and “יהוה <i>heard</i> that I am despised and has given me this one too” (Simeon, a pun on “hearing”); she speculates that “this time my husband will be <i>attached</i> to me” (Levi, a pun on “Accompany”), and resolves that “this time I <i>give thanks</i> to יהוה” (Judah, a pun on “thanks”). While marking her triumphs and articulating her desire for marital love in the names of her sons, Leah bequeaths them sibling rivalry, an inheritance that drives the story of Joseph and his brothers.

Chapter 30



Verse 1

<b><i>“me…I.”</i></b> <i>Heb. li…anochi</i>. Rachel emphasizes her personal need for children through first person pronouns (see also at v. 3); she is concerned with her vitality and her own lineage. Let Jacob have his sons with Leah, but he must—at the same time—preserve Rachel’s individual legacy.
<b><i>“otherwise I am a dead woman!”</i></b> Rachel equates her inability to give birth with death, implying that her story will never be told if not condensed in the name of a child; ironically, she will eventually die giving birth to her second child (35:18). In effect she protests not only the state of barrenness, but also the limits that her society sets on female autonomy. In this case, Rachel speaks to the threat of her negation should she not reproduce. Perceiving the limits of her own authority, she turns to a person with immediate authority over her—her husband, Jacob.

Verse 2

 Jacob deflects responsibility and in fury directs Rachel’s protest toward God. However, had Rachel not spoken out, her journey would have had no beginning and no fulfillment.

Verse 3

<b><i>But she said, “Here is my maid Bilhah.”</i></b> That is, her slave; see at 16:1. The space between barrenness and fertility is a gap in the relationship between Rachel and God that she must bridge through symbolic acts. By employing her slave, Bilhah, as a surrogate, Rachel performs a kind of imitative magic in which she plays the Deity— causing a woman to conceive in the hopes that the Creator will likewise fertilize her. Like Sarah (16:13) and Leah (below, v. 9), Rachel relies on surrogacy also to bypass the obstacles to conception more directly. She achieves her goal by claiming the body of another woman as an extension of her own. In biblical narrative, birth is a moment of female collaboration when the boundaries between distinct bodies collapse, an occasion in which multiple female bodies operate in tandem. All females on the narrative stage at the moment of birth function as a collective body absorbed in the process and implication of birthing. This is evident in the surrogacy scenes, as well as in the birth scenes of Rachel and of Tamar—in which midwives take part in the naming of the child (35:17–18; 38:29; see also I Samuel 4:19–22). It is also clear when the midwives defy Pharaoh in order to save the lives of Hebrew babies (Exodus 1). Birth as a collective female action even transcends ethnic difference, as in the book of Ruth. There, Ruth the Moabite pledges to bind her body and her fate to her Israelite mother-in-law, Naomi—who has declared herself “too old to be married” (Ruth 1:12). Following the birth of Ruth’s son, a chorus of women blesses Naomi with the pronouncement that “a son is born to Naomi” (4:17). (On surrogacy see also at Genesis 16:2.) | Viewed from a more individualistic perspective, it is deeply problematic that the matriarchs potentially force their servants into undesired sexual relations.
<b><i>“my…I too.”</i></b> Heb. <i>gam anochi.</i> Rachel emphasizes her personal volition when spelling out the surrogacy procedure to Jacob, adding an extra firstperson singular pronoun.
<b><i>“I…may have a son.”</i></b> Heb. <i>ibaneh,</i> the same term that Sarah had used (16:2); on its meaning, see there.

Verse 4



Verse 5



Verse 6

<b><i>6–8.</i></b> As Bilhah twice gives birth, Rachel has the opportunity to thrust her own jabs at her sister through the names of sons: Dan (a pun on “judge”) because “God has <i>judged</i> me and has also listened to my plea”; and Naphtali (a pun on “struggle”) because “a mighty <i>rivalry</i> have I waged with my sister.”

Verse 7



Verse 8

<b><i>“I have prevailed”</i></b> Heb. <i>yacholti.</i> As she engages in sibling rivalry, Rachel also struggles with God in order to win the ability to give birth. Her naming of Naphtali is verbally linked with God’s later renaming of Jacob as Israel: “for you have struggled with God and with human beings, and you have prevailed (<i>vatuchal</i>)” (32:29). Both Rachel and Jacob prevail in contests doubly waged with people and with God.

Verse 9

<b><i>Leah saw that she was no longer bearing children.</i></b> Leah is never called barren, but she does experience a period of infertility.

Verse 10

<b><i>10–13.</i></b> Leah stresses her good fortune as she names the sons of Zilpah. <i>Gad</i> means literally “good fortune” and <i>Asher</i> is a name based on a verb form (“Fortunate is…”) that anticipates that other women will declare Leah fortunate.

Verse 11



Verse 12



Verse 13



Verse 14

EXCHANGE BETWEEN SISTERS (30:14–24) The turning point in the sisters’ relationship comes with their readiness to enter into an exchange—to give each what the other lacks. Symbolically, Leah is willing to give fertility (via mandrakes) to her barren sister and, in turn, Rachel gives Jacob to Leah, who longs for his love. | Whereas Jacob will first draw a truce with God (32:25–31) and then negotiate an icy peace with his brother (33:1–17), Rachel first strikes a deal with her sister and then wins the ability to create from God.
<b><i>mandrakes.</i></b> Or “love fruits,” known as an aphrodisiac as well as an aid to conception.

Verse 15

 Leah’s acerbic response exposes her pain. Rachel turns her sister’s complaint into terms of negotiation by giving Leah “back” her husband for one night in exchange for the mandrakes. In the meantime, she increases her request for a portion of the mandrakes to a demand for all of them.

Verse 16



Verse 17



Verse 18

 As she names her fifth biological son, Leah attests that she is rewarded by God: Issachar (a pun on “reward” or “hire”), saying, “God has given me my reward because I gave my maidservant to my husband” (30:18). The name also puns on Leah’s pre-coital statement to Jacob, “I have bought (or: hired) you with my son’s mandrakes” (30:16).

Verse 19



Verse 20

 In this naming ceremony, Leah utters a pious word of thanks, which hints at the name Zebed. But then she expresses her true wish. The name Zebulun reflects her focus on improving her marriage.

Verse 21

 The exchange (v. 15) results not only in the birth of Leah’s fifth and sixth sons but also in her first daughter, Dinah. The phrase “she conceived and she bore” associated with the birth of each son is absent here. Also absent is a naming declaration for Dinah, although her name means “judgment that leads to justice.”

Verse 22

 The mandrakes (vv. 14–15) do not cure Rachel’s barrenness, but they do alert God to her desperation—and the lengths to which she will go in order to conceive. In other words, the actions that Rachel takes to reverse her situation function as self-initiation into a relationship with God. They also prove her to be an ambitious mother worthy of a heroic son. Rachel has followed a three-part course in protesting her infertility: articulation of discontent, surrogacy, and medicinal aid. God likewise responds with three actions: “God now remembered…listened…and opened her womb.” Her struggle results in a response from God—such that her memory is assured, her voice heeded, and the barrier to conception lifted.
<b><i>God…remembered.</i></b> The same idea appeared (in different Hebrew terms) when God “remembered” Sarah and she became pregnant (21:1). In the biblical accounts of the nation of Israel’s loss or suffering, acts of memory (whether human or divine) are the first step toward redemption. In the stories of barren women, the occasion of divine remembrance signals that their actions have led to acknowledgment—and the reversal of their situation.

Verse 23



Verse 24

 The giving of a name affords the new mother an opportunity to tell her story of movement from barrenness to fertility, and to perpetuate her experience through the child’s ascribed identity. Although Rachel uses a pious statement that “God has removed (Heb. <i>asaf)</i> my disgrace,” she calls her son Joseph <i>(yosef</i>), meaning “may God add on <i>(yosef)</i> another child for me.” Celebrating her victory, Rachel already begins strategizing for another.

<b><i>37–39.</i></b> How peeled rods can determine the color of sheep is anyone’s guess, but Jacob later explains to Rachel and Leah that the technique was revealed to him during a dream communication with an angel (31:10–13).

Chapter 31



Verse 1

<b><i>“Jacob has taken all that belongs to our father.”</i></b> In fact, Jacob has acquired his wealth by usurping his own brother’s blessing. Resentment on the part of the host culture toward Hebrew successes is likewise evident at the start of Exodus and later comprises a familiar trope in Jewish history.

Verse 2



Verse 3



Verse 4

<b><i>Rachel and Leah.</i></b> Here and in v. 14, the narrator places Rachel before Leah, consistent with the larger theme of the displaced first-born in Genesis. As with Jacob, Rachel’s preeminent position in the family implies that hierarchies can be unsettled by action. Ruth 4:11 also lists Rachel prior to Leah, suggesting that Ruth’s mode of contending with barrenness most closely parallels Rachel’s journey to fertility.

(Rachel continues to display her individual will in v. 19.)

Verse 15

<b><i>“Are we not like foreigners to him?”</i></b> By acknowledging their outsider status in the household, Leah and Rachel prepare themselves to journey to an unknown land. They distinguish themselves from their father, citing the egregious manner in which he married them off and then denied them their due; see at 29:18.

FLIGHT, THEFT, AND PURSUIT (31:17–42)

Verse 18



Verse 19

<b><i>Rachel had stolen her father’s household gods.</i></b> We can gain a hint of Rachel’s presumed motive from the 14th-century-<small>B.C.E.</small> tablets of Nuzi, an ancient city in Iraq. Evidence from there suggests that possession of the household gods was associated with clan leadership or inheritance rights. Thus Rachel, like Jacob before her, deceives the father in order to gain tokens of power and authority. Once again, Rachel is a counterpart to Jacob (Ilana Pardes, <i>Countertraditions in the Bible,</i> 1992, p. 61). She may also have sought the <i>t’rafim</i> to serve as fertility gods, hoping for a second child (see Contemporary Reflection). | The Torah includes a number of trickster stories like this, showing how marginalized men and women outwit the powerful in order to survive or safeguard justice (for example, Genesis 12:10–20; 38:1–30).

(For a different perspective, see Contemporary Reflection.) | This verse provides further evidence of Rachel’s concern for her own status and survival.

Verse 33



Verse 34



Verse 35

<b><i>“the way of women is upon me.”</i></b> With poetic euphemism, Rachel staves off her father by playing on masculine fears about menstruation. The irony is that these same fears result in the type of purity laws and prohibitions concerning menstruating women that would categorize bleeding on gods as an act of contamination (Leviticus 15:20). The ruse displays Rachel’s cleverness. (On menstruation, see at Leviticus 15:19–32.)

The tension that suffuses their dialogue will erupt into future hostilities between the nations of Israel and of Aram, but this first treaty makes them equal partners.

<i>Settling Accounts</i>
JACOB’S STRUGGLES WITH GOD AND MEN (32:4-33:20)
Even before birth, Jacob was portrayed as a character who struggles. He struggled in the womb (25:22). He struggled with Esau for birthright and blessing (Genesis 25 and 27). After twenty years of living in Aram he struggled with Laban (Genesis 31) and, ever since he has headed back toward the land of Canaan, he has been facing a potentially dangerous encounter with his estranged brother Esau. Now, on the way home, Jacob endures a physical confrontation with God—and as a result, has his name changed to Israel. The struggle between humans and God is a prevalent theme in the Hebrew Bible that culminates not with Jacob/Israel, but with <i>B’nei Yisrael,</i> his descendants—who continually engage in either avoidance of, or confrontation with, their God.
JACOB SETS OUT TO MEET ESAU (32:4–16)
According to the preceding narrative, Jacob had wronged his brother, Esau, and then left home (27:1–28:5). Now Esau comes to meet Jacob with four hundred men, and Jacob is terrified. Jacob responds by making use of his two greatest assets: a wily mind, and God’s covenant with his ancestors.

JACOB STRUGGLES WITH GOD (32:17–33) Separated from all his recent acquisitions and now alone, Jacob wrestles with a mysterious being. This is a life-altering event for him. He demands a blessing, and receives a name change that signifies a permanent change in Jacob’s character.
<b><i>17–22.</i></b> Forms of the word “face” (Heb. <i>panim)</i> occur seven times in this passage (at times translated as “in front of” or “ahead of”), providing a verbal link to the life-altering theme in the events that are about to occur. The repetition conveys the force of this moment in Jacob’s life and of all that he must face—including his brother. Two encounters, first with his God and then with his brother, will be united when he eventually says to Esau, “I’ve seen your face—like seeing God’s face!” (33:10).

Verse 23

<b><i>eleven children.</i></b> Heb. <i>y’ladim</i> here must actually refer to “boys” only, because the narrator specifies eleven of them. Dinah, Jacob’s daughter (30:21), is not included in this count. [Apparently the narrator here relates to Jacob’s children in genealogical terms, their being the ancestors of the future tribes of Israel. On women and biblical genealogies, see at 10:1. —<i>Ed</i>.]

Verse 24



Verse 25

<b><i>a man wrestled with him.</i></b> In Hosea 12:5–6, the prophet states specifically that Jacob “strove with a divine being (<i>elohim</i>); he strove with an angel <i>(malach)</i> and prevailed.” However, here the mysterious being that appears suddenly as Jacob’s adversary is described only as an <i>ish,</i> translated here as “a man,” as is conventional. However, given the flexibility in biblical Hebrew of the term <i>ish,</i> it can mean a challenging figure that need not be human but could be divine.

Verse 26



Verse 27

<b><i>“I will not let you go unless you bless me!”</i></b> Jacob insists that the struggle lead to blessing.

Verse 28



Verse 29

<b><i>“Israel.”</i></b> The original meaning of this twopart name cannot be stated definitively. In most cases, <i>el</i> is a noun meaning “God,” but sometimes it has a more general sense of “divine” or “superlative.” Also unclear is whether <i>el</i> is subject or object of the name’s verbal portion, which itself is ambiguous. Thus this name can be construed as “he struggles with God,” or “God struggles,” or “God rules,” or “his struggle is mighty,” and more. The present story turns on the first of those possible meanings.
A name change often signifies a change in character. Jacob is no longer simply the “deceiver/supplanter” (27:36). Abraham and Sarah have their names changed permanently and consistently (Genesis 17); Jacob, on the other hand, will be called both Jacob and Israel after this name change.
<i><b>“struggled with God.”</b></i> Or “…with divine beings” (compare Judges 13:22). It is not clear whether this statement is intended literally to describe the recent wrestling match, or figuratively in reference to Jacob’s general life circumstances.

Verse 30



Verse 31

<b><i>Peniel—“For I have seen God face-to-face.”</i></b> Explaining the place name as if it meant “face of God” (<i>p’nei-el</i>), suggesting that Jacob understands his overnight struggle as a direct encounter with God. [Because the Bible—as in the ancient Near East generally—considers the actions of messengers to be largely inseparable from the principal who sent them, Jacob may perhaps be referring to an encounter with a divine messenger as agent. —<i>Ed.</i>]

Verse 32

 Jacob leaves the encounter with a serious injury. He thus sets out to meet his brother while physically limping and vulnerable, but with new internal strength.

Verse 33

<b><i>the people of Israel do not eat the thigh muscle.</i></b> This dietary restriction is not mentioned in the laws of <i>kashrut</i> in either Leviticus 11 or Deuteronomy 14:3-21. It is presented as a matter of ethnic identification rather than of ritual purity.

Chapter 33



Verse 1

THE BROTHERS RECONCILE (33:1–20)
<b><i>1–2.</i></b> After his encounter with God, Jacob turns back to the confrontation with his brother, Esau. He divides the women and children, situating the women most likely according to personal preference: maids and their children first, then Leah and her children, and then, Rachel and Joseph—his favorites—in back. The status of Jacob’s sons depends apparently upon their mothers’ favor with Jacob, not their birth order or even their personalities. Joseph is the only child specifically cited. These spatial and narrative details spotlight Jacob’s preference of Rachel, an attitude that later proves to undermine harmony within the household.

Chapter 34



Verse 1

<i>Dinah and Shechem</i>
SEX AND SOCIAL STATUS (34:1-31)
Dinah, acting independently and of her own initiative, goes out to visit “the women of the locality.” In the span of just two verses, the local Hivite prince, Shechem, spots Dinah, has sex with her, falls in love with her, and wants to marry her. Her brothers react violently and destroy Shechem and his city.
Dinah’s status and her standing in society steadily decline as the story progresses. She moves from fulfilling the proper role in the proper place (virgin-daughter in father’s house) to a socially ambiguous role with no proper corresponding physical place. Her story serves as a warning in the larger—and probably overriding—issue of the political and ethnic identity of the Israelites in relation to the other people in the land.
Throughout the story, Dinah’s location corresponds directly to her perceived position in society and illustrates the precarious state of the daughter in biblical Israel. Though she seems free to move about, she is not secure anywhere. One need only consider the plight of Jephthah’s daughter in Judges 11, the concubine in Judges 19, and the daughters of Shiloh in Judges 21, to get the message that women, or at least daughters, are vulnerable to calamity when they “go out.”
RAPE? (34:1–4)
A crucial question for modern interpreters is whether or not Dinah was raped. When considering the modern concept of rape—characterized by an aggressive act and lack of mutual consent—there is little question as to what happens to Dinah; the author tells us that Shechem saw her, took her, lay with her, and humiliated her. To us, this string of verbs screams “rape” (and is in fact even translated that way in v. 2). The assumption made by most interpreters is that Dinah did not consent to the sexual act. However, the question of consent, so central to the modern notion of rape and of women’s rights in general, is entirely ignored in this text. Dinah’s consent is not the issue. The ambiguity of the Hebrew verbs describing Shechem’s actions toward Dinah compounds the difficulty of interpretation.
If we contemporary interpreters are sensitive to the ancient context in which the story was recorded, we need to entertain the possibility that there is a fundamental difference between our modern concept of rape and what may represent rape in the biblical text. In our society, forcing a woman to have sex against her will is seen as terrible both for its emotional and psychological consequences, and for the humiliation and debasement suffered by the woman as an individual. The Bible, even in its rape laws, was primarily concerned with the juridical and social-status consequences of the tort involved in sleeping with a virgin without either marrying her or compensating her father. As with adultery, the problem was not treated as an emotional or psychological one. When Amnon rapes Tamar in II Samuel 13, the violation that has taken place is made clear when Tamar begs Amnon not to reject her but to request her for his wife. It is his rejection subsequent to the sexual act that damages Tamar’s life the most, because as an unmarried non-virgin princess, she has completely lost status in her society. In contrast to Tamar, Dinah is not granted a voice in the story; instead, her body and life form a site for settling issues between men.
If Shechem marries Dinah after having sex with her, she would have full status as a wife in his household. The story, however, aims at excluding such a union with the other peoples in the land. Thus Jacob ignores his obligation to protect the women of his household when he does not subsequently negotiate Dinah’s marriage to Shechem. (For a different perspective on this episode, see Another View.)
<b><i>Dinah, Leah’s daughter.</i></b> Dinah is introduced as the daughter of Leah, the wife that Jacob did not want. (On the status of offspring as a function of Jacob’s favoring Rachel, see at 33:1–2.)
Dinah is referred to as “daughter” seven times in this story. See also at v. 4, s.v. “girl.” <i><b>went out to see the women of the locality.</b></i> Dinah goes out of her father’s house to a public space, literally “to see the daughters of the land.” Dinah seems free to leave, but she does so at her own risk. She is going out to “see” her peers, but she is ultimately “seen”—with dramatic consequences. Nowhere in the text is she criticized for her action.

Verse 2

<b><i>Shechem.</i></b> The name both of the prince and of the settlement (today’s Nablus). In the book of Joshua, this locale becomes the site of a special covenant ceremony for the Israelites (Joshua 24). Later it rivaled Jerusalem; this rivalry may account for the hostility with which the city is portrayed in the present story.
<i><b>he took her and lay her down and raped her.</b></i> Interpretive debates about the story and its import revolve around the meaning of the word <i>innah,</i> here rendered as “rape.” The meaning of the other verbs as well is both affected by, and in turn influences, how one interprets the actions involved in this episode.
Deuteronomy 22 contains several laws about sexual offenses with terminology similar to what appears here. From the usage in Deuteronomy one can conclude that <i>innah</i> means “violate,” not “rape” (22:23–24). The expression “he took hold of her” <i>is</i> apparently the one used for rape in Deuteronomy (22:25) as well in the Tamar/Amnon story (II Samuel 13:14)—and it is not used here in the present verse. Consequently, the word <i>innah</i> should not be translated as rape, and what happened to Dinah certainly should not be understood as an act of rape in the modern sense of the word. Rather, the term demonstrates in this passage, as elsewhere, a downward movement in a social sense, meaning to “debase” or “humiliate” (Genesis 16:6). Though an affront to the woman’s family, the term does not carry with it the psychological and emotional implications for the woman that the contemporary notion of rape suggests. In this particular text, the woman has no voice, and the narrator has no interest in whether or not she consented to the sexual act. Bear in mind that according to ancient Near Eastern mores, Dinah would have been considered to have been disgraced even if she had consented.

Verse 3



Verse 4

<b><i>“girl.”</i></b> Heb. <i>yaldah;</i> literally, “a (female) child,” which suggests that she is rather young. Similar terms such as <i>bat</i> (daughter) and <i>naara</i> (girl or young woman) appear repeatedly in this passage (see at v. 1). Taken together, these descriptors suggest that Dinah’s youth was relevant to the events that follow.
<i><b>“girl…wife.”</b></i> Heb. <i>yaldah…ishah.</i> The transition from childhood to adulthood (for <i>ishah</i> can also mean “woman”) is brought on by a change in status involving sexual relations.

Verse 5

BROTHERS’ INTERPRETATION: AN OUTRAGE AGAINST ISRAEL (34:5–24) Jacob hears what has happened to Dinah and, somewhat uncharacteristically, waits until the return of his sons. There is irony here in that on the Canaanite side the son (Shechem) goes to his father (Hamor) to negotiate on his behalf, while Jacob remains silent throughout the entire story until v. 30, when he chastises his sons for having made trouble for him in his new land.
<b><i>defiled.</i></b> Heb. <i>timei</i>, indicating that Dinah’s status has changed for the worse. Other forms of this word are used in Leviticus for “pollution” or “impure,” a condition that can be temporary (as in 11:44; 15:31; 18:20). Something defiled can often be rendered pure with proper ritual purification. In the case of Dinah, it appears that marriage to Shechem could potentially change her status from “defiled” to “pure.”

Verse 6



Verse 7

<b><i>an outrage against Israel.</i></b> The sons are angry because of the “outrage against Israel.” The only “Israel” in this story is Jacob himself; but he is not the one outraged. Rather, it is his sons, the <i>B’nei Yisrael,</i> who are affected and who take action in response.
<i><b>lying with Jacob’s daughter—such things were not done.</b></i> The reason Jacob’s sons give for their rage is clearly expressed. The “thing not to be done” is to have sex with Jacob’s daughter.

Verse 8

<b><i>8–17. Hamor now spoke with them.</i></b> The negotiation occurs only among men. They alone discuss the details involved in changing Dinah’s status from unmarried virgin in her father’s house to married wife and future mother in her husband’s house. The negotiations as stated do not convey Dinah’s consent or desire. It is Shechem’s wish that was expressed (v. 4), and it is his father’s negotiation that now takes place on his behalf.

Verse 9



Verse 10



Verse 11



Verse 12

<b><i>‘‘girl.”</i></b> Shechem here refers to Dinah as a naara rather than as <i>yaldah</i> (child, girl); see at v. 4.

Verse 13

<b><i>deceptively.</i></b> Heb. <i>b’mirmah;</i> here this word is applied to “Jacob’s sons,” a reminder that earlier it referred to Jacob himself (see at 27:35). On subterfuge as a recourse for both women and men who face abuses of authority, see at 27:1–28:9 (introduction).

Verse 14

<b><i>14–24.</i></b> Entering into a binding marriage requires both negotiation and sex (not necessarily in that order); so Dinah and Shechem are already halfway there. For their part of the negotiation, the brothers tell Shechem that they cannot give Dinah to him in marriage until he is circumcised. In a surprising move, Shechem is able to convince the males of the town to become circumcised in order to benefit from contact with Jacob’s family.

Verse 25

BROTHERS’ REVENGE (34:25–31) Rather than framing their sister’s loss of virginity in the context of marriage, “Jacob’s sons” had arranged marriage deceptively (v. 13). Rather than following through with the terms they had negotiated, Simeon and Levi—now also identified as “Dinah’s brothers” (v. 25)—exact revenge.

Verse 26

<b><i>taking Dinah from Shechem’s house.</i></b> After her initial encounter with Shechem, Dinah does not return to her father’s house. But in Shechem’s house, her status is equally problematic as she is not officially his wife. An alien in a foreign household, lacking a negotiated marriage and children, Dinah is literally on the social fringe. Her removal from Shechem’s house at this point in the story does nothing to improve the situation. With a voided marriage but the sexual status of wife, there is no acceptable place for her in society.

Verse 27



Verse 28

<b><i>28–29.</i></b> The brothers kill all the men but spare women and children, taking them captive instead.

Verse 29



Verse 30

<b><i>“You have made trouble for me.”</i></b> Jacob chastises his sons for their violent response (compare 49:5–6), predicting the destruction of his own household as a result.

Verse 31

<b><i>“Should he then have been allowed to treat our sister like a whore?”</i></b> The brothers choose to view the offer of money in compensation for Dinah’s virginity not as an elevation of her status, but rather as a statement about Dinah’s availability as a prostitute. Their explanation for their behavior makes clear that Dinah herself is not culpable. This position stands in stark contrast to tendencies in the ancient (and modern) world to blame the woman for the family’s shame.

Verse 4

 Jacob’s household buries all the foreign gods and the earrings from their ears—presumably also the <i>t’rafim</i> (household gods) that Rachel stole from her father (31:19). The reason for specifying earrings is not clear. In Exodus 32 (the Golden Calf story) and Judges 8:24–27, earrings are used to fashion an idol.

<b><i>Deborah, Rebekah’s nurse.</i></b> See at 24:59. <b><i>died.</i></b> Rebekah’s own death is never mentioned, so it is strange that her nurse’s death is worth noting.
<i><b>the Oak.</b></i> Presumably a tree near Beth El that served as a landmark. A more famous Deborah— the prophet—is also associated with a tree, for she would sit under a palm and render judgment (Judges 4:4–5).

Verse 9



Verse 10

<b><i>“Jacob are you called no more, for Israel is your name!”</i></b> The story in vv. 9–15 is a doublet on the name change from Jacob to Israel (32:17–33), one of several episodes in the Torah that appear twice in similar form (see the sister/wife story of Abraham and Sarah in Genesis 12 and 20).

Verse 11



Verse 12



Verse 13



Verse 14



Verse 15



Verse 16

RACHEL’S SECOND SON AND HER DEATH (35:16–21) On the road from Beth El, Rachel dies in childbirth. Earlier, when Laban had charged Jacob with stealing the household gods (Genesis 31), Jacob had countered, “the one with whom you find your gods shall not live” (31:32). It is unclear whether according to the text’s composer(s) Rachel’s death is an unwitting result of Jacob’s rash curse (after all, Laban did not find his household gods). Deaths during childbirth were a widespread phenomenon in the ancient world. Rachel’s demise may implicitly be connected to her former barrenness and desperate attempts to have a child. Ironically, the woman who so longed for children dies in childbirth.
This is one of only two stories in the Bible about such deaths. In the other (I Samuel 4:18–22), a woman’s premature labor is triggered by the shock of Israel’s defeat in war and of the deaths of her father-in-law and husband; and she, like Rachel, dies after naming the child (but see at 30:3).

Verse 17

<b><i>“Don’t be afraid; this one, too, will be a son for you.”</i></b> Rachel—who embedded her longing for another son already in the name of her first son, Joseph (30:24)—is dying; but her midwife tries to comfort her with the knowledge that she is giving up her life for a living (male) child. A similar attempt at comfort is recorded in I Samuel 4:18.

Verse 18

<b><i>Ben-oni,</i></b> An ambiguous name that can mean “son of my suffering” or “son of my strength.” <i><b>Benjamin.</b></i> That is, “son of the right [hand].” Perhaps Jacob is changing Rachel’s sense of the futility of her life into an affirmation of her importance to Jacob as his favorite wife.

Verse 19

<b><i>buried on the road to Ephrath, that is, Bethlehem.</i></b> According to I Samuel 10:2, the tomb of Rachel was in the territory of (or at the boundary of) Benjamin, as might be expected, and not near Bethlehem, which is in Judah. In Jeremiah 31:15, Rachel weeps for her children in Ramah, a city in Benjamin. The later status accorded to Bethlehem under David’s influence might account for the present note that Rachel’s tomb was near Bethlehem. According to the biblical accounts, Rachel is the only one of the four matriarchs not buried in the cave of Machpelah, purchased by Abraham for Sarah (Genesis 23)—which is also Jacob’s final resting place (50:13). Such perpetual separation is sadly ironic, given his intense love for Rachel.

Verse 20

 Just as he had set up a pillar to commemorate his encounter with God (35:14), Jacob sets up one to mark Rachel’s grave. Although no emotions are expressed here, on his deathbed Jacob will poignantly recall this loss and burial (48:7).
 <i><b>22. Reuben went and lay with his father’s concubine Bilhah.</b></i> Sleeping with one’s father’s wife was a great offense (Leviticus 18:8; 20:11). It is possible that this is why Bilhah is called a concubine <i>(pilegesh</i>) here, while she appears as “wife” in other instances (see Genesis 37:2). Intercourse with the father’s concubine, although a less severe offense than with his wife, is apparently tantamount to a declaration of rebellion against the father. When Adonijah asks for Abishag, the woman who shared David’s bed when he was old (I Kings 1:1–4), Solomon takes this as a bid for the throne, and has Adonijah executed for treason (I Kings 2:13–25). Note also Absalom’s sleeping with David’s concubines as a sign of displacing his father, David (II Samuel 16:22–23).
<i><b>and Israel heard.</b></i> As with Dinah in Genesis 34, Jacob takes no immediate action. However, he will bypass Reuben for the birthright in his deathbed blessing (Genesis 49:3–4).

Verse 21



Verse 22

JACOB’S WIVES AND CHILDREN (35:22–26) The summary list of Jacob’s twelve sons is given according to their mothers. Dinah, and any other possible daughters, are omitted. The mothers’ mention presumably indicates the relative status of the sons. The mothers are listed in a different order than seen previously. In 33:2, fearing Esau’s wrath, Jacob had placed the maids Bilhah and Zilpah and their children first, Leah and her children next, and Rachel and her son closest to the rear. That order reflects their importance to Jacob, from the most to the least expendable. Here, the women’s order corresponds to the order in which Jacob married them: Leah; Rachel; Rachel’s maid, Bilhah; and Leah’s maid, Zilpah.

Verse 23

Verse 26



Verse 27

ISAAC’S DEATH (35:27–29) Jacob returns to see his father Isaac (who may have been on his deathbed for two decades; 27:1–2, 31:41). Nothing is said about his mother Rebekah, whose death is never reported. Isaac dies and is buried by both Esau and Jacob. This brief report recalls that of Abraham’s death and burial (25:8–10). In both cases estranged brothers come together to bury their father. Nothing is recorded as to whether they also bury their differences.

Chapter 36



Verse 1

THE LINE OF ESAU (36:1–43) This section provides the genealogy of Esau’s line. Esau’s Canaanite wives figure prominently. While the women in Jacob’s list above are mentioned only in connection with their sons, Esau’s wives are identified by the name and ethnicity of their fathers. Esau acquires power by establishing a series of marriage alliances corresponding to the later relationship of the nation Edom with these other nations. Here the movement of women from the house of their father to the house of their husband serves to establish political and social relations between two groups of previously unrelated men.
The passage’s inconsistent genealogies must have been compiled from a variety of sources. The names of Esau’s wives in vv. 2–3 do not correspond to the names of his wives given earlier (26:34, 28:9). Prominent in this list are wives Adah, Basemath, Timna, Oholibamah, and Zibeon.

Chapter 37



Verse 1

<i>Joseph the Dreamer</i>
HIS JOURNEY FROM HOME TO SLAVERY IN EGYPT (37:1–36)
<b><i>Jacob now settled.</i></b> The opening lines begin with Jacob. However, the subject is really Joseph, whose mother Rachel—beloved by his father—had died upon giving birth to Benjamin (35:16–20).

Verse 2

<b><i>sons of Bilhah and Zilpah.</i></b> These sons of Jacob’s secondary wives seem less valued than the sons of Leah and Rachel. Joseph’s young age (seven­teen) and his status as an eleventh son would justify his family status as similar to theirs.

Verse 3

<b><i>Israel.</i></b> That is, Jacob. Even after receiving this new designation (32:29; 35:9–15), he continues to be known by both names.
<b><i>he was to him the son of his old age.</i></b> This is the reason given for Jacob’s favoring Joseph, although the younger Benjamin would have been a better candidate for that. No reason is given, although presumably this reflects Jacob’s intense love for Ra­chel, Joseph’s (and Benjamin’s) deceased mother.
<b><i>coat of many colors.</i></b> Or “long tunic.” The book of Samuel uses the same expression for the garment worn by Tamar, daughter of King David, who tears it after her half-brother Amnon rapes her. It may have been an external marker of her status as a royal virgin daughter (II Samuel 13:18–19). That is, this garment functions as a symbol of its wearer’s special status. (Compare the role of a garment in Tamar’s and Madam Potiphar’s stories, below.)

Verse 4

<b><i>his brothers saw.</i></b> Jacob’s other sons have two reasons for hating Joseph: he is a telltale, and he is his father’s favorite—as they can see, all the time, by looking at his distinctive attire.
 <i><b>5–11.</b></i> Two dreams of Joseph about his forthcoming dominance over other members of his family exacerbate the enmity.

Verse 31

<b><i>31–35.</i></b> Jacob draws his own conclusion about Joseph’s “death” by looking at the garment that signified Joseph’s favorite status, now immersed in a goat’s blood. The goat whose blood stains the tunic recalls the kids’ skins that Rebekah had placed on Jacob to dupe his father, Isaac, into believing Jacob was Esau (27:16). The allusion is unmistakable: Jacob is deceived by his sons in the same manner he deceived his father—for the same practice of favoring a son. A kid will be part of Tamar’s negotiation with Judah in 38:17, yet another play on the same theme.

Verse 32

<b><i>“Is it your son’s coat?”</i></b> The brothers do not <i>tell</i> Jacob that Joseph is dead—that is, they do not formally lie to him. Instead, they present the fabricated evidence and let him reach his own conclusions. An invitation to recognize items signifying identity is also important later in Tamar’s message to Judah (38:25).

Verse 33



Verse 34



Verse 35

<b><i>he refused to be consoled.</i></b> This, like his death wish, shows disregard for the rest of the family.

Verse 36

 At the end of this passage, Joseph is in Egypt as a slave; Jacob is in mourning; and the text gives no sign that Joseph’s brothers feel remorse. Perhaps the family’s dysfunction can be explained by the void left after Rachel’s death (35:16–19). Also Leah is no longer in view and has perhaps died, too. (The text never reports her demise, only that Jacob eventually buried her body in the family’s burial site, the cave at Machpelah; 49:31.)

Chapter 38



Verse 1

<i>An Interlude: Tamar and Judah</i>
JUDAH IS EDUCATED THROUGH DECEPTION AND SEX (38:1–30)
Readers who wish to learn what will happen to Joseph must wait, because now Tamar and Judah take center stage. This passage disrupts the plotline—just as Tamar and Judah disrupt each other’s lives—and it even seems to be placed out of chronological sequence. We do not know when these events happen. As some early rabbis and Rashi pointed out, however, this episode has literary (thematic and verbal) links to the episodes that precede and follow it, despite the ostensible interruption. For example, Judah deceives his father in the previous episode and is deceived by Tamar (for a good purpose) here; garments—Joseph’s and then Tamar’s—play a central role in both stories, as status markers as well as vehicles of deceit; and the issue of group survival is present in both. This story also looks forward to the next episode. Tamar’s bold desire and the resulting sexual transgression here is comparable (positively or negatively) with Madam Potiphar’s desire for Joseph in the story that follows, in which a garment again figures prominently.
The present story is part of the ongoing history that leads to King David, founder of Israel’s most illustrious dynasty. According to the Bible, David’s pre-history started when Lot’s daughters, believing that the rest of humankind has been destroyed, deceived their drunken father in order to get pregnant. Two sons, Moab and Ammon, were born (19:25–38). In the second (present) installment, Tamar deceives Judah and gives birth to twins. In the third installment, Ruth the Moabite (a descendant of Lot’s daughter) marries Boaz (a descendant of Tamar’s son Perez), making her the great-grandmother of David. All three stories involve transgression of norms inscribed elsewhere in the Bible. In all three cases a younger female relative prompts a male to engage in a sexual liaison; the woman initiates the action at considerable risk to herself; and the woman dupes the man to some extent. All three cases result in the birth of one or more sons, which signals divine approval and brings benefit to Israel. Although Tamar is not explicitly identified as foreign, the context suggests that she might be. Thus foreign women become mothers of Israel’s most illustrious dynasty.
INTRODUCTION: JUDAH AND HIS FAMILY (38:1–5)
 Judah seems to be fully integrated in the Canaanite environment.

Verse 2

<b><i>the daughter.</i></b> On her name, see at v. 12.

Verse 3

<b><i>3–5.</i></b> Judah’s Canaanite wife is credited with giving birth to three sons for Judah, and with naming the two younger ones.

Verse 4



Verse 5



Verse 6

TAMAR LOSES HER HUSBANDS AND POSITION (38:6–11)
<b><i>Judah now took a wife for Er.</i></b> As is common in the Bible, the father finds a wife for his son. (But Hagar takes a wife for her son, 21:21.)
<i><b>Tamar.</b></i> The name means “a palm tree,” a tree used in the ancient Near East as a royal symbol. The context implies that Tamar is Canaanite, although this is never stated.

Verse 7

<b><i>his death.</i></b> Er dies without offspring.

Verse 8

 In agreement with the custom of levirate marriage, Judah gives Tamar to his next son, Onan. In levirate marriage (see at Deuteronomy 25:5–10), the wife of a deceased, childless man bears a son for the dead husband by being impregnated by his living brother. The practice applies when brothers live together. The son of such a union inherits the deceased brother’s property. Although this is not stated in the current passage, presumably the son also takes care of his mother, who otherwise–with neither a son nor an inheritance–would have no economic resources apart from what she brought into the marriage.

Verse 9

<b><i>waste [his seed] on the ground.</i></b> Onan’s “sin” is refusing to impregnate his sister-in-law. His fate does not serve to condemn either masturbation or coitus interruptus, two definitions for “onanism” in English dictionaries. Onan’s selfish reasoning is logical (but condemned): he has no interest in producing an heir for his dead brother’s (land) portion, which is in the interest of the household’s structure but not in his own personal interest.

Verse 10

 Onan dies because he refuses to cooperate. Like his brother Er before him, Onan is presented as responsible for his own demise. The reader thus knows that Tamar does not cause these deaths.

Verse 11

<b><i>“Stay as a widow.”</i></b> Judah disposes of Tamar by sending her to her father’s home while keeping her legally bound to his own. His subterfuge is Shelah’s youth. As with Joseph in the previous episode (37:26–27), Judah rids himself of a person whose presence vexes him.
<i><b>“Lest he too die like his brothers.”</b></i> Judah removes Tamar because he blames her for his sons’ death (compare at v. 10). While his reluctance is humanly understandable, his deception of Tamar is objectionable—and will, eventually, incite her to act.
<i><b>So Tamar went.</b></i> Tamar is obedient. We learn nothing about Tamar’s response or feelings throughout these occurrences. She is twice widowed (or at least bereft of a partner) in a short time, denied her third man and thus the possibility of all-important motherhood. Moreover, she loses her place in Judah’s household by being sent back to her father but is not released of her duty to this same household. Up to this point, Tamar has no voice but only a passive presence.

Verse 12

TAMAR EVOLVES FROM VICTIM TO AGENT: DECEPTION, SEX, AND PREGNANCY (38:12–23) Tamar finally takes matters into her own hands and ensures that she will have a child by deceiving her father-in-law Judah into having sex with her. This would be incest according to the stipulation in the book of Leviticus (“you shall not uncover the nakedness of your daughter-in-law,” Leviticus 18:15), and is punishable by death (Leviticus 20:12).
Tamar seems to be motivated by the wish to conceive for Judah’s family: she endangers herself, because legally she is bound to Shelah. She deceives Judah by covering herself up—not by pretending to be anything she is not. She, then, falls in with his impulsive cupidity.
<b><i>Shua’s daughter.</i></b> Heb. <i>bat shua,</i> which perhaps should be understood as a proper name (“Bathshua,” akin to Bathsheba); however, her father’s name is indeed Shua (v. 2). Like many other wives of named characters in the Bible, she seems to remain unnamed in this story.
<i><b>Judah’s wife, died.</b></i> This remark might serve as partial justification for Judah’s eagerness upon meeting Tamar.

Verse 13



Verse 14

<b><i>14–15. covered herself up with a veil.</i></b> Ironically, Judah sees Tamar only when she is covered. Whether a covered face indicated the garb of a prostitute in the ancient Near East is far from certain. That Judah does not recognize Tamar despite the veil—or at least by her voice when they negotiate— is a measure of his eager state. It may also signal a lack of familiarity with his daughter-in-law. She, in fact, does not pretend to anything apart from disguising herself and looking available. She leaves the rest to him. He jumps to the conclusion that she is a prostitute.
<b><i>entrance to Enaim.</i></b> The phrase is also a pun, meaning “opening of the eyes.” Blind in this very spot to Tamar’s plight and presence, Judah’s eyes will soon open.
<i><b>for she saw.</b></i> Although Tamar’s specific plan is not recorded, the incentive for her action is clear: Judah’s failure to keep his promise and duty.

Verse 15



Verse 16

<b><i>she said, “What will you give me to couple with me?”</i></b> Has Tamar planned to have sex with Judah, as the text at least implies? Or did she have some other encounter in mind—and this is why she has disguised herself? At any rate, when Judah suggests having sex with her as a prostitute, she quickly bargains for her presumed wages. She demands a payment; and even if she had no previous such plan, she is quick-witted enough to devise one now.

Verse 17



Verse 18

<b><i>“Your signet seal, your cord, and the staff in your hand.”</i></b> Judah characteristically suggests a delayed payment (a kid; see at 37:31–35). Tamar asks for a guaranty: she names Judah’s signet, cord, and staff. In other words, she wants <i>all</i> his identity markers (equivalent today to all of one’s major credit cards; see Robert Alter, <i>The Art of Biblical Narrative</i>, 1981, p. 9). While practical as a guaranty, these items also convey Tamar’s goal of legitimating herself. Surprisingly, Judah agrees to this exaggerated request. Tamar, if she had no plan to conceive a child prior to the encounter, certainly has this possibility in mind at this point. Judah has now surrendered, symbolically, his identity and social status as patriarch to Tamar.

Verse 19



Verse 20



Verse 21

<b><i>“courtesan.”</i></b> Heb. <i>k’deishah</i> (“hallowed one” or “one apart”), a word related to <i>kadosh</i> (“holy”) and thus translated sometimes as “cult prostitute.” While Judah previously assumes that Tamar is a <i>zonah</i> (prostitute), here his friend inquires using a different term. Some have suggested that cultic prostitution—namely, sexual activities connected to worship in shrines—existed in ancient Israel. But there is no evidence that this ever existed anywhere in the ancient Near East. Judah’s friend may be attempting to add dignity to a simple sexual transaction by giving it a cultic meaning. The present translation presumes that he is using a more genteel term, with no cultic signification implied.

Verse 22



Verse 23



Verse 24

TAMAR IS VINDICATED: TRIAL, BIRTH, AND EDUCATION (38:24–30)
<b><i>“let her be burned!”</i></b> Judah’s rash judgment highlights the gender double-standard that the story unmasks and probably critiques. Judah has the right, as head of household, to condemn Tamar to death for her “whoredom,” which is how her pregnancy is seen. The usual biblical punishment for adultery, for both women and men, is by stoning; but Judah demands burning. In the Bible and the ancient Near East, “adultery” concerned only a married woman; and Tamar’s status is still that because, in spite of being sent to her father’s house, the marriage relationship is with the household (Judah’s), not only with the dead husband; and Judah has not released her of this bond (as is possible to do according to the levirate marriage custom, Deuteronomy 25:7–10).

Verse 25

<b><i>Acknowledge.</i></b> Heb. <i>haker na,</i> the same words that Judah and his brothers had posed to their father when they deceived him (“do you recognize it,” 37:32).
Tamar, discreetly, does not confront Judah but sends his symbols of identity and allows him to draw his own conclusion (as was done to Jacob upon Joseph’s presumed death, 37:32–33). Such an indirect mode is risky but in this case effective; complete silence or a head-on confrontation would have been shameful, perhaps also counterproductive.

Verse 26

<b><i>Judah…said, “She is more in the right than I.”</i></b> Judah recognizes that Tamar has behaved in a more moral fashion than he has. He does not comment on his own unchecked desire, on his having been deceived, or on the sudden prospect of progeny. The phrasing indicates relativization: according to Judah, Tamar is not <i>wholly</i> in the right but is better by comparison with him. Yet this is the first reported occasion where anyone has called Judah to account for his actions; he rises to the occasion by taking responsibility for his earlier words and actions—albeit indirectly. It marks a definite step in his maturation.
<i><b>he never touched her again.</b></i> That he has no more sex with Tamar may be another attempt to whitewash his dubious behavior. At any rate, his response limits Tamar’s success: she becomes a mother (of twins) but remains without a (sexual) partner. She saves Judah’s household (and, historically, Israel) but does not transform her own position back into a married woman (as it should have been had Judah given her Shelah as promised).

Verse 27

<b><i>27–30.</i></b> Tamar’s vindication by Judah is supplemented by what seems like divine vindication. Tamar is amply rewarded for her deeds: she brings twin sons into the world (although she remains a single mother).

Verse 28



Verse 29

<b><i>she said.</i></b> Most likely the midwife, who has identified the baby and his actions (v. 28).
<i><b>she named him.</b></i> [Literally, “[he] named him”; but the verb’s implied subject lacks a clear male antecedent. In such a construction the masculine verb does not necessarily imply a gendered referent; many translations render the verb impersonally: “he was named.” The present translation, however, seems influenced by the fact that in the Bible, it is usually the mother or midwife who names a newborn, and that some ancient translations also state “she named him,” as if that was perhaps the reading in their Hebrew source manuscripts. —<i>Ed.</i>] <i><b>Perez.</b></i> The name means “Breach.” It describes not only the circumstances of his birth, but also, indirectly, of his conception.

Chapter 39



Verse 1

<i>Joseph and Madam Potiphar</i>
SEX AND DECEPTION (39:1–23)
The story of Joseph resumes right where it left him in 37:36—brought down to Egypt and sold as a slave there. While much in this narrative remains ambiguous, it does continue the theme of self-definition in relation to the other peoples, this time focusing on the danger awaiting a male Israelite in a foreign land.
JOSEPH SUCCEEDS IN POTIPHAR’S HOUSE (39:1–6)
<b><i>I. Potiphar.</i></b> The name of Joseph’s new master resembles Potiphera, the name of the father of Asenath, Joseph’s future wife (41:45). If there is a connection, the Torah does not describe it.
<b><i>one of Pharaoh’s officers.</i></b> Heb. <i>s’ris paroh;</i> the noun <i>saris</i> means either “a eunuch” or “an official.” Potiphar’s wife’s attraction to Joseph and her attempted seduction of him (see below) might seem different if her husband were understood to be a eunuch.

Verse 2

<b><i>2–5.</i></b> God intervenes directly for the first time in this parashah. And undoubtedly Joseph—as a young man in a strange land—would need this divine help.

Verse 3



Verse 4



Verse 5



Verse 6

<b><i>the food he ate.</i></b> This might be a playful reference to his wife, given that in v. 9 below, Joseph tells Madam Potiphar that his master has “withheld nothing from me but you.” <i><b>fair of form and fair of appearance.</b></i> Literally, “good looking and good to look at.” The same words described his mother Rachel in 29:17 (translated there as “beautiful of form and of face”). Implicitly, his beauty would serve as Madam Potiphar’s motivation for what follows.

Verse 7

JOSEPH RESISTS SEDUCTION (39:7–12)
<b><i>set her sights on Joseph.</i></b> Literally, “lifted her eyes up to Joseph.” <i><b>“Lie with me!”</b></i> Madam Potiphar falls for Joseph and approaches him with this blatant bid. She is painfully direct. We have no details as to her motivation apart from Joseph’s beauty: is it lust only, or love as well? Is her husband a eunuch (see at v. 1), thus justifying her adulterous thought somewhat?

Verse 8

<b><i>8–9. But he refused.</i></b> Joseph cites his master’s trust and God as the two reasons for his refusal. He does <i>not</i> say whether or not he desires his mistress. Indeed, in the absence of data about her—name, looks, age, and attractiveness are all lacking—we may read his refusal either as lack of interest or, conversely, as control of desire due to loyalty to his earthly and divine masters.

Verse 9



Verse 10

<b><i>she would sweet-talk Joseph day after day.</i></b> The seduction attempts are still only verbal.

Verse 11

 Why does Joseph go inside when no one else is around, when he knows the mistress should be inside and waiting to pursue him, as she does “day after day”? What is the unspecified “work”? And where are all the household members? The text is ambiguous, as is Joseph’s behavior.

Verse 12

<b><i>she took hold of him.</i></b> For the first time, Madam attempts something physical: she gets hold of Joseph’s garment.
<i><b>he left his garment in her hand.</b></i> As when his brothers took his robe (37:23), Joseph here is divested of his garment. This time we have no idea what garment it is, although once again it will be used to deceive.
<i><b>fled, and ran outside.</b></i> Joseph votes with his feet, so to speak. His verbal refusal is now backed by action.

Verse 13

MADAM POTIPHAR LIES AND JOSEPH IS ARRESTED (39:13–20) To protect herself, Madam Potiphar accuses Joseph of intending to or actually forcing himself on her. The woman who kept saying laconically, “Lie with me!” now becomes a great rhetor as well as an accomplished liar. She presents her case skillfully to the menservants and to her husband, emphasizing different things in each instance.
<b><i>13–15.</i></b> Somehow the menservants are now available again to Madam. In this, her first version of the story, she enlists their sympathy against an upstart foreign (Hebrew) man, brought in by “him”— her husband.

Verse 14

<b><i>“to toy.”</i></b> Heb. <i>l’tzachek,</i> which has a sexual connotation—such as when Isaac “toys” with his wife Rebekah, whereby Abimelech understands that the pair is married (26:8, where this verb is translated as “fondling”).
<i><b>“with us.”</b></i> She includes the menservants as intended victims. The “us” versus “he” places her on the side of the menservants, against her unnamed husband.

Verse 15



Verse 16

 She then keeps the garment, presumably as proof of her story.

Verse 17

<b><i>“The Hebrew slave.”</i></b> In this second version, delivered to the master, she emphasizes Joseph’s slave status.
<i><b>“whom you brought to us.”</b></i> Given that no one else seems to be present, the “us” here presumably refers only to her and her husband, thus emphasizing Potiphar’s responsibility in this shared concern of wife and husband to uphold the husband’s honor.
<i><b>“to toy with me.”</b></i> The “us” from her previous statement is reconfigured as “me.”

Verse 18



Verse 19

 The wife manages to anger her husband, but we readers remain in the dark: does he believe her? He sends Joseph to prison (v. 20), but this is the royal prison where accused persons await decisions concerning their fate. Potiphar does not punish his wife, which would indicate more clearly that he believes Joseph. The ambiguity remains.

Verse 20



Verse 21

CONCLUSION: JOSEPH SUCCEEDS IN JAIL (39:21–23) At first it appears that Joseph has merely moved from one pit (in the ground in Canaan) to another (in prison in Egypt). Yet the end of this episode links with its beginning. God again has blessed Joseph; the chief jailer likes him and puts him in charge (vv. 21–22) and leaves “everything” to Joseph’s management. Once again, God makes Joseph “succeed.”    

Chapter 40



Verse 1

<i>Joseph’s Education Continues</i>
THE DREAM INTERPRETER IN JAIL (40:1–23)
In this concluding unit of the parashah, Joseph grows further in stature. From a callous youth, he becomes a person who cares. He asks two jail mates why they look sad after their dreams and is prepared to help (vv. 7–8). He protests his innocence but forgoes the chance to blame anybody specifically (v. 15). From being a mere dreamer, he becomes a dream interpreter. He is coming closer to the ancient Near East’s “wise man” or “wise courtier” ideal type, which is present also in the portrayals of Mordecai (in the book of Esther) and of Daniel.

Verse 15

 For the first time, the story depicts Joseph telling someone in Egypt how he came to be there. The version he tells the cupbearer is notable for its heavily edited contents. There is not a word about his brothers, or the events in Potiphar’s house. He blames nobody and names no culprit. All he does is establish his innocence so that, upon his restoration, the cupbearer would remember and mention him to the pharaoh. This is also the first time we are told that Joseph actively seeks freedom, or an improvement of his lot, since coming to Egypt.
* * * From an arrogant and gossipy boy, Joseph has grown into a young man who refuses adultery with his master’s wife, who suffers in prison, who does not tell on his brothers when the opportunity arises. Clearly, he can now exercise control over his own behavior and emotions, which he could not do earlier—and which is a prerequisite for his future role. In addition, from a dreamer he has evolved into a dream interpreter. He is poised to act on dreams to the benefit of all: his adopted land, his own self, and his original family.

Chapter 41



Verse 1

<i>Joseph Interprets Pharaoh’s Dreams and Rises to Power</i> (41:1–57)
As the parashah opens, Joseph is in Egypt, where he is not only a slave but also indefinitely detained in a prison—and no one in his family knows his whereabouts. For readers the situation would seem grim but for the narrator’s note that “יהוה was with Joseph” (39:21). In his youth, Joseph’s dreams had provided the pretext for his enslavement (see 37:19–20); now—in a turn of poetic justice—the dreams of others provide the context for solving his problem both of enslavement and of imprisonment: the ruler of Egypt awakens from a pair of disturbing premonitory dreams; upon hearing this, his chief cupbearer recalls how he once received help with his own troubling dream. And this leads back to Joseph.
Although Pharaoh’s dreams strictly relate to famine in Egypt, as the story later unfolds we will see the famine extending to the land where Jacob resides. Thus, the famine will make it possible for Joseph to be reunited with his family.
PHARAOH DREAMS OF COWS AND CORN (41:1–8)
After Joseph interpreted the dreams of the chief cupbearer and the chief baker (Genesis 40), he has another opportunity to demonstrate his dream interpretation skills.

Verse 2

<b><i>2–7. cows…ears of grain.</i></b> The cows and the corn symbolize the fertility of the land.

Verse 9

THE CHIEF CUPBEARER RECALLS JOSEPH, INTERPRETER OF DREAMS (41:9–13)
<b><i>“This day I [must] acknowledge my sins!”</i></b> In 40:14 Joseph had asked the cupbearer to mention him to Pharaoh and to help free him. The cupbearer is only doing that now, two years later. His offense this time is forgetting Joseph.

Verse 10



Verse 11



Verse 12

<b><i>“he interpreted for us.”</i></b> The cupbearer attributes the ability to interpret dreams to Joseph, while Joseph had claimed that dream interpretation comes from God (40:8), a view that he articulates consistently (see below at v. 16).

Verse 13



Verse 14

JOSEPH INTERPRETS PHARAOH’S DREAMS (41:14–36)
<b><i>he shaved.</i></b> In the ancient Near East, only the Egyptians were clean shaven, so as Joseph prepares to go before Pharaoh his appearance is made distinctively Egyptian, reflecting Egyptian protocol—and foreshadowing Joseph’s rise from a slave to one who has authority over Egyptians.
<i><b>changed his clothing.</b></i> Joseph’s clothes have served to signal his fate (his special coat from his father, 37:3, 33; his garment in the hands of his master’s wife, 39:12–18). In this case, new clothing is a sign of a positive shift in identity.

Verse 15

However, in the next parashah, Joseph will be the one to provide nourishment when he is in charge of distributing grain during the famine.

Verse 37

JOSEPH IS ELEVATED TO HIGH OFFICE AND MARRIES ASENATH (41:37–49) Here Joseph is given signs of his authority in the Egyptian court. With this clothing and associated goods, Joseph moves from an outsider to an insider status in Egypt. Ironically, a slave has risen to the second-highest post. It has been suggested that such a role for the foreigner would have been historically possible during the time when the Asiatic Hyksos reigned in Egypt (the 17th and 16th centuries <small>B.C.E.</small>).

Verse 42

<b><i>signet ring.</i></b> A ring with the royal symbol of Pharaoh.

Verse 43

<b><i>“Royal Steward!”</i></b> Heb. <i>avrech</i>; it appears nowhere else in the Bible and its meaning is unclear. It has also been translated “bow the knee.” The term may have Egyptian origins.

Verse 44



Verse 45

<b><i>Zaphenath-paneah.</i></b> Egyptian for “God speaks and lives.” <i><b>On.</b></i> The ancient city of Heliopolis, north of modern Cairo.
<i><b>Asenath.</b></i> Egyptian for “the one belonging to Neith.” Neith was an Egyptian creator goddess seen as both the mother of the king and the mother of Re, the ancient Egyptian creator god and god of the sun.
<i><b>daughter of Potiphera.</b></i> When Joseph had encountered Potiphar’s wife, he wound up in jail (Genesis 39); but now, when he encounters Potiphera’s daughter, Joseph becomes fully integrated into Egyptian society. Perhaps the author is subtly contrasting the “evil woman” versus the “good woman” here. Biblical women characters in Genesis are often presented in pairs: Sarah and Hagar, Rachel and Leah, Bilhah and Zilpah, and now, Potiphar’s wife and Asenath.
<i><b>Potiphera.</b></i> In Egyptian, “the one whom [the god] Re gave.” As just noted, this name evokes that of Pharaoh’s officer, Potiphar (Genesis 39), which is obviously similar; but the distinctions between professions suggest different figures.
<i><b>as a wife.</b></i> This, like his new name, indicates Joseph’s acceptance into Egyptian society and a shift in his identity. One may understand Joseph now to be not only an Egyptian, but also a fully adult male (age 30, according to v. 46). Comparative evidence, not only from other ancient Near Eastern cultures but also from anthropological data regarding patrilineally organized societies, makes clear that in the biblical period, a male was not considered a man until he had a wife (if not also children). Similarly, a female in ancient Israel was not fully accepted as a woman until she was married and had borne children to her husband (think of Sarah in Genesis 12–21; see further Naomi Steinberg, <i>Kinship and Marriage in Genesis,</i> 1993).
Joseph’s marriage to a woman of Egyptian descent is an example of <i>exogamous</i> marriage, that is, marriage outside the patrilineal (male line) kinship group. This prefigures Moses’ marriage to a foreign woman (Exodus 2:21) and is in stark contrast to the postexilic marriage restrictions in Ezra 9–10. (See further Another Contemporary Reflection.)

Verse 46



Verse 47



Verse 48



Verse 49



Verse 50

ASENATH BEARS MANASSEH AND EPHRAIM TO JOSEPH (41:50–52) The names of Joseph’s sons reflect their father’s circumstances and embody his longing to forget his past (Manasseh) and his hope of success (Ephraim). In contrast to Jacob’s sons, whose names bear the hopes and circumstances of their mothers Leah and Rachel (29:31–30:24; 35:18), these sons’ names say nothing about Asenath’s aspirations. Her sons, progenitors of the tribes of Manasseh and Ephraim, are not only linked to the family of Israel but also are descendants of an Egyptian priestly heritage. Jacob later recognizes both of these sons as full heirs to the Israelite lineage (48:5).

Verse 51



Verse 52



Verse 53

FAMINE CAUSES “ALL LANDS” TO TRAVEL TO EGYPT FOR GRAIN (41:53–57) Presumably due to its reliable water supply from the Nile, Egypt is a destination for food; see Abraham and Sarah’s visit there for that reason (12:10). In Genesis (contrary to Exodus) the Israelites find sustenance in Egypt.

Chapter 42



Verse 1

<i>Ten Brothers Journey to Egypt</i> (42:1–25)
This unit explores what it means to be a member of a family: what it means to be a brother, what it means to be a father (especially one who plays favorites among his children), and what it means to take responsibility for one’s past actions toward other family members.
The words “brother” and “recognize” are abundant in this unit; they remind us of when Jacob recognized a bloodied coat as belonging to Joseph (37:31–33). Likewise, they recall Tamar’s words to Judah, inviting him to recognize (“acknowledge”) and take responsibility for his actions (38:25). This is one of several connections to the episode of Tamar and Judah in Genesis 38.
JACOB SENDS TEN BROTHERS TO EGYPT FOR FOOD (42:1–5)

Verse 2



Verse 3

<b><i>3–4. Joseph’s brothers…ten of them…Joseph’s [full] brother…his brothers.</i></b> The differing status of the brothers’ relationship to Jacob—depending on their different mothers—is emphasized in the wording that separates Joseph’s ten half-brothers from Benjamin, Joseph’s brother by the same mother Rachel.

Verse 4



Verse 5



Verse 6

THE BROTHERS APPEAR BEFORE JOSEPH (42:6–17)  <i><b>7. recognized…pretended to be a stranger.</b></i> There is a wordplay at this point because the same Hebrew root, <i>n-k-r</i>, is behind both verbs. The word also figures prominently in the story of Tamar and Judah—when Tamar confronts Judah with his responsibility for her pregnancy (38:25).

Verse 7



Verse 8



Verse 9

 Joseph’s identity is masked from his brothers, enabling him to confine them, just as he was earlier confined by them. This is a case of role reversal between the brothers. Joseph may have had one or more motives at this time: punishment, testing, teaching a lesson, or fulfillment of his earlier dream of having all his brothers bow down to him.
<i><b>“nakedness.”</b></i> Heb. <i>ervah</i>, which brings to mind that in the Bible nakedness is usually connected with sexual misconduct. (See Leviticus 18:6–20.)

Verse 10



Verse 11

<b><i>“we are all of us sons of the same man.”</i></b> The brothers’ statement is intended to refute the charge that they are a band of unrelated individuals plotting against Egyptian bounty, but on another level it reminds us of the emphasis on family unity that characterizes the tension of the narrative.

Verse 12



Verse 13



Verse 14



Verse 15

<b><i>15–16.</i></b> Joseph asks to see the other son borne by his mother, Rachel. In light of how Leah’s sons had mistreated him, Joseph may fear that a similar fate has met his only full brother, Benjamin.

Verse 16



Verse 17

<b><i>he placed them under guard for three days.</i></b> The brothers are confined just as Joseph was (40:3).

Verse 18

JOSEPH DEMANDS THAT THEY BRING BENJAMIN (42:18–25)

Verse 19

<b><i>19–20. “let one of your brothers be confined in your place of custody…then bring your youngest brother to me.”</i></b> We are not told what motivates Joseph’s change in plans. Joseph must realize that the separation of Benjamin and Jacob will cause great distress to his father.

Verse 20



Verse 21



Verse 22

<b><i>Reuben now responded to them, saying “Didn’t I say to you, ‘Do not sin against the lad!’”</i></b> Reuben’s remark indicates that the brothers’ actions toward Joseph still haunt them.

Verse 23



Verse 24

<b><i>He left them and wept.</i></b> This is the first of four times in this parashah and the next that Joseph weeps with emotion over his brothers (see also 43:30; 45:1–2, 14–15; and in 46:29, Joseph weeps when he is reunited with his father).
<i><b>took Simeon from them.</b></i> Leah’s second son is taken hostage until Benjamin, Rachel’s second son, comes down to Egypt and appears before Joseph. Not knowing for sure that Benjamin is alive and well, Joseph may think that his brothers will care more for money than for Simeon—a repetition of their past actions toward him. However, the significance of Joseph’s actions can have more than one meaning: while earlier the brothers judged him, now he stands in judgment over them and attempts to make them feel the desperation that they once made him feel.

Verse 25



Verse 26

<i>Nine Brothers Return to Canaan</i> (42:26–38)
The vizier has detained Simeon and dismissed the rest of the brothers (vv. 24–25). Ten had left for Egypt to procure food (v. 3), but only nine now make it back home to their father. As these ostensibly free family members react to their situation, it reveals to the reader that they are, as it were, trapped in a confinement of their own: the family is constrained by unacknowledged favoritism, betrayal, and guilt. Thus even what might otherwise be greeted with glee—the surprise discovery of money—is received with dismay (vv. 28, 35).
ONE BROTHER DISCOVERS MONEY IN HIS SACK (42:26–28)

Verse 27



Verse 28

<b><i>“What is this…?”</i></b> The brothers, like the reader, do not know why the money is in each of their sacks. Will it be the source of economic relief or cause them trouble?

Verse 29

THE BROTHERS REPORT TO JACOB (42:29–35)

Verse 30



Verse 31



Verse 32



Verse 33



Verse 34



Verse 35

<b><i>each one’s money-bag was in his sack.</i></b> As also in v. 27, above, the Hebrew word <i>hinneh</i> (untranslated here, but rendered as “lo” or “behold” elsewhere in this translation) appears at the beginning of this phrase to emphasize the drama of the discovery of the money. Here it also indicates a shift from the narrator’s to the character’s point of view.

Verse 36

JACOB IS DISMAYED MOSTLY OVER THE PROSPECTIVE LOSS OF BENJAMIN (42:36–38)
<b><i>“Joseph is no more, Simeon is no more, and now you would take Benjamin from me.”</i></b> Jacob may think that the brothers sold Simeon for the money that now appears in their sacks—and that they plan the same fate for Benjamin. Benjamin is Jacob’s youngest son and, as far as Jacob knows, his only surviving son from his beloved wife Rachel, who died in childbirth (35:16–19).

Verse 37



Verse 38

<b><i>But [Jacob] said, “My son shall not go down with you—his brother is dead and he alone remains.”</i></b> Jacob’s speech illustrates that he cannot be consoled after losing the sons Rachel bore to him, while the loss of his other sons is acceptable. Note the shifting familial language: Jacob refers to Benjamin as “my son” and then Joseph as “his brother,” relating them both back to his love for the deceased Rachel. Jacob is still oblivious to the alienation that such favoritism causes among the brothers. His response—that only Benjamin remains—denies the other ten brothers any place in their father’s family or feelings. It is as if they do not exist for their father.
<i><b>“cause my gray head to go down in anguish to Sheol.”</b></i> Jacob uses a Hebrew idiom for dying due to grief—rather than in a good old age—and descending to the realm of the dead. Earlier, Jacob had said he would go down to Sheol in mourning for the loss of Joseph, presumably to seek out his son there (37:35). Although Sheol is the underworld—a place below the ground—it is not to be equated with notions of Hell or a judgment after death. Such ideas did not exist in ancient Israelite thought; going to Sheol was the fate of all human beings.

Chapter 43



Verse 1

<i>The Second Journey to Egypt, with Benjamin</i> (43:1–44:13a)
Eventually even in Jocab’s enormously wealthy household (30:43), the economic situation in Canaan gets desperate. Judah, the fourth oldest son, is at first as reactive as the rest, but eventually he rises to the occasion and shows real leadership. This enables the family to move forward with a plan.
CONTINUING FAMINE FORCES JACOB TO LET BENJAMIN GO (43:1–14)

Verse 2



Verse 3

<b><i>Judah said to him.</i></b> Now Judah functions as spokesman for the brothers; previously Reuben had spoken up ineffectually on their behalf (42:37). It may be that Reuben was afraid to challenge his father directly due to his apparently unsuccessful attempt to usurp Jacob’s role as head of the family when Reuben lay with Bilhah (35:22). However, based on his experience that followed upon his unjust treatment of Tamar (Genesis 38; see further below, v. 9), Judah has meanwhile developed the resolve to speak directly to his father of what needs to be done in order for the family to survive.

Verse 4



Verse 5



Verse 6

<b><i>6–7. “Why did you do me this wrong…‘Bring your brother down’?”</i></b> Jacob blames his sons for disclosing the existence of Benjamin. They innocently and honestly respond that they could hardly have foreseen that they would be asked to bring Benjamin with them on their next trip to Egypt. Imagine how Jacob would have felt if he learned at this point of their earlier treatment of Joseph.

Verse 7



Verse 8



Verse 9

 Judah now takes responsibility for the safe return of Benjamin from Egypt. He introduces the religious language of sin (<i>ch-t-a</i>), here translated as “condemned,” which emphasizes the gravity of Judah’s offer to his father. Judah promises Jacob that he will answer for Benjamin in Egypt. Through their statements we can perceive the concern that the brothers have for their father’s emotional wellbeing, as well as the depth of Jacob’s love for Benjamin. Although the family of Jacob has been torn apart in many respects, specific sons struggle to keep the family intact as best they can.
<i><b>“I will be responsible for him.”</b></i> Heb. <i>e’ervenu,</i> based on the same root <i>(e-r-v)</i> as <i>eravon</i> (“pledge”), found in the Bible only in Genesis 38 (vv. 17, 18, 20). The use of such a rare term suggests a deliberate link to the Tamar and Judah story in Genesis 38—and to Judah’s earlier, hasty responses in that episode. If so, the author may imply that Judah’s more mature behavior results from his encounter with Tamar at “the entrance to Enaim” (38:14), a locale that also can be read as “the opening of the eyes.” The transformation of Judah from a callous son in Genesis 37 to a responsible man who can rise to leadership can be understood, then, as a consequence of his eye-opening experience with Tamar.

Verse 15

<i><b>there he wept.</b></i> This is the second time we are told that Joseph weeps; see at 42:24, above.
 <i><b>34. Benjamin’s portion exceeded all of theirs fivefold.</b></i> Joseph’s overt favoritism of Benjamin may indicate his own affection for the only other son borne by his mother Rachel. But Joseph may be testing his brothers to determine whether or not their jealousy toward Jacob’s favorite now applies to Benjamin, now the perceived favorite son. Joseph treats his full brother differently from his halfbrothers. By the brothers’ and the narrator’s identifying the sons not only through their father but also by their mother (see also v. 29), we understand that the mother matters, not only the father.

Chapter 44



Verse 1

JOSEPH TESTS THE BROTHERS (44:1–2) Genesis 42 had begun a reenactment of scenes from Joseph’s early experience with his brothers. Now begins the concluding episode that addresses these issues.

<b><i>“Let anyone caught with it among your servants die.”</i></b> The brothers’ rash statement, like Jacob’s in 31:32, condemns the “thief” to death, but it will have bearing on the fate of all the brothers.

Verse 10

 The steward agrees that the harsh sentence is just, but he promises a lighter punishment.

Verse 11



Verse 12

<b><i>eldest…youngest.</i></b> This search scene continues to recall the one in which Laban searched throughout the tents of his nephew’s family, ending up in the tent of his youngest daughter, Rachel (31:30–35). Now the present search ends with her youngest son, Benjamin.

Verse 13

<b><i>They tore their mantles.</i></b> The tearing of the clothing reflects the brothers’ concern that Benjamin would be torn from their family. (The custom of tearing one’s clothes as an act of mourning is still followed today.) His fate appears to have been sealed by his brothers’ own words (v. 9). Thus once again they have set up one of Rachel’s offspring to become a slave. Indeed, these brothers had caused their father likewise to tear his garment—more than two decades earlier (37:34).
<i>The Third Appearance before Joseph</i>
THE FINAL TEST (44:13b–17)
The vizier’s missing goblet has been found in Benjamin’s bag (v. 12), suggesting that he stole it. Benjamin stands accused but lacks the ability to prove his innocence. Surely he will be enslaved and remain in Egypt, presumably for the rest of his life. Benjamin’s voice is heard nowhere in the entire narrative. Although he is now at the heart of the story, it is not really about him, but rather about the relationship of his brothers to each other and to their father. (In this regard he resembles his half-sister Dinah in Genesis 34.)
At this point the rest of the brothers—having narrowly escaped slavery themselves—are free to return home. Remarkably, they do not do so. Instead, they return with Benjamin to face the vizier (Joseph), who challenges them to account for their deed. Judah replies, and a dialogue ensues.
At this juncture, the psychological dynamics of these events operate on multiple levels. Thus we may speculate that Judah is haunted by guilt over what the brothers (without Benjamin’s involvement) did to Joseph long ago—and he feels that they must finally pay for their actions (see 42:21). Judah’s remarks can then refer both to the present unfortunate reality of the goblet in Benjamin’s sack and to the brothers’ past behavior toward Joseph.
THE BROTHERS APPEAR BEFORE JOSEPH (44:13b–15)

Verse 14

<b><i>Judah and his brothers.</i></b> Contrast this designation with 43:15–44:4. Since they left Canaan for Egypt, this party has been referred to—ten times in a row—only as <i>ha-anashim</i> (traditionally rendered as “the men”). The shift in language is significant; it may hint at the fraternal solidarity that forces on Judah the role of spokesperson for the brothers.

Verse 15



Verse 16

JUDAH’S CONFESSION (44:16) Judah acknowledges that all of the brothers are guilty before God, although he presumably believes that none of them is guilty of the crime in question.

Verse 17

JOSEPH DEMANDS ONLY BENJAMIN (44:17) Joseph sets up the brothers in order to test them. He intends to find out whether or not they have changed since when they threw him in a pit. In other words, Joseph intends to determine if the brothers will abandon Benjamin as earlier they had abandoned Joseph himself. He is also trying to set them up to face the prospect of their father’s grief over the loss of a favorite son.
<i><b>“go up in peace to your father.”</b></i> The last words of this parashah remind us of the peace that Jacob had lost when his ten oldest sons showed him Joseph’s bloodied coat (37:32). The parashah ends as a cliff-hanger, with the story’s resolution still to come in the parashah that follows.
<i>—Naomi Steinberg</i>  

Verse 18

<i>Judah Pleads for Benjamin’s Release</i> (44:18–34)
This parashah picks up where the last one left off: Joseph’s goblet had been found in Benjamin’s sack, and Joseph had announced his plan to make Benjamin his slave. [Rather than using the occasion as an opportunity to eliminate a rival for his father’s affection, Judah now strives to return Benjamin home. —<i>Ed.</i>]
<b><i>Judah now approached him.</i></b> Judah functions as a spokesman for the brothers.

Verse 19



Verse 20

 <b><i>“He alone was left of his mother, and so his father loves him</i></b> [<b><i>all the more</i></b>]<b><i>.”</i></b> Although the translator modifies the concluding mention of love with “[all the more],” the Hebrew can be understood to suggest that Jacob loves <i>only</i> Benjamin. Judah seems able to accept that state of affairs. The pathos of the story lies in this acknowledgement.

Verse 21



Verse 22

<b><i>“if he leaves his father, he will die!”</i></b> Judah’s recollection of this filial concern both indicates psychological maturity on his part and foreshadows the unity of father and sons that will finally resolve the tensions that split the family apart in Genesis 37. A family that had been divided against itself is about to overcome the years of alienation and living a lie. The loss of two of his own sons (38:7–10) explains Judah’s newfound sympathy, while his encounter with Tamar (38:12–26) seems to account for his willingness to take responsibility. (See at 43:9 and the introduction to <i>Mikeitz,</i> p. 233).

Verse 23

<b><i>23–34.</i></b> Judah makes several points in his eloquent speech to Joseph: (<i>1</i>) He retells the events that have led the brothers to be in their present circumstances. (<i>2</i>) He emphasizes how Benjamin’s absence will break the heart of their father Jacob. <i>(3)</i> He demonstrates his sincere desire to spare their father the heartbreak and offers to serve in Benjamin’s place in slavery.

Verse 24



Verse 25



Verse 26



Verse 27



Verse 28

<b><i>“Surely he’s been ripped to shreds!”</i></b> Joseph now learns how Jacob interpreted Joseph’s disappearance.

Verse 29

<b><i>“you will lower my gray head in woe to Sheol.”</i></b> This near-quotation of Jacob’s own words in 42:38 (reiterated in v. 31) leaves no doubt about the devastating effect on Jacob if Benjamin does not return to his father.

Verse 30



Verse 31

<b><i>“he will die.”</i></b> Judah reveals his desperate concern for the effect on his father, thus demonstrating the love that now binds the sons to their father.

Verse 32

<b><i>“If I don’t bring him back to you, I will stand guilty before my father for all time.”</i></b> Judah holds himself responsible for Benjamin because he stood surety for him earlier (43:9–10). Judah’s concern for his father’s welfare at this time stands in direct contrast to the spirit that moved him to participate in the brothers’ plot to rid them of Joseph back in 37:26. Previously self-centered, Judah emerges now as self-sacrificing.

Chapter 45



Verse 1

<i>Joseph Discloses His Identity</i>
RESPONSES AND RAMIFICATIONS (45:1–28)
Judah’s speech to Joseph has brought the suspense between the brothers to a climax, and it prompts Joseph’s self-revelation to his brothers. Joseph’s statements reveal that he too has undergone a transformation. Joseph’s emotional maturity matches the emotional maturity demonstrated in Judah’s speech on behalf of Benjamin, as well as Judah’s filial concern for Jacob’s well-being.
JOSEPH DISCLOSES HIS IDENTITY (45:1–3a)
Judah’s speech, and his concern for his father’s well-being, push Joseph to reveal himself—and proclaim his own identity and loyalties.

Verse 2

<b><i>wail.</i></b> This is the third of four times that Joseph weeps with emotion over his brothers (earlier: 42:24 and 43:30).
The Hebrew root <i>b-k-h</i> is often used also for female emotional distress, with a prominent example being the imagined weeping of Joseph’s mother, Rachel, for her lost children after the destruction of the northern tribes of Israel (Jeremiah 31:15).

Verse 3

 <i><b>“I am Joseph—is my father [really] alive?”</b></i> The story reaches its climax when Joseph finally discloses his true identity to his brothers. This is the pinnacle of the emotional build-up that has been developing in Joseph. His outburst of emotions and self-revelation stands out as one of the most moving expressions of family ties in the Torah.
JOSEPH AND HIS BROTHERS REUNITE (45:3b–15)

Verse 4



Verse 5

<b><i>5–7. “don’t be troubled… God sent me ahead of you.”</i></b> The assurance that God sent Joseph is so important here that it is repeated twice (in vv. 5 and 7). The arc that spans the stories of Joseph and his brothers serves to explain the will of God to bring about good for the people. The story perpetuates the idea that faithfulness results in divine action and ultimate relief for the people. Moreover, it affirms that God works through ordinary human beings to accomplish salvation for the people of Israel, as represented by the family of Jacob and his children. Thus, despite the emphasis on Joseph in Genesis 37–50, the drama really concerns a father and all his sons. The family is only a family when all its members acknowledge their connection and unite to support each other. The travails of this family illustrate the messiness and unpredictability of human emotions. Rather than be angry at his brothers for what they did to him in the past, Joseph is now grateful for their presence in his life.
Moreover, the story establishes the importance of the capacity of human beings to forgive each other. The theme of family unity echoes the theme of God’s unified control of events. By attributing all that has happened to the divine intention to save lives, Joseph provides psychological support for the brothers to rid themselves of guilt over what they had done earlier.

Verse 6



Verse 7



Verse 8

<b><i>“So it’s not you who sent me here but the God who made me a father to Pharaoh.”</i></b> Joseph uses the language of family relations as a way to explain to them his power over and ability to counsel Pharaoh. Although in the ancient Near East people expressed <i>all</i> interpersonal and political relationships in household terms, here such usage is poignant because another “father” (Jacob) is so much on the mind of his sons.

Verse 9



Verse 10

<b><i>“You can settle in the land of Goshen and be near to me—you, your children, and your children’s children, your flocks and herds, and all that you own.”</i></b> The command from Joseph does not mention the women and wives traveling to Egypt with Jacob. This reflects the patrilineal concerns of the story. (See further at 6:10; 10:1.) However, in Genesis 45:19; 46:5 (see below) the wives of Jacob’s sons are acknowledged as members of the family of Jacob who went with him to Egypt.
The precise location of Goshen is not known, but it is clear from the context that the name refers to a geographical spot that will be ideal for the extended family and its flocks (46:32–34; 47:6, 11).

Verse 11



Verse 12



Verse 13



Verse 14

<b><i>14–15. weeping… and wept.</i></b> This is the fourth time Joseph weeps over his brothers (see at 45:2); he also weeps when reunited with his father (46:29).

Verse 15

<b><i>only after this.</i></b> The gestures of Joseph’s kissing his brothers and weeping over them is what gives the brothers confidence finally to respond. This very emotional scene clearly expresses the true fraternal affection felt by the brothers, who seem to have now made peace with the events of the past.

Verse 16

PHARAOH HELPS JOSEPH’S FAMILY (45:16–24)

Verse 17



Verse 18

<b><i>“households.”</i></b> Heb. <i>batim</i> (plural of <i>bayit,</i> literally “house”). The thrust of this term here is explained in the next verse: “little ones” and wives.

Verse 19



Verse 20



Verse 21



Verse 22

<b><i>To each he furnished a change of clothing.</i></b> The gift of clothing should remind the reader—and perhaps Joseph’s brothers themselves—of their earlier jealousy of the special clothing that he had long ago received from their father, a sign of Jacob’s favoritism (37:3–4). Whereas earlier, clothing had divided the brothers against Joseph, here it signifies the reconciliation between them.

Verse 23



Verse 24



Verse 25

JACOB LEARNS THAT JOSEPH IS ALIVE (45:25–28)

Verse 26

<b><i>26–27. When they told him “Joseph is still alive”…his heart froze,… But when they told him all that Joseph had spoken to them…their father Jacob’s spirit came alive.</i></b> Biblical narratives do not often describe how characters feel. Here, however, the vivid descriptions let readers see how shocked Jacob is upon discovering that his son Joseph—believed to have died twenty-two years earlier—is actually alive and well, and in a position of high authority and prestige in Egypt.

Verse 27



Verse 28

<b><i>Israel said, “Enough! My son Joseph is alive! I must go and see him before I die!”</i></b> Jacob’s excitement about reuniting with Joseph overshadows all material complications that the prospect of life in Egypt would seem to present. Jacob’s emotional outburst might have revived the brothers’ jealousy, but we are not told that they express any such feelings.

Chapter 46



Verse 1

<i>Jacob/Israel Meets Joseph In Egypt</i> (46:1–34)
At this juncture—as Jacob sets out on his journey to Egypt—the narrative marks the occasion in two ways. The first is a revelation from God. This is the first reported divine communication to Jacob since the death of his wife Rachel more than twenty years before.
The second way that the text marks this moment’s significance is with a genealogical list of all those who went down to Egypt with Jacob. Until now, Genesis has described the lineage of the patriarchs in what can be called a “vertical” genealogy that traces inheritance from father to one or more sons (11:27; 25:19; 37:2). In contrast, this unit emphasizes a “horizontal” genealogy that acknowledges the family relationship between Jacob and all of his offspring. (Compare Jacob’s adoption and blessing of Ephraim and Manasseh in Genesis 48.) This shift in how the genealogy is established coincides with the conclusion of the ancestors’ time in Canaan. The rest of the Torah will concern the people of Israel in circumstances outside their Promised Land.
PREPARATIONS (46:1–7)
<b><i>Israel.</i></b> This is the name that was given to Jacob in 32:29 and 35:10. Jacob/Israel is an example of an eponym—a group’s taking its name from (or: later attributing its name to) an individual. The shift here from Jacob (one man) to Israel (representing the people of God) may be occasioned by the fact that this is the only theophany—direct appearance of God—in the stories of Joseph.
<i><b>offered sacrifices.</b></i> Eager though he is to see Joseph, Jacob nevertheless takes time to express gratitude and attend to his relationship with God.

Verse 2



Verse 3

 [<i><b>God</b></i>] <i><b>said, “I am God the God of your father.”</b></i> Here is a reference to family religion, linking one generation of believers to the next. God’s self-revelation emphasizes the overarching link between earlier stories of Jacob’s ancestors and his own experiences of the divine.
<i><b>“do not be afraid to go down to Egypt.”</b></i> Only after God assures Jacob and blesses him does Jacob move on from Beersheba. This scene further reinforces the importance of God in Jacob’s life.

Verse 4

<b><i>“Joseph will lay his hand upon your eyes.”</i></b> A reference to the practice of a family member’s closing the eyes of someone who has just died. God thereby promises Jacob that his favorite son not only will be present when he expires but also will properly care for his corpse. The latter was a matter of abiding concern in the Bible and ancient Near East. (On Israelite burial practices, see <i>Va-y’chi,</i> Another View.)

Verse 5



Verse 6



Verse 7

<b><i>His sons and his sons’ sons were with him, his daughters and his sons’ daughters.</i></b> The birth of only one daughter of Jacob—Dinah—is mentioned in Genesis. (She first appears in 30:21; see Genesis 34 for her story.) Both 37:35 and this verse indicate that Jacob had more than one daughter, but we have no other details about them apart from these references in passing. Likewise, 46:15 mentions “daughters” yet that passage identifies only Dinah.

Verse 8

THE SEVENTY MEMBERS OF JACOB’S FAMILY WHO COME TO EGYPT (46:8–27) These verses are especially important because they make reference to the women who comprise the family of Jacob. This section reiterates that the totality of Jacob’s family includes both women and men borne to Jacob by four different women. The members of the family are listed in relationship to the four women: Leah, Zilpah, Rachel, and Bilhah. The number of <i>banim</i> (“sons” or “children”) attributed to each of the women includes not only the individuals they bore but also their grandchildren.
<b><i>These are the names.</i></b> The same words open the book of Exodus, which begins with a list of only the twelve sons of Israel/Jacob.

Verse 9



Verse 10

<b><i>son of a Canaanite woman.</i></b> Simeon’s youngest son Saul is identified in the same unusual way in Exodus 6:15. Historically, the tribe of Simeon was later absorbed by the tribe of Judah. Not only Simeon married a Canaanite woman but also Judah (Genesis 38:2), reflecting both territorial expansion by these tribes and intermarriage with surrounding peoples.

Verse 11



Verse 12



Verse 13



Verse 14



Verse 15

<b><i>These were Leah’s sons.</i></b> Leah’s children are listed first, but she is not identified as a wife; compare v. 19.
<i><b>along with Dinah his daughter.</b></i> On Dinah, see at v. 7. It may be significant that she is listed here as <i>Jacob’s</i> daughter; she appeared in 34:1 as <i>Leah’s</i> daughter.

Verse 16



Verse 17

<b><i>their sister Serah.</i></b> Zilpah, one of Jacob’s wives, had borne him two sons, Gad and Asher; the latter became the father of four sons and one daughter, Serah. Serah is the only daughter of any of Jacob’s sons mentioned in this genealogy of those who went to Egypt with Jacob. Serah’s name appears again in Numbers 26:46—where she seems to be counted also among those leaving Egypt some 400 years later—and in I Chronicles 7:30. [The Bible also mentions another of Jacob’s granddaughters, Jochebed daughter of Levi; she is born in Egypt (Exodus 6:16–20; Numbers 26:59). —<i>Ed</i>.]

Verse 18

<b><i>These were Zilpah’s children, whom Laban had given to Leah his daughter. She bore these to Jacob.</i></b> The sons are not reckoned as Leah’s children but rather Zilpah’s, her handmaid, even though Leah had named them and claimed them as her own (30:9–13). Despite the ostensibly lower status of the handmaids, their sons are acknowledged as equal members of the family—as “Israel’s sons” (46:8). In this regard, it appears that the status of Jacob’s secondary wives, Zilpah and Bilhah, is comparable to the status of his primary wives, Leah and Rachel.

Verse 19

<b><i>Jacob’s wife Rachel.</i></b> Only she is explicitly identified as “Jacob’s wife.” And of the other wives, only her name appears twice (see v. 22), framing the list of her descendants.

Verse 20

<b><i>whom Asenath daughter of Potiphera priest of On bore to him.</i></b> This reference repeats information first mentioned in 41:50. This is the Bible’s third and final mention of Asenath; see also at 41:45. (The text does not censure Joseph for having married outside the kinship group, namely, for having an exogamous marriage.) Asenath is the only wife of the second generation to be named, perhaps a sign of her distinctive importance: Jacob’s eventual adoption of Ephraim and Manasseh (48:5) will make her the mother of two tribes—by proxy, a seventh matriarch. Just as the other sons of Jacob are listed according to their mothers, so too here.

Verse 21



Verse 22



Verse 23



Verse 24



Verse 25

<b><i>These were the children of Bilhah, whom Laban had given to Rachel his daughter.</i></b> These sons are not reckoned as Rachel’s children but rather Bilhah’s, even though Rachel had named them and claimed them as her own (30:3–8). As with Zilpah’s children (see at v. 18), the handmaids’ sons are acknowledged as equal members of the family.

Verse 26



Verse 27

<b><i>70 in all.</i></b> Seventy is a typological or symbolic number (a multiple of seven, equated with the seven days of Creation). Thus the text emphasizes the complete movement of the ancestral family from the Promised Land to Egypt, as the next step in their journey as God’s chosen people.

Verse 28

JACOB AND HIS SONS REUNITE (46:28–34)

Verse 29

<b><i>weeping all the time.</i></b> Just as earlier Joseph wept over seeing his brothers (see at 45:14–15), he now weeps at being reunited with his father.

Verse 30

<b><i>Israel said to Joseph, “Now…I can die at last.”</i></b> The poignancy of the reunion is stressed by Jacob’s statement that he can now die a happy man (in contrast to going down to Sheol in grief; see at 42:38, 44:29), having seen Joseph alive again. One thinks here of the many tearful reunion scenes in our own day of family members reunited after being separated from each other for decades.

Verse 31

<b><i>31–34.</i></b> Joseph quickly becomes businesslike in telling his father how he and the brothers ought to respond when they are presented before Pharaoh.

Verse 32



Verse 33



Verse 34

<b><i>“Egyptians find shepherds abhorrent.”</i></b> This statement is not supported by Egyptian records; moreover, even in the biblical account, Pharaoh has his own herds (see 47:6). Possibly it refers only to non-Egyptian shepherds. (Similarly, using the same Hebrew term as here, we are told that the Egyptians find it an “abomination” to eat together with Hebrews; 43:32.) The point seems to be that Jacob and his family will be allowed to live in a separate region from the Egyptian shepherds and maintain their own cultural identity.

Chapter 47



Verse 1

<i>Joseph and Jacob Meet with Pharaoh</i> (47:1–10)
During his long years in Egypt and in service to the pharaoh, Joseph has become a master of court diplomacy. These verses bring out the split nature of Joseph’s identity: he is aware of Egyptian court demeanor but also tied to his family of livestock herders. Throughout his time in Egypt, Joseph defies the “macho” stereotype; he uses diplomacy, rather than force, to raise his status in the Egyptian court. This is the characteristic maneuver of a minority people living in a majority culture; one thinks also of the biblical story of Esther and her dealings in the Persian court. However, standing in contrast to Joseph’s subtle maneuvering is the later behavior of Moses, who dramatically cut his youthful ties with Pharaoh’s palace when he “turned this way and that and, seeing no one about, he struck down the Egyptian and he hid him in the sand” (Exodus 2:12).

Verse 2

<b><i>2–4.</i></b> The text suggests a protocol that separates the pharaoh from the foreign brothers who are both ethnically and socially of a distinct status from the head of Egypt.

Verse 3



Verse 4



Verse 5



Verse 6

<b><i>“settle…in the best part of the land.”</i></b> This instruction—in fulfillment of what Pharaoh said in 45:18—signals the success of the audience before the pharaoh.

Verse 7

<b><i>greeted.</i></b> Heb. <i>va-y’varech,</i> which can also be translated as “blessed” (see at v. 10).

Verse 8

<b><i>Pharaoh said to Jacob.</i></b> Possibly as a sign of respect both for Jacob’s advanced age and for Joseph’s authority within Egypt, Pharaoh speaks more directly to the aged father than to Joseph’s brothers.

Verse 9

 Jacob responds to Pharaoh’s question with more than simple facts such as his age; he focuses on the sorrow in his life and acknowledges that his age does not compare with the longevity of his ancestors. Pharaoh’s request for personal information about Jacob establishes a bond between the two men who have in common that Joseph has been a central, life-sustaining figure for each of them.
<i><b>“fathers.</b>”</i> Heb. <i>avot,</i> which can mean “ancestors” (including females, as in v. 30, below), although here it seems that Jacob is intending only the male family heads: Terah died at 205, Abraham at 175, and Isaac at 180. He is, after all, older than his grandmother Sarah, who died at the age of 127. (The Bible does not disclose the longevity of the other matriarchs.)

Verse 10

<b><i>parting blessing.</i></b> Heb. <i>va-y’varech;</i> compare v. 7. | The bond between the two elders becomes even clearer when Jacob blesses Pharaoh before departing from his presence. Jacob’s blessing is rooted in the blessing of life that Pharaoh made possible for Joseph’s family. Normally it would go without saying that one utters a benevolent wish when departing from a favorable audience before a monarch. What is noteworthy here is that such an utterance is mentioned—and described as a “blessing,” which in the Torah has an overtone of divine favor. Compare Bathsheba’s exit from an audience with her husband, King David, in I Kings 1:31.

Verse 11

<i>Further Details Regarding Joseph and Family</i> (47:11–27)
JOSEPH SETTLES HIS FATHER’S HOUSEHOLD IN EGYPT (47:11–12)
<b><i>in the region of Rameses.</i></b> Up until this point, the text has repeatedly (eight times) referred to the place where Jacob would live with his family as “Goshen” (see also v. 27, below). A place named Rameses is mentioned also in Exodus 12:37 and Numbers 33:3, <i>5;</i> it is identified as a settlement in Exodus 1:11. This is one of the many biblical passages where a merging of different stories may be responsible for the text.

Verse 12



Verse 13

JOSEPH DEALS WITH THE FAMINE IN EGYPT (47:13–26) The text has been focused on the reconciliation and reunion of the family. Now the narrator must remind the reader that despite these happy circumstances, the reality of famine still plagues Egypt. This serves as a contrasting situation to that of Jacob’s family, which is explicitly said to be given food by Joseph (v. 12). Due to the need to preserve human life, the Egyptian people first sell their grain, then their livestock, and finally both their land and themselves to the royal court.

Verse 14

 The reminder of the famine allows the story to shift back to Joseph’s role in Egypt as the one with a plan to avert death when the famine hits.

Verse 15



Verse 16



Verse 17



Verse 18



Verse 19



Verse 20

<b><i>20–21.</i></b> Joseph’s authority as spokesperson for the Egyptian court is manifested when he buys all the land from the impoverished Egyptian population and accepts their servitude.

Verse 21



Verse 22



Verse 23



Verse 24



Verse 25



Verse 26



Verse 27

CONCLUSION: ISRAEL/JACOB PROSPERS IN EGYPT (47:27) The parashah concludes by shifting attention back to the prosperity of Jacob in Egypt and the fruitfulness of the family line there.
<b><i>Israel thus settled.</i></b> By referring to the thriving of “Israel” rather than the individual Jacob, the text emphasizes that what was once a family of brothers (and sisters) and their father (and their mothers) has grown into a nation. (Compare at 46:1.) Both God’s promise to Abraham in 12:2 (“I will make of you a great nation”) and the blessing bestowed upon Rebekah in 24:60 (“Sister, may you become thousands of myriads”) have begun to be fulfilled.
<i>—Naomi Steinberg</i>   

Verse 28

<i>Jacob’s Last Days</i> (47:28–48:22)
The patriarch turns his attention to his legacy. Jacob’s first concern is his final resting-place (47:28–31); he insists that it be in the location that his grandfather Abraham had dedicated. Jacob’s second concern for legacy involves assigning heirs, which prompts him to make special provisions for Joseph’s two sons (48:1–20). His third concern, combining elements of the first two, is that his descendants return to their ancestral land and live there (48:21–22).
One aspect of the desires that Jacob expresses has since been echoed by pious Jews through the ages and in our own day: to be buried in the Land of Israel. On the ancient norm of burial in a family plot or cave, rather than in a communal cemetery, see Another View.
JACOB PREPARES FOR DEATH AND BURIAL (47:28–31)
<b><i>Jacob lived in the land of Egypt 17 years.</i></b> The period is noted as if to say that it formed a separate chapter in his life.
<i><b>Jacob’s days—the years of his life—were 147.</b></i> The narration begins a formulaic summary of Jacob’s lifetime, but it will not actually relate his demise until much later (49:33; compare 25:7–8; 35:28–29). This parashah thus zooms in on the relatively brief moment in Jacob’s existence that lies in between.

Verse 29

<b><i>29–31.</i></b> These burial instructions mention neither the locale of the ancestral resting-place nor even the country where it is located. What Jacob emphasizes is that burial must not be in Egypt (stated twice), and that Joseph must swear to carry out these instructions. Compare the reiterations at 49:29–32 and 50:5; see the comments there.
 It is the duty of sons to bury their father: Isaac and Ishmael buried Abraham (25:9), and Esau and Jacob buried Isaac (35:29). But Jacob does not summon all his sons; he summons only Joseph— child of his beloved Rachel—his favorite son and the one of highest status in Egypt.
Later, when Joseph himself is about to die, he will utter a similar statement: “I am dying, but God will surely take care of you and bring you up out of this land to the land that [God] promised to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob” (50:24).
<b><i>“put your hand under my thigh.”</i></b> This act and the accompanying verbal oath (v. 31) comprise the swearing that Jacob requires; compare Abraham’s procedure when he sent his slave to secure a wife for Isaac (24:2–3, 9).

Verse 30

<b><i>“ancestors.”</i></b> [Heb. <i>avot,</i> often translated as “fathers.” See at 25:8. —<i>Ed.</i>]

Chapter 48



Verse 1

JACOB BLESSES EPHRAIM AND MANASSEH (48:1–20)

Verse 2



Verse 3

<b><i>3–4.</i></b> Jacob repeats God’s promise to the patriarchs of progeny and land. Both are in play here. Jacob’s insistence on being buried in Canaan foreshadows the permanent settlement in the Promised Land. His “adoption” of Joseph’s two sons points to progeny and family continuity.

Verse 4



Verse 5

<b><i>“your two sons…they are mine.”</i></b> Another grandparent (or substitute grandparent) who is considered to be like a parent is Naomi in Ruth 4:17, where the women declare of the son of Ruth and Boaz: “A son is born to Naomi.” In our verse, Jacob equates Ephraim and Manasseh with Reuben and Simeon, his own first- and second-born sons.
Jacob has lifted Ephraim and Manasseh from the genealogy of Joseph and placed them in his own genealogical list. He does so in memory, as it were, of Rachel, Joseph’s mother. This is a strong statement of family continuity—from Jacob to Joseph to Joseph’s sons, a male genealogy inspired by a woman. In later biblical tradition Rachel is the mother of the northern tribes, symbolized by the “Joseph” tribes. Thus we read: “A voice is heard in Ramah / <i>…</i> Rachel is weeping for her children, / refusing to be comforted” (Jeremiah 31:14); the passage concludes with a promise that her children will be restored (“your children shall return to their own borders,” v. 16).
If we view Genesis 48 as a late retrojection, reflecting the tribes that settled in Canaan, then this is an etiology for how Ephraim and Manasseh—who were not sons of Jacob like the rest of the tribes’ eponyms—came to be tribes. Jacob’s bestowal on Ephraim of the birthright reflects the later reality: Ephraim the tribe became the largest and most influential in the northern kingdom.

Verse 6

<b><i>“progeny…after them.”</i></b> No further progeny is known. If Joseph were to have subsequent sons, they would not form separate tribes bearing their names but would be included in the twelve tribes.

Verse 7

<b><i>“And I—.”</i></b> In thinking about his own death and burial, Jacob suddenly recalls the death and burial of his beloved wife.
<i><b>“Rachel died in the land of Canaan.”</b></i> Joseph’s mother was not buried in the ancestral cave of Machpelah. (On its purchase and Sarah’s burial there, see Genesis 23.) Her passing, first recounted in 35:16–20, is repeated here with the addition of this notice. This mention of Canaan re-emphasizes the idea of burial in Canaan that marked Jacob’s earlier instructions.
<i><b>“Ephrath, that is, Bethlehem.”</b></i> See Ruth 4:11, which mentions both Rachel and Leah as it links Ruth with Ephrathah, which is Bethlehem.

Verse 8

<b><i>8–20.</i></b> The bestowing of a blessing and a birthright, and bestowing it upon the “wrong” son, recalls Jacob’s bargain to obtain the birthright from Esau (Genesis 25:29–34), his deception to obtain the blessing from his father, and the compensatory blessing granted to Esau (Genesis 27). The blessing here reiterates the patriarchal promise and again—as in the preceding passage—emphasizes the continuity from Abraham through Joseph’s sons.
<b><i>8–10.</i></b> Jacob appears confused here, as if forgetting that he had just seen Joseph’s sons and spoken about them at length. Modern critical scholars smooth the rough edges of this narrative sequence by suggesting that verse 8 is the continuation of verse 2, and that verses 3-7 are an insertion from a different source, interpreting the original scene.

Verse 17



Verse 18



Verse 19

 Jacob refuses Joseph’s attempt to correct the order of precedence of the children. The same Jacob who supplanted his own older brother once again puts the younger before the older. The switching of places of Ephraim and Manasseh also invokes the common theme in Genesis of the younger sibling taking precedence over the older: Isaac over Ishmael (Genesis 21); Jacob over Esau (Genesis 27); Rachel over Leah (31:4); Tamar’s son Perez over Zerah (38:27–30). (The theme is also a popular one elsewhere in the Bible. But in the story of Leah and Rachel, Laban reverses the theme, using the priority of Leah to trick Jacob; 29:26.)

Verse 20



Verse 21

JACOB RESUMES HIS PREPARATIONS FOR DEATH (48:21–22)

Verse 22

<b><i>“Shechem mountain-ridge.”</i></b> Heb. <i>sh’chem echad</i>, a difficult phrase. Many commentators understand it to mean “one portion,” or the double portion assigned to the first-born (Deuteronomy 21:17). Others, including our translator, read it in terms of the walled town of Shechem, in the vicinity of which Jacob had once settled and even purchased land (Genesis 33:18–19). It is the locale where Jacob had sent Joseph when his brothers were pasturing flocks there (37:13), and where Joseph would eventually be buried (Joshua 24:32). According to the Bible’s allotment of Canaan by tribe, Shechem sits in the territory of Manasseh—one of Joseph’s sons—which would later become part of the northern kingdom of Israel. It is the same town where the story of Dinah takes place, and the name of the prince who lies with her (see at Genesis 34).
<i><b>“which I won…with my sword and my bow.”</b></i> This clause strengthens the argument that the previous phrase refers to a location. There is, however, no record of Jacob’s having fought to obtain land.
<i><b>“Amorites.”</b></i> Another name for the indigenous inhabitants of Canaan.

Chapter 49



Verse 1

<i>Jacob’s Deathbed Blessing</i> (49:1–27)
This is a laconic and therefore difficult poem; a number of verses remain poorly understood. In it, Jacob sets the future course of his sons—the eponyms of the tribes of Israel. It reflects a later time, after the tribes have settled in the land, but here its panoramic view is retrojected into a last will and testament of the patriarch. It has political overtones, putting some tribes in a more favorable light than others. Yet the overall effect—like so much in this parashah—is to foreshadow the fulfillment of the patriarchal promise: it depicts Israel settled in its land.
Such a testament is a well-known literary trope. A counterpart is found in Deuteronomy 33, in Moses’ farewell blessing of Israel, in which the tribes are blessed as if they are his own sons. Ancient post-biblical literature elaborated on this genre, composing testaments for the Twelve Patriarchs—the twelve sons of Jacob—as well as for other biblical figures like Moses, Solomon, and Job.
The sons are listed roughly by the mothers who bore them. Leah’s children appear first (Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah, Zebulun, Issachar) followed by Zilpah’s and Bilhah’s sons (Dan, Gad, Asher, Naphtali), and culminating in Rachel’s sons (Joseph, Benjamin). But the order does not follow exactly the birth order in the stories in Genesis 29, 30, and 35. Despite the adoption of Ephraim and Manasseh in the foregoing section, they are not mentioned in this poem.
In some cases, the blessing includes the tribal totem or symbol. For example, Judah is a lion; Zebulun is associated with ships; Dan is a serpent; Benjamin is a wolf. (Through the ages, these symbols have been used by various artists, such as Chagall in his famous Hadassah Hospital windows in Jerusalem.) The poem often invokes wordplay on the sons’ names.
Taken as a whole, this poem privileges Judah and Joseph—symbols of the later southern and northern Israelite kingdoms, respectively. It thereby looks beyond the tribal land allotments to the time of the divided monarchy, when the individual tribes had little significance, having been replaced by the two more centralized polities. Some scholars read the poem as promoting Judah over Joseph, implying an even later perspective when the northern kingdom had been destroyed and Judah alone was left (D. Carr, <i>Reading the Fractures of Genesis,</i> 1996, p. 250).

Verse 2



Verse 3



Verse 4

<b><i>“you mounted your father’s bed.”</i></b> An allusion to when Reuben slept with his father’s concubine (35:22). Such an act is taken elsewhere as a sign of wishing to supplant the father (II Samuel 16:20–22; I Kings 2:20–22). This verse might be an attempt to explain why Reuben, although the first-born of Jacob, was not to become a historically important tribe.

Verse 5

<b><i>5–7.</i></b> The allusion is to Genesis 34, the Dinah story, in which Simeon and Levi arrange for the massacre of the men of Shechem. Here, as in the earlier account, Jacob’s assessment differs from that of these two brothers.

Verse 6



Verse 7

<b><i>“I will disperse them in Jacob, / scatter them in Israel.”</i></b> They would not remain distinct tribes. Simeon was absorbed into the tribe of Judah; and Levi—the tribe from which the Levites and priests would come—did not have landholdings.

Verse 8



Verse 9

<b><i>9–10.</i></b> The blessings of Reuben, Simeon, and Levi disqualify those three oldest sons, leaving Judah to serve as the leading tribe—securing the birthright, as it were.
<i><b>“lion’s cub…lion…lioness.”</b></i> The “king of beasts” is an appropriate emblem for Judah, the tribe linked with the Davidic kingship—an eternal dynasty.

Verse 10

<b><i>“until he comes to Shiloh.”</i></b> This last part of the verse is obscure; it has been interpreted as having messianic meaning.

Verse 11

<b><i>11–12.</i></b> This blessing’s emphasis on wine suggests agricultural fertility, as well as luxury and festive banqueting. Future royalty is surely implied.

Verse 12



Verse 13

 This verse places the tribe of Zebulun on the northern coast of Israel.
<i><b>“Sidon.”</b></i> A Phoenician port-town (now part of Lebanon).

Verse 14

 Issachar is not portrayed positively; he is subjugated to those around him, probably the Canaanites.

Verse 15



Verse 16

<b><i>“Dan will plead.”</i></b> A wordplay on the name of Dan, linking it with the root <i>d-y-n,</i> “to judge.”

Verse 17

 This verse adds an apparently additional, unrelated portrait of Dan. It is not clear whether it is positive or negative.

Verse 18

 This verse breaks away from the main poem and has been explained as an interpolation from elsewhere (see Psalm 119:166). In its present location, it might be seen as an aside by Jacob, calling on God’s help.

Verse 19

 This verse features repeated wordplay on the name of Gad, built on the root letters <i>g-w-d.</i>

Verse 20



Verse 21



Verse 22

<b><i>“wild she-ass’s son.”</i></b> Or, “a fruitful bough.” Both interpretations have been offered for this difficult phrase. In either case, the image is one of vigor.

Verse 23

 The poetry now transmutes the animal or floral image of the preceding verse into a human archer-warrior who, although having been set upon by enemies, was able to remain steady. We have no inkling of the referent of this image; the Bible nowhere else mentions Joseph as a warrior or archer. It may refer to the later history of the northern kingdom, given that the “Joseph” tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh settled in the central part of the country and dominated it politically.

Verse 24

<b><i>24–26.</i></b> Jacob heaps the greatest blessing upon Joseph.
<b><i>“Mighty One of Jacob…Shepherd…Rock.”</i></b> The poetry invokes several ancient divine epithets.

Verse 25

<b><i>“Shaddai.”</i></b> One of God’s names, often associated with fertility.
<i><b>“heaven above…deep…below.”</b></i> The entire cosmos, from the heavens above to the primeval waters below, participates in the blessing.
<i><b>“blessings of breasts and womb.”</b></i> This unusual reference signals fertility.

Verse 26

<b><i>“my parents’ blessings.”</i></b> The blessing on Joseph, says Jacob, will surpass the blessing he received from his own parents; that is to say, the blessing of Joseph will surpass the promise to the patriarchs. Interestingly, Jacob does not use the Hebrew word <i>avot</i> (“ancestors”) but <i>horai</i>—here translated as “parents”—a term related to pregnancy.

Verse 27



Verse 28

<i>Jacob Imparts Instructions for His Burial</i> (49:28–33)
The narrative returns to the issue of Jacob’s instructions for his burial that has occupied so much of this parashah. Here, as opposed to 47:30, Jacob addresses all his sons—not Joseph alone—and he details the location of the burial place and the family members who have already been laid to rest in it. The deceased matriarchs figure as prominently as the patriarchs. Indeed, it was the death of Sarah that had necessitated acquiring this family plot. (Genesis 23:3–15 recounts the purchase of this site—the first land acquisition in the Promised Land, and the first step in the fulfillment of God’s promise to Abraham.) In death, as in life, the matriarchs are the cement that provides family continuity.
<b><i>All these are the twelve tribes of Israel.</i></b> This summation acknowledges that the poem refers not to Jacob’s sons themselves but to the future of the tribes. By putting the future of the tribes in the form of this testament, it suggests that what befell the tribes was fitting to the character of each; it was their destiny. The Bible often explains and justifies a current situation as if it had been predicted prophetically.

Verse 29

<b><i>29–32.</i></b> Jacob’s words are not meant simply to provide instructions on how to find the burial plot. By retelling the story of the site, Jacob appeals for family continuity—for the preservation of this burial tradition. (How often thoughts of family continuity and traditional practice come at the moment of death, when an important link in the chain is about to be lost!)
<b><i>“my people.”</i></b> See at 25:8.
<i><b>“ancestors.”</b></i> [Heb. <i>avot,</i> often translated as “fathers.” See at 25:8. —<i>Ed</i>.]

Verse 30



Verse 31



Verse 32



Verse 33

<b><i>he drew his feet into the bed.</i></b> This action complements that of 48:2, when Jacob “sat up in the bed.” His instructions are now complete; he can die in peace knowing that he has conveyed his wishes to his sons.

Chapter 50



Verse 1

<i>Jacob’s Funeral and Burial</i> (50:1–13)
The narrative spotlight now shifts from Jacob to Joseph. He takes the lead in mourning for Jacob and in making arrangements to carry out his father’s last wishes.
Some of the confusion in this unit—especially in reference to Joseph’s acting alone versus all the brothers—is explained by modern critical scholars as the result of the combination of different sources, Priestly and non-Priestly accounts.

Verse 2

<b><i>his servants the physicians.</i></b> Apparently Joseph had his own staff of physicians. Knowledge of anatomy is necessary for embalming, during which the internal organs are removed.
<i><b>to embalm his father.</b></i> An Egyptian practice that conforms to Egyptian religious thought about the afterworld. This is one of several features in the Joseph story that reflects its Egyptian setting. Except for Jacob and Joseph, no other Israelites in the Bible are embalmed. Later Jewish law forbade attempts to preserve a corpse (except in extreme circumstances), since normally Jews are to be buried quickly.

Verse 3

 The forty days of embalming were followed by thirty (or, per the present translation, seventy) days of public mourning: Jacob, because of his relation to Joseph, was treated as a quasi-royal figure.

Verse 4

<b><i>4–6.</i></b> Only after concluding the period of mourning does Joseph begin arrangements for the burial. Here Egyptian custom ends and Jacob’s instructions begin to be carried out. Yet the Egyptian setting of the story is still in evidence in Joseph’s carefully crafted words, seeking permission to bury his father in Canaan. Here—as often in the Bible—the narrative repeats a character’s speech with changes that adjust it to its changing audience. Three times the text relates Jacob’s burial instructions (47:29–30; 49:29–32; and here), and each time the wording is different, because both the purpose of the speech and the recipients of the information have changed. Joseph must obtain permission from Pharaoh, so he uses a strategy and language that will accomplish his goal.
<b><i>Pharaoh’s household.</i></b> Joseph does not approach Pharaoh directly but through his official court, whom he asks to convey his request to Pharaoh. (This seems strange, given Joseph’s high status as second only to Pharaoh.)

Verse 5

<b><i>“My father adjured me, saying…”</i></b> Joseph does not repeat the exact wording of the oath he swore to his father. He changes it so as to make it sound more positive: “bury me in Canaan” rather than “don’t bury me in Egypt.” It is not as if Jacob specifically rejected Egypt, but that he preferred Canaan. Joseph speaks here as a loyal Egyptian merely doing his filial duty.
<i><b>“‘acquired’”</b></i> Heb. <i>kariti,</i> literally “dug” or perhaps “prepared.” There is no prior notice that Jacob had prepared his grave in any way. This suggests that, as this translation reflects, it was the location that was important to Jacob himself—not the structure of the grave. (On the burial details, see Another View.) But Joseph has designed <i>his</i> words to appeal to a pharaoh. High-ranking Egyptians had elaborate tombs prepared for themselves many years before their death. Therefore, we should take the word <i>kariti</i> literally: Joseph is making it sound as if his father, too, followed Egyptian custom, but with an Israelite twist—burial in the ground rather than in a pyramid. Pharaoh could predictably relate to this request of Joseph’s, to honor his father by burying him in the “tomb” specially prepared for him.
<i><b>“then I will come back.”</b></i> Joseph’s loyalty is again evident in these words. After the burial Joseph will resume his place in Egypt. Indeed, he and his brothers do return (v. 14), for although the funeral procession foreshadows the Exodus, it is, as it were, only a rehearsal for it (see below on vv. 8, 10).

Verse 6



Verse 7

<b><i>7–9.</i></b> Like the period of mourning, the funeral and burial involve a large entourage, including Egyptians. This is a state funeral. In fact, the Canaanites perceive it as “a solemn mourning for Egypt” (v. 11).

Verse 8

<b><i>They left in Goshen only their little ones, their flocks, and their cattle.</i></b> While this is not yet the Exodus, the language foreshadows the struggle to take the children and livestock in Exodus 10:9–11, 24. As for women, it seems likely that most remained with the children, while at least a few of them featured in the funeral and burial ceremonies (see at v. 10, “lamentation”).

Verse 9



Verse 10

<b><i>Goren ha-Atad.</i></b> A place name not otherwise known.
<i><b>on the other side of the Jordan.</b></i> The route through Transjordan is not a direct route from Egypt to the cave of Machpelah. This route foreshadows that of the Israelite exodus, which also wound its way through Transjordan.
<i><b>they.</b></i> Presumably referring to the brothers and the Egyptians, or perhaps only the Egyptians.
<i><b>lamentation.</b></i> A specialty of women; the public voice of mourning in the ancient Near East was both female and male (see <i>Chayei Sarah,</i> Contemporary Reflection, and at Leviticus 10:6).
<i><b>mourning ceremony.</b></i> The translation “ceremony” suggests that the mourning period observed by Joseph included still more lamentation. Alternatively, Joseph observed “a seven-day period of mourning” of an unspecified type.
<i><b>seven days.</b></i> A mourning period of seven days is known from the Mesopotamian epic of Gilgamesh, and in the Bible also from the mourning for Saul (I Samuel 31:13) and from Job’s friends (Job 2:13). It became shivah, the traditional period for Jewish mourning that begins after the burial. Here, however, Jacob has not yet been buried (see v. 13). Alternatively, this verse reflects an alternate tradition which has Jacob buried at Goren ha-Atad, followed by the period of mourning. See also at vv. 12–13.

Verse 11

<b><i>Abel.</i></b> Which means “brook, watercourse” or “pasture, meadow, well-watered land.” (Place names beginning with “Abel” are found in sites in Canaan dating from the transition between the Late Bronze and early Iron Ages. These sites originated among non-urban populations.) It is here given the false etymology of “mourning,” deriving from this incident.
<i><b>Abel Mizraim.</b></i> This particular place name has been identified with several sites.

Verse 12

<b><i>12–13.</i></b> These verses give the impression that after the public mourning at Abel Mizraim, Jacob’s family continued on to the cave of Machpelah for a private burial. Yet verse 14 mentions “all who had gone with him,” as though the whole entourage was present at the burial. The present verses are, then, better understood as a conclusion, a frame bringing closure to Jacob’s initial command, which has now been carried out as he wished. (See also at v. 10, “seven days.”)     

Verse 13



Verse 14

<i>Joseph and His Brothers Return to Egypt</i> (50:14–26)
As he had promised Pharaoh (v. 5), Joseph—along with his brothers—returns to Egypt after the burial. The action of the Joseph story concludes as it began, with a confrontation between Joseph and his brothers.
BROTHERLY RECONCILIATION (50:14–21)
Just as at the beginning of the story the brothers plotted against Joseph and fabricate a speech (Genesis 37), so they do at the end, although much more benignly. Worried now that after Jacob’s death, Joseph will take revenge on them for all the trouble they caused him, they introduce a hitherto unacknowledged deathbed speech of Jacob. The brothers claim that Jacob told them to tell Joseph that he should forgive his brothers.
The brothers’ claim is implausible; why did Jacob not tell this directly to Joseph? It is better to conclude that Jacob never said this and that the brothers made it up. (Compare Bathsheba’s making up a speech that her husband, King David, was supposed to have said, designating Solomon as heir; I Kings 1.) The language is overly formal, and one can imagine how stiffly and nervously the words were delivered.
But this lie is in essence true. The brothers have repented—and Joseph knows it. He cries when they say this. He will not hold their past actions against them.

Verse 15



Verse 16

<b><i>“Your father.”</i></b> Not <i>“our</i> father”—to play on the special bond between Joseph and Jacob.

Verse 17

<b><i>“servants of your father’s God.”</i></b> The brothers refer to themselves via a phrase of humility and piety.
<b><i>17–18.</i></b> Joseph’s weeping and the brothers’ prostrating themselves and calling themselves “your slaves” is a replay of the earlier meetings between Joseph and his brothers (especially 45:1–5). But this time, at last, the relationship is wholly repaired: The brothers are fully reunited, not only physically, but also emotionally and psychologically. The next step, taken at the beginning of Exodus, is for this family to become a people.

Verse 18



Verse 19



Verse 20



Verse 21



Verse 22

JOSEPH’S LAST DAYS (50:22–26)
<b><i>110 years.</i></b> This is the ideal life span in Egyptian culture; the Bible’s ideal is 120 years (6:3).

Verse 23

<b><i>Ephraim's grandchildren.</i></b> In the Bible, to live to see one’s grandchildren is one of the signs of blessing, along with living to a ripe old age (Psalm 128:6). Joseph is even more fortunate: he sees his great-grandchildren.
<i><b>Machir.</b></i> The eponym of the most important clan in the tribe of Manasseh. (In a genealogy elsewhere in the Bible, his wife or sister is named as Maacah; I Chronicles 7:15–16.)
<i><b>born on Joseph’s knees.</b></i> Joseph may have adopted Machir—as Jacob had adopted Ephraim and Manasseh (48:5–6, 12); alternatively, this is a figurative idiom for family continuity.

Verse 24

<b><i>24–26.</i></b> Joseph, too, like Jacob (49:1–28), makes a deathbed prophecy and extracts a promise from his survivors to bury him in Canaan.
<b><i>“take care.”</i></b> Heb. <i>p-k-d</i>, literally “take notice.” Moses will use the same verb and construction when he introduces the idea of the Exodus to the Israelites (“taken note,” Exodus 3:16). The same verb appeared earlier in Genesis when God fulfilled a promise to Sarah: she became pregnant with Isaac (“remembered,” 21:1).

Exodus



Chapter 1



Verse 1

<i>Israel Proliferates in Egypt</i> (1:1–22)
Fearful that the Israelites are “too numerous,” the new ruler of Egypt tries several increasingly severe measures to reduce the population; yet his efforts produce the opposite effect.
TRANSITION FROM GENESIS: ISRAELITE FERTILITY (1:1–7)
The names of the sons of Israel were listed in Genesis 46, so their repetition here provides a flashback to the descent into Egypt, which in turn becomes the preface to the exodus from Egypt. Exodus 1:6–7 also functions as an epilogue to the Joseph story. These verses introduce, or re-introduce (see Genesis 47:27), the theme of fertility, which dominates the first two units (Exodus 1:1–2:22).
<b><i>These are the names.</i></b> The identical expression in Genesis 46:8 introduces a list that includes Dinah, Leah, Serah, Zilpah, Rachel, Asenath, and Bilhah (46:15–25). [The list in Genesis also mentioned dozens of men who are not named here, which indicates that the men whose names <i>are</i> repeated here have been given a new role: each of them now represents a whole “house” (clan or tribe) of people—both women and men. —<i>Ed.</i>] Although these women do not appear here, named and unnamed women soon take on a central role in the narrative.

Verse 2



Verse 3



Verse 4



Verse 5



Verse 6



Verse 7

<b><i>fertile and prolific…multiplied…the land was filled.</i></b> Heb. <i>paru vayishr’tzu vayirbu…vatimalei ha-aretz,</i> which recalls the proliferation of life at the creation of the universe (Genesis 1:28) and also after the flood (9:1, 7)—particularly the teeming, swarming water creatures and the command to humans to “be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth” (1:28).

Verse 8

PHARAOH’S RESPONSE: OPPRESSION AND KILLING OF THE BABY BOYS (1:8–16)
<b><i>a new king arose over Egypt who did not know Joseph.</i></b> This notice indicates more than just the passage of time. Whereas in Joseph’s time the pharaoh welcomed the family of Israel, now they face persecution by this new, unnamed king.

Verse 9

<b><i>“Israelite people.”</i></b> Heb. <i>am b’nei yisrael</i>, which points to a significant transition. What in Joseph’s time constituted “the <i>children</i> of Israel,” that is, an extended family or clan, has now become a people. The shift in language marks a new era in Israel’s history.
(Outside the Bible, the first extant mention of Israel as a people occurs in the Merneptah stele, a monument celebrating an Egyptian victory over various peoples in Canaan, including Israel. The pharaoh Merneptah, successor to Rameses II, ruled Egypt from 1213–1203 <small>B.C.E.</small>)
<i><b>“much too numerous for us”</b></i> Ironically, the king feels threatened by a people who remains a small minority.

Verse 10



Verse 11

<b><i>forced labor.</i></b> The Israelites were not forced into domestic slavery. Instead, they were conscripted for corvée labor, which entailed mandatory unpaid labor on large public projects.
<i><b>garrison cities.</b></i> These were not pyramids (royal tombs), a popular misconception.

Verse 12



Verse 13



Verse 14

<b><i>harsh labor at mortar and bricks.</i></b> In the ancient Near East, certain types of forced labor, such as building projects, were typically reserved for men. Brickmaking was understood to be men’s work, even as voluntary labor. See also the next comment.
<i><b>made them perform…tasks in the field.</b></i> The biblical text speaks vaguely of “them”; thus it does not clearly indicate whether Israelite women were forced into working as slaves along with Israelite men. Women’s participation may have been understood since historically in ancient Egypt, both women and men performed field work in state fields; and in ancient Israel, too, both genders regularly engaged in farm labor (see Ruth 2:8–9). More likely, it went without saying that the Egyptians drafted only Israelite men for the physical corvée labor.

Verse 15

<b><i>Hebrew midwives.</i></b> It is unclear from the wording of the Hebrew whether they are Hebrew women who work as midwives, or Egyptian midwives who serve the Hebrews. If the latter, the midwives are righteous gentiles who fear God (1:17).
<i><b>Shiphrah and…Puah.</b></i> The midwives’ names are Semitic rather than Egyptian in origin. The name Shiphrah comes from the root meaning “to be beautiful” and has been found also in a pre-biblical Egyptian document listing Asiatic slaves. The name Puah is attested in Ugaritic (Canaanite) literature and can be traced to a word for a fragrant blossom that came to mean “young girl.” Commentators question how two midwives could have served the entire burgeoning Israelite population. It has been suggested that this account only includes the names of the two midwives who disobeyed Pharaoh. Alternatively, it is possible that the narrator is here mentioning the names of the overseers of two guilds of midwives—or the names of the guilds themselves. Either way, it is significant that while the pharaoh’s name is not mentioned, the names of these two women are preserved.
<i><b>“if it is a boy, kill him.”</b></i> The reason is apparently so they could not become soldiers in an opposing army, which is what worries Pharaoh (see v. 10).

Verse 16

<b><i>“birthstool.”</i></b> Literally, “two stones,” referring to a pair of stones that women used for support as they squatted or kneeled during childbirth. (Not surprisingly, a kneeling woman was the Egyptian hieroglyphic sign for childbirth.) This practice allowed for an easier delivery than the contemporary practice of lying down, and gave access to the midwife; she sat facing a kneeling woman in labor, or behind a squatting woman. After the delivery, the midwife would cut the umbilical cord, bathe the baby, rub the child with salt, and wrap it in strips of cloth (see Ezekiel 16:4).

Verse 17

MIDWIVES’ RESPONSE: OPPOSITION TO PHARAOH (1:17–22) Twice it is mentioned that the midwives are God-fearing (vv. 17, 21), which undoubtedly gives them the courage to countermand a direct order from Pharaoh by letting the Hebrew boys live. They cleverly make up the excuse that the Hebrew women delivered their children before the midwives could arrive. (See also, Another View.)

Verse 18



Verse 19

<b><i>“vigorous.”</i></b> Heb. <i>chayot,</i> which also conveys the sense that the women are like wild animals (<i>chayot)</i> in that they gave birth naturally, without the assistance of a midwife. The midwives’ resistance goes beyond non-cooperation to a direct defiance of Pharaoh through lies. On subterfuge as recourse for both women and men who face abuses of authority, see p. 142.

Verse 20



Verse 21

 [<i><b>God</b></i>] <i><b>established households for the midwives.</b></i> The midwives are rewarded for their role in helping to increase the Israelite population by having progeny of their own. [Perhaps this notice means to suggest that a lineage was named after each midwife; elsewhere in the Bible, the word <i>batim</i> (“households”) refers not merely to having progeny but to heading a lineage (see Ruth 4:11–12). Some scholars speculate that the biblical text mentions Shiphrah and Puah by name because those were lineage names known to the text’s ancient audience (<i>The Torah: A Modern Commentary</i>, 2005, p. 347). In biblical genealogies, many of the names refer to a town or clan known also from later in Israelite history; occasionally—albeit rarely—the genealogies do mention women’s names in this capacity. —<i>Ed.</i>]

Verse 22

<b><i>“throw.”</i></b> Heb. <i>tashlichu,</i> which with regard to a child does not mean “to hurl” but “to abandon” (see Genesis 21:15; Ezekiel 16:5). The predictable—but not immediate—result would be the baby boy’s death.
<i><b>“into the Nile.”</b></i> Much as in ancient Greece, where unwanted female babies were left on hillsides, here the males are to be floated in baskets on the water—where they would die out of the sight of their parents, either by sinking into the water or from exposure. | Ironically, Moses will be saved, not killed, by the Nile. Later, a pharaoh will himself be killed with his troops by water in the Sea of Reeds as they pursue the Israelites (14:28).

Heroes in ancient traditions often have auspicious births. The Bible’s typical special birth story involves a child born to a barren mother (Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, Samson, Samuel). However, given the emphasis on fertility in the Exodus account, a barren woman motif would be jarring, if not dissonant, so an alternate special birth theme was chosen: the young hero’s abandonment and narrow escape from death. Similar stories were told about Sargon of Akkad (a king who established an empire in southern Mesopotamia) and Romulus and Remus (the founders of Rome). In both the Legend of Sargon and the Moses story, the child is born in secret, abandoned by his natural parents, set in a reed basket, and pulled out of the water by a rescuer. A distinctive feature of Exodus 2 is that the rescuers of the future hero are women.
MOSES’ BIRTH: WOMEN RESCUE AND NURTURE MOSES (2:1–10)
Moses’ mother manages to keep his birth a secret for three months, until she is no longer able to hide his existence. She then puts the baby in a basket on the Nile where he is rescued by Pharaoh’s daughter and aided by his sister. The collaboration of these three women ensures that Moses will survive.
<b><i>A certain member of the house of Levi…married a woman of Levi.</i></b> Moses’ parents remain anonymous in this story. (In 6:20, they are identified as Amram and Jochebed.) His father plays no further role; his mother and sister (see v. 4) take the initiative and do what is needed to protect Moses.

Verse 2

<b><i>bore.</i></b> See at Genesis 29:32.

Verse 3

<b><i>wicker.</i></b> That is, made from reeds growing along the Nile.
<i><b>basket.</b></i> Heb. <i>teivah,</i> the same word for Noah’s ark (Genesis 6–9), another container designed to save special people from the water.
<i><b>caulked it with bitumen and pitch.</b></i> To make it watertight. Moses’ mother thus takes special precautions to ensure the life of her son.

Verse 4

<b><i>his sister.</i></b> This is Miriam, although she is not referred to by name until 15:20, where she is called a prophet. | Although women were generally not included in genealogical lists, Miriam’s name appears in the list of Amram’s three children in I Chronicles 5:29. Micah 6:4 mentions her along with Moses and Aaron as having played an equal role in saving Israel. (See also at Numbers 20:1.)
<i><b>stationed herself.</b></i> Here—and when she approaches Pharaoh’s daughter in v. 7—the unnamed sister takes initiative. There is no indication that her mother or father sent her to watch over the baby. Thus this scene highlights Miriam’s audacity and ingenuity.

Verse 5



Verse 6

<b><i>“Hebrew child.”</i></b> It is significant that Pharaoh’s daughter realizes that the baby is a Hebrew, because she probably knows about her father’s injunction. If so, her rescue of the child constitutes another case in which a woman bravely defies Pharaoh’s decree. (See also 1:17–22.)

Verse 7

<b><i>“Shall I go and get you a Hebrew nurse…?”</i></b> Whereas Moses hesitates later before addressing Pharaoh, his sister displays no reluctance as she now approaches Pharaoh’s daughter and enacts a clever plan to reunite Moses with his mother.

Verse 8



Verse 9

<b><i>“nurse it for me, and I will pay your wages.”</i></b> Wet-nurse agreements like this one are attested in ancient Near Eastern documents, corroborating that a wet nurse might act as guardian for the infant during the first few years of its life. Here, the baby’s mother is to be paid for nursing her own child. [In the ancient Near East, adoptive mothers often relied on wet nurses, as did birth mothers—particularly among the urban elite, and not only due to lack of milk or loss of the birth mother. See the mention of Rebekah’s wet nurse in Genesis 24:59 and 35:8 and comments there. Similarly, one Mesopotamian document mentions that a woman had contracted to give her daughter to a team of two other women for wet-nursing; those nurses “received food and clothing for three years” plus a monetary payment (Mayer Gruber, “Breast-Feeding Practices…,” 1989, pp. 74–82). —<i>Ed.</i>]

Verse 10

<b><i>When the child grew up.</i></b> Extant documents suggest that in Egypt, as elsewhere in the ancient Near East, mothers usually weaned their children at around the age of three. [As long ago as the 18th century <small>B.C.E.</small>, Mesopotamian contracts and other documents—including even lawsuits—mention a three-year period for wet-nursing (see previous note). —<i>Ed.</i>] <i><b>She named him Moses.</b></i> The narrator gives a Hebrew etiology for Moses’ name, but the name is actually Egyptian, meaning “gave birth.”

Verse 11

MOSES’ FLIGHT TO MIDIAN (2:11–15) The young Moses is raised as a prince in the Egyptian court, yet upon his maturity he immediately identifies with his kin, an enslaved people. His first act is murder in defense of his kinsman, which prompts him to flee from Egypt; but after escaping, he almost immediately rescues seven Midianite shepherdesses. The narrative characterizes Moses here as heroic; although later known to be humble and modest, he shows leadership qualities from the start.
<b><i>kinsfolk.</i></b> Heb. <i>achim,</i> literally “brothers.” Although raised in Pharaoh’s palace, Moses considers the Israelite his “brother” and thus acts to defend him.

Verse 12



Verse 13



Verse 14



Verse 15

<b><i>Midian.</i></b> A region south of the Negev, which is beyond Egyptian jurisdiction.
<i><b>sat down beside a well.</b></i> That is, a central gathering place.

Verse 16

MOSES’ RESCUE OF REUEL’S DAUGHTERS AND MARRIAGE TO ZIPPORAH (2:16–22) Meeting a future wife at a well is a narrative motif that recurs in betrothal type scenes in the Bible (see Genesis 24:10–27; 29:2–14). One difference about this scene is that here the man defends the women and waters their flocks, thus giving prominence to the hero, Moses.
<b><i>seven daughters.</i></b> [With the five women mentioned earlier, this makes twelve women in Exodus 1–2, a parallel to the twelve tribes. —<i>Ed.</i>] <i><b>They…filled the troughs to water their father’s flock.</b></i> Although the seven sisters are not called “shepherds” (as was Rachel in Genesis 29:9), they are clearly acting in that capacity. In the ancient Near East, both females and males took care of the flocks.

Verse 21

<b><i>Zipporah.</i></b> Her name means “bird.” We are not told why she was selected from the seven daughters to marry Moses.

Verse 22



Verse 23

<i>Moses’ Mission Commences</i> (2:23–6:1)
The death of the pharaoh who had presumably sought to bring Moses to justice now paves the way for Moses’ return to Egypt—but it does not end the oppression of the Israelites. Moses reluctantly accepts that he has been chosen by God to deliver them from bondage.
SETTING THE STAGE: GOD TAKES NOTE OF ISRAEL’S SUFFERING (2:23–25)
The covenant with the ancestors includes the promise of land; however, as predicted in Genesis 15:13–16, this promise would not be fulfilled until the Israelites endured enslavement and affliction. This report of God’s resolve to respond to the Israelites’ suffering signals the first step in their deliverance.

Chapter 3



Verse 1

THE BURNING BUSH: GOD COMMISSIONS MOSES (3:1–10)
Moses is first introduced to God through a modest vision of a burning bush—an object just odd enough to catch his attention. At first only curious about this unnatural phenomenon, he only gradually becomes aware that he stands before the divine presence.
<b><i>his father-in-law Jethro.</i></b> He was called Reuel in 2:18.
<i><b>Horeb.</b></i> Another name for Sinai (see at 18:5).

Verse 11

MOSES RESISTS ACCEPTING GOD’S MISSION (3:11–4:17) Like some later biblical prophets, Moses is reluctant to accept his prophetic commission, partially out of modesty and partially out of fear of how he will be received and whether he will be successful. Moses raises four objections (3:11, 13; 4:1, 10), each of which God addresses.
<b><i>“Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh…?”</i></b> When Moses first objects to his prophetic calling, he expresses humility and lack of self-confidence. In response, God assures Moses that God will be with him (v. 12).

Verse 12



Verse 13

<b><i>“what shall I say to them?”</i></b> Moses’ second objection concerns what proof to offer to the Israelites that God really sent him. The proof will be the knowledge of God’s name (vv. 14–15), which is connected to the God of the ancestors, a deity already known to the Israelites. In the course of reassuring Moses, God foreshadows the events that will unfold: the people will be freed; they will return to the place where Moses stands now; Pharaoh will only let the Israelites go after God has smitten Egypt; and the Israelites will not leave Egypt empty-handed (vv. 16–22).

Verse 14

<b><i>“Ehyeh-Asher-Ehyeh.”</i></b> God seems to proclaim this enigmatic phrase as a name, although it appears nowhere else in the Bible. Its first and third words derive from the Hebrew root <i>h-y-h</i> (“to be”). Thus, this divine name suggests pure existence, being—a presence that cannot be seen or touched but which is most certainly there. Left in transliteration here, the expression sometimes has been translated as “I Am That/Who I Am” or “I Will Be What I Will Be.” The present verse may be explaining God’s permanent name (see next comment) in terms of this one, as an instructive “folk” etymology—in much the same way that the Bible often portrays mothers as explaining via wordplay the name that she has given her child.

Verse 15

<b><i>“יהוה, the God of your ancestors.”</i></b> God here proposes to be identified by an additional name, the more familiar יהוה (Y-H-V-H, <i>yud-hei-vav-hei</i>). Known in English as the tetragrammaton (from the Greek for “the four consonants”), Jews came to consider the pronunciation of this personal divine name so sacred that it was avoided and has been lost over time. In Jewish tradition, the convention developed in speech to substitute יהוה with <i>Adonai</i> (the Hebrew word meaning “my Lord”) or <i>Hashem</i> (“the name”), an even more indirect substitution. In 1783, Moses Mendelssohn proposed the translation “the Eternal,” which has since become popular in certain Bible translations and religious circles. Meanwhile, modern academic scholars have widely accepted a reconstruction as “Yahweh,” although there is only circumstantial evidence in its favor; many Jews avoid it. Whereas the word “Lord” invokes a masculine image, the divine name revealed in this verse is free of gendered associations (see at Genesis 2:4).

Verse 20



Verse 21

<b><i>“I will dispose the Egyptians favorably toward this people.”</i></b> That is, the Egyptians will willingly provide objects of value.

Verse 22

<b><i>“Each woman.”</i></b> In these instructions, the women are the ones involved in the transfer of goods; but in 12:35–36, where the event takes place, women are not specifically mentioned. (Compare also 11:2, 3.)
<i><b>“borrow.”</b></i> See at 11:2.
<i><b>“neighbor…lodger.”</b></i> The Hebrew nouns are feminine, which may imply that Egyptian and Israelite women were on good terms, despite the subjugation of the Israelites. The wording of this verse suggests that both peoples lived in close proximity, not in segregated areas as depicted in the Joseph story (Genesis 46:34). Confirmation of this integration can be found later, in the need for the Israelites to mark their doorposts with blood so that their first-born sons will not be killed with those of the Egyptians (12:13; see also at 11:2).
<i><b>“lodger in her house.”</b></i> This phrase is puzzling. Did Israelites have Egyptian servants in their homes? Some commentators suggest that the Israelites had Egyptian slave-women like Hagar (Genesis 16:1) who served as legally recognized concubines and could bear their master legitimate children.
<i><b>“silver and gold, and clothing.”</b></i> That is, objects of value, in fulfillment of God’s promise to Abraham that after four hundred years of servitude in a foreign land, God would bring judgment upon the nation they are serving and Israel “shall go out with many possessions” (Genesis 15:13–14).
<i><b>“on your sons and daughters.”</b></i> Evidence from the ancient Near East suggests that men as well as women wore jewelry. Later, women and men will contribute to the Tabernacle their gold and silver jewelry and expensive textiles (35:21–29), presumably goods obtained from the Egyptians.
<i><b>“thus stripping the Egyptians.”</b></i> Many commentators have been troubled by the implication that the Israelites would plunder the Egyptians. Commentators justify the taking of these valuable objects either as just payment for the years of slave labor, or as voluntary gifts from Egyptians who were eager to get rid of the Israelites.

Chapter 4



Verse 1

<b><i>“What if they do not believe me?”</i></b> Moses’ third objection expresses his concern that the Israelites will not believe him. At this point, Moses receives a set of more concrete signs to prove God’s power: the rod that becomes a snake, the leprous hand, and the water that turns to blood.

Again, God assures Moses about the source of prophetic power, though God also becomes annoyed with Moses’ excuses and appoints Aaron as the official spokesperson (4:11–17).

Verse 21



Verse 22

<b><i>22–23.</i></b> If Pharaoh refuses to free God’s first-born, Israel, then Pharaoh’s first-born will suffer the consequences. Moses is never recorded as repeating these words to Pharaoh. Yet they set the tone for the long confrontation that will shortly ensue.

Verse 23



Verse 24

INTERLUDE: ZIPPORAH RESCUES THE “BRIDEGROOM OF BLOOD” (4:24–26) Moses’ mission begins with an enigmatic episode. Perhaps an old, no-longer-understood story was placed here because of the connection between the slaying of the first-born mentioned in the preceding verse and the blood of circumcision of Zipporah’s son. Later blood will mark the Israelite homes, where the first-born will be spared (12:21–23). In both cases, blood is an apotropaic—warding off death.
<b><i>sought to kill him.</i></b> It is unclear who the intended victim is: Moses—or his and Zipporah’s son, Gershom (2:22). Aside from God, the only name mentioned in this episode is Zipporah’s.

Verse 25

<b><i>So Zipporah took a flint and cut off her son’s foreskin.</i></b> This is the only place in the Bible that explicitly mentions a woman’s performing the rite of circumcision. | Why was Gershom not circumcised before now? Commentators surmise that Zipporah’s father might have prevented Gershom’s circumcision, or Moses might have postponed it in anticipation of their difficult journey back to Egypt.

Verse 26

<b><i>“bridegroom of blood.”</i></b> This baffling phrase may reflect an ancient custom (long since abandoned) of circumcision at the time of marriage.

Verse 27

MOSES AND AARON CONVINCE THE ISRAELITES OF GOD’S PLAN (4:27–31) As Aaron becomes Moses’ assistant and spokesman, the two brothers must convince the Israelites of God’s intentions before they can convince Pharaoh.

Chapter 5



Verse 1

MOSES AND AARON FAIL TO CONVINCE PHARAOH: OPPRESSION WORSENS (5:1–6:1) The story returns to the reality of the Israelite suffering, which only gets worse after Moses and Aaron’s initial meeting with Pharaoh. Pharaoh’s pronouncement that the Israelite men must henceforth gather their own straw and still meet their quotas of bricks is reminiscent of the earlier pharaoh’s decrees regarding “birth control” (1:16, 22); but here the pronouncement is also calculated to undermine the Israelites’ acceptance of Moses and Aaron. The scene is now set, physically and psychologically, for a contest between the might of Pharaoh and the might of God.
<b><i>1–2.</i></b> Moses announces to Pharaoh the name of the God of Israel, whom Moses represents, but Pharaoh claims not to know this deity and therefore has no intention of heeding God’s words. This is the main issue in the account that will follow of the signs and wonders: how and when will Pharaoh come to know God and understand that God’s power trumps all other divine powers?
<b><i>“Let My people go that they may celebrate a festival for Me.”</i></b> In God’s name, Moses will repeatedly request to bring the people to the wilderness for a worship festival; he does not go so far as to ask to leave Egypt permanently.

Verse 2



Verse 3



Verse 4



Verse 5



Verse 6

<b><i>taskmasters and overseers.</i></b> The “taskmasters” are Egyptians; the “overseers” are Israelite leaders of work-gangs who are supervised by the taskmasters (see v.14).

Verse 7



Verse 8

 Pharaoh claims repeatedly that the request for a three-day festival is an excuse to slack off from work (see also v.17).

Verse 9

<b><i>“laborers.”</i></b> Heb <i>anashim</i>, a plural noun that can apply to women in some contexts; but in the present context of brickmaking—considered to be men’s work—it would go without saying that Pharaoh is placing an increased burden on the men in particular; see at 1:14. That Pharaoh would now single out males for harsh treatment is predictable, given that it is men (namely, Moses and Aaron, and presumably the elders for whom they are speaking) who openly challenge his authority. Furthermore, Pharaoh has been trying to get rid of the males all along (1:16, 22).
<i><b>“deceitful promises.”</b></i> Does Pharaoh refer here to the promise of a three-day festival vacation, or of liberation? Either way, he is trying to undermine Moses’ credibility. Perhaps Pharaoh already senses that the request for a festival is a ruse.

Verse 10



Verse 11



Verse 12

Chapter 6



Verse 1

 Foreshadowing what is to come in the following three Torah portions, God assures Moses that Pharaoh will soon see God’s might.
<i>—Adele Berlin</i>   

Verse 2

<i>Prophetic Commission and Mission</i>
COVENANT AND CONTINUITY (6:2–7:7)
Moses and Aaron’s first appearance before Pharaoh (5:1–5) resulted only in harsher work conditions for the Israelites (5:6–19). The prior parashah ended with the Israelite overseers’ condemnation of Moses and Aaron, and with Moses wondering why God had dispatched him. In response, God now reiterates the terms of the covenant and reassures Moses that he is God’s chosen representative.
REVELATION OF GOD’S NAME AND REAFFIRMATION OF THE COVENANT (6:2–9)
The name revealed to Moses is offered as proof of God’s manifest presence. Moses initially asked for such evidence in order to assure the people that the Deity known to their ancestors had recognized their suffering (3:13). However, the desire to know God’s name also can be seen as a gesture toward establishing a relationship. As the first piece of information we often give others about ourselves, a name enables interaction and serves as a substitute when we are not physically present, thus allowing for invocation and an extension of immanence.
<b><i>“I am יהוה.”</i></b> The name revealed by God, with all its iconic power, is something of an enigma. On the history both of the pronunciation of this name and of its treatment in translations, see at 3:15.

Verse 3

<b><i>“El Shaddai.”</i></b> This complex title shares a root with the Akkadian word for mountain <i>(shadu)</i> and intersects with the Hebrew root <i>sh-d-d,</i> “to be powerful.” Since <i>shad</i> also means “breast” in biblical Hebrew, some scholars have suggested that this divine name expresses the fertile, life-giving aspect of God. There is some evidence for this connotation in the book of Ruth, where Naomi invokes a shortened version of this name, Shaddai, when she refers to the Deity who claimed the lives of her husband and sons (Ruth 1:20–21; see also Genesis 17:1; 35:11). As the plot reveals, God also restores Naomi’s fertility by providing her with an heir whom she is said to nurse (Ruth 4:16).
Historically speaking, El was the name of the chief god of the early Canaanite pantheon, and the Israelite forebears—who were largely Canaanite—would have worshipped El. Other divine names with El preserved in the ancestral stories include El Elyon (in our translation, “God Most High”; Genesis 14:18–22), El Ro’i (16:13), El-Elohei-Yisrael (33:20), and El Beth El (“El of Beth El,” 35:7).
<b><i>“but I did not make Myself known to them by My name</i> יהוה.<i>”</i></b> The book of Genesis does in fact portray the ancestors as using this divine personal name (as in 14:22, 15:2, 16:5), yet here God claims that the name יהוה was unknown to them.

Verse 4



Verse 5



Verse 6



Verse 7

<b><i>“I will take you to be My people, and I will be your God.”</i></b> The covenantal language used in this verse indicates that God and Israel are entering into a binding relationship. This contractual, formulaic language also reflects the way marriage is spoken of in the Bible: God “takes” Israel the way that a man “takes” a wife. (On marriage in the Bible, see <i>Chayei Sarah,</i> Another View.) There is a reciprocal devotion in this relationship: as God takes Israel, God becomes Israel’s sole deity.

Verse 8



Verse 9

<b><i>they would not listen to Moses.</i></b> The Israelites responded positively to their first encounter with Moses and Aaron, convinced that God had taken note of their plight (4:29–31). But since the first confrontation between Moses and Pharaoh resulted in more oppressive labor demands (5:6–23), the people’s exhaustion and despondence prevent them from believing in the promise of redemption.

Verse 10

PROPHETIC DOUBTS (6:10–13) Moses has a herculean task on his hands. His own people reject him, and his request of Pharaoh is rebuffed. In this scene, Moses appears as the hesitant actor pushed onto the stage of history under God’s reassuring direction.

Verse 11



Verse 12

<b><i>“who gets tongue-tied.”</i></b> In response to his being sent again to speak before Pharaoh, Moses claims to be literally “uncircumcised of lips” (the same protest he will raise in v. 30). His words echo the assertion at the burning bush that he is, literally “heavy of mouth and heavy of tongue” (4:10). While some commentators conclude that Moses claims to have some sort of speech impediment, others interpret these expressions to mean that Moses feels he is unworthy of transmitting the divine word.

Verse 13

<b><i>both Moses and Aaron.</i></b> In response to Moses’ hesitation, God includes his brother Aaron—but not his sister Miriam—in the revelation. The Torah first mentioned Miriam (but not by name) at 2:4; see the comment there. Although she does not join her brothers during any of the revelatory moments in the Exodus narrative, she is referred to as a “prophet” (15:20), a title only metaphorically associated with Aaron (7:1). God speaks directly to all three siblings in Numbers 12:4–6.

Verse 14

GENEALOGY LISTING FOUR WIVES (6:14–25) The challenge presented by the Torah’s genealogies for the female reader is the frequent omission of women’s names. This genealogy stands out because it mentions four women. Carol Meyers claims that including Aaron’s mother, wife, and daughter-in-law in this passage draws attention to Aaron and contributes to an aristocratic claim for the Aaronide priesthood (<i>Exodus</i>, 2005, p. 69).

Verse 15

<b><i>son of a Canaanite woman.</i></b> This unnamed mother gives birth to Saul, a Canaanite-Israelite half-breed who bears the same name as the future king of Israel; see at Genesis 46:10. Individuals of mixed origins trouble the juxtaposition of Israel and the other nations since they fall between ethnic categories. Nonetheless, it appears that some offspring of Israelite fathers and non-Israelite women assume positions of stature, as in the cases of Perez (son of Judah and Tamar; see Genesis 38; Ruth 4:11–22) and Phinehas (see v. 25). See also <i>Mikeitz,</i> Another Contemporary Reflection.

Verse 16



Verse 17



Verse 18



Verse 19



Verse 20

<b><i>Jochebed.</i></b> Moses’ mother is the first person recorded in the Bible with a name containing elements of the tetragrammaton (see at 3:15), for her name means “Yo/Yah is glorified” (the first part of the name is a shortened form of יהוה). Her name thus gives weight to the tradition that identifies Moses as the first to know God’s personal name (see 6:2). Jochebed is identified as her husband’s aunt (the sister of Amram’s father); note that Leviticus 18:12 and 20:19 ban marriages between family members so closely related.

Verse 21



Verse 22



Verse 23

<b><i>Elisheba, daughter of Amminadab and sister of Nahshon.</i></b> The name of Aaron’s wife may mean “My God is seven,” alluding to the wholeness and perfection of the number seven that is evident in the story of Creation (Genesis 1) and the institution of the Jubilee (Leviticus 25). Alternatively, the name can be understood as “God of the oath,” suggesting the promissory bond between God and her lineage. The names of Elisheba’s father and brother indicate that she is from the tribe of Judah; her brother would become a distant ancestor of King David (see Numbers 2:3; Ruth 4:20–22).

Verse 24



Verse 25

<b><i>one of Putiel’s daughters.</i></b> The lineage of Eleazar’s wife and Phinehas’s mother is provided, yet not her name or her sisters’ names. Putiel is a distinctly Egyptian name and is never otherwise mentioned in the Bible. If Putiel was an Egyptian, then this suggests that his grandson, the zealot priest Phinehas, was of mixed background (see Numbers 25:1–13). Note, however, Deuteronomy 23:8–9 considers the grandchildren of an Egyptian to be legitimate Israelites.

Verse 26

REITERATION OF THE PROPHETIC MISSION (6:26–7:7) The narrative resumes its focus on Aaron and Moses, as the major themes of Moses’ commission are revisited. This section returns to various themes in 6:2–12, such as the declaration of the divine name (6:2, 29; 7:5), promise of deliverance from Egypt (6:6; 7:5), and the issue of Moses’ “uncircumcised lips” (6:12, 30).

Chapter 7



Verse 1

<b><i>“I place you in the role of God to Pharaoh.”</i></b> This astonishing analogy promotes Moses to the role of the Deity, lording over Pharaoh—who in Egyptian society was considered divine.

Verse 2



Verse 3

<b><i>“But I will harden Pharaoh’s heart.”</i></b> This aspect of the Exodus raises questions of theodicy. On one level, the obstacle of a hardened monarch and the ensuing portrait of Egypt’s destruction seem unjust. Could God not have softened Pharaoh’s heart and spared Egypt? The exodus narrative justifies the freedom won at the expense of the oppressors’ devastation not as retribution, but as a means of impressing knowledge of divine power on Israel and Egypt alike. Pharaoh’s opposition entails a clash of wills as well as a contest between the pantheon of Egypt and the lone God of Israel. Biblical narrative renders the victor indisputable and the powers of the Egyptian gods obsolete. The number ten is at work in this part of the plot: ten times God hardens Pharaoh’s heart (4:21; 7:3; 9:12; 10:1, 20, 27; 11:10; 14:4, 8, 17); and another ten times Pharaoh is described as naturally resistant due to his own obstinacy (7:13, 14, 22; 8:11, 15, 28; 9:7, 34, 35; 13:15).

<i>Moses and God versus Pharaoh</i>
SEVEN SIGNS AND MARVELS (7:8–9:35)
Is there any logic behind the arrangement of the so-called ten plagues? Interpreters have indeed observed different types of organizing principles in this artfully crafted narrative. The events can be seen as a sequence of five pairs: two Nile transformations, two infestations of insects, two epidemics, two crop destructions, two conjurings of darkness and death. The narrative can also be divided into three triads topped by a climactic final plague: the 1st, 4th, and 7th signs begin with Moses “standing before” Pharaoh in the morning; the 2nd, 5th, and 8th start with Moses “coming before” Pharaoh; and the 3rd, 6th, and 9th are unleashed without warning. One line of rabbinic interpretation divides the signs according to the instigating agent: Aaron brings about the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd signs; Moses brings about the 7th, 8th, and 9th; God causes the 4th, 5th, and 10th; and the 6th is created by a collaboration of Aaron, Moses, and God (<i>Sh’mot Rabbah</i> 9.10; 20.1).
While the account in the book of Exodus enumerates ten separate episodes, two other accounts in Psalms 78:42–51 and 105:28–36 each list seven; and in those two poetic accounts, the signs are arranged in a different order than in the Torah. Interestingly, the designation “Ten Plagues” (<i>eser makkot</i>) is not found in the Bible; it is a later, rabbinic appellation. In fact, most of these divine acts are called “signs,” not “plagues,” thus highlighting that they were not considered punitive, but rather the means to convince Pharaoh, the Israelites, and the reader of God’s might (see also at 9:14 and 11:1).
In straining to place the Exodus in an indisputably historical context—rather than a literary or religious one—some scholars have proposed naturalistic explanations of these events. For instance, the claim has been made that the Nile appeared red due to red sediment caused by uncommonly heavy rainfalls; this unusual flooding then disturbed the ecosystem of the Nile and caused a chain of events, including the invasion of frogs and disease-carrying insects that made cattle ill and caused boils. However, the rhetoric of Exodus emphasizes that these are unique preternatural occurrences intended to promote awareness of divine power; they are best understood as devices that heighten the contest between God and Pharaoh and drive the plot toward the liberation of Israel.
PROLOGUE: SNAKES AND SPELLS (7:8–13)
Here and in several subsequent episodes, Aaron competes with the magicians of Egypt, showing how God bests Pharaoh and the Egyptian pantheon on their own terrain.

Verse 9

<b><i>“into a serpent.”</i></b> During his earlier vision at Sinai, Moses was instructed to deploy a similar wonder as a means of authentication before the Israelites (4:2–5). Here Aaron’s staff becomes a serpent <i>(tannin),</i> a large sea creature, as opposed to a snake in the prior episode. Since Aaron’s staff later changes into an almond branch (Numbers 17:23), some scholars have identified a connection to the ancient Near Eastern goddess Asherah, who is associated with blooming trees, rods, and serpents.

Verse 10



Verse 11

<b><i>sages.</i></b> Given the plural language, women are conceivably included in this term. Historically speaking, “wise woman” was a well-known category in Egypt; and the Hebrew Bible also recognized women for their wisdom (II Samuel 14:2, 20:16; Proverbs 31:26).
<i><b>sorcerers.</b></i> Again, given the plural term, women may be included: they were among Egypt’s sorcerers since pre-dynastic times; and in the Bible, the practice of magic is specifically associated with women in Exodus 22:17 (“You shall not tolerate a sorceress”) and Nahum 3:4.
<i><b>magician-priests.</b></i> Unlike the preceding two Hebrew terms, this one comes directly from an Egyptian word that—in Egypt—applied only to men.

Verse 12



Verse 13



Verse 14

ONE: NILE TURNS TO BLOOD (7:14–24) The signs (often called “plagues” in later Jewish parlance) are framed by blood: They begin with the transformation of life-giving waters into deadly aquifers, and they end with blood smudged on Israelite doorposts to deflect the macabre visit of the Angel of Death (12:23). As both source of abundance and site of Egyptian divinity, the Nile is targeted first. Various water-related terms (such as rivers, canals, and ponds in v. 19) permeate this section, introducing a theme that will climax with the splitting of the Sea of Reeds.

Verse 15

<b><i>“at the edge of the Nile.”</i></b> The spilling of Moses’ blood was avoided when Pharaoh’s daughter drew him from the Nile (2:5–10); now Moses faces another member of the Egyptian royal family on the banks of the river.

Verse 16

<b><i>“God of the Hebrews.”</i></b> In the Bible, the Israelites tend to be called Hebrews (<i>ivrim</i>) by speakers outside of the group (Genesis 39:14; 41:12; Exodus 1:16, 19; 2:6) or when an Israelite speaks to an outsider (Genesis 14:13; Exodus 2:7; Jonah 1:9).
<i><b>“Let My people go.”</b></i> This resounding phrase first appeared in Exodus 5:1 (compare 4:23). God repeats it five more times in giving instructions to Moses (here; 7:26; 8:16; 9:1, 13), while Moses repeats it once more to Pharaoh (10:3)—a total of seven times.
<i><b>“that they may worship Me.”</b></i> The request for freedom from slavery is linked to the request for freedom to serve God. Linguistically speaking, the contrast could not be more pointed: the Hebrew narrative employs the same verb (<i>avod)</i> for the two counterposed activities: “work as a slave” to Pharaoh, and “worship” God.

Verse 17



Verse 18



Verse 19



Verse 20

<b><i>all the water in the Nile was turned into blood.</i></b> This sign conveys a sense of measure-for-measure justice: the bloody river recalls the blood of Israelite infants spilled in the Nile (1:22).
A similar event is brought about by the goddess Inanna, “Queen of Heaven,” in the Sumerian myth “Inanna and the Gardener”: as a punishment, the goddess transforms all well water into blood.

Verse 21



Verse 22



Verse 23



Verse 24

<b><i>the Egyptians had to dig round about the Nile for drinking water.</i></b> Elsewhere the Bible portrays the hauling of water (for drinking and general use) as a woman’s activity (Genesis 24:11; I Samuel 9:11). If this were also the case in Egypt, then one can imagine the particularly hard burden that this sign placed on Egyptian women.

Verse 25

TWO: EGYPT SWARMS WITH FROGS (7:25–8:11) In the course of the second sign, a creature that dwells mostly in water emerges to take over the human realm. This species invasion signals that the realms of creation—water, earth, and air—have been breached. The multiplication of frogs, like the appearance of the blood, conveys a sense of measure-for-measure justice: the “swarming” frogs (7:28) invoke Pharaoh’s fear of the multiplying, “swarming” population of Israelites (1:7). In ancient Egypt, human reproduction was associated with Heqt, the frog goddess of childbirth who protected the mother and newborn infant. Other deities associated with fertility and childbirth include Bes (the hippo goddess) and Taweret (the female crocodile goddess).

Verse 26

<b><i>“Let My people go that they may worship Me.”</i></b> Moses does not ask Pharaoh to liberate the Israelites permanently. Instead, following God’s plan, Moses requests that the Israelites be allowed a brief leave so they can take a three days’ journey to the wilderness for a sacrificial celebration (3:18; 5:1–3; 8:21–24). Ancient Egyptian documents do attest to the practice of allowing free workers time off for various reasons, including participating in religious festivals.

Verse 4

<b><i>“I will let the people go to sacrifice to יהוה.”</i></b> For the first time, the pharaoh seems to acknowledge the existence of God.

Verse 5

<b><i>“for what time shall I plead in behalf of you?”</i></b> In order to prove that the removal of the frogs is not incidental but rather an act of God, Moses lets Pharaoh name the time of their elimination.

Verse 6

<b><i>“that you may know that there is none like our God יהוה.”</i></b> The signs are expressly intended to engender knowledge of God among the Egyptians and Israelites, with differing effects on each. (See also Another View.)

Verse 7



Verse 8



Verse 9



Verse 10

<b><i>the land stank.</i></b> Here and in 7:21, the text emphasizes the olfactory dimension of the first two signs. Measure-for-measure justice is again at work. In 5:21 the Israelites had condemned Moses and Aaron for literally “causing our breath to be malodorous” (in our translation: “making us loathsome”), meaning that Moses’ demands have brought harsher labor requirements down on the slaves. As God proves through the signs, it is not the Israelites who stink, but rather the land of Egypt during its accelerated rate of decay.

Verse 11



Verse 12

THREE: DUST TURNS TO LICE (8:12–15) During this third round, the Egyptian magician-priests drop out of the contest and—humbled—admit defeat, with a partial recognition of God’s agency. The lice infest Egyptian bodies as the frogs would have disrupted their households.
<b><i>“Say to Aaron.”</i></b> In the 3rd, 6th, and 9th signs (the last in each triad), the event occurs without any warning being given to Pharaoh.

Verse 13



Verse 14

<b><i>magician-priests…could not.</i></b> Having matched the signs performed by Moses and Aaron three times (rod in 7:11–12; blood in 7:22; frogs in 8:3), the Egyptians now fail to reproduce Aaron’s actions.

Verse 15

<b><i>“This is the finger of God!”</i></b> Throughout the Exodus narrative, reference is made to God’s outstretched hand (such as 3:20) or arm (such as 6:6) as the vehicle for punishing the Egyptians. Here, the magician-priests express their acknowledgment of God’s power though a similarly anthropomorphic image. As in other ancient Near Eastern texts, the hand of a deity is an image that signifies her or his ability to act in the world.

Verse 16

FOUR: SWARMS INVADE THE LAND (8:16–28)

Verse 17

<b><i>“if you do not let My people go.”</i></b> God does not secure Israel’s liberation in a non-violent manner, rather, each refusal entails a harsh consequence. Moses emphasizes the reciprocal damage that Pharaoh brings on himself and his people by using verbs that share the same root. A translation that captures the parallel is: “If you do not <i>send</i> my people, then I will <i>send</i> swarms against you.” <i><b>“swarms of insects.”</b></i> Heb. <i>arov,</i> which stems from the root meaning “to mix.” Some ancient and medieval commentators understood the word as referring to a mixture of wild beasts, while others interpreted the term as some sort of insect, perhaps a fly. The parallelism with “lice” in Psalm 105:31 supports the present translation.

Verse 18

<b><i>“I will set apart the region of Goshen.”</i></b> God begins the process of separating the people of Israel from the Egyptian population while fulfilling the fantasy of the oppressed seeing their oppressors suffer. God wrenches Israel from Egypt in gradual stages of individuation during which Israel is free of suffering.

Verse 19

<b><i>“I will make a distinction.”</i></b> The distinction that results from the Exodus is of two sorts: Israel becomes independent of Egypt and receives a legal code that marks it as different from other nations.

Verse 20

 Like the frogs, the insects invade the houses of royalty and commoners alike.

Verse 21

<b><i>“sacrifice to your God within the land.”</i></b> A clever negotiator, Pharaoh concedes to half of Israel’s request by proposing that they sacrifice to their God <i>within</i> Egypt, a compromise Moses rejects.

Verse 22

<b><i>“what we sacrifice…is untouchable to the Egyptians.”</i></b> According to classical sources, ancient Egyptians sacrificed animals to gods and to the dead, but the creatures they offered were not sheep and goats like the Israelites. This may account for anathema to the Egyptians. This is a kind of “ethnic differentiation” in which the customs of one group are deeply disapproved of by another.

Chapter 9



Verse 1

FIVE: PESTILENCE ATTACKS THE ANIMALS (9:1–7) Like the first two signs, this episode, too, seems to involve an element of measure-for-measure justice. Since Israel is not allowed to sacrifice its animals to God in Egypt, the animals of Egypt will suffer.

Verse 2



Verse 3



Verse 4



Verse 5



Verse 6



Verse 7



Verse 8

SIX: SOOT BRINGS ABOUT BOILS (9:8–12) With Pharaoh as their witness, Moses and Aaron throw handfuls of soot into the air; the soot becomes dust and causes boils to break out on humans and animals. In James Frazer’s typology of magic, this constitutes imitative magic, for the properties of one object (soot that has been <i>burnt</i>) resemble another (a <i>burning</i> rash on the skin) to the point of actual inflammation.
When stricken by boils, Job sits in ash and scratches himself with a potsherd (Job 2:7–8). This image conveys the misery of the affliction that, like the lice before it, affects the flesh of both humans and animals.
<b><i>“soot from the kiln.”</i></b> The reason for this specification is not clear. Umberto Cassuto suggests that the kiln in view is one where bricks are forged; since the making and laying of bricks are the very labors forced on the Israelites, both symmetry and “poetic justice” would then be evident in this divine act (<i>Exodus</i>, 1967, p. 113). Arguing against that interpretation is the fact that in ancient Egypt, bricks were generally sun-dried rather than kiln-fired.

Verse 9



Verse 10

<b><i>Moses threw it.</i></b> Although both Aaron and Moses are instructed to take handfuls of soot, only Moses actually throws the soot into the sky. Aaron’s role is fading, as Moses takes center stage along with God and Pharaoh.

Verse 11



Verse 12



Verse 13

SEVEN: HAIL RAINS DOWN DESTRUCTION (9:13–35) This plague comes with an additional test of Pharaoh: he is forewarned that if he wants to preserve his remaining servants and livestock, then he will need to shelter them before the hail strikes. The warning divides Pharaoh’s household into those who fear God’s word and therefore bring the animals inside and those who do not heed the divine word and leave their animals exposed.

Verse 14

<b><i>“My plagues.”</i></b> Prior to mention of the killing of the first-born (11:1), this is the one time that God uses a term of affliction: <i>mageifot</i> (plagues). While the other episodes are referred to as “signs,” “marvels,” or “wonders,” here the term “plagues” may have been used because the hail will involve a loss of life for humans and animals. (See also at 11:1.)
<b><i>“in order that you may know that there is none like Me.”</i></b> The intended outcome of the increasingly severe signs is the recognition of the unequaled power of God. Such a sentiment is expressed in the Song at the Sea (15:11) and later intoned in Jewish liturgy as the prayer <i>Mi Chamochah.</i>

Verse 27

<b><i>“I stand guilty this time.”</i></b> Pharaoh temporarily puts himself in the wrong, but he recants from this position when the marvel ceases (9:34–35). Pharaoh sometimes seems to peer beyond his stubbornness and grasp the inevitable conclusion of the struggle.

Verse 28



Verse 29



Verse 30



Verse 31

<b><i>Now the flax and barley were ruined</i></b>. This digression about the harvest emphasizes the loss of one season’s yield as well as the survival of the lateblooming crops. This foreshadows more destruction to come.
<b><i>31–32. barley… wheat.</i></b> These grains are associated with the Exodus not only narratively but also ritually: the earliest celebrations of Passover marked the barley harvest; and Shavuot was, in its first form, the wheat harvest holiday. The practice of cleaning one’s house of leaven before Passover recalls the farmers’ clearing of stale remnants of a previous crop before the harvest of a new one.
<b><i>emmer.</i></b> A kind of wheat.

 The parashah ends with both Pharaoh’s stone heart and the acknowledgment that all is going according to God’s plan.
<i>—Rachel Havrelock</i>   

Chapter 10



Verse 1

<i>Moses and God versus Pharaoh, continued</i>
TWO MORE SIGNS FROM GOD (10:1–29)
The previous parashah ended after a series of seven signs of divine power. According to the narrator, Pharaoh reacted to these signs by “stiffening” his “heart” (that is, his will). Following the 5th sign, God began to “harden” Pharaoh’s heart. Nevertheless, his free will remained (9:35).
Now, after Moses and Aaron again warn Pharaoh—and God once again hardens his heart—the east wind ushers in an unprecedented swarm of locusts. The grand scale of this 8th sign underscores that it is a one-time, cataclysmic event aimed to demonstrate God’s supremacy.
Pharaoh is unable to relent. This will lead to a 9th sign—darkness—which is announced and performed without confrontation with, or warning to, Pharaoh (just like the 3rd and 6th signs; see 8:12–15 and 9:8–11).
EIGHT: LOCUSTS (10:1–20)
<b><i>“I have hardened his heart.”</i></b> A major theme of this parashah is God’s omnipotence, especially in relation to the pharaoh. The narrator insists on showing that God completely controls all that is happening, as exemplified by the way God hardens Pharaoh’s heart. (Earlier, Pharaoh hardens his own heart, as in 8:15.)
<i><b>“hardened.”</b></i> Literally, God “made [Pharaoh’s heart] heavy” (from the root <i>k-b-d,</i> “to be heavy”). The image of the heavy heart may relate to the ancient Egyptian conception that in the afterlife, when weighed on the scales of judgment, the virtuous soul is found to have a heart that is lighter than a feather, whereas the sinner has a heavy heart.

Verse 2

<b><i>“that you may recount.”</i></b> The memory of the bondage in and redemption from Egypt is central to Israel’s covenantal relationship with God, as seen in the prologue to the Decalogue (20:2). Moses is addressed in the singular here, as the one who will begin the process of the retelling of the enslavement and exodus to subsequent generations in order to ensure that these events do not fade from Israelite memory.
<b><i>“in order that you may know that I am</i> יהוה.”</b> As with the other signs, part of God’s stated motivation for these events is to demonstrate and authenticate the divine Presence, thus eliciting recognition of God’s power from both the Egyptians and the Israelites.

Verse 3



Verse 4



Verse 5

<b><i>“no one will be able to see.”</i></b> This phrase refers not only to the 8th sign but also foreshadows the 9th sign (see next section). For further foreshadowing, see at v. 17, below.

Verse 6



Verse 7

<b><i>“a delegation.”</i></b> Heb. <i>ha-anashim</i> (traditionally “the men”), which the present translation understands as referring to a group’s representatives. The courtiers’ plea to Pharaoh is to dispatch the Israelite elders or officials—presumably men; thus Pharaoh asks for a specific list (v. 8).

Verse 8



Verse 9

<b><i>“We will all go.”</i></b> In his reply, Moses shows that the courtiers’ limited offer is unacceptable: he includes all the people as well as the livestock. Moses and Aaron had originally resorted to a ruse, telling Pharaoh that they wanted to leave only in order to worship their God at a distance of three days’ journey into the wilderness (see 5:1, 3). Since they have no intention of returning to Egypt, no one and nothing can be left behind.
<i><b>“regardless of social station.”</b></i> Literally, “with our underlings and with our elders” or “with our youths and with our old folks”; the Hebrew terms can refer either to socioeconomic status or to age.
This type of expression is called a “merism,” meaning that the figure of speech uses two extremes to convey a totality, as if it said “and everybody in between.” <i><b>“with our sons and daughters.”</b></i> This is a second expression that Moses uses to signal inclusiveness in the proposed religious observance.

Verse 10



Verse 11



Verse 12



Verse 13

<b><i>east wind.</i></b> Later, when the Israelites cross the Sea of Reeds, God will again bring an east wind to turn the water into dry ground (see at 14:21; also Numbers 11:31).

Verse 14



Verse 15



Verse 16



Verse 17

<b><i>this death.</i></b> Thus the 8th sign anticipates the final and most crushing divine act, the death of the first-born sons (11:1–10; 12:29–36); compare at v. 5, above.

Verse 18



Verse 19



Verse 20



Verse 21

NINE: DARKNESS (10:21–29)

Verse 22



Verse 23

<b><i>People could not see one another…but all the Israelites enjoyed light.</i></b> Presumably the text’s ancient audience would have understood such darkness as a reflection of the impotence of Re, the Egyptians’ sun god. Thus this sign implicitly proves that the God of Israel is stronger than the gods of the Egyptians.

Verse 24

<b><i>“even your dependents may go with you.”</i></b> Despite Pharaoh’s earlier restriction that only the men leave (v. 11, rendered there as “you gentlemen”), he now relents and acquiesces to Moses’ demand that all the people be allowed to leave (v. 9).
<i><b>“dependents.”</b></i> Heb. <i>taf,</i> a flexible term whose sense depends on what it complements. Since Moses previously specified that everyone would go, including “our youths and our old folks” and “our sons and daughters” (v. 9; see comments there), its scope must include the women as well as children. Most individuals in this category would be economically productive members of their household.

Verse 25



Verse 26



Verse 27



Verse 28



Verse 29

<b><i>“You have spoken rightly. I shall not see your face again.”</i></b> In spite of this statement, Moses continues speaking to Pharaoh (11:4–8). Moses and Aaron meet with Pharaoh again when Pharaoh gives his final permission for the Israelites to leave Egypt (12:31–32).

Chapter 11



Verse 1

<i>Ritual Preparations for the Exodus</i> (11:1–12:28)
Nine signs from God in dramatic escalation have led to the present impasse: Pharaoh is unwilling to relent. However, God has already hinted at a 10th sign (4:23), and now it is announced. But before describing the execution of that sign, the narrative will pause to embed in the story two ritual acts—a passover offering and a Feast of Matzot—that are to be commemorated annually.
ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE TENTH SIGN (11:1–10)
The final calamity, which is labeled a “plague” (see at 11:1), proves decisive. It is introduced at length and receives more narrative space than any of the others; the account is more dramatic and also more disturbing to modern readers. Although the Egyptians are condemned for inflicting bondage on the Israelites and attempting to kill Hebrew babies, God’s killing of innocent Egyptians may still raise theological and ethical questions for a contemporary audience. However, these concerns are not central to the biblical account. From the Bible’s perspective, the main purpose of the signs is to prove God’s might and supreme control. While recognizing the literary function and ahistorical nature of these texts helps to provide perspective on the seeming injustice of God’s actions, many nevertheless struggle with what remains for them a troubling biblical text.
 <b>יהוה <i>said.</i></b> This revelation to Moses interrupts the heated exchange between Moses and Pharaoh and begins the instructions to the Israelites regarding preparations for the impending exodus. This interruption heightens the tension preceding the actual exodus from Egypt.
<i><b>“plague.”</b></i> Heb. <i>nega,</i> a term of affliction like <i>mageifah</i> in 9:14 and <i>negef</i> in 12:13, which are all customarily translated by the same English word. Such terms appear only in connection with the killing of the first-born and the hail—both of which involve a loss of human life. However, as Carol Meyers has pointed out, whenever God or the narrator describes what these calamities are intended to mean to the story’s Israelite characters—and to its Israelite audience—the term used is “signs” <i>(otot,</i> see 8:19), “marvels” <i>(mof’tim,</i> see 11:10), or “wonders” <i>(nifla’ot,</i> see 3:20) (<i>Exodus</i>, 2005, pp. 76–77). At the same time, the phrasing here (“one more plague”) suggests that all ten events generally are “plagues,” referring to how the Egyptians experience them.

Verse 2

<b><i>“borrow.”</i></b> The Bible gives no indication of any intention to return the Egyptians’ objects. The Hebrew word translated as “borrow” has a range of meanings, including “ask” or “demand” (see also at 3:22). To explain the Israelites’ actions, commentators connect this verse with Deuteronomy 15:13, which states that a Hebrew slave should not be set free without payment. As early as the 2nd century <small>B.C.E.</small>, the despoiling of the Egyptians was considered recompense for the labor of bondage (Jubilees 48:18).
<i><b>“each man from his neighbor and each woman from hers.”</b></i> In this context, the grammatically masculine language of the first phrase alone could have been understood as gender inclusive. God’s instructions thus go out of their way to specify that the Israelite men are to interact with the Egyptian men, and the Israelite women are to deal with the Egyptian women.
<i><b>“neighbor.”</b></i> Presumably Egyptians, not Israelites (see 12:35), thus implying that the Israelites lived in close proximity to at least some Egyptians. See also at 3:22.

Verse 3

<b><i>disposed the Egyptians favorably.</i></b> One of the main points of the account of the signs is that God is all-powerful: God rules heaven and earth and all therein, including the Egyptians. Each biblical reference to this episode underscores that the Egyptians willingly gave their belongings to the Israelites as a result of God’s intervention, meaning that the silver and gold was not plunder, but freely given (see 3:19–22; 12:35–36; Psalm 105:36–38).

Verse 4



Verse 5

<b><i>“every [male] first-born.”</i></b> This translation clarifies that the plague will target specifically first-born sons, not daughters.
<i><b>“from the first-born of Pharaoh…to the first-born of the slave girl.”</b></i> Another merism (see at 10:9): the intent of this act is to affect all Egyptian households, from the highest male aristocracy to the lowest female slave. The Torah is not concerned with the guilt or innocence of any specific victim, nor with the ethical implications of blanket punishments; the focus remains resolutely on exemplifying God’s supreme power.
<i><b>behind the millstones.</b></i> Grinding grain to make bread for household consumption was likely the task of free women, bondwomen, or bondmen. On some large estates in Egypt, men first would crush grain in a mortar to make it ready for the women who then would grind it into flour. In ordinary peasant households, women likely performed all the procedures necessary for transforming grain into bread. In the Bible, grinding stones are associated with women (Judges 9:53); when young men carry them, the world has gone topsy-turvy (Lamentations 5:13). (See at 12:8 for more on women’s involvement in bread production.)

Verse 6

<b><i>“loud cry.”</i></b> The cry of the Egyptians will parallel the earlier outcry of the Israelites that God heard (3:7), the event that precipitated their salvation.

Chapter 12



Verse 1

INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE PASSOVER SACRIFICE (12:1–13) The narrative is interrupted at this point, thus heightening the suspense and drama of the story. The account of the plague continues in v. 29, after God gives instructions for the preparation of the Passover sacrifice, the application of blood to the doorposts and lintels, and the Feast of Matzot—all means of remembering and commemorating God’s signal acts.
<b><i>1–2.</i></b> This instruction depicts the exodus from Egypt as the start of a new epoch in Israelite history and in the relationship of the Israelites with God. This foundational event is memorialized by a reformation of the calendar so that the year starts in the spring, the time of the Exodus. Exactly one year later, the Tabernacle will be erected (40:17), again highlighting this date as one on which momentous events occurred.

Verse 2

<b><i>This month.</i></b> Although unnamed here, the month is later identified as Abib (13:4; 23:15; 34:18; Deuteronomy 16:1), meaning “month of new grain”; still later it is called Nisan (Esther 3:7).
<i><b>first of the months of the year.</b></i> Rosh HaShanah, the first day of the seventh month, is now celebrated as the Jewish New Year; however, the Bible simply refers to it as a holiday commemorated with a shofar blast (see Leviticus 23:24; Numbers 29:1). In an agricultural society, both the spring and the fall could be considered new years, so some scholars see these two festivals as a way of combining competing ancient beliefs regarding the beginning of the year.

Verse 3

<b><i>3–6.</i></b> The passover sacrifice is not a typical offering, for each family is to prepare, slaughter, and consume its own lamb (or kid—the Hebrew term applies to the young of both sheep and goats; see v. 5) as part of the offering. Some believe that this was an earlier apotropaic (or protective) custom that here becomes associated with the Exodus.
<b><i>family…household.</i></b> Heb. <i>beit avot</i> and <i>bayit,</i> both of which can refer to a small (6- to 12-person) family unit, as probably here, or to a larger clan or lineage group. The language here and in v. 21 <i>(mishpachot,</i> translated there as “families”) signals that women were included in the passover sacrifice. See also Deuteronomy 16:16, in which only men are obligated to celebrate the Passover festival.

Verse 4



Verse 5

<b><i>yearling male.</i></b> The male animal is selected for sacrifice not because it is considered more valuable than a female. Rather, the female animals are preserved for breeding purposes and for milk production.

Verse 6



Verse 7

<b><i>7–13.</i></b> Blood, as a vital force of life, has protective powers in biblical thought. Some scholars maintain that the blood is to be applied to the door-frame of the house to protect the point where evil might enter; therefore, no one is to pass through the doorway (v. 22). The blood must be applied to the doorway before nightfall so that the sign will be apparent to God, thus ensuring that the Israelites will remain safe.

Verse 8

<b><i>with unleavened bread and with bitter herbs.</i></b> No explanation is provided for the instruction to eat unleavened bread and bitter herbs along with the passover sacrifice. Hence, many scholars believe that this was a pre-existent custom that here becomes associated with the Exodus. The source of this custom is unknown, but many scholars associate the bitter herbs with a sharp seasoning that might have been used in ancient times. According to the Mishnah (<i>P’sachim</i> 10:5) and the Passover Haggadah, the bitter herbs symbolize the bitterness of the enforced labor (Exodus 1:14).
Although the Bible does not give much information about food preparation, several texts (Genesis 18:6; I Samuel 8:13; II Samuel 13:8; Ecclesiastes 12:3), as well as extra-biblical and ethnographic evidence, suggest that women usually prepared bread. See also at 11:5, 16:3, and Leviticus 26:26.

Verse 9



Verse 10



Verse 11

 The instructions in this verse indicate that the Israelites are to be prepared for an imminent departure. A reference to speed appears again in vv. 33–34, which describe the Egyptians’ impatience for the Israelites to leave, and in v. 39, which links the unleavened bread to the Israelites’ hasty departure.
<i><b>passover.</b></i> This is the first time the word <i>pesach</i> is used in the Torah; and, as with matzah and the bitter herbs, the text assumes that the Israelites will understand the term. A folk etymology for the name “Passover” connects it to the angel of death’s passing over the houses of the Israelites (see at 12:27).

Verse 12



Verse 13



Verse 14

REGULATIONS FOR THE FEAST OF MATZOT (12:14–20) Some scholars posit that the Feast of Unleavened Bread (<i>matzot)</i> and the passover sacrifice (<i>pesach</i>) originally were two distinct festivals; but there is no consensus regarding their origins. Here the Bible connects the two and links them to the Exodus experience (see also Joshua 5:11; Ezekiel 45:21; II Chronicles 35:17), thereby making them part of the rite of remembrance.

Verse 15

<b><i>you shall eat unleavened bread.</i></b> The exact significance here of matzah is unclear. The Bible presents unleavened bread as both a festive food (Genesis 19:3) and a symbol of oppression, associating “the bread of distress” with the memory of the Exodus (Deuteronomy 16:3).
<i><b>person.</b></i> See at Leviticus 2:1.
<i><b>cut off from Israel.</b></i> See at Leviticus 7:20.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE PASSOVER SACRIFICE DELIVERED TO THE ELDERS (12:21–28) Earlier, God instructs Moses to “speak to the whole community of Israel” (12:3). Here, however, Moses speaks specifically to the elders of Israel, who then will disseminate the information about the passover sacrifice to the entire community.

Verse 22

<b><i>“None of you shall go outside the door of your house.”</i></b> The blood applied to the doorway differentiates the Israelites from the Egyptians and symbolically protects any first-born male children in the house (see at 12:7–13).

Verse 23

<b><i>“Destroyer.”</i></b> The one who brings the plague is personified as an agent of God (see II Samuel 24:15–17; II Kings 19:32–37). Nonetheless, God’s control remains complete, for it is God who will “not let the Destroyer” enter the Israelites’ homes.

Verse 24



Verse 25



Verse 26



Verse 27

<b><i>“passed over.”</i></b> In this verse, the root <i>p-s-ch</i> links the festival of Passover (<i>Pesach</i>) to God’s passing over (<i>pasach</i>) the houses of the Israelites, thereby protecting them from this plague. Scholars debate the precise force of the verb here. Some focus on the apotropaic function of blood (see at vv. 7–13) and understand it to mean “protect.” Others connect it with the leaping of the demons from which one needs protection, or they relate it to a rite of passage.

Verse 28



Verse 29

<i>The Tenth Sign</i>
SLAYING OF THE FIRST-BORN (12:29–36)
The prior narrative—set aside since 12:1—picks up again here, after the Israelites carry out the instructions for the passover offering (v. 28).
<b><i>first-born of the captive.</i></b> When this sign is announced (11:5), a slave girl exemplifies the lowest member of society. Here a different figure, a male captive, is contrasted with Pharaoh to signify that all elements of Egyptian society are subject to the reach of God’s wrath.

Verse 30

<b><i>loud cry.</i></b> See at 11:6.

Verse 31

<b><i>“Go, worship יהוה as you said.”</i></b> The outcome predicted by God in 3:20 and 6:1 now comes to pass as Pharaoh finally recognizes God’s supremacy.

Verse 32



Verse 33



Verse 34

<b><i>dough…kneading bowls.</i></b> The narrative may highlight these objects because the description of the unleavened cakes of dough baked on the journey out of Egypt (12:39) links the narrative of the Exodus to the festival of matzot (13:3).

Verse 35



Verse 36

<b><i>stripped.</i></b> Heb. root <i>n-tz-l</i>, meaning “to take away.” Though in English “stripped” has a negative connotation, the Torah does not seem to give a pejorative spin to the “despoiling” of Egypt (see at 11:2).

Verse 37

<i>The Exodus from Egypt Begins</i> (12:37–42)
The drama of the hurried flight from Egypt is followed by various details about the start of the journey, including where the Israelites traveled, how many left, and when the exodus occurred.
<b><i>from Rameses to Succoth.</i></b> The exact location of these cities, and therefore the route of the exodus itself, is unknown, perhaps because the biblical account is not an historical record but rather a story meant to dramatize and commemorate a formative experience.
<i><b>six hundred thousand fighting men.</b></i> This large number is symbolic, perhaps representing all Israelites of generations to come. If taken literally, the estimates for the total number of people leaving Egypt range between two and three million, assuming each man was accompanied by a wife and between two and three children. The number here agrees with the accounting in Numbers 11:21, but note the discrepancy with the census account in Numbers 26:51 (see also Exodus 38:26).
<i><b>noncombatants.</b></i> As in 10:24, this term (Heb. <i>taf</i>) presumably includes the women, children, and infirm or disabled men.

Verse 38

<b><i>mixed multitude.</i></b> Heb. <i>erev rav</i>, an expression implying that other people joined the Israelites when they fled Egypt; but these people are not identified.

Verse 39

 The significance of eating matzah is given here, even though the initial directive for eating it had been given in connection with the regulations for the Passover Festival (v. 8).

Verse 40

<b><i>four hundred and thirty years.</i></b> It is impossible to reconcile this figure with the other dates for the sojourn in Egypt given in the Bible (see Genesis 15:13, 16). Large numbers like this need not be taken literally but can be read as indicating relative size (see at v. 37). In this case, the message conveyed is that the sojourn in Egypt lasted a long time. There is, as yet, not enough information available to posit any precise dating of the Exodus; any attempt to do so is, at best, speculation.

Verse 41

<b><i>to the very day.</i></b> This phrase indicates that the timing of the Exodus was either divinely preordained or miraculous. Either way, the implication is that God keeps all promises, thus continuing the theme of God’s ultimate control over all events.

Verse 42

<b><i>vigil…vigil.</i></b> Heb. <i>shimurim</i>, literally “keeping watch,” contains the root <i>sh-m-r</i>, which occurs a total of seven times in Exodus 12 (also “keep watch,” v. 6; “observe,” vv. 17 [twice], 24, 25). Just as God has kept watch to effectuate the Exodus, so the Israelites must vigilantly observe the various rites established to commemorate this extraordinary event. These rites are the subject of the remainder of the parashah.

Verse 43

<i>Ritual Remembrances of the Exodus</i> (12:43–13:16)
In returning to ritual considerations, the text now constructs a double frame around the climactic events just narrated. The first frame is focused on the passover sacrifice. The regulations enumerated earlier (vv. 3–6) discuss how the offering is to be prepared; here we are told who may partake of the offering and who is excluded. The topic of the second, outer frame is the importance of memory, a concern that not only began the parashah (10:2) but also appeared in the preparations for the Exodus (12:26–27); here we find a listing of rites that institutionalize the memory of the Exodus and God’s redemptive power.
LAWS OF THE PASSOVER OFFERING (12:43–51)

Verse 44

<b><i>circumcised.</i></b> Inclusion in the covenantal relationship through circumcision is the dominant criterion for participation in the passover offering for foreigners who live in the community (see also v. 48). Mention of circumcision here links this episode to the circumcision performed by Zipporah, Moses’ wife, in 4:24–26, and thus frames the story of the salvation of the Israelites.

Chapter 13



Verse 1

CONSECRATION OF FIRST-BORN MALES, FEAST OF MATZOT, AND T’FILLIN (13:1–16)

Verse 2

 <i><b>“first [male] issue of every womb.”</b></i> Heb. <i>peter rechem</i>, from the root <i>p-t-r</i>, meaning “to separate” or “to open”; the phrase refers to a female’s first offspring. | The reason for the consecration or separation of first-born males is explained in vv. 12–15.

Verse 3

<b><i>3–8.</i></b> This section connects the prior instructions for matzot (12:14–20) with the recounting of the events of the Exodus for future generations (see at 10:2).
<b><i>“house of bondage.”</i></b> This is the Torah’s first instance of this famous phrase, a depiction of Egypt that foreshadows the Decalogue (20:2). Literally a “house of slaves,” it envisions all Egypt as one large slave quarters. Ancient workers’ villages found in Egypt show that historically, laborers were housed in segregated areas near their building projects and given provisions according to their skills and the difficulty of their labor.

Verse 4



Verse 5

<b><i>fathers.</i></b> See at Deuteronomy 4:31.

Verse 6



Verse 7



Verse 8



Verse 9

<b><i>“sign…reminder”</i></b> Here and in other passages (see Deuteronomy 6:8; 11:18; Proverbs 6:20–21; 7:1–3) this sort of language refers metaphorically to the way certain ritual practices memorialize the Exodus experience. In late antiquity, some Jewish authorities understood this language literally, as referring to the wearing of <i>t’fillin</i> (phylacteries) on the hand and head. (See also at v. 16 and Deuteronomy 6:8.)

Verse 10



Verse 11



Verse 12



Verse 13



Verse 14



Verse 15

<b><i>“redeem every male first-born among my children.”</i></b> Although animals are to be sacrificed to God, sons are to be redeemed by monetary means (Numbers 18:16) since human sacrifice is not tolerated. | This verse, together with Numbers 3:13 and 18:16, provide the biblical background for the Jewish ceremony of <i>pidyon haben:</i> on the thirty-first day after his birth, the parents redeem their first-born son, usually with silver coins, from a <i>kohein</i> (priest). Following v. 2, above, this ceremony is performed only if the son is the first issue of his mother’s womb. Thus, exempt from redemption is a first-born son delivered by caesarean section, or a first-born son to a mother who had previously given birth to a daughter, or who had miscarried.

Verse 16

<b><i>“symbol.”</i></b> Heb. <i>totafot;</i> the term’s meaning is uncertain, but the context indicates that it refers to an amulet (an object thought to provide spiritual protection) worn “between the eyes” (that is, on the forehead). While some have attempted to connect <i>t’fillin</i> with specifically female ornaments or amulets, there is ample evidence that in the ancient Near East and Egypt both women and men wore forehead ornaments both for protection and for decoration. <i>T’fillin</i> are to serve as another type of reminder of the might of God and the redemption from Egypt.

Verse 17

<i>Departing from Egypt</i> (13:17–22)
This parashah continues the account of the journey away from Egypt and into the wilderness that began in 12:37–42. God’s involvement is apparent from the outset: God chooses the route, and God’s presence as manifest in pillars of cloud and fire leads the people as they travel. Moses’ role as human leader—so prominent in negotiations with the pharaoh that were featured in the previous three Torah portions—now gives way to divine leadership.
<b><i>way of the land of the Philistines.</i></b> This phrase refers to the coastal route from Egypt to Israel. The route derives its name from the Philistines, who settled the southern coast of Canaan in the early 12th century <small>B.C.E.</small> As such, it is anachronistic as a reference to the earlier migration from Egypt that this story is recounting.
<i><b>war.</b></i> This is perhaps a reference to the militarized way stations on the heavily traveled coastal route.

Verse 18

<b><i>by way of the wilderness at the Sea of Reeds.</i></b> This designates a more circuitous and difficult route. “Sea of Reeds” (or “Reed Sea”) is a literal translation of <i>yam suf</i> and almost certainly does not refer to the Red Sea. It is a descriptive term for a body of water with an abundance of reedy plants rather than the designation of a specific sea. Attempts to identify the sea have proved fruitless, for this is an impressionistic recollection of escape rather than an accurate accounting of geographic places.

Verse 19

<b><i>bones of Joseph.</i></b> The Israelites comply with Joseph’s deathbed request that his bones be buried in Israel (Genesis 50:24–26), thus making the Sinai journey a funeral procession as well as a trek to freedom.

Verse 20

<b><i>set out…encamped.</i></b> Formulaic language—departing from <i>place A</i> and arriving at <i>place B</i>—introduces the second of what will be twelve stages of the wilderness journey. The symbolic number twelve suggests a set number of places and thus a purposeful journey rather than a period of random wandering. Most of the places mentioned in the account of the wilderness journey have not been firmly identified—nor is it likely that they ever will be, for the names have been gathered from various sources, or even invented by the storyteller, to give a sense of reality to the dimly remembered recollections of the journey.

Verse 21

<b><i>pillar of cloud…pillar of fire.</i></b> Similar to signals that caravans use, these pillars represent God’s presence. This imagery will recur in the account of the Tabernacle (Exodus 33:9–10) and elsewhere in the Torah (see 16:10).

Chapter 14



Verse 1

<i>Crossing the Sea</i> (14:1–31)
The sea crossing is set forth in three prose sections, each introduced by “יהוה said to Moses” (vv. 1, 15, 26). The literary structure thus emphasizes God’s control of what happens.
EGYPTIAN PURSUIT (14:1–14)
Having reached Etham, the Israelites are told to backtrack so that the pharaoh will think they are lost, thus setting the stage for one last appearance of the motif of the hardening of Pharaoh’s heart. The Egyptians will attempt to capture the fleeing and frightened Israelites, but they will fail because of God’s spectacular intervention.

Verse 2



Verse 3



Verse 4

<b><i>gain glory.</i></b> The Heb. root is <i>k-b-d</i>, language that provides a sense of irony, for the “hardening” of the pharaoh’s heart sometimes uses the same root (see at 10:1). The action caused by the Egyptian ruler’s fateful stubbornness thus portends an event that will magnify God.
<i><b>Egyptians shall know that I am</b></i> <b>יהוה</b>. Acknowledging the existence, and sometimes the supremacy, of Israel’s God is a recurring theme of the Exodus account (see 5:2 and 10:2).

Verse 5



Verse 6



Verse 7

<b><i>picked chariots…the rest of the chariots.</i></b> Given the elite nature of a chariot corps, such detail highlights the enormous social and military distance between the pursuers and their prey.

Verse 8

<b><i>defiantly.</i></b> Literally “with hand [held] high,” this is an allusion to having an uplifted weapon. Thus it is an image of defiance.

Verse 9



Verse 10



Verse 11

<b><i>11–12.</i></b> The terrified Israelites pose three rhetorical questions, imbued with biting sarcasm.
Their outcry is less a lack of faith in God than a sign of human anguish in the face of the perceived threat of death in the wilderness.

Verse 12



Verse 13

<b><i>“Have no fear! Stand by, and witness the deliverance.”</i></b> The people’s three questions elicit three reassuring imperatives. The language here is used in military contexts to calm troops before battle and to denote battle readiness (see Deuteronomy 20:3; Joshua 10:25).

Verse 14

 <b><i>“</i>יהוה</b> <i><b>will battle for you,”</b></i> Moses’ resolute and reassuring response introduces the “divine warrior” theme. Drawn from Canaanite mythology, the image of God doing battle with Israel’s foes is a powerful expression of divine might and one of the most masculine biblical metaphors applied to God (see at 15:3). Military language suffuses the depiction of God’s involvement in delivering the people.

Verse 15

SPLITTING OF THE SEA (14:15–25) The sea event takes the narrative to a new level. The signs and wonders performed in Egypt are intense versions of natural devastation, and the horrific slaying of the first-born is a counterpoint to the earlier Egyptian infanticide and an etiology for various Israelite rituals. But the splitting of the sea lies in the realm of cosmic battle.

Verse 16

<b><i>“your rod”</i></b> Moses’ staff is a symbol of authority and an instrument of magical acts (see 4:2–3, 17).

Verse 17



Verse 18



Verse 19

<b><i>angel of God.</i></b> The narrator has not previously mentioned this divine messenger (compare 3:2), who appears to have been leading the Israelites along with the pillar of cloud, which contains God’s presence (13:21). Both shift to the rear, forming a protective shield between the people and the advancing Egyptians (v. 20).

Verse 20



Verse 21

<b><i>his arm.</i></b> The narrative now refers to Moses’ arm only and not his rod (compare v. 16).
<i><b>east wind.</b></i> Winds from the east, known today by the Arabic term <i>chamsin,</i> are notorious in the Levant for their suffocatingly hot gusts.

Verse 22



Verse 23



Verse 24



Verse 25



Verse 26

REJOINING OF THE WATERS (14:26–31) The restoration of the divided waters brings deliverance for the Israelites but death for the Egyptian army.

Verse 27



Verse 28

<b><i>not one of them remained.</i></b> Taken literally, the complete annihilation of the Egyptian army seems excessive and tragic. However, the story is more likely a literary way to emphasize divine might and God’s concern for the oppressed. Realizing that it is not a historical record of the complete slaughter of many thousands of Egyptians partially ameliorates our modern revulsion at so many deaths. Yet we still must confront the reality of a tradition that recounts and even celebrates this extensive loss of human lives. (See the introduction to 11:1–10).

Verse 29



Verse 30



Verse 31

<b><i>wondrous power.</i></b> Literally, “great hand (or: arm).” This translation masks the use of corporeal language for conveying divine might. God’s arm, not Moses’, becomes the instrument of destruction.
<i><b>had faith.</b></i> The Hebrew word denotes trust rather than belief.

Chapter 15



Verse 1

<i>Celebrating Deliverance</i> (15:1–21)
Most scholars understand the poetic celebration of Israel’s miraculous rescue from the Egyptians to be a very ancient poem, dating to the late 12th or early 11th century <small>B.C.E.</small>—much older than the somewhat different prose account that precedes it. In form and content, the poetry draws from the mythological epics of ancient Canaan, in which the heroic deity Baal conquers the primordial forces of chaos, represented by surging waters, so that order can be established. The military imagery of that cosmic battle is echoed and historicized in the Song at the Sea <i>(Shirat HaYam),</i> in which the natural elements—water and wind—become God’s weapons against human enemies. The miracle of deliverance is captured in exuberant language, making this passage the thematic centerpiece of Exodus.
Thus far the narrative movement of the book has taken us toward God’s holy mountain, first mentioned in 3:1 and now again at the end of this poem (see also 3:12 and 4:27); most of the rest of Exodus focuses on God’s revelation at this mountain. On its location, see at 18:5.
The poetic account of victory at the sea appears in two segments, a longer version (vv. 1–18, with a prose frame in vv. 1 and 19) followed by a much briefer version (v. 21, with a prose introduction in v. 20). On biblical poetry, see at Deuteronomy 32:1–43.
SONG AT THE SEA (15:1–19)
Many modern scholars conclude that the Song was created and performed by women. Beginning in the mid-20th century, a considerable body of literary, historical, sociological, and musicological evidence has been amassed to suggest that the Song should be attributed to Miriam. For example, one ancient manuscript tradition calls it the Song of Miriam. Also, songs of military triumph belong to a victory song genre typically composed and performed by women—not men—to greet victorious troops after battle (see at 15:20). Thus, the title “Song of Miriam” that is often used by modern scholars and interpreters for v. 21 might in fact be appropriate for this passage as well.
<i><b>I. Moses…sang this song.</b></i> The prose introduction mentions Moses, the chief human protagonist of the Exodus narrative, as the performer of the Song, along with the people. Hence it has traditionally been assumed that Moses is the author of the Song. Why would a woman’s composition (see previous comment) be attributed to a man? Perhaps the centrality of Moses to the Exodus story meant that authorship of this hymnic masterpiece accrued to him.
<i><b>I will sing to</b></i> <b>יהוה.</b> Directed to God alone, human agency in the victory over the enemy disappears; neither Moses’ rod nor outstretched arms, both prominent in the prose account (14:16, 21, 26–27), appear in the poem.
<i><b>He.</b></i> On the palpable masculinity of the poetic figure employed in vv. 1–4, see at v. 3, below.

Verse 2

 <b>יהוה <i>…deliverance.</i></b> The first part of this verse is also found in Isaiah 12:2 and Psalm 118:14, suggesting a liturgical use of this resounding affirmation of God’s power to save those in need.
<i><b>enshrine.</b></i> This term may allude to the building of an abode (shrine) for God, a project to which much of the second half of Exodus is devoted. However, because the poetry places it in parallel with “exalt,” the Hebrew term might better be translated “glorify.” <i><b>ancestors.</b></i> Heb. <i>av,</i> which is sometimes translated “father.” Yet here it does not refer to the poet’s biological male parent; rather, it alludes to the ancestors of Genesis as a collective (see also Exodus 3:13, 15, 16; 4:5; 13:5, 11). The inclusive term “ancestor” best represents the poet’s claim that the deity celebrated for deliverance at the sea is the same as the One who appeared to earlier generations.

Verse 3

<b><i>the Warrior.</i></b> As one of the most strikingly male metaphors applied to God in the Bible, this term signifies divine power and asserts that human military victories must be attributed to God. It contributes to our contemporary notion that the biblical deity is male. However, although warriors were understood to be male, this imagery does not mean that the Torah’s composer(s) believed God to be a male being. Note that female imagery for God also occasionally appears in the Bible, including in Exodus (see at 16:4, 19:4; Numbers 11:12; Deuteronomy 32:13, 18). In Isaiah 42:13–14, the image of God as a warrior is juxtaposed with the image of God as a woman in labor. The prophet uses both metaphors to convince the people of God’s power.

Verse 4



Verse 5

<b><i>The deeps.</i></b> Heb. <i>t’homot,</i> the plural of <i>t’hom,</i> the deep waters of Genesis 1:2. This mention echoes the name of the Babylonian goddess Tiamat and represents primeval water and chaos.

Verse 6

<b><i>right hand…shatters.</i></b> This image depicts God’s military might, for the right hand is the one used for holding a weapon in Near Eastern mythology.

Verse 7



Verse 8

<b><i>blast of Your nostrils.</i></b> Although God’s flared nose usually means hot anger, here the anthropomorphic language for God depicts the ferocious winds that will reconfigure the waters.

Verse 9

<b><i>“I will divide the spoil.”</i></b> An incentive for battle is often the booty gathered by the victors. This phrase probably implies the taking of humans as well as goods, since conquering soldiers took nubile women as spoil (see Judges 5:30). Young female captives were especially prized for their reproductive and labor potential, for the mortality rates for women due to death in childbirth meant a shortage of wives. (See at Deuteronomy 21:10–14.)

Verse 10



Verse 11

 <b><i>Who is like You,</i> יהוה, <i>…?</i></b> The proclamation of the incomparability of God is expressed in a resounding rhetorical question that has become part of daily Jewish liturgy and is known as the <i>Mi Chamochah.</i> The uniqueness of God flows from the divine might exemplified by the deliverance at the sea.
<i><b>among the celestials.</b></i> The very declaration of uniqueness is witness to a polytheistic world: God is unique among the “celestials,” a somewhat misleading translation of a word that means “gods.” Because true monotheism did not emerge in ancient Israel until the 6th century <small>B.C.E.</small>, this verse may well reflect an earlier period in which the existence of other divine beings was assumed. The reference to other gods also may denote the lesser heavenly beings, or “hosts,” that were part of ancient Israel’s understanding of divinity (see at Deuteronomy 6:4; Isaiah 3:1; Jeremiah 5:14; Zechariah 1:3).

Verse 12



Verse 13

<b><i>love.</i></b> Heb. <i>chesed,</i> a relational term. When applied to God, it indicates God’s utter commitment and kindness to Israel. (See at Deuteronomy 7:12.)
<i><b>holy abode.</b></i> Although some understand this to be a reference to the Jerusalem temple and thus consider the Song a composition of the monarchic period (beginning in the 10th century), the mythic nature of the hymn makes it more likely that “holy abode” refers to God’s heavenly habitation. The Israelites, like their Canaanite neighbors, imagined a divine abode in heaven that became the model for God’s earthly dwellings, the Tabernacle and the Temple (see at v. 17 and 25:9).

Verse 14

<b><i>14–15. dwellers in Philistia…Edom…Moab…Canaan.</i></b> These four groups of people represent the Israelites’ early enemies. The Song serves as a warning to them, anticipating or reflecting Israel’s early struggles in the Promised Land.

Verse 15



Verse 16

<b><i>ransomed.</i></b> A better translation would be “created.” The root <i>k-n-h</i> can mean “to acquire” (hence “ransomed”; compare “redeemed” in v. 13) or “to create.” It was used when Eve, the archetypal mother, gave birth to her first child (Genesis 4:1), thus linking childbirth with divine creativity.

Verse 17

<b><i>Your own mountain…The sanctuary…which Your hands established.</i></b> This verse reflects mythic language for God’s sacred mountain and indicates that God has a hands-on role in the construction of this sanctuary. Like v. 13, the passage refers to God’s imagined dwelling in the heavens.

Verse 18

<b><i>reign.</i></b> The exultant closing line of the poem applies another masculine metaphor to God: kingship, an image commonly employed for deities in ancient Near Eastern literature (see at Deuteronomy 33:5).

Verse 19



Verse 20

SONG OF MIRIAM (15:20–21) Preceded by a prose introduction (v. 20), the single stanza of v. 21 is known in contemporary parlance as the Song of Miriam. This poetic verse is likely the title of the full poem, suggesting that the victory song in vv. 1–19 may have been composed by a woman (see at v. 1).
<b><i>Miriam the prophet.</i></b> Unnamed in Moses’ birth narrative (2:4, 7–9), the woman mentioned in more biblical books (five) than any other female figure finally gets a name. She also gets a title, one that never appears for Moses in the book of Exodus. Miriam is the first of several biblical women—including Deborah (Judges 4:4), Huldah (II Kings 22:14), and Noadiah (Nehemiah 6:14)—to bear the title of prophet. The authority of prophets as conveyors of God’s will to the people was gender inclusive both in the biblical world and in other parts of the ancient Near East. The 8th-century-<small>B.C.E.</small> prophet Micah acknowledges Miriam’s leading role in the Exodus when he proclaims in God’s name that to deliver Israel, “I sent you Moses, Aaron, and Miriam” (Micah 6:4). In the present verse, Miriam appears also as a singer and a leader of other singing women, a role familiar from other biblical texts and ancient cultures.
<i><b>hand-drum.</b></i> This translation of <i>tof</i> is more appropriate than either the anachronistic “tambourine” or the vague “timbrel” that appears in many English translations; tambourines are not attested until the Roman period, more than a thousand years later. The hand-drum, or frame-drum, is the only percussion instrument mentioned in the Bible, in contrast to other classes of instruments (such as string and wind instruments) for which there are many examples. Archeological evidence—such as terracotta statuettes of women (never men) playing the frame-drum—indicates that this was largely a woman’s instrument. Thus, the mention of instrumental ensembles, including the frame-drum in other biblical texts (such as Psalm 150), suggests the presence of female musicians. Because of the rhythmic nature of ancient Hebrew music, drum playing —by women—would have been an essential part of most musical performances.
<i><b>all the women.</b></i> It was apparently customary in ancient Israel for women to welcome victorious armies with victory songs (see Judges 11:34; I Samuel 18:6–7). Accomplished female musicians would have earned the esteem of their community. Also, groups of female performers likely would have met together to practice their instruments and compose songs for specific occasions, which would have provided occasions for female bonding and for women to exert organizational skills and mentor younger performers.
<i><b>dance.</b></i> Along with singing and drum playing, dance was an integral part of this performance genre. It is likely that most musical performances in the biblical world involved movement as well as vocal and instrumental expression (see Psalms 149:3; 150:4).

Verse 21



Verse 22

<i>Journeying in the wilderness</i> (15:22–17:16)
No sooner do the Israelites safely cross the sea than they are confronted with two universal problems of community survival. The first concerns sustenance: how will they secure enough to eat and drink? The second concerns safety: how will they deal with military threats? The provision of food and water and the protection from enemies signal God’s beneficent presence. The deliverance from Egypt was depicted largely in masculine imagery—with God portrayed, for example, as a warrior defeating Israel’s enemies. Now we come to accounts of divine resolution of food and water problems; arguably these episodes portray God with female imagery, insofar as women in ancient Israel were the ones who frequently drew water (see Genesis 24:11 and Exodus 2:16) and nearly always provided food.
WATER CRISIS (15:22–27)
The trust in God and Moses established by the sea episode (14:31) gives way to bitter complaints in the face of life-threatening thirst.

Verse 23

<b><i>Marah.</i></b> Like other places named in this parashah, this is an unknown locale and probably not a real place. Instead, its name, meaning “bitterness,” indicates what happens there. In addition, the name connects the bitterness of wandering with the bitterness of work in Egypt (1:14), which the bitter herbs of the Passover ritual commemorate (12:8).

Verse 24



Verse 25

<b><i>piece of wood…the water became sweet.</i></b> What might nowadays be considered magic and thus superstition was believed to be efficacious in the biblical world. Judging from Palestinian folklore, throwing wood into water may be akin to a modern European homeopathic procedure: a piece of wood with bitter-tasting bark removes the bitterness of impotable water.
<b><i>test.</i></b> The theme of testing appears in all the food and water crises in this parashah.

Verse 26

<b><i>I יהוה am your healer.</i></b> God as healer may evoke images of women as well as men as practitioners of folk medicine. Because women in ancient Israel prepared food and kept herb gardens, they possessed knowledge about the specific properties of various plant substances used in folk medicine.

Chapter 16



Verse 1

FOOD CRISIS (16:1–36) The next stage of the trek across Sinai is marked by food shortages, which are resolved by the provision of manna and quail in this somewhat repetitive narrative. The testing motif recurs, the complaining persists, and a strange ritual involving the manna is recounted.
<b><i>wilderness of Sin.</i></b> The place name Sin (unrelated to the English noun “sin”) may be an alternative form of Sinai.

Verse 2

<b><i>grumbled.</i></b> This word of complaint occurs repeatedly in 16:1–12. The frequent use of “grumble” may be the narrator’s way of expressing the intensity of the people’s dissatisfaction with their lot.

Verse 3

<b><i>“our fill of bread”</i></b> Cereal products were so central to the diet of people in ancient Israel—providing approximately half of their daily caloric in take—that the Bible uses the term for bread (<i>lechem</i>) sometimes to denote food more generally. Close examination of biblical texts mentioning bread production, and consideration of relevant archeological and ethnographic data, together indicate that women were the producers of bread in households in the Land of Israel. In an arduous series of operations—grinding, sifting, kneading, baking (which involved collecting wood and building fires)—taking several hours every day, women transformed grain into bread. This complex process was essential because human beings cannot digest the endosperm surrounding the grain nor the grains’ nutritional starch in raw form. On women and bread-baking, see also at 11:5, 12:8, and Leviticus 26:26.

Verse 4

<b><i>“I will rain down bread.”</i></b> In miraculously producing “bread” from on high, God assumes the female role of bread producer.

Verse 14



Verse 15

<b><i>“What is it?”</i></b> The Hebrew words of this question <i>(man hu</i>) provide a folk etymology for the term by which the bread from heaven will be known: <i>man</i> (“manna”) (v. 31).

<b><i>eifah.</i></b> This seems to have been the most common dry measure in ancient Israel, yet its exact capacity is not known; perhaps it was between ten and twenty liters.

Chapter 17



Verse 1

ANOTHER WATER CRISIS (17:1–7) Again the people claim they have nothing to drink, and Moses magically produces water by striking a rock. Sufficient water was a persistent problem in ancient Israel. Thus, it is no wonder that two water crises appear in succession. This incident appears in other biblical books (such as Deuteronomy 33:8; Psalm 95:7–8) as an important example of how God provides for the people—and also as an illustration of the people’s lack of trust that God will do so.
<b><i>Rephidim.</i></b> Because this place name is from a verb meaning “to help, support,” it is probably not a real place name but rather a name that symbolizes what is said to happen there: God helps Israel with water. (Also, in the next episode—which takes place at this same locale—Moses receives support for his arms so as to effect military victory; see vv. 8, 12.)

Verse 2



Verse 3

<b><i>“us and our children and livestock.”</i></b> That woman are not listed separately indicates that they are part of “the people” registering the complaint. Clearly they have a voice in life-and-death matters affecting the community.

Verse 4



Verse 5

<b><i>“rod with which you struck the Nile”</i></b> Note the irony; the rod that had magically made the Nile undrinkable (7:14–24) will now provide potable water.

Verse 6

<b><i>“Horeb.”</i></b> This is another name for Sinai (see 3:1, 12), perhaps reflecting a separate a separate narrative tradition.

Verse 7

<b><i>Massah and Meribah</i></b>. Like so many of the places on the wilderness trek, these terms, meaning “Test” and “Quarrel” are probably symbolic rather than geographical names.
<i><b>“Is</b></i> <b>יהוה</b> <i><b>present…?”</b></i> This agonizing query reveals a fundamental conundrum regarding the concept of divine presence is equated with the provision of food and water (see for example, 16:4–7), thirst and hunger seem to mean divine absence. (The same issue arises in the next episode regarding protection from enemies; military defeat would seem to indicate divine absence.) How can these facts be reconciled with the notion that God is everywhere? (See also, Another View)

Verse 8

MILITARY CRISIS (17:8–16) The protective aspect of divine presence becomes immediately apparent in the confrontation with the Amalekites, who are defeated as long as Moses holds high his magical staff.
<b><i>Amalek.</i></b> The Amalekites are traditional enemies of the Israelites, especially in the premonarchic era. That they are also related to the Israelites—Amalek is a grandson of Esau (Genesis 36:11–12)—makes their traditional enmity all the more tragic.
<b><i>Rephidim.</i></b> See at v. 1.

Verse 9

<b><i>Joshua.</i></b> This is the first appearance of Moses’ eventual successor.

Verse 10

<b><i>Hur.</i></b> Along with Moses And Aaron, Hur is part of a triumvirate presented as Israel’s leaders in the wilderness (see 24:14).

Verse 11



Verse 12



Verse 13



Verse 14

<b><i>“Inscribe this…as a reminder…and read it aloud.”</i></b> This is the first explicit reference in the Bible to documents and to literacy. It takes for granted that Moses knew how to both read and write—the latter being a more elite skill in the ancient world.
<i><b>“utterly blot out the memory.”</b></i> The total destruction of Amalek will not only be genocidal but will also preclude existence in memory. Thus is harsh and troubling language for expressing divine power.

Verse 15



Verse 16

 <b><i>“‘Hand upon the throne of</i> יהוה</b><i><b>!’”</b></i> Or, according to a frequent emendation of the text, “…the banner of יהוה (<i>nes</i> יהוה).” Either way, this etiology for the altar’s name, Adonai-Nissi, is probably an ancient oath; it would be like swearing in God’s name. Oaths in the biblical world were sworn while placing one’s hand in a significant place.
<b><i>“throughout the ages.”</i></b> If Amalek symbolizes Israel’s enemies, this notice acknowledges the sad fact that military crises will always be part of Israelite life. With war in the ancient Near East being waged almost entirely by men, to the extent that the Bible is concerned for Israel’s security it not surprisingly focuses on male characters, with little attention given to the lives of women.

Chapter 18



Verse 1

<i>Jethro’s Advice to Moses</i> (18:1–27)
Moses’ Midianite father-in-law, Jethro, joins the Israelites at Sinai and advises Moses how to create a system for resolving internal disputes. This passage serves as a transition between the liberation from Egypt and the revelation of God’s teachings. The positive relations between Israelite and non-Israelite at the start of this parashah stand in direct contrast to the conclusion of the preceding parashah, which expresses permanent hostility toward Amalek (17:16). The desire to contrast “good gentile” with “bad gentile” may have dictated the placement of this episode.
JETHRO, ZIPPORAH, AND SONS WITH MOSES AT SINAI (18:1–12)
<b><i>Jethro.</i></b> Moses’ father-in-law is referred to elsewhere as Jether (4:18), Hobab (Numbers 10:29; Judges 4:11), and Reuel (Exodus 2:18), though the latter may be the name of Jethro’s father.

Verse 2

<b><i>So Jethro…took Zipporah…after she had been sent home.</i></b> The narration implies that Moses’ wife and children were living in Midian while Moses returned to Egypt to free the Israelites. Yet no notice was given earlier that Zipporah and her sons were dispatched back to Midian. When last we encountered Zipporah, she was traveling with Moses and her sons from Midian to Egypt (4:20). On the way, she saved her family by circumcising her son, the mysterious “bridegroom of blood” incident (4:24–26).
<i><b>sent home.</b></i> The Hebrew verb here can mean divorce, so some interpreters claim that Moses had divorced her; yet this explanation is not persuasive since Jethro refers to her as Moses’ wife in v. 6. The reason for the separation is not explained.

Verse 3



Verse 4

<b><i>Eliezer.</i></b> While Gershom’s birth is mentioned in 2:22, this is the first explicit reference to Eliezer, although 4:20 alludes to him.
<i><b>meaning.</b></i> In the Torah, the explanation of a name by the mother or father is a standard feature of the birth of sons, but never of daughters. This may be due to the patrilineal nature of Israelite society: the names of boys often become clan and tribal names, while girls’ names did not.
<i><b>“My ancestors’.”</b></i> Heb. <i>avi,</i> literally “my father’s.” On the gender-inclusive sense, see at 15:2.

Verse 5

<b><i>the mountain of God.</i></b> Several passages in the Torah refer to this mountain as Sinai, while others call it Horeb (see 3:1). One explanation is that two different traditions existed about the name of this mountain; another possibility is that the term Horeb should be understood as the name of the larger region, while “wilderness of Sinai” and “Mount Sinai” refer to a specific area or peak in the boundaries of Horeb. People have long sought to locate this mountain, identifying it with Jebel Musa or other particular mountains in the Sinai Peninsula or northwestern Arabia. However, such efforts seem to misconstrue the way the Bible presents Sinai as a phenomenon that transcends space and time (Carol Meyers, <i>Exodus,</i> 2005, p. 144).

Verse 6



Verse 7

<b><i>he bowed low and kissed him.</i></b> Moses, acting as the host, warmly greets his father-in-law; but no mention is made of him welcoming his wife and sons. This imbalance may reflect the formal hospitality customs common in the biblical world. Or, rather than suggesting the neglect of his family, this may stem from the Torah’s intent to highlight Moses’ remarkable relations with his Midianite father-in-law.

Verse 13

JETHRO RECOMMENDS DELEGATING JUDICIAL AUTHORITY (18:13–27) After noticing the cumbersome and inefficient nature of Moses’ role as the sole judge of the people, Jethro makes a suggestion. Deuteronomy’s version of this episode omits Jethro’s role (Deuteronomy 1:9–18), which is hardly surprising since ascribing Israel’s judiciary structure to a foreigner is quite remarkable.

Verse 21

<b><i>chiefs.</i></b> Heb. <i>sarim,</i> meaning officers with a range of administrative duties. The judicial system outlined by Jethro is hierarchical and quasi-military, which makes sense since Israel’s organization in the wilderness is most akin to a military formation. The noun “judge” <i>(shofet)</i> is not used in this passage. While presumably women were excluded from such leadership positions, Judges 4–5 records that Deborah served as a judge and prophet.

Chapter 19



Verse 1

<i>Preparing for the Covenant and Divine Revelation</i> (19:1–25)
The encounter at Sinai forms the literary and ideological heart of the Torah. Israel’s experience at “God’s mountain” is presented as the determining factor in its spiritual and national identity. It is here that God proposes and Israel accepts the covenant (<i>b’rit</i>) that creates a legal and binding relationship between a people and its deity, a relationship not found elsewhere in the ancient world. This covenant also serves to bind individuals into a nation, for Israel’s communal acceptance of the terms of the covenant (19:9) imposes upon the people collective rewards and punishments (Leviticus 26; Deuteronomy 28).
ARRIVING AT SINAI (19:1–2)
This passage marks the Israelites’ arrival in the wilderness of Sinai. According to Numbers 10:11–12, they remain there for nearly a year before briefly resuming their journey to the Promised Land.

Verse 2



Verse 3

GOD PROPOSES A COVENANT AND ISRAEL ACCEPTS (19:3–8)
In contrast to the unconditional covenant with the ancestors in Genesis, the Sinai covenant requires the people to adhere to certain stipulations in order to receive God’s promised benefactions. The people enthusiastically accept God’s covenantal offer, although the exact terms of the covenant remain unspecified until Exodus 20–23.

Verse 4

<b><i>“I bore you on eagles’ wings.”</i></b> Whereas the prior parashah contains a number of masculine images of God (see at 14:14; 15:3, 18) and possibly some female divine imagery (see at 15:26; 16:4; and the introduction to 15:22–17:16), here we find God depicted as an eagle, a metaphor that evokes the way this majestic bird protectively carries its young while training them to fly.

Verse 5

<b><i>“treasured possession.”</i></b> Heb. <i>s’gulah,</i> which normally refers to a private accumulation of valuable property (see Ecclesiastes 2:8). While this universal deity could potentially claim possession of any nation on earth, God chooses Israel as a personal treasure. The notion of Israel’s exclusive relationship with God—found here and in the subsequent verse—is problematic for many modern readers. However, in the polytheistic world of the ancient Near East, it was assumed that a deity would have a special connection to a single people.

Verse 6

<b><i>“you shall be to Me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.”</i></b> These words clarify Israel’s unique role as God’s covenant partner. The words “kingdom” and “nation” express the idea that national autonomy and ethnic distinctiveness are essential for the fulfillment of Israel’s mission. Further, just as the priests devote their lives to the service of the Divine and convey God’s will to the people, so Israel is to assume this role among the nations. The word “holy” (<i>kadosh</i>) designates that which is set apart from the profane or ordinary. (For more on biblical notions of holiness, see <i>parashat K’doshim.)</i>

Verse 7



Verse 8

<b><i>All those assembled.</i></b> The presence of women in the <i>am</i> (usually construed as “people”) is not explicitly indicated by the text. Other public occasions where the Law is read, or covenants are made, expressly indicate the presence of women (Deuteronomy 31:9–13; Joshua 8:35; perhaps II Kings 23:2; Nehemiah 8:2–3). This is not the case at Sinai. However, since the event at Sinai represents the paradigmatic revelation to the Israelite nation, it seems unlikely that women would have been excluded.

Verse 9

PREPARING FOR THE DIVINE REVELATION (19:9–25) In this passage, the people prepare for God’s self-manifestation, which is commonly associated with storm imagery (see Judges 5:4–5; Isaiah 29:6; 30:30; Nahum 1:3–6; Psalm 18:7–17). Here and in 20:15, the sight of lightning, dense clouds, and smoke, along with the sound of thunder and blaring horns, herald God’s awesome revelation.

Verse 10

<b><i>“Go to the people and warn them to stay pure.”</i></b> God instructs Moses to make sure that the people are in a pure state, expressed here by the root <i>k-d-sh,</i> “holy.” Although this verse focuses only on washing clothes, other passages specify that attaining a physically holy state also involves washing oneself as well as avoiding sexual relations and contact with impurities (see at Leviticus 12–15; 17:15).

Verse 11



Verse 12



Verse 13



Verse 14



Verse 15

 <i><b>“</b></i>[<i><b>the men among</b></i>] <i><b>you should not go near a woman.”</b></i> In vv. 14–15, Moses implements the instructions received in vv. 10–13. He repeats God’s charge to the Israelites to stay pure and launder their clothes, while he adds the command not to approach a woman. The prohibition seems to concern sexual intercourse (based on how the synonymous verb <i>k-r-v</i> is used in Leviticus 18:14; 20:16; Deuteronomy 22:14; Isaiah 8:3). According to Leviticus 15:18, sexual intercourse renders both parties ritually impure, so that they may not have access to the Sanctuary or objects deemed holy. By specifying a common action that would preclude individuals from participation in the sacred event of revelation, Moses amplifies God’s directions to ensure the purity of the people.
The present translation inserts the phrase “[the men among]” in order to show that although the inclusion of women is generally assumed, in this particular verse the imperative must be addressed to men.
Some scholars infer from this that Moses spoke only to the men; they argue that if women were included in the covenant community, Moses would have phrased his warning in mutual terms, something akin to: “Men and women do not go near each other.” However, this suggestion can be challenged by the fact that biblical Hebrew rarely addresses sexual relations in mutual terms. Instead, references to sexual relations usually contain a masculine subject and a female object: a man “knows” a woman, “lies” or “lies with” her, “approaches” her, or “comes to” her. This language presents the male as the active figure and the female as the passive party. Although this linguistic pattern is problematic for contemporary readers, it means that the address to men in this verse cannot be used to argue that women were excluded from the revelation at Sinai. (See also Another View and Contemporary Reflection.)

Verse 16



Verse 17



Verse 18



Verse 19

<b><i>in thunder.</i></b> Heb. <i>b’kol</i>, literally “in a voice,” is enigmatic. The identification of God’s “voice” with thunder is found in several biblical passages (Psalm 18:14; 29:3); however, since the focus here is on God’s discourse with Moses and Israel, “voice” is the more likely meaning. The content of Moses’ conversation with God is unclear. Some commentators think that this verse refers to the Decalogue, while others identify it with God’s instructions to Moses in vv. 21–22.
  * This accent pattern for the Decalogue is the that is customarily used for private study. (Masoretic tradition also includes an accent pattern that is used for public reading.) Verses are numbered according to a modern convention.

Chapter 20



Verse 1

<i>The Decalogue (“Ten Commandments”)</i> (20:1–14)
The unique status of the Decalogue is due to the tradition, found in the framework of Exodus 19–20 and Deuteronomy 4–5, that God recited these rules directly to the people, without the mediation of Moses. Only after the last commandment do the people demand Moses’ intervention because they dread the terrifying display of divine power.
While Exodus 19–20 does not provide a specific title for this group of precepts, the label “Ten Words” <i>(aseret had’varim)</i> is found elsewhere (34:28; Deuteronomy 4:13; 10:4). The ancient Jewish Greek-speaking community in Egypt translated that Hebrew phrase as <i>deka logoi</i> (“ten words”), resulting in the alternative English name “Decalogue.” The more common English title “Ten Commandments” is somewhat misleading since the Torah itself does not use the term “commandment” (<i>mitzvah</i>) in conjunction with this passage, nor is it clear that every one of its utterances constitutes a command (see at v. 2). Likewise, uncertainty exists as to how to divide these verses into ten discrete commandments. Verse 3 may be grouped with v. 2 or with vv. 4–5, while the prohibition against coveting in v. 14 may be considered a single law or two distinct commandments.
This passage has no specific target audience (such as priests or judges); nor does it refer to any societal institution (like kingship or the Temple) or any specific historical context (though v. 12 may reflect Israel’s residence in Canaan). Reward for adherence is mentioned only once (v. 12), while punishments are largely omitted (except for v. 5). Recognition of divine authority and of prior acts of redemption, established in v. 2, seems to be the primary motivating factor for obeying these stipulations.
Exodus 20:2–14 consistently uses the second-person singular, perhaps to impress upon the audience their obligation as individuals to adhere to these teachings. Because the language of address is grammatically masculine, one might infer that these regulations address only men. However, in biblical Hebrew, masculine grammatical form does not specify social gender unless it is used to refer to a definite, particular person. So-called masculine forms often have a gender-neutral function. (See, for example, Deuteronomy 28:68, where masculine singular address at the start of the verse is equivalent to both masculine and feminine plurals at the end of the verse.) Therefore, the Decalogue’s masculine singular address does not necessarily mean that only men were addressed. (See further at Exodus 21:2; <i>Mishpatim,</i> Another View.)
The Torah later records that God also engraved the “Ten Words” upon two stone tablets, which Moses received on the top of Mount Sinai (31:18; Deuteronomy 4:13). Furthermore, these tablets were to be deposited in the Ark of the Covenant, which was to be placed in the “Holy of Holies” of the Tabernacle (25:16). This is akin to the ancient Near Eastern practice of storing a treaty document in the sanctuary of a temple so that the deity could serve as the guardian of its implementation. The medium of stone, as opposed to parchment or papyrus, underlines the permanent validity of these precepts.
INTRODUCTION (20:1)
This verse establishes that God speaks the Decalogue directly to the people. In contrast, the precepts that follow in the Covenant Collection, like the Tabernacle instructions, are communicated through Moses (see 20:19; 25:2).

Verse 2

THE COMMANDMENTS (20:2–14)
The “Ten Words” have a discernable arrangement, with a separation between those that dictate correct behavior regarding God and those that apply to the treatment of other human beings. Note, for instance, that the first statement opens with “your God,” while the last one closes with “your neighbor.” Further, the first five utterances mention “יהוה your God” five times, while the second five contain no references to God. The fifth commandment, which mandates honoring one’s parents, serves as a bridge between the two halves; it contains both religious and social aspects, and both God and parents claim authority over the individual. Within each grouping of five, the directives are arranged in order of decreasing severity. (These foundational precepts are repeated, with minor variations, in Deuteronomy 5:6–18.)
 <i><b>I</b></i> <b>יהוה <i>am your God.</i></b> This verse, in which God is self-identified as the One who took Israel out of Egypt, serves as the introduction and basis for all that follows. It is because God redeemed Israel from Egypt that God reserves the right to command exclusive fidelity (v. 3).

Verse 3

<b><i>You shall have no other gods besides Me.</i></b> This command of fidelity to only one god is unique in the ancient Near East. Texts from this period present a generally tolerant religious environment: the gods did not mind the worship of their “peers” as long as their own needs (in the form of donations of precious goods, food, and drink) were not neglected. This precept does not negate the existence of other gods, and may be pre-monotheistic (see also Deuteronomy 6:4). Biblical scholars compare Israel’s covenant with God to ancient Near Eastern international vassal-overlord treaties. Marriage is another, more familiar relationship that shared this kind of exclusivity; hence, the prophets develop the metaphor of God as husband and Israel as wife (see Isaiah 54, Jeremiah 3, Hosea 1–3).

Verse 4

<b><i>You shall not make for yourself a sculptured image.</i></b> Prevailing Jewish tradition understands vv. 4–6, forbidding the worship of images, as a continuation of v. 3. Yet if v. 3 is interpreted as the first stipulation, then v. 4 begins the second. The reason offered for the prohibition is that God communicated at Sinai only through a voice (Deuteronomy 4:12–16). Idols are therefore incompatible with the historic self-disclosure of God’s nature. Further, the worship of God through fixed representations limits the range of the Deity’s attributes.

Verse 5

<b><i>impassioned</i></b> See at Deuteronomy 5:9.
<i><b>visiting the guilt of the parents upon the children.</b></i> While God may practice trans-generational reward and punishment, Israelite courts are forbidden to do so (Deuteronomy 24:16).
<i><b>parents.</b></i> Heb. <i>avot,</i> sometimes translated as “fathers.” Here, however, the principle is more general: with regard to the covenant with God, the deeds (and misdeeds) of both mothers and fathers will matter.

Verse 6



Verse 7

<b><i>You shall not swear falsely.</i></b> This verse prohibits the misuse of the divine name. Commentators debate whether this refers specifically to invoking God’s name when taking an oath or more broadly to using God’s name frivolously or improperly.

Verse 8



Verse 9



Verse 10

<b><i>sabbath.</i></b> This is an institution unique to ancient Israel.
<i><b>you shall not do any work.</b></i> This clause introduces a list of seven categories of individuals who are obligated to rest on the Sabbath, beginning with the word <i>atah,</i> the masculine singular second person pronoun. On the scope of grammatically masculine address, see the introduction to the present unit. Paradoxically, it is the conspicuous omission of the wife that signals her inclusion here: if she is not addressed by “you,” then are we to assume that the verse burdens her with work—while her children, slaves, and draft animals rest? This can hardly be the case. As Tikva Frymer-Kensky writes, “the omission of a phrase ‘and your wife’ shows that the ‘you’ that the law addresses includes both women and men, each treated as a separate moral agent” (“Deuteronomy,” <i>Women’s Bible Commentary,</i> 1992, p. 59). Confirmation of a gender-inclusive “you” comes from comparing this verse to the similar construction in Deuteronomy 12:18, where logically and in light of 12:7 the word <i>atah</i> must have an inclusive sense.

Verse 11



Verse 12

<b><i>Honor your father and your mother.</i></b> The importance of respect for parents is underlined by its inclusion in the first five precepts, which concern proper behavior toward God. This command is the only one in the Decalogue for which a reward, extended residence in the land of Israel, is promised. It may reflect the legal custom found in other ancient Near Eastern texts that inheritance of property is conditional upon proper treatment of parents in their old age. The Torah outlines various offenses against parents, some of which are considered capital crimes: striking, cursing, insulting, and insubordination (as in 21:15, 17; Deuteronomy 21:18; 27:16). The inclusion of the mother alongside the father is consistent in all of these laws. | The specific activities that constitute “honor” are enumerated in post-biblical Jewish texts, not in the Torah.

Verse 13

<b><i>You shall not commit adultery.</i></b> Adultery is defined in Israel and the ancient Near East as sexual relations between a betrothed or married woman and any man other than her fiancé or husband. A married man was guilty of adultery only if his sexual partner officially “belonged” to another, since a man could legitimately take another unmarried woman as wife. The Torah’s legal texts consider adultery a capital offense and demand the execution of both the woman and her paramour (see Leviticus 18:20; 20:10; Deuteronomy 22:22–24; compare Hosea 2:4–9). Such harsh punishments reflect a concern for paternity and the transmission of property by men to their own offspring.
<i><b>false witness.</b></i> See at Deuteronomy 5:17.

Verse 14

 The traditional paragraphing in a Torah scroll properly breaks this verse into two clauses. In the first, the object of “covet” is “house,” which should be understood as “household” (as in Genesis 7:1). As the present translation indicates, the second clause enumerates those objects that constitute an Israelite household, starting with the most important, one’s wife.
<i><b>covet.</b></i> This refers to an intense desire for an object, and perhaps the scheming to acquire it (34:24; Joshua 7:21). See also at Deuteronomy 5:18.
<i><b>your neighbor’s wife.</b></i> Some scholars have argued that if the Decalogue were addressed to women as well as men, it would have included a parallel prohibition against coveting “your neighbor’s husband.” But the lack of mutuality here does not rule out that the previous provisions of the Decalogue addressed themselves to both men and women. Rather, each provision is addressed to whomever it applies. In ancient Israel, marriage was not a symmetrical arrangement: typically a man was in a position to take a woman into the household as a wife, but typically a woman could not take a man into her household as a husband. That alone would seem to account for why “husband” is not mentioned in this verse, as Tikva Frymer-Kensky has pointed out (“Deuteronomy,” <i>Women’s Bible Commentary,</i> 1992, p. 59). (See also <i>Mishpatim,</i> Another View.)

Verse 15

<i>The People’s Response and the First Instruction</i> (20:15–23)
The overwhelming display of divine might inspires such fear that the people withdraw and demand that Moses assume the role of mediator (vv. 15–16). The belief that seeing God could be lethal is found elsewhere in the Bible (Genesis 32:31; Exodus 33:20; Judges 6:22–23; 13:22). The revelatory experience at Sinai becomes the basis for the first instruction following the Decalogue (vv. 19–23): Because Israel’s experience of God at Sinai was auditory and not directly visual, their worship of God should exclude physical representations. This passage introduces the precepts of the Covenant Collection that follow in the next parashah.
<i>—Elaine Goodfriend</i>

Chapter 21



Verse 1

<i>The Covenant Collection</i> (21:1–23:33)
In conveying the Decalogue (Exodus 20:2–14), God addressed the people directly; but because the people fear the terrifying display of divine might (20:18–21), Moses mediates the regulations that now follow. The Book of the Covenant exhibits numerous similarities in content, form, and organization to the law collections of Israel’s neighbors. Yet biblical law departs from ancient Near Eastern jurisprudence in several ways. Israel was unique in its belief that God—not a king—authored the rules governing interactions with humans and the Divine. Another distinguishing feature is that all Israelites were charged with knowing the precepts in order to ensure their observance.
INTRODUCTION (21:1)
The inclusive nature of Israelite law is seen in this verse, when God instructs Moses to set the rules before the people. In contrast, the Laws of Hammurabi stipulate that only the aggrieved party could have the laws read to him; in Mesopotamian society, public knowledge of the law was not assumed.

Verse 2

CIVIL AND CRIMINAL MATTERS (21:2–22:16)
This section presents various cases involving the mistreatment of humans, livestock, or property, and the corresponding adjudications of those misdeeds. The Book of the Covenant commences with regulations concerning the emancipation of Hebrew indentured servants (21:2–11). While this arrangement might seem jarring at first glance—since it follows so closely after the story of the Israelites’ deliverance from bondage—it makes sense when we understand it as an attempt to limit Israelite servitude.
In what comprises the bulk of this section (21:12–22:14), laws are arranged according to decreasing severity, with crimes against property in the last passage. The section closes with consideration of a case of seduction (22:15–16).
<i>Treatment of Male and Female Hebrew Indentured Servants</i> (21:2–11)
Whereas the Israelites were subject to corvée labor in Egypt (see at 1:11), this passage describes a more restricted form of indentured service, also called debt-slavery. An Israelite might be reduced to indentured servitude because of extreme poverty, debt, or in restitution for theft; the individual was not chattel owned by the master (see at v. 7).
In comparison to other ancient Near Eastern legal collections, several regulations in this parashah are somewhat protective of servants (see 21:2–11, 20–21, 26–27, 32). Most biblical rulings treat male and females slaves equally (see, for instance, 20:10 or 21:20). Here, however, the text specifies that a male servant must be released at the end of six years, but not the indentured daughter (see at v. 7). [While this passage seems to present two contrasting laws, some interpretations—including the present translation—perceive that the unit has three parts: first, a general rule concerning the release of both female and male Hebrew indentured servants in the seventh year (v. 2, which is formulated in masculine language but represents an inclusive category); then two exceptions, one for males (vv. 3–6) and the other for daughters (vv. 7–11). This inclusive reading of v. 2 resembles Deuteronomy 15:12, which mandates the release of a Hebrew slave regardless of gender. —<i>Ed.</i>]
<b><i>you.</i></b> The Hebrew wording is grammatically masculine singular. The present translation presumes that such biblical language leaves the social gender unspecified whenever it refers to a nonspecific category of persons (“you who…” or “anyone who…”). Readers or listeners then determine the intended social gender from the topic under discussion, or from other clues in the context. Here, the topic is determinative: the sense is gender inclusive because in ancient Israel, some women as well as some men owned debt-slaves; and the law has no reason to discriminate according to the owner’s gender.
<i><b>slave.</b></i> Heb. <i>eved,</i> which can refer to either male or female servants or slaves. Here, the translation understands this noun in an inclusive way, on the grounds that the basic principle is not constrained by gender. This law would thus also cover the case of a desperate woman who—lacking familial assistance—sells herself into slavery (compare Deuteronomy 15:12, 28:68). Note, however, that this section takes pains not to be gender inclusive by differentiating between <i>eved</i> (v. 2) and <i>amah</i> (female slave) (v. 7) (see also vv. 20, 26–27, 32), as well as between <i>ish</i> (man) and <i>ishah</i> (woman) (v. 28) and between <i>ben</i> (son) and <i>bat</i> (daughter) (v. 31).

Verse 3

<b><i>if he had a wife.</i></b> This verse suggests that if a man was married before he became a debt slave, his wife accompanies him when he becomes an indentured servant and then is set free after six years. Presumably, the master provides for the man’s wife and children during the years of servitude.

Verse 4

<b><i>the wife and her children shall belong to the master.</i></b> In this case, the master gives the bondsman a slave-wife, possibly of non-Israelite origin, in order to produce “house born” slaves. The mother’s status determines the children’s status, a practice that departs from the patrilineal norm in ancient Israel: if the mother is a slave, the children remain slaves. At the end of his indenture, the bondsman has to choose between continued servitude with his family or a lonely freedom. Perhaps because of the precariousness of his circumstances when freed, he might choose to stay. (For another perspective, see Contemporary Reflection.)

Verse 5



Verse 6



Verse 7

<b><i>7–11.</i></b> This case concerns a daughter sold into debt servitude. Gregory Chirichigno observes that this passage applies to a female sold into marriage and specifically designated as a sexual partner, as opposed to a female dependent sold to perform only household or non-sexual labor; the latter case is treated in Deuteronomy 15:12–18 (<i>Debt-Slavery in Israel and the Ancient Near East,</i> 1993, p. 255).
<b><i>parent.</i></b> Heb. <i>ish</i> (traditionally translated as “man”) in the Bible usually refers to a category of person (“anyone who…”). In the context of legal proceedings, when <i>ish</i> refers non-specifically to a plaintiff, defendant, or victim, the present translation understands the term as equivalent to the English word “party”; its social gender is determined not by the language but by the situation. Here, either a mother or a father could be in a position to sell a child; in the biblical world, impoverished families sometimes pledged a daughter or son in order to secure loans or land. The Bible tells of a widow who expects that a creditor will seize her children and force them into indentured servitude to pay off the family’s debt (II Kings 4:1). In Nehemiah 5:5, the people complain about having to sell their children in order to survive.
<i><b>slave.</b></i> Heb. <i>amah,</i> which refers to a female servant and has a wide range of meanings. While designating a slave or servant (such as Bilhah in Genesis), it also can be a self-deprecating title for a woman when she wishes to show deference. (See how the term is repeatedly used by wealthy Abigail when speaking to David in I Samuel 25:24–31.)
<i><b>she shall not go free as other slaves do.</b></i> According to this passage, an indentured daughter does not go free in the seventh year (v. 2) but rather stays in her master’s home where she becomes a wife or secondary wife of either the master or the master’s son. In contrast, Deuteronomy 15:12 allows the Israelite woman to go free in the seventh year, but that verse may refer to a girl or woman who becomes an indentured servant with no intention of marriage. Here, marriage to the master or the master’s son seems to be the condition the father makes for the daughter’s indenture.

Verse 8

<b><i>If she proves to be displeasing.</i></b> What causes her to be seen, literally, as “bad in the eyes of her master”? Given the implicit focus on sexuality in this passage, some commentators infer that she is rejected because of something related to her status as a potential sexual partner or wife. However, reasons for the disapproval are not specified.
<i><b>he shall not have the right to sell her.</b></i> This law implies that if the master designates the girl as his wife but then finds her unsatisfactory for any reason, he has to allow her family to redeem her (compare Leviticus 25:47–49).
<i><b>outsiders.</b></i> The Hebrew phrase includes the word <i>am</i> (kin). While the woman changes hands without her choice, at least she remains among her people.

Verse 9

<b><i>he shall deal with her as is the practice with free maidens.</i></b> This verse suggests that the girl must be given the rights of a free Israelite bride, as explained in v. 10.

Verse 10

<b><i>her food, her clothing or her conjugal rights.</i></b> These three provisions comprise the basic entitlements of a married woman. The meaning of the third term (<i>onah</i>) is disputed; it appears nowhere else in the Bible. Some understand this word as a reference to a dwelling place (<i>ma’on).</i> Others translate the noun as “oil” or “ointment,” a reading that is based not on linguistic evidence, but on the fact that the combination of food, clothing, and oil is found in several ancient Near Eastern texts concerned with the minimal requirements for supporting a dependent. Jewish tradition considers <i>onah</i> to refer to marital relations, either for the purpose of sexual gratification or procreation, hence the translation “conjugal rights.” According to Nahum Sarna, if this interpretation is correct, “it would reflect a singular recognition in the laws of the ancient Near East that a wife is legally entitled to sexual gratification” (<i>Exodus</i>, 1991, p. 121).

Verse 11

<b><i>If he fails her in these three ways.</i></b> One interpretation of the phrase “three ways” is that she may leave as a free woman if the master does not allow her to be redeemed by her own family (v. 8), if he fails to treat her as a free maiden (v. 9), or if he neglects her maintenance (v. 10). Alternatively, “these three ways” could refer to “her food, her clothing, or her conjugal rights” (v. 10). In either case, if certain conditions are not met, the female servant has the ability to leave her master’s home without one of her relatives paying a redemption fee.

Verse 12

<i>Capital Crimes: Murder, Abuse of Parents, Kidnapping</i> (21:12–17) This section enumerates crimes against persons for which the Book of the Covenant demands the execution of the guilty party.
<b><i>One.</i></b> Linguistically the social gender is unspecified (see at v. 2); here the same law—and the death penalty—would apply whether the killer was a man or a woman (compare at Genesis 9:5–6).

Verse 13

 <i><b>If</b></i> <b>[</b><i><b>a male killer</b></i><b>].</b> The verse establishes that someone who commits involuntary homicide can flee to a city of refuge (see Numbers 35:9–29 and at Deuteronomy 19:1–13) to avoid vengeance being carried out by the deceased’s family. The principle of asylum was applicable regardless of gender. However, it may have gone without saying—as the present translation presumes—that the case of a female killer would be somewhat more complicated than the case that the Torah outlines.

Verse 14



Verse 15

<b><i>, 17. One who strikes one’s father or mother… One who insults one’s father or mother.</i></b> The physical or verbal abuse of father and mother is considered a capital offense, for these regulations are addressed to adult offspring upon whom senior family members are dependent for their survival. The word “insults” can refer to cursing or habitual rebellious behavior (see Deuteronomy 21:18–19),as well as treating parents with contempt; it is the opposite of “honor” in Exodus 20:12. Biblical law consistently mentions “mother” alongside “father” in its legislation regarding the honoring of parents, with father mentioned first in most cases (20:12; Deuteronomy 5:16; 21:18; 27:16) except for Leviticus 19:3, which lists the mother first. A similar provision in the Laws of Hammurabi (¶ 195) mentions only the father. See further at v. 20.

Verse 16



Verse 17



Verse 18

<i>Bodily Injury Caused by People and Livestock</i> (21:18–32) After treating the capital crimes, the text transitions to situations where the prescribed remedy can be execution but more typically is physical retaliation or financial compensation.

Verse 19



Verse 20

<b><i>A slave, male or female.</i></b> A distinctive feature of the Covenant Collection is that eight among its first laws make the gender-inclusive sense explicit (vv. 15, 17, 20, 26, 28, 29, 31, 32). This may be due to the position of Exodus 21 as the first section of jurisprudence after the Decalogue. Thus, the equal protection of women is emphasized at the beginning of the covenant legislation.

Verse 21



Verse 22

 <b><i>When</i> [<i>two or more</i>] <i>parties fight, and one of them pushes a pregnant woman and a miscarriage results.</i></b> This verse contains two significant aspects of biblical and later Jewish law. First, this is the only Torah text that discusses the value of a fetal life, a subject crucial for the development of legislation concerning women. Further, it presents the statement of exact retaliation, “an eye for an eye” or “talion” law, from the Latin term <i>lex talionis.</i> | This verse does not explain how the woman became involved in the altercation. Was she simply an innocent bystander, or did she intervene to aid one of the parties? (The latter legal scenario is found in Deuteronomy 25:11–12.)
<i><b>damage.</b></i> Heb. <i>ason,</i> which is used elsewhere in the Bible only in the Joseph narrative, when Jacob fears sending Benjamin down to Egypt lest an <i>ason,</i> meaning some sort of harm or mishap, befalls him (Genesis 42:4, 38; 44:29). Likewise the present translation understands that <i>ason</i> refers to harm in general, given the range of penalties mentioned in vv. 23–25. In this particular case, <i>ason</i> seems to refer specifically to the death of the mother as a result of the trauma of the assault and subsequent miscarriage. This assumption is corroborated by similar ancient Mesopotamian laws which speak first of the death of the fetus and then the death of the mother: “If a noble strikes a woman of the noble class and thereby causes her to miscarry her fetus, the perpetrator shall weigh and deliver ten shekels of silver for her fetus. If that woman should die, they shall kill the perpetrator’s daughter” (Laws of Hammurabi ¶¶ 209–10). In the Hammurabi regulation, the one who kills the pregnant woman loses a daughter. In the Torah, the attacker is required to monetarily compensate the “owner” of the fetus, the woman’s husband, with an amount of compensation to be negotiated.

Verse 23

<b><i>But if other damage ensues, the penalty shall be life for life.</i></b> Only if the mother dies (literally “if there is an <i>ason”</i>) must the attacker pay “life for life” <i>nefesh</i> in place of <i>nefesh”</i>). The relatively permissive Jewish law regarding abortion is derived from the essential distinction between the fetus and its mother. While the mother is considered a <i>nefesh</i> and her death is a capital crime, the loss of a fetus carries a lesser penalty. Similar to other cases of physical injury (vv. 18–19), the miscarriage is punished by monetary compensation.

Verse 24

<b><i>eye for eye, tooth for tooth.</i></b> The legal formula for precise retribution, “eye for an eye,” has little relevance here, as this case speaks only of the miscarriage of the fetus or of the mother’s death (see at v. 22), not burns or injuries to eyes, hands, or feet. This expression was probably placed here to complete the beginning of the formula found in v. 23, “life for life,” the one part of the phrase that fits this particular case. The talion formula recurs in different contexts in Leviticus 24:17–20 and Deuteronomy 19:21. According to Tikva Frymer-Kensky, this formula “must have been a judicial maxim to express the principles of equivalent retaliation” and not a mandate to inflict a penalty of bodily mutilation (“Israelite Law: State and Judiciary Law,” <i>Encyclopedia of Religion,</i> 2nd ed., 2005, 7:4741). In other words, this language should not be interpreted literally. Measure-for-measure punishment is found not only in biblical law but also in narrative; this was considered God’s own way of rendering justice.

Verse 25



Verse 26

<b><i>male or female.</i></b> On the mention of both genders, see at v. 20.

Verse 27



Verse 28

<b><i>28–32.</i></b> This case distinguishes between an animal that unexpectedly attacks someone and one that previously exhibited such aggressive behavior. The law’s gender-inclusive sense is stressed via the repetition of “man or a woman” (vv. 28, 29) and “male and female” (vv. 31–32); see at v. 20.

Verse 29



Verse 30



Verse 31



Verse 32



Verse 33

<i>Property Damage: Injury to Livestock, Theft, Crop Damage, Safeguarded Property</i> (21:33–22:14) The regulations in this section deal with crimes against an individual’s property. Penalties range from financial compensation for loss of property to forced labor for the thief who cannot pay the penalty (22:2).

<i>Seduction of an Unbetrothed Woman</i> (22:15–16) This case concerns a young woman of marriageable age, as young as eleven or twelve, who loses her virginity to a man who did not seek her father’s permission by entering into a formal engagement and paying a betrothal gift. While scholars generally differentiate between this case, which deals with the “persuasion” of the young girl, and Deuteronomy 22:28–29, which deals with rape, the distinction is not clear when dealing with young women who may be too naïve to offer real consent for sexual relations. This case is positioned after a series of laws regarding property loss (likewise remedied by monetary compensation), but before a series on disruptions to the social order; it seems to share aspects with both subjects. It may reflect an ancient Near Eastern view of a daughter’s virginity as the father’s or household’s asset.
<i><b>bride-price.</b></i> Heb. <i>mohar,</i> which indicates the customary transfer of property from the groom or his family to the bride’s father (see also Genesis 34:12 and I Samuel 18:25–27), perhaps to compensate her family for the loss of her labor. The <i>mohar</i> is different from a dowry, the money or moveable property that the wife might bring to her husband and his family at marriage. Carol Meyers argues that the betrothal gift does not mean that the groom purchased the bride like chattel; therefore, the standard translation of <i>mohar</i> as “bride-price” is misleading. Instead, the dowry and betrothal gift (a better rendering of <i>mohar</i>) helped form alliances between the two families and provided security for the woman, who theoretically retained possession of the dowry (<i>Exodus</i>, 2005, p. 197).

Verse 16

<b><i>If her father refuses to give her to him.</i></b> Although the law requires the man to take full responsibility for his actions and marry the woman, it is understandable that a father might refuse to allow his daughter to marry the man who evaded his parental authority and seduced his daughter. In that case, the law ensures that the father’s household bears no financial loss and thus receives the betrothal gift of virgins, which would have been greater than that for widows or divorcees. The law underlines a father’s responsibility for his daughter’s sexuality.

Verse 17

ASSORTED RELIGIOUS AND SOCIAL PRECEPTS (22:17–23:19) The start of the second section of the Book of the Covenant is marked by a shift in content and style. Whereas the prior laws are formulated as hypothetical cases, many of the subsequent verses are phrased apodictically as categorical imperatives. These injunctions deal with various social and religious matters, such as questions of how to treat others and the proper way to approach God. One consequence of the notion of the divine authorship of the law is that the distinction between civil and religious law becomes blurred, as seen in this parashah.
<i>Prohibitions of Sorcery, Bestiality, and Apostasy</i> (22:17–19) These three offenses all incur the death penalty. Sorcery and sacrificing to other gods conflict with the proper worship of Israel’s God. Sexual relations with an animal are condemned elsewhere, along with incest and adultery (Leviticus 18:23, 20:15–16; Deuteronomy 27:21).
<b><i>You shall not tolerate.</i></b> Biblical authors treat an attempt to learn the future as permissible so long as it is accomplished through permissible means: consultation with prophets, dream interpretation, or an oracle via the high priest’s breastplate (I Samuel 28:6). All other means—such as conjuring the spirits of the dead, interpreting the movements of clouds, or “reading” omens from the livers of sacrificial animals—fall into the category of intolerable sorcery (see next comment). Deuteronomy 18:13–14 suggests that sorcery violates Israel’s obligation to wholeheartedly worship God.
<i><b>sorceress.</b></i> Whereas many of the prior laws in this parashah mention both women and men, here the text focuses only on the former. Deuteronomy 18:9–14 enumerates various kinds of diviners and sorcerers, without distinguishing between male and female.
Women are associated with the occult in I Samuel 28, where the Woman of En-dor conjures up Samuel’s ghost, and in Ezekiel 13:17–23, where the prophet denounces female soothsayers. (See also at Leviticus 20:27 and at Deuteronomy 18:10–11.)

Verse 18



Verse 19



Verse 20

<i>Proper Treatment of the Disadvantaged</i> (22:20–26) In this section, the Torah targets the oppression of the vulnerable members of society: the stranger, the widow, the fatherless, and the poor.

Verse 21

 <b><i>You</i> [<i>communal leaders</i>].</b> The Hebrew wording is masculine plural; on this language, see at 21:2. Here, the addressees are those with the authority and power to carry out this precept, namely, certain male leaders (see Isaiah 1:23; Jeremiah 22:23). This explains the reference to “your wives” in v. 23.
<i><b>widow or orphan.</b></i> These two classes are recognized as deserving of compassion because they have no adult male provider and protector. The term <i>yatom</i> (“orphan”) more precisely means “fatherless,” since v. 23 makes it clear that the individual is bereft of a father, not both parents. The plight of a widow was often dire because she did not automatically inherit her husband’s land. She was left at the mercy of her children, who might have been too young to support their mother, or, in the event that she had no children, her deceased husband’s male relatives (Numbers 27:9–11). (On widows, see also <i>Eikev,</i> Another View.)

Verse 19

 While this verse is not directly addressed to women, few laws have had a greater impact on the domestic lives of Jewish women than this one, for it serves as the basis for the historic Jewish dietary practice of separating dairy and meat products. The kid, or young goat, is mentioned because it was the most common type of livestock; later Jewish law extended the prohibition to sheep and large cattle as well. In ancient Israel, meat was rarely consumed outside of special occasions—such as festivals, new moons, or perhaps the visit of an honored guest. Cooking the animal in milk instead of water would have made it tastier and more tender. (For a different theory, see at Deuteronomy 14:21.) Most commentators point to a humanitarian motivation for this law, like the other regulations in the Torah that express a sensitivity to animals and their young (see Exodus 22:29; Leviticus 22:27; Deuteronomy 22:6–7). Boiling a goat in its mother’s milk, a plausible scenario on a small farm, represents the destruction of the young in the substance intended to sustain and nurture it. In order to prevent the accidental transgression of this original injunction, the rabbinic sages expanded this command into a general prohibition against mixing meat with dairy products.

Verse 20

DIVINE PROMISES AND WARNINGS (23:20–33) This epilogue reaffirms the divine promise to bring Israel to Canaan and articulates the blessings that will be enjoyed by those who keep the covenant. The blessings of food, water, health, and procreation were crucial for the Israelites to survive in the Promised Land.

<b><i>No woman in your land shall miscarry or be barren.</i></b> Israel is admonished in vv. 24–25 to worship the God of Israel and not adopt the religious practices of the native Canaanite population. As a reward, they will receive an array of blessings, including absence of two kinds of women: those who are incapable of conception, and those who suffer miscarriages (or, according to Rashi, those who bury their children). Fertility was considered crucial for both the individual and society for several reasons. Israel’s agrarian economy depended upon large families to perform all necessary labors. Premature mortality due to disease therefore made it necessary for women to have many children in order to ensure that some lived to adulthood. Also, a woman’s financial security depended upon having children, as seen in the book of Ruth, where the women rejoice that Ruth’s son will provide for his grandmother Naomi in her old age (Ruth 4:14–15). If a woman was widowed without children and her husband made no provisions for her, she might have no means of support, for her deceased husband’s property would be inherited by her husband’s brothers (Numbers 27:9).

Chapter 24



Verse 1

<i>The Covenant Ratification Ritual</i> (24:1–18)
Exodus 24 depicts the ratification of the covenant between God and Israel. The central components of this ceremony involve Moses’ recitation of the terms of the covenant, the people’s unanimous agreement to follow God’s words, the construction of an altar and twelve pillars symbolizing the twelve tribes, and the offering of sacrifices, with half the blood dashed on the altar and the other half sprinkled on the people—perhaps a graphic symbol of their entry into the covenant.
This passage also describes an unusual scene in which the leaders and representatives of the people ascend partway up the mountain, where they collectively experience a vision of God and participate in a formal meal to solemnize the covenant. Various segments of Israel’s leadership participate in this ceremony: prophetic (Moses), priestly (Aaron, his sons Nadab and Abihu), and judicial (seventy representative elders). Although women do not take part in this particular ritual, presumably they are included in the term “people” as everyone affirms, “All that יהוה has spoken we will faithfully do” (v. 7). The episode reaches its climax when Moses ascends the mountain and receives the stone tablets etched with God’s precepts. The tablets are to be deposited eventually in the ark of the Tabernacle, the focus of most of the remaining portion of the book of Exodus.

Chapter 25



Verse 1

<i>Instructions about Building Materials</i> (25:1–9)
Because the Tabernacle is conceived of as God’s abode, many of its features are highly symbolic. This is apparent in this introductory unit, which features seven categories of materials: metals, yarn, skins, wood, oil, spices, and gemstones. The number seven represents completeness in the Semitic world, so this group of materials signifies the totality of the supplies.
 <b>יהוה <i>spoke to Moses.</i></b> The directions for the Tabernacle are presented as being given to Moses at Sinai, thus linking the remainder of the book of Exodus to the preceding narrative about the exodus from Egypt and the revelation at Sinai.

Verse 2

<b><i>gifts.</i></b> Heb. <i>t’rumah,</i> a collective term, provides the designation for this parashah. The resources for the Tabernacle are to be donated, not elicited as taxes.
<i><b>people…every person.</b></i> All members of the community, both female and male, are expected to contribute, as 35:22, 29 and 36:6 make explicit. This assumes that women had their own resources and control over them; presumably they could decide for themselves what to offer to the project.

Verse 3

<b><i>gold, silver, and copper.</i></b> Three metals will be used for the components of the Tabernacle according to their proximity to the most sacred space, the Holy of Holies. The most sacred objects will be made of gold, the most valuable metal.
<i><b>copper.</b></i> The Hebrew term also designates bronze (a copper-based alloy), which, given its strength and hardness, is more likely the intended meaning with regard to the Tabernacle.

Verse 4

<b><i>blue, purple, and crimson yarns.</i></b> The three colors specified for the woolen yarns—indigo blue, sea-snail purple, and cochineal red—were the most desirable and expensive in ancient Israel and the wider Near East. These particular dyes were self-fixing, meaning that they were relatively impervious to light and remained bright. Dying woolen strands with these colors was costly because the raw materials were difficult to use or rare. These three colors are probably listed in order of costliness. Textile production was largely the domain of women, as the Torah reflects in 35:25–26 (see also Another View; <i>P’kudei,</i> Another View).
<i><b>linen.</b></i> The word for linen is derived from an Egyptian term and denotes an especially fine grade of that fabric.

Verse 5

<b><i>dolphin.</i></b> The meaning of this term is uncertain; perhaps it represents a specific color—probably rust—of tanned and dyed sheep- or goat-skin, rather than a sea animal.
<i><b>acacia.</b></i> Wood from acacia trees is durable and relatively light in weight—ideal for a portable structure.

Verse 6

<b><i>oil.</i></b> Namely, olive oil to be used as lamp fuel, as explained later; see 27:20–21 and the comments there.
<i><b>spices for the anointing oil and…incense.</b></i> The oil is to be used to anoint the sacred objects and the priests, as explained later; for the ingredients, see 30:22–38.

Verse 7

<b><i>lapis lazuli.</i></b> More likely onyx or possibly carnelian.
<i><b>ephod and…breastpiece.</b></i> These are the paraphernalia of the vestments for the chief priestly official. (For more details, see at 28:6.)

Verse 8

<b><i>sanctuary.</i></b> Heb. <i>mikdash,</i> from the root <i>k-d-sh</i> (“to be hallowed”); the term emphasizes the Tabernacle’s holiness.
<i><b>that I may dwell among them.</b></i> This key statement articulates the purpose of the Tabernacle.
<i><b>dwell.</b></i> The verb comes from the root <i>sh-k-n.</i> The usual word for “dwell” (<i>y-sh-b</i>) means to inhabit or live someplace. In contrast, the root <i>sh-k-n</i> indicates a moving, dynamic presence, not one tied to a fixed location. (The later concept of the <i>Shechinah</i> comes from the same root; see Post-biblical Interpretations.)
<i><b>among them.</b></i> Or, “in the midst of” the people. Such language helps negotiate the tension between the freedom of God to be everywhere and the need of humans to have tangible evidence of God’s immanence and accessibility.

Verse 9

<b><i>pattern.</i></b> Heb. <i>tavnit,</i> a noun formed from the verb “to build” (<i>b-n-h</i>). It probably refers to an archetypal heavenly structure rather than to a plan an architect would use. Thus, God’s imagined heavenly abode provides the model for the Tabernacle.
<i><b>Tabernacle.</b></i> Heb. <i>mishkan,</i> from the root <i>sh-k-n</i> (see at v. 8 under “dwell”), which allows for the mobility inherent in the concept of a tent-shrine. The noun conveys the idea of a dwelling-place and is not simply a synonym for tent. The English word “Tabernacle” (which derives from Latin) refers only to this wilderness shrine, whereas <i>mishkan</i> is a more general term: when it refers to a structure occupied by human beings it is translated as “dwelling, abode, home” (for example, Leviticus 26:11; Numbers 16:24, 24:5). The Tabernacle is conceived of as a place on earth in which God will be readily accessible and from which God’s protective power will emanate.

Verse 10

<i>Instructions about Interior Furnishings</i> (25:10–40)
The prescriptive texts (those detailing what is to be done) begin with the contents of the Tabernacle, in contrast with the descriptive texts (those detailing what was done), which begin with its structure (see the introduction to <i>Vayak’heil</i>). The first item in a series is arguably the most important. Here, the instructions for the furnishings begin with the most sacred object, the Ark, which will occupy the Holy of Holies, followed by the offering table and menorah in the outer room.
ARK AND ITS COVER (25:10–22)
The term <i>aron</i> (“Ark”) denotes a box or chest used as a container for valuables, probably similar to those known from ancient Egypt. The Ark is to contain a document understood to be the Decalogue (“Ten Commandments”) or some form of the covenant between God and the people. At the same time, the Ark symbolically suggests a throne for the invisible deity and signifies God’s presence in the Tabernacle’s inner sanctum. (For the descriptive text later in Exodus that parallels this prescriptive section, see 37:1–9.)
<b><i>two and a half cubits…a cubit and a half…a cubit and a half.</i></b> The Ark is to be nearly 4 feet long (a little more than 1 meter) and a bit more than 2 feet wide and deep (about ⅔ meter). The cubit was a widely used measure in the ancient Near East but was never standardized.

Verse 11

<b><i>pure gold.</i></b> As part of the furnishings of the holiest zone, the Ark is to be covered with the most precious metal. The designation “pure” indicates that the highest quality of gold is to be used.

Verse 12

<b><i>its four feet.</i></b> The feet perhaps are added to ensure this sacred object will not rest directly on the ground.

Verse 13

<b><i>13–14. poles…for carrying.</i></b> Since the Ark was to be portable, it could be carried to battle to represent God’s presence (see I Samuel 4–7; Numbers 10:35–36).

Verse 14



Verse 15



Verse 16

<b><i>[the tablets of] the Pact.</i></b> Heb. <i>edut,</i> meaning “pact” or “treaty,” is likely an elliptical designation for “tablets of the Pact,” the document on which the agreement between God and Israel was said to have been inscribed (31:18). Elsewhere in the Torah, the word <i>b’rit</i> (“covenant”) is usually used for this treaty (as in 34:28).

Verse 17

<b><i>cover.</i></b> Heb. <i>kaporet,</i> whose meaning and etymology remain uncertain. Many understand it in relationship to the verb <i>k-p-r,</i> “to atone.” It also is possible that it is derived from an Egyptian phrase that would make it equivalent to a place for one’s feet to rest, a suggestion that gives it a tantalizingly close connection to the depiction of the ark in certain texts (I Samuel 4:4; Psalm 99:1–5), in which an invisible God seems to be present on a cherubim throne with a footstool.

Verse 18

<b><i>cherubim.</i></b> These fanciful beasts are well known in ancient Near Eastern culture. Composite creatures made up of human and animal features, they are not at all like the round-faced cherubs of Western art. Usually depicted with wings, they possessed the ability to move where humans cannot, which made them apt symbols of deities.

Verse 19

<b><i>19–21.</i></b> The placement of the cherubim on either side of the “cover” forms a throne, with the cover as a footstool for God’s unseen presence (see at v. 17). The Ark, with its cover surmounted by cherubim, serves as the visible locus of God’s invisible royal presence.

Verse 20



Verse 21



Verse 22

<b><i>There I will meet with you.</i></b> Another name for the Tabernacle, the Tent of Meeting (27:21 and frequently thereafter), is related to this concept of God’s interaction with the people at the place where the divine Presence rest. In ancient Israel, such meetings probably took the form of divine oracles delivered via qualified priests (see <i>T’tzaveh</i>, Another View), or via prophetic figures like Moses (see 34:34). While women did serve as prophets in Israel (see at 15:20), Israelite priests were male. In the Torah’s depiction of the Tabernacle, oracular meetings held there to mediate God’s will to the people are restricted to select male agents: only those from the family of Levi.
<i><b>concerning the Israelite people</b></i>. In the ancient world, people typically sought oracles when they turned to a deity to resolve an otherwise intractable legal dispute (see, for example, Numbers 27:1–5). Oracles also aided with political decisions, such as determining whether or when to go to war or levy taxes. According to the Torah, oracular decisions are achieved by mechanical means; see comments about the ephod (Exodus 28:6), priestly “breast-piece of decision” (28:15), and Urim and Thummim (28:30).

Verse 23

TABLE AND MENORAH (25:23–40) The Tabernacle’s main, outer room is furnished with a table and a lampstand. A third object—an incense altar—will be mentioned in an addendum, in the next parashah (30:1–10). All three golden items are suitable furnishings for a royal abode; together they provide food and drink, light, and aromatic smells. (For the descriptive text later in Exodus that parallels this prescriptive section, see 37:10–24.)
The lampstand’s significance seems to lie less in its functional role as the bearer of a light source and more in its iconic significance, for it resembles sacred trees of other Near Eastern culture. Such trees conveyed the idea of the fertility granted by divine powers (see also at v. 31). Because those powers were associated with both male and female deities, the menorah’s presence in the Tabernacle perhaps conveyed the metaphoric female as well as male aspects of God.
<b><i>table.</i></b> Tables for food and drink offerings were typical furnishings of ancient Near Eastern shrines, as known from depictions in art.
<i><b>two cubits…one cubit…cubit and a half.</b></i> This rectangular table is to be about 3 feet (nearly 1 meter) long, 1½ feet (nearly ½ meter) wide, and a bit more than 2 feet (about ⅔ meter) high.

Verse 24



Verse 25



Verse 26



Verse 27



Verse 28



Verse 29

<b><i>bowls, ladles, jars and jugs.</i></b> The Torah specifies four kinds of golden vessels for the table: “bowls” for serving the bread, cup-shaped “ladles” for the incense (frankincense), jars for pouring libations, and jugs into which the libations were poured.

Verse 30

<b><i>bread.</i></b> When the Israelites lived in the Land of Israel, roughly half of their caloric intake came from cereal products. Bread was the most important part of their diet, and so not surprisingly bread has primacy in the retrojected Tabernacle offerings. But the text does not tell us who baked the bread. As in most traditional societies, bread production in Israelite households was almost exclusively the task of women (see also at 16:3). However, in pre-modern cultures, male specialists were often responsible for baking and cooking in elite contexts (like palaces or temples)—just as master chefs today are predominantly male even though home cooks typically are female. Yet because I Samuel 8:13 indicates that royal bakers and cooks were women, it is possible that the text envisions women as preparing this sacred bread for the tent shrine, although in a Second Temple text, this task is assigned to a levitical clan (I Chronicles 9:31). Leviticus 24:5–8 describes how the bread offering is to be prepared and presented (see also at Leviticus 7:12).
<i><b>display.</b></i> Literally, “face.” This term characterizes the bread offering. Because “face” indicates divine presence (see at 33:20), its association with the bread offering perhaps signifies that the bread is for God. (However, it is eventually eaten by priests; see Leviticus 24:9.)
<i><b>always.</b></i> The term <i>tamid</i> signifies that the loaves were to be on the table at all times, with fresh ones placed there weekly on the Sabbath (Leviticus 24:8).

Verse 31

<b><i>lampstand of pure gold.</i></b> The golden menorah has survived into post-biblical Judaism as one of the most recognizable Jewish symbols. The depiction of a single golden lampstand here conflicts with the description of ten lampstands in the First Temple (I Kings 7:49). It agrees, however, with the single lampstand of the Second Temple, which was carried off by the conquerors of Jerusalem and is depicted on the Arch of Titus in Rome. The lampstand of the Second Temple may recapture the single-menorah tradition of the pre-monarchic tent shrine. The terminology in the lampstand passage is replete with botanical terms, and its branched shape also implies a tree-like form. These features may signify the fertility provided by God or the idea of the eventual rise of a Davidic ruler as a “shoot” or “branch” (see Isaiah 11:1, Jeremiah 23:5, and Zechariah 3:8). The form may even allude to the female aspect of God’s presence, for female deities in the ancient Near East—such as the Canaanite goddess Asherah—may have been represented by sacred trees.
<i><b>hammered work.</b></i> According to the biblical description, the menorah seems to be made entirely of gold, but it is unclear whether it is solid gold or hollow. The translation “hammered” is conjectural, and the mode of the menorah’s fabrication is not specified.
<i><b>its base and its shaft.</b></i> The menorah’s central element is a thick cylinder or shaft, flared at the bottom to form a stable base, and not a slender one as in many depictions of the menorah from the post-biblical period.
<i><b>cups.</b></i> This term probably refers to a bulging shape (like the capital of a column): a decorative element of the shaft (v. 34) and its branches (v. 33).
<i><b>calyxes, and petals.</b></i> The first indication of botanical imagery, a calyx is the outer part of a flower.

Verse 32

<b><i>branches.</i></b> The term adds to the botanical imagery. The overall form likely would have looked like a tree, similar to depictions in Late Bronze and Iron Age Near Eastern art.

Verse 33

<b><i>almond-blossoms.</i></b> This additional information about the shape of the calyxes and petals provides another botanical term.

Verse 34



Verse 35



Verse 36



Verse 37

<b><i>seven lamps.</i></b> These were apparently not to be attached to the lampstand, nor is it specified that they were to be made of gold. According to Exodus 27:21 (see comment there), only one lamp may be involved. That is, the text may be describing a saucer lamp with seven spouts surmounting the central shaft, perhaps a simpler version of the complex visionary menorah of Zechariah 4:2.
<i><b>light.</b></i> The light-giving properties of the menorah are partly symbolic, connoting the cosmic power of God as the creator of heavenly lights.

Verse 38

<b><i>tongs and fire pans.</i></b> These were utensils for tending the lamp (or lamps).

Verse 39

<b><i>talent.</i></b> This term probably designates a weight of about 75 pounds (34 kilograms); see at 38:24.

Chapter 26



Verse 1

<i>Instructions about the Tabernacle Structure</i> (26:1–37)
With the directions for the Tabernacle’s interior furnishings complete, the narrative turns to the dwelling itself, which consists of two internal sections. The structure will have three components: coverings of textiles and animal skins, wooden frames, and two textile partitions. Despite the plethora of details, the specifications are incomplete and the directions for assembling the structure are unclear. Thus, it is unlikely that this section contains actual directions for making a real shrine. Information about flooring is lacking; perhaps a dirt floor is assumed (see Numbers 5:17).
COVERINGS (26:1–14)
The tent-like dwelling is to be made of two layers of fabric—decorated linen panels and unadorned goat-hair panels—which in turn will be covered with two layers of animal skins. (For the descriptive text later in Exodus that parallels this prescriptive section, see 36:8–19.)
<b><i>tabernacle.</i></b> The translation does not capitalize this word in this passage (vv. 1–14), to indicate that the Hebrew noun <i>mishkan</i> denotes only the inner fabric component of the dwelling, to be made of decorated linen. (Compare at 25:9.)
<i><b>fine twisted linen.</b></i> “Twisted” linen refers to the technique of spinning for preparing the linen thread. Women typically do this kind of work; compare 35:25–26.
<i><b>yarns.</b></i> Regally colored woolen yarns were apparently to be embroidered to make a design on the linen cloth.
<i><b>design of cherubim.</b></i> Images of these fanciful composite creatures would not only form the “throne” over the Ark (see at 25:18, 19–21) but also decorate the dwelling’s fabric sides.

Verse 2

<b><i>twenty-eight cubits…four cubits.</i></b> Each fabric panel is to be about 14 yards (nearly 13 meters) by 2 yards (nearly 2 meters).

Verse 3

<b><i>3–6.</i></b> As specific as the directions for joining the fabric panels seem, the exact procedures remain elusive. It seems that five of the panels were joined together, perhaps by sewing, and then the two resulting larger panels were connected.

Verse 4



Verse 5



Verse 6



Verse 7

<b><i>cloths of goats’ hair.</i></b> Goat hair can be spun into yarn and then woven into waterproof cloth. It has been used for tents in the Middle East for millennia.
<i><b>tent.</b></i> Heb. <i>ohel</i> denotes this second fabric layer, which is to cover and protect the linen tabernacle (vv. 1–6).

Verse 8

<b><i>thirty cubits…four cubits.</i></b> Each of the eleven panels is to be about 15 yards (nearly 14 meters) by 2 yards (nearly 2 meters).

Verse 9



Verse 10



Verse 11



Verse 12



Verse 13



Verse 14



Verse 15

FRAMES (26:15–30) The structure’s frame is to be constructed of a complex system of gilded boards and bars with metal fastenings; the frame is to be set into bases. (For the descriptive text later in Exodus that parallels this prescriptive section, see 36:20–34.)
<b><i>planks.</i></b> The Hebrew word translated here as “planks” is used in the Bible only with regard to the Tabernacle; its precise nuance is not clear. Apparently the four layers of textiles and skins that comprise the tent will be hung on a frame made of acacia wood.

Verse 16

<b><i>ten cubits…a cubit and a half.</i></b> The “planks” measure about 15 feet (4½ meters) by a bit more than 2 feet (about ⅔ meter); their thickness is not specified. Despite the minutiae provided, it is not clear how the frame would be assembled.

Verse 17



Verse 18



Verse 19

<b><i>silver sockets.</i></b> The sockets, which were probably bases in which the “planks” (see at v. 15) were set, were likely made of a less precious metal because they were to rest on the ground.

Verse 20



Verse 21



Verse 22

<b><i>west.</i></b> The rectangular interior space is to be oriented in an east-west direction, with its holiest rear wall at the west. If the entry partition (26:36–37) were open, the sun rising at the equinox would shine toward the Holy of Holies.

Verse 23



Verse 24



Verse 25



Verse 26

<b><i>bars.</i></b> Probably long horizontal rods or crossbars to stabilize the “planks” (see at v. 15).

Verse 27



Verse 28



Verse 29



Verse 30

<b><i>Tabernacle.</i></b> Now the term seems to refer to the entire structure, not just the tent coverings (see at v. 1).

Verse 31

TEXTILE PARTITIONS (26:31–37) The textile and skin coverings are to hang over a gilded wooden structure. The space thus created is to be divided into two parts by a textile partition hung on gilded posts. One of the areas is designated <i>kodesh</i> (“Holy”) and the other <i>kodesh kodashim</i> (“Holy of Holies”). Another textile partition, also hung on gilded posts, is to separate the interior space from the surrounding courtyard. (For the descriptive text later in Exodus that parallels this prescriptive section, see 36:33–38.)
<b><i>make a curtain.</i></b> The curtain for the Tabernacle is to be made with the best grade of linen embroidered in cherubim designs with royally dyed woolen threads.
The word for “curtain” (<i>parochet</i>) survives in contemporary Jewish life as the designation for the fabric hung in front of a synagogue ark.

Verse 32

<b><i>gold…gold.</i></b> This precious metal is most appropriate for features of the holiest space.
<i><b>sockets of silver.</b></i> The bases for the gilded posts are silver perhaps because the bases touch the ground.
<i><b>33. carry the Ark of the Pact there.</b></i> The most sacred space, the Holy of Holies, is where the most sacred object—the—Ark will be placed.
<i><b>between the Holy and the Holy of Holies.</b></i> The interior is thus divided into two zones of holiness.

Verse 33



Verse 34



Verse 35

 The offering table and the menorah are situated outside the Holy of Holies, the table on the north side and the menorah on the south. The space directly in the center of the curtain in front of the Ark seems to be vacant; but in 30:1–10 we will learn that a third item, the incense altar, is to occupy that spot.

Verse 36

<b><i>screen.</i></b> The fabric partition or “screen” between the interior and exterior spaces is to be similar to the <i>parochet</i> except without cherubim designs.

Verse 37

<b><i>gold…copper.</i></b> The hooks and posts holding the screen are to be of gilded wood. The bases (“sockets”) in which they are to be set, however, are “copper” (probably bronze; see at 25:3), the least precious of the three metals, because these foundation pieces are on the ground and border on the courtyard, the outer zone of holiness.

Chapter 27



Verse 1

<i>Instructions about the Courtyard</i> (27:1–19)
Like virtually every domicile in the ancient Near East, whether a village house or an urban palace, the Tabernacle is to have an unroofed outdoor space, a courtyard. Certain household functions, including roasting large pieces of meat, were performed more efficiently outdoors. Thus the altar for various types of offerings is to be placed in the courtyard.
Whereas the other parts of the Tabernacle were restricted to certain priests, the courtyard was a place where the rest of the people—including women—could enter and present their offerings.
ALTAR (27:1–8)
Only the altar is mentioned in this section; but another courtyard installation, the laver (or basin), appears in 30:17–21. The instructions say nothing about how the altar is to be used, though the following parashah mentions grain, oil, wine, and animals as offerings to be made on the altar (29:38–42). Leviticus and other biblical texts presume that women, like men, would approach the altar to present their offerings (see the introduction to <i>Vayikra</i>). (For the descriptive text later in Exodus that parallels this prescriptive section, see 38:1–8.)
<b><i>of acacia wood.</i></b> Because it is highly unlikely that a wooden altar, even one overlaid with metal, could have been functional, this must be a hypothetical item (see the parashah introduction). A large-scale altar would have been made of stone, which would make it virtually impossible to build, dismantle, and transport. Features of known altars are integrated into the instructions for this somewhat imaginary wooden courtyard altar.
<i><b>five cubits…five cubits…three cubits.</b></i> At about 7½ feet (more than 2 meters) square and 4½ feet (almost 1½ meters) high, the height would have required steps, thus making the altar conceptually different from stone or earthen altars (see 20:21–23), which can be built anywhere.

Verse 2

<b><i>horns on the four corners.</i></b> The most striking feature of the courtyard altar is that horns are to protrude from its four corners. How they are to be placed is not clear, but the positioning of the horns on stone altars discovered by archeologists suggests that the horns would have turned upward from the altar’s corners. Most of the excavated horned altars are quite small, like the incense altar of 30:1–10; but two massive ones have been found at Beersheba and Arad. In the Tabernacle, the altar and its horns are to play a role in the consecration ceremony (see 29:12).
<i><b>copper.</b></i> Since the courtyard is the least holy zone, its furnishings, utensils, and carrying poles are to be made of bronze (see at 25:3).

Verse 3

<b><i>pails for removing its ashes.</i></b> This anticipates the function of the altar, for the ashy remains of the wood fuel and of the offerings consumed by fire would need to be removed.
<i><b>scrapers.</b></i> These are probably for cleaning the altar after the sacrifice has been burnt.
<i><b>basins.</b></i> The word for “basin” is from the verb <i>z-r-k</i> (“to sprinkle”), indicating that the basins are to be used to carry the blood to be sprinkled (“dashed”) on the altar (see, for instance, Leviticus 7:2) or smeared on its horns (29:12).
<i><b>flesh hooks.</b></i> Probably long-handled meat forks for positioning the sacrificial flesh on the altar.
<i><b>fire pans.</b></i> These were used for carrying hot coals. The first step in preparing and using the altar comes last in the instructions, for the pails used for cleanup are specified first.

Verse 4

<b><i>4–5.</i></b> It is not clear whether the bronze “grating of meshwork” and the “ledge” are meant to be decorative or functional elements of the altar, or both.

Verse 5



Verse 6

<b><i>poles.</i></b> These bronze poles, inserted into rings attached at each of the corners, make the altar hypothetically portable.

Verse 7



Verse 8

<b><i>hollow.</i></b> This is another vague feature of the altar. Perhaps it is an attempt to deal with the conceptual problem of how an enormous object could be carried, or it may be related to the fact that no upper surface or top for the altar is specified.

Verse 9

ENCLOSURE (27:9–19) In the Land of Israel at the time of the Bible, people typically surrounded the courtyards of homes and palaces with enclosure walls that marked the limits of the premises. The enclosure also controlled the movement of animals and small children and protected the domestic and productive space and its contents from intruders. As the text describes the sacred Tabernacle precinct, its courtyard enclosure also serves as the boundary between holy space within and profane space outside. Despite the many details, directions for positioning the Tabernacle within the enclosure are not provided. (For the descriptive text later in Exodus that parallels this prescriptive section, see 38:9–20.)
<b><i>hangings of fine twisted linen.</i></b> Undecorated linen fabrics form the courtyard walls. They are to be made of the highest quality linen; but unlike the linen used for the interior fabrics (26:1, 31), they are not to be decorated with colored wool and designs. The least sacred zone, the courtyard has less elaborate materials.

Verse 10

<b><i>hooks…bands…silver.</i></b> It is not clear why these fastening devices use a higher grade of metal, while the poles are to be of bronze, a lesser grade substance.

Verse 11



Verse 12



Verse 13



Verse 14

<b><i>14–15. fifteen cubits…fifteen cubits.</i></b> The entrance space left between enclosure hangings is to be about 10 yards (9 meters) across.

Verse 15



Verse 16

<b><i>gate of the enclosure.</i></b> That is, the entrance to the sacred precinct.
<i><b>screen…embroidery.</b></i> The entrance to the courtyard is to be spanned by a textile panel of a more elaborate fabric, apparently the same as the screen for the entrance to the interior space (26:36).

Verse 17



Verse 18

<b><i>hundred cubits…fifty…five cubits.</i></b> Like the tent within, the courtyard is to be rectangular, about 50 yards (46 meters) by 25 yards (23 meters), with fabric walls more than 7 feet (more than 2 meters) high.

Verse 19

<b><i>utensils of the Tabernacle.</i></b> In this summary statement, the word <i>mishkan</i> seems to refer to the Tabernacle precinct—that is, the courtyard—and not the tent structure inside.
<i><b>service.</b></i> Heb. <i>avodah</i> can mean “labor” or “tasks” (as in 1:14), but it more often refers to devotional service such as the offerings on the courtyard altar.
<i><b>pegs…of copper.</b></i> Almost as an afterthought, the instructions mention copper stakes to which guy wires were presumably to be attached, to hold taut the enclosure fabrics and perhaps also the tent coverings.
<i>–Carol Meyers</i>  

Verse 20

<i>Instructions about Oil for Light</i> (27:20–21)
The instructions for making the menorah in Exodus 25 did not mention how it is to be used; instead, the directions for the lamp oil and its use appear here, as a prelude to the units on priestly vestments and investiture. Like the concluding unit of the parashah (instructions about the altar in 30:1–10), this passage might seem out of place. However, the arrangement makes sense since both passages concern specific rites to be performed inside the shrine by Aaron and his sons. (For the descriptive text later in Exodus that parallels this prescriptive unit, see 35:8, 28.)
<b><i>clear oil of…olives.</i></b> Olive oil was one of the major agricultural products of the Land of Israel. Not only did it serve as a clean-burning lamp fuel, but it provided the basic fat source for the ancient diet in the Mediterranean region. Olive oil also had cosmetic and medicinal uses; and it was used to consecrate objects and individuals (see at 29:7). Like blood and water, oil was a liquid associated with transformation and holiness. Olive trees provided relatively stable crops since they were not susceptible to the variations in rainfall and temperature that could harm other food supplies; thus they symbolize fertility in many biblical texts, like Psalm 128:3.
<b><i>beaten.</i></b> Better, “crushed.” Small quantities of oil, as in this context, were probably extracted from olives by placing them in a stone basin or a depression in a rock and then pounding them repeatedly with a stone tool. Because the technology for producing olive oil was similar to the grinding of grain for bread, which was done almost entirely by women (see at 16:3 and 25:30), and because women may have produced stone tools of this sort, the preparation of olive oil—at least in village settings in the Land of Israel—was likely a woman’s task.
<b><i>lamps.</i></b> Heb. <i>ner</i> (lamp), in the singular. The plural translation here may reflect an attempt to align this passage with the idea of seven lamps at the end of the branches of the menorah—perhaps a Second Temple reality, as opposed to a simpler single-lamp tradition for the pre-monarchic tent shrine (see at 25:37).
<b><i>regularly.</i></b> Heb. <i>tamid,</i> which refers to the regular, daily ritual of lamp lighting. The term sometimes means “continually,” but that is not its plain sense here (see next verse).
Later, Jews paired <i>tamid</i> (“regularly”) with the preceding word <i>ner</i> (“lamp”) to form the term <i>ner tamid,</i> the name for the ever-burning, or “eternal,” light that is suspended in front of a synagogue’s ark.

Verse 21

<b><i>Tent of Meeting.</i></b> This designation for the sacred tent shrine appears here for the first time in Exodus. The term “meeting” (<i>mo’ed</i>) reflects the oracular function of such a shrine, in which God would “meet” with a human leader in order to communicate the divine will or provide answers to questions (see 33:7–11). The elaborate and costly Tabernacle (<i>Mishkan</i>) may be fictive, yet it seems to incorporate authentic traditions about a relatively small and simple tent shrine (Tent of Meeting) dating to the pre-monarchic era (see also the introduction to <i>T’rumah</i>).
<i><b>the Pact.</b></i> An elliptical reference to the “tablets of the Pact”—the covenant document to be placed in the Ark (see at 25:16).
<i><b>[to burn] from evening to morning.</b></i> That is, overnight during the dark hours (see 30:7–8).
<i><b>for all time, throughout the ages.</b></i> In the Torah, such language usually signifies an etiology that would give divine sanction to an existing custom by attributing it to the era of Moses and the authority of the Sinai revelation (as in 12:14 and 40:15).

Chapter 28



Verse 1

<i>Instructions about Priestly Vestments</i> (28:1–43)
Like palaces, sacred shrines in the biblical world had coteries of servants to tend the needs of the occupant; in this case, the priests served God’s unseen presence. Appropriate garb for entry into the sacred space of the Tabernacle structure is specified for Aaron, who functions as chief or head priest. Aaron’s name appears many times in this priestoriented text, in contrast to its virtual absence from the equivalent unit in the Tabernacle descriptive texts (see at 39:1–31). The focus here is on Aaron’s garments; only three verses provide instructions for Aaron’s sons’ garments (28:40–43). Less elaborate clothing for the other priests, many of whom are to perform menial and messy tasks associated with the slaughter of animals in the courtyard, is also briefly mentioned.
The text does not indicate who will make the priestly apparel. However, because women were probably responsible for making textiles and clothing in ancient Israel, it is likely that they were responsible for producing the sacral garments, just as they were the ones who produced fabrics for the Tabernacle (see at 35:25).
INTRODUCTION (28:1–5)
This brief introduction names the priestly family, calls for the services of skilled artisans, and lists the items of clothing and materials to be used to make the priestly vestments. (For the descriptive text later in Exodus that parallels this prescriptive section, see 39:1.)
<b><i>your brother Aaron…to serve Me as priests.</i></b> Although Aaron appears frequently in Exodus up to this point, this is the first place that his name is used together with the word “priest.” Aaron’s responsibilities as priest are said to include various matters of ritual (for example, 27:21; 28:35; 30:7–8), judicial proceedings (28:29–30), and instruction (Leviticus 10:11). The Bible never refers to Aaron by the title “high priest”—a term that seems to refer to an office that developed over time so that its responsibilities included also temple finance and management.
As the narrative presents it, Aaron seems to have become the head of the priestly line by virtue of being Moses’ brother. Both are from the family of Levi, and their association with Sinai serves to legitimate the Aaronide priesthood. We know from Exodus 6:20 that Aaron’s mother was Jochebed, and from 6:23 that his wife was “Elisheba, daughter of Amminadab and sister of Nahshon.”

Verse 2



Verse 3

<b><i>all who are skillful.</i></b> More information about the textile workers appears in 35:25–26 and 36:6, where it is clear that female artisans are involved. “Skillful” is literally “wise of heart.” In Israelite society, artisans were held in higher esteem than manual laborers; and their ability to apply unusual talent to create beautiful items was attributed to God.

Verse 4

 Altogether, Aaron will wear seven items (the six mentioned here plus the frontlet in 28:36–37), seven being a symbol of perfection and totality. He will wear breeches too (v. 42), but they would not be visible and probably were not considered sacred. Note the absence of footwear, implying that priests wore no shoes on holy ground (see 3:5).

Verse 5

<b><i>gold, the blue, purple, and crimson yarns, and the fine linen.</i></b> The sumptuous materials to be used for the textiles of the Tabernacle and its partitions (see at 25:4) also to be used for the garments worn by the one entering that holy space.

Verse 6

RITUAL ITEMS FOR AARON (28:6–30) Two highly specialized and somewhat enigmatic items of Aaron’s apparel, the ephod and breastpiece, will have a role in ritual practice. Their collective importance is signaled by the length of the passages devoted to instructions for making these two items; but how they are to be used is never explained. (For the descriptive text later in Exodus that parallels this prescriptive section, see 39:2–21.)
<b><i>ephod.</i></b> The English noun is simply a transliteration of the Hebrew term. A number of diverse sources (Judges 8:24–27; I Samuel 2:18; II Kings 8:8–14) indicate that the ephod’s appearance and function changed over time. It was a ritual garment, a divinatory device, or sometimes both—as seems to be the case here, because of the ephod’s attachment to the “breastpiece of decision.” <i><b>of gold</b>.</i> That is, using gold thread (Exodus 39:3). Fabrics with gold are known from Mesopotamian texts describing garments made to clothe statues of the gods. Golden garments are fit for deities or for their human attendants.
<b><i>worked into designs.</i></b> Like the fabrics of the Tabernacle (26:31, 36; 27:16), the ephod is to have embroidered work.

Verse 7

<b><i>shoulder-pieces.</i></b> Perhaps shoulder straps of a vest-like garment.

Verse 8



Verse 9

<b><i>lazuli stones.</i></b> More likely onyx or possibly carnelian.
<i><b>engrave on them the names of the sons of Israel.</b></i> Engraving gemstones with their owners’ names, and sometimes with a design, was a highly developed craft in the ancient Near East. Engraved stones served as signets or seals and were used for legal or economic documents. Here, engraving the names of the twelve tribes—six on each stone—symbolizes the presence of all Israel in the decisions made with the ephod and gives authority to those rulings; it also carries the implicit hope for divine awareness of the people and their needs (see also at v. 12).

Verse 10

<b><i>in the order of their birth.</i></b> This implies knowledge of the matriarchal narratives of Genesis.

Verse 11

<b><i>lapidary.</i></b> Literally, a “cutter,” meaning an engraver.

Verse 12

<b><i>stones for remembrance…names…for remembrance.</i></b> Ancient inscriptions asking that God “remember” supplicants for good attest to the implicit hope that God will always be mindful of the people and presumably bring them blessings.

Verse 13



Verse 14



Verse 15

<b><i>breastpiece.</i></b> This ornate pouch, square when viewed from the front (v. 16), is attached to the ephod. It contains the enigmatic Urim and Thummim, which probably were lots cast to determine God’s will in legal, military, and other situations (see at v. 30).
<i><b>decision.</b></i> Heb. <i>mishpat,</i> meaning “judgment”; this term provides a clue to the breastpiece’s ritual function. Like most ancient peoples, the Israelites turned to their deity to resolve judicial proceedings that had reached an impasse, often involving the word of one individual against another (see 22:8 and at 25:22).

Verse 16

<b><i>a span…a span.</i></b> The breastpiece is to be about nine by nine inches (a little more than 20 centimeters square).

Verse 17

<b><i>17–21.</i></b> A total of twelve stones, three each in four rows, are to adorn the breastpiece. The mineralogical identity of most of the stones is uncertain. (Thus, many of the names used in the translation are not necessarily accurate.) They seem to be the kind of semiprecious stones that were regularly engraved for use to mark the seals on official documents in the ancient world. Most of the Hebrew seals discovered in the Land of Israel by archeologists bear men’s names; but a small percentage have women’s names, attesting to the fact that some women performed legal or economic transactions.

Verse 18



Verse 19



Verse 20



Verse 21



Verse 22

<b><i>22–28.</i></b> Golden rings, chains, and frames along with a blue cord are to form an elaborate mechanism for securing the breastpiece to the ephod and for assuring the stability of this weighty item.

Verse 23



Verse 24



Verse 25



Verse 26



Verse 27



Verse 28

<b><i>cord of blue.</i></b> Blue seems to have been the most highly prized color—and thus the most fitting for priestly vestments—apparently because blue dyes were more difficult to obtain and prepare than those used for purple and crimson (see at 25:4; <i>T’rumah</i>, Another View).

Verse 29

<b><i>over his heart.</i></b> The heart represents the identity of a human being in the Bible; it was considered the locus of various human functions, including memory.

Verse 30

<b><i>Urim and Thummim.</i></b> No translation is given for these terms because their meaning is so uncertain. They refer to stones, perhaps similar to dice or lots, to be kept in the breastpiece. Their function seems clear: they served as a medium for ascertaining a divine ruling on human problems. (See, for example, Numbers 27:21; I Samuel 14:41–42.)
<b><i>when he comes before</i> יהוה</b>. That is, when he approaches the sacred space closest to God’s invisible presence over the Ark.

Verse 31

APPAREL FOR AARON AND OTHER PRIESTS (28:31–43) The first two ritual vestments, a special robe and an adornment for the headgear, are for the chief priestly official alone. The other items—tunic, headdress, and sash—are for both the head of the priesthood and the next tier of priests. (For the descriptive text later in Exodus that parallels this prescriptive section, see 39:22–31.)
<b><i>robe of the ephod of pure blue.</i></b> Probably a full-length garment, the robe is blue, a color indieating an especially costly fabric. In other biblical texts, this kind of garment is associated with royalty or other high officials only.

Verse 32

 Somewhat like a long vest (sleeves are not mentioned), the robe is pulled on through a reinforced opening for the head. According to I Samuel 2:19, Hannah made a new robe for her son Samuel each year while he served as a priest’s assistant.

Verse 33

<b><i>pomegranates of…yarns.</i></b> The pomegranate was a symbol of fertility and a well-known decorative element in ancient Near Eastern art. Here, they are to be made of woolen yarn that is colored with the same three dyes adorning both the Tabernacle fabrics and the ritual items of Aaron’s garb. That is, these pomegranates would be elaborate tassels to be attached to the robe along with the golden bells.
<i><b>all around the hem.</b></i> The distinctive feature of this robe is its lower portion or “skirt” (rather than “hem”), which is to be specially embellished.

Verse 34



Verse 35

 Bells, which incorporate the sense of hearing into the sensory array of the shrine’s features, apparently had an apotropaic effect, meaning that they were intended to ward off evil. Sounds were believed to protect people, hence the notice that Aaron “will not die” as long as the noise can be heard. In this case, the danger would have been the intense holiness emanating from the presence of God as Aaron entered the holy zone of the Tabernacle.

Verse 36

<b><i>frontlet of pure gold.</i></b> All priests wore head coverings, but the chief priestly official also had an inscribed golden medallion hanging on the headdress, or perhaps an actual diadem surmounting it.
<i><b>frontlet.</b></i> Literally, “flower” or “blossom,” referring perhaps to a rosette-shaped piece of metal. Rosettes, which are depicted as an ornament on the headdresses of deities in Assyrian art, perhaps indicate the high status of the one who wore it.
<b><i>“Holy to</i> יהוה</b>.” The intent of the inscribed phrase is ambiguous; the inscription may indicate the sanctity of the headdress, the priest, the priest’s tasks in the shrine, or some combination of these.

Verse 37



Verse 38

<b><i>that Aaron may take away any sin.</i></b> This clause either suggests an apotropaic (protective) function for the frontlet, or it refers to the expiatory role of the head priest. The term “take away” can also mean “bear, carry”; that is, the priest either carries or removes any sinful aspect of what the Israelites bring as holy offerings to God.

Verse 39

<b><i>fringed.</i></b> The meaning of the Hebrew term is uncertain; it might represent some kind of decorative work.
<i><b>tunic.</b></i> This garment, mentioned many times in the Bible, was the main item of clothing worn by Israelite women as well as men.

Verse 40

<b><i>tunics…sashes…turbans.</i></b> The garb of the other priests does not include the special touches accorded to that of the chief priestly official. Their headdress is to be more of a “cap” than a turban.

Verse 41



Verse 42

<b><i>linen breeches.</i></b> The text prescribes breeches to function as an undergarment worn by all priestly ranks, for reasons of modesty; the Bible does not mention breeches being worn by most people.

Verse 43

<b><i>incur punishment and die.</i></b> Because of the great sanctity of the shrine, proper attire would be essential, and the consequences of having improper vestments would be dire.
<i><b>law for all time.</b></i> See at 27:21.

Chapter 29



Verse 1

<i>Instructions about Consecration</i> (29:1–46)
The ornate vestments provide the priests with authority for their roles only through elaborate and lengthy installation rituals. These instructions are not implemented until Leviticus 8–9, which parallels this prescriptive unit as a descriptive text: it records the investiture and consecration of the priests.
INSTALLATION RITES (29:1–37)
The installation rites are to include three kinds of sacrifices: purgation offering (vv. 10–14), burnt offering (vv. 15–18), and elevation offering (vv. 22–26). The rites will also feature four procedures that focus on the persons involved: washing (v. 4), dressing (vv. 5–6, 8), anointing (v. 7), and carrying out a blood rite (vv. 19–21).
<b><i>you.</i></b> The instructions are addressed to Moses, who himself is to act as priest in ordaining his brother and nephews.
<i><b>consecrating.</b></i> The form of the verb <i>k-d-sh</i> that means “consecrate, make holy” appears seven times in this unit (vv. 1–46), thus indicating the complete sanctity endowed upon the priestly line. Holiness in the ancient world was not an abstract concept, as it is today. A highly positive quality linked with the nature of God, holiness could be acquired through ritual acts by people, animals, places, and things; only then could they approach the powerful sanctity of God, which paradoxically could be dangerous as well as beneficent because of its extreme power.
<i><b>bull of the herd and two rams.</b></i> The Israelite custom of sacrificing these two kinds of animals is given extra significance by relating it to Sinai and the wilderness shrine. All three animals are male probably because killing females would jeopardize milk supplies and breeding.

Verse 2



Verse 3



Verse 4

<b><i>wash them with water.</i></b> Ablutions before approaching the sacred realm were meant to remove impurity. It is not certain whether washing was believed to actually wash off contaminating substances or only to signify their removal.

Verse 5



Verse 6



Verse 7

<b><i>Take the anointing oil.</i></b> Anointing with olive oil had cosmetic and even magical functions in daily life in ancient Israel and in the wider Near East (see also at 27:20). In ceremonial use, anointing served to formalize an elevation in status. Kings and priests were anointed as they took office. Eventually, the eschatological king is called the “messiah” (<i>mashiach</i>), meaning “anointed one.”

Verse 8



Verse 9

<b><i>priesthood as their right for all time.</i></b> Making the priesthood the hereditary right of Aaron and his male offspring effectively precludes women from serving as officiants in the holy precinct. In this regard, the Israelites differed from other ancient peoples, for whom priestesses are mentioned. One possible explanation for the exclusion of women is a demographic one; that is, because infant mortality was high and women risked death in childbirth, women were needed for normal family life and thus were not separated out for Temple or Tabernacle service. (See further Another View.) Establishing a hereditary priesthood meant that most males, those not from the tribe of Levi, were also denied the right to officiate.
<i><b>ordain.</b></i> Literally, “to fill the hand” of Aaron and his sons. This idiom, known in other ancient texts, probably refers to the placing of a scepter in the hands of an official who is being installed into office; it later comes to mean more generally “to install” or “ordain.”

Verse 10

<b><i>lay their hands upon the head of the bull.</i></b> The purpose for this action is unclear. Laying hands upon the bull may transfer their impurity to the animal, which is then destroyed; or it may indicate the transfer of ownership of the bull to God, or both.

Verse 11



Verse 12

<b><i>take some of the bull’s blood.</i></b> The significance of blood as the life force is apparent in many biblical texts; here it may purify the altar.

Verse 13



Verse 14

<b><i>purgation offering.</i></b> See Leviticus 6:17–23.

Verse 15

<b><i>15–32.</i></b> The first of the two rams is a “burnt offering” (vv. 15–18; see at Leviticus 1:3; 6:2); the second ram is the “ordination” offering (29:19–26, 31–32). Likewise, as documents from other ancient Near Eastern cultures indicate, the major sanctuaries of Israel’s neighbors typically featured similarly complex and lengthy procedures using the blood and parts of animals along with cereal offerings.

Verse 28

<b><i>those parts…to Aaron and his descendants.</i></b> Because priests had no land or herds, and thus no source of the agricultural products that provided sustenance, part of the sacrificial offerings were to be set aside as food for priests and their families. “Descendants” typically would include female as well as male offspring who were living in the priest’s household, though vv. 31–34 specify that consumption of the sacral ordination sacrifice is limited to the priests themselves.

Verse 38

DIRECTIONS FOR REGULAR SACRIFICE (29:38–42a) Once the priests have been consecrated, they will be able to perform the obligatory daily offerings, which include meat, cereal, oil, and wine. The basic foodstuffs of the Israelite diet also become foods offered to God, the exalted resident of this resplendent earthly residence.
<b><i>yearling lambs.</i></b> Animals of this age are fully grown; they are sacrificed at this point, before additional investment in maintaining and feeding them is made. Thus, the more expendable male animal is to be used.

Verse 39



Verse 40



Verse 41



Verse 42

SUMMATION (29:42b–46) Once the tent and its furnishings have been made and the priests consecrated, God will consecrate the Tent of Meeting and the whole establishment will become functional.
<b><i>there I will meet with you, and…speak with you,</i></b> God’s communication with humans will take place at the shrine. The “you” in this verse is singular, referring to Moses. The location of this meeting place seems to be the courtyard altar, at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting, or in front of the curtain that screens off the Ark (see 30:6, 36).

Verse 43

<b><i>I will meet with the Israelites.</i></b> The verb “meet” from the previous verse is repeated, making it clear that God will be available to everyone there. The mechanism for the meeting is not clear; it is possible that Moses or Aaron is to be the intermediary.

Verse 44

<b><i>I will sanctify.</i></b> Here it is God who sanctifies; earlier, Moses is the one to do so (see 29:21, 35–36; 30:29–30). Is Moses the alter ego for God? Or are these variant traditions?

Verse 45

<b><i>I will be their God</i></b> This is covenant language, the elliptical half of the statement that the people will be God’s, and God will be their deity (see 20:2).

Verse 46

 Again, covenant language appears in this succinct summary of the entire book of Exodus: God has brought the people out of Egypt, as recounted in Exodus 1–24; then, the people construct a dwelling for God, who will then “dwell” (25:8; or, as the present translation has it here, “abide”) among them, as set forth in Exodus 25–40.

Chapter 30



Verse 1

<i>Instructions about the Incense Altar</i> (30:1–10)
why is the small gilded incense altar discussed here, rather than in Exodus 25 along with the lampstand and offering table that are also supposed to occupy the Holy place? Scholars have offered many answers, yet their explanations of this seemingly anomalous placement remain somewhat speculative. (For the descriptive text later in Exodus that parallels this prescriptive section, see 37:25–28.)
<b><i>altar for burning incense.</i></b> Incense altars were standard items in shrines in the ancient Near East, just as some mechanism for freshening the air was part of every household. This completes the sensory repertoire of items to be used in the interior space of the Tabernacle: sight, taste, sound, and now smell.

Verse 2

<b><i>a cubit…a cubit…two cubits.</i></b> The altar is to be about 1½ feet (1½ meter) square and 3 feet (1 meter) high.
<i><b>horns.</b></i> Like the courtyard altar and the many small incense altars found in the Land of Israel by archeologists, the gilded incense altar’s horns probably would be at the upper corners, projecting upward (see at 27:2).

Verse 3



Verse 4



Verse 5



Verse 6

 The incense altar’s central placement, directly in front of the textile panel that screens the Ark (and the unseen presence of God above it), will make it the most important of the three items of furniture in the room: incense altar, lampstand, and offering table. (On the latter two items, see at 25:23–40.)

Verse 7

<b><i>aromatic incense.</i></b> The wafting upward of the smoke of burning incense may represent a primitive metaphor in which God “smells” the incense in the earthly shrine and thereby notices the officiants and comes to meet them. Perhaps it also represents an attempt to communicate with the unseen Deity via something as ethereal as smoke. At the same time, the smoke conceals God’s presence from the officiant, for seeing God can be lethal (see Leviticus 16:12–13). (For another perspective, see at 30:34–38.)
<i><b>when he tends the lamps.</b></i> Of the lampstand (menorah); see at 27:20–21.

Verse 8



Verse 9



Verse 10

<b><i>blood of the purgation offering.</i></b> This substance is to be brought from the courtyard altar, a less holy zone, and applied to the horns of the incense altar. Perhaps this is one reason that the instructions for the incense altar are separated from those prescribing the other items of utmost sanctity.

Verse 11

<i>Instructions for the Tabernacle</i> (30:11–31:18)
The parashah starts with several supplemental instructions concerning the construction of the Tabernacle, an appendix to the detailed prescriptive texts in the prior two Torah portions.
CENSUS (30:11–16)
Census taking, which was usually a prelude to military conscription or taxation, was considered an inherently dangerous act in the biblical world (see II Samuel 24). Its negative consequences must be pre-empted by paying a half-shekel ransom. Only the men of fighting age (twenty and older) are counted in the census and required to pay the tax, which in this case is to be used for the operation of the Tabernacle; women are not part of Israel’s military and not counted in the census. The high concentration of expiation language in this passage (note the four-fold repetition of the root <i>k-p-r</i> [atone, propitiate], translated here as “ransom” or “expiation”) underscores the text’s anxiety about the supernatural and societal dangers of the census.

Verse 12

Verse 17

LAVER (30:17–21)
The laver, or basin, is to be placed in the Tabernacle courtyard, between the altar for burnt offerings and the entrance to the Tabernacle itself. It is to be used by the priests to wash their hands and feet, thus ensuring that they approach the altar in a state of ritual purity. According to 38:8, this basin was made from mirrors donated by “the women who performed tasks at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting.”

<b><i>Tent of Meeting.</i></b> See at 33:7–11.

Verse 22

ANOINTING OIL (30:22–33) The oil used to anoint the sacred objects and the priests is to be made of four precious spices—myrrh, cinnamon, cane, and cassia—combined with olive oil. Because the oil conveys holiness to whatever it touches, there are severe penalties for its use on profane objects and laypeople.

INCENSE (30:34–38) The incense contains three precious spices combined with frankincense. As v. 36 indicates, the incense created a cloud of smoke that was perceived as the manifestation or sign of God’s presence. (See also at 30:7.)

Chapter 31



Verse 1

ARTISANS (31:1–11) This passage identifies the artisans—Bezalel and Oholiab—who are to make the Tabernacle and its furnishings. Their tasks will include directing and supervising the involvement of other artisans, including women (see 35:25–26; 36:1–4). The passage then gives a summary list of the components of the Tabernacle.

Verse 2



Verse 3

<b><i>divine spirit.</i></b> This phrase <i>(ruach elohim</i>) also appears in Genesis 1:2. Its use here strengthens the connection between the Tabernacle and the cosmos, and likewise between the creative work of God and of the artisans (see also at Exodus 40).

SHABBAT OBSERVANCE (31:12–17) The Placement of the Shabbat commandment here connects the realms of holy space (the Tabernacle) and of holy time (Shabbat). A central concern of the Torah’s priestly theology is the maintenance of these holy realms.

Verse 13



Verse 14

<b><i>person.</i></b> See at Leviticus 2:1.
<i><b>kin.</b></i> Heb. <i>ammim</i>; see at Genesis 25:8.

Verse 16

<b><i>16–17–17</i></b>. In rabbinic Judaism, these verses form the text of the <i>V’shamru</i> (“[they] shall keep”) prayer, which is recited as part of the Shabbat liturgy and as a prelude to <i>Kiddush</i>, the blessing of the wine, on Shabbat morning.

Verse 17



Verse 18

CONCLUSION (31:18)
<b><i>inscribed with the finger of God.</i></b> This image fits with the pervasive anthropomorphic depiction of God in this parashah. Functionally speaking, it portrays the tablets as concrete products and extensions of God’s will.

Chapter 32



Verse 1

<i>Crisis: The Golden Calf Episode</i> (32:1–35)
The Golden Calf episode reveals the challenge of maintaining a relationship between “stiff-necked” Israel and its holy God. For the Rabbis, this incident functions as a “fall” story (akin to how the Garden of Eden story in Genesis 3 functions for Christian and some later Jewish interpreters), meaning that this episode represents a rupture in the intimate connection between God and Israel and necessitates a more distant and mediated relationship.
The placement of this episode highlights the ironic link between the calf and the Tabernacle. In both instances, the people are invited to donate gold for the construction and do so willingly. The gold is then used to manufacture the ritual object and, upon its completion, the people offer sacrifices and celebrate. These similarities set into sharp relief the crucial difference between the Tabernacle, which is sanctioned by God, and the calf, which is condemned as a fatally inappropriate ritual object.
CONSTRUCTION OF THE CALF (32:1–6)
The word <i>eigel</i> (commonly translated as “calf”) refers to a young bull or ox (see Psalm 106:19–20), both of which were symbols of power and virility and associated with the God of Israel and other gods of the ancient Near East. According to I Kings 12:25–33, King Jeroboam—the first king of the northern kingdom of Israel—erected two golden calves, one at Bethel and one at Dan. Historically, these sacred objects probably functioned like the ark and cherubim in the Jerusalem Temple: as thrones or symbols for the God of Israel who was worshipped at those shrines (see at 25:17–21). However, in the biblical text, which reflects a Judean perspective and a later centralization of worship, the calves are condemned as inappropriate and idolatrous.
This biblical polemic provides a context for the Golden Calf episode and demonstrates the complexity of the question of “idolatry.” The Bible and later rabbinic texts imagine that visual representations of God are “idols” that are worshipped as gods by their devotees. However, in most ancient and modem cases, images of gods are understood as symbols or accessories of the god, forms of mediation that help worshippers connect to the deity. Within the parashah, the calf shares many features of the Tabernacle: both are associated with the God of Israel and are constructed out of freewill offerings of the Israelites. However, the calf is condemned while the Tabernacle is legitimated. The overlap between these two forms of mediation demonstrates how complex the questions of divine mediation and religious representation are.
<b><i>“make us a god”</i></b> The word <i>elohim</i> (translated here as “god”) is a plural noun (literally “gods”) that can refer to either a single deity or more than one god. The God of Israel is often called <i>elohim,</i> but with singular verb forms used with that divine name. In this verse, the noun is paired with a plural verb, which might imply that the Israelites ask Aaron to make them more than one god. Or, as this translation suggests, the plural verb is used to signal that the Israelites are demanding <i>a</i> god, rather than <i>the</i> God.
<b><i>“that fellow Moses…who brought us from the land of Egypt.”</i></b> Elsewhere in the Torah, the identification of God as the agent of the Exodus is central to God’s claim to authority over Israel (as in 20:2). But here Moses is identified as the one responsible for the Exodus.

Verse 2

<b><i>“take off the gold rings that are on the ears of your wives, your sons, and your daughters.”</i></b> Aaron directs the men to take jewelry off the members of their household under their control.

Verse 3

<b><i>all the people took off.</i></b> This statement implicates everyone, not only the men, in the construction of the calf.

Verse 4

<b><i>And they exclaimed, “This is your god…who brought you out of the land of Egypt!”</i></b> While the ambiguity of the word <i>elohim</i> (see at v. 1) raises the possibility that the Israelites sought to worship another deity, the phrase “who brought you out of the land of Egypt” and Aaron’s explicit mention of “יהוה” in v. 5 suggest that the people craved a visible symbol of God’s presence. Nevertheless, by attributing these words to the Israelites, the authors of the text portray the people as idolators, who identify and worship the calf <i>as</i> a god.

Verse 5

 Aaron’s response is complex. By constructing an altar, he facilitates the inappropriate, idolatrous understanding of the calf. Yet by declaring a “festival of יהוה,” he redirects the Israelites’ attention to the God of Israel.

Verse 6

 Of the three activities mentioned in this verse, sacrificial offerings and ritual feasting are part of authorized Israelite worship. However, dancing (literally “laughing”) is non-normative and perhaps signals the deviant nature of this impromptu festival.

Verse 7

GOD’S ANGER AND MOSES’ INTERCESSION (32:7–14) While the Golden Calf may be defensible as a legitimate, non-idolatrous religious object from the point of view of ancient Israelite history and theology (see above), the Torah unambiguously identifies its creation as transgressive. This is clear from the fury expressed by both God and Moses.

Verse 8

<b><i>“They have made themselves a molten calf.”</i></b> This verse deflects blame for the calf from Aaron to the people. Throughout the parashah, the degree of blame attributed to Aaron fluctuates. In vv. 2–5, Aaron is portrayed as responsible for creating the calf. Yet here and in vv. 22–24, the people are identified as the creators of the calf. Some scholars have seen this contradiction as evidence for two earlier versions of this story, one pro-Aaron and the other anti-Aaron. It is also possible to read the contradictions as a reflection of the difficulty involved in definitively identifying agency and responsibility.

Verse 9

<b><i>“stiffnecked people.”</i></b> This epithet suggests that the calf is not a sign of Israelite fickleness, but rather of their stubbornness and their inability to adapt to the covenantal relationship with God that was established at Sinai (Avivah Gottlieb Zornberg, <i>The Particulars of Rapture,</i> 2001, pp. 408–9).

Verse 10



Verse 11

<b><i>11–14. But Moses implored.</i></b> Moses uses two rhetorical strategies to successfully dissuade God from destroying the people. First, he argues that God’s reputation will be sullied if God annihilates the very people that God rescued from Egypt (vv. 11–12). Then, he reminds God of the covenant with the ancestors (v. 13). The success of Moses’ intervention is underscored by the reference to Israel as God’s people in v. 14.

Verse 12



Verse 13



Verse 14



Verse 15

MOSES’ ANGER AT THE PEOPLE AND AARON (32:15–29) Moses descends from the mountain with two tablets—which he furiously hurls to the ground. The detailed description of the tablets and their identification as “God’s work” (v. 16) highlight their sacrality and underscore the drama of their destruction.

Verse 16



Verse 17



Verse 18



Verse 19

<b><i>dancing.</i></b> The term here for dancing <i>(m’cholot)</i> probably refers to women’s circle dancing rather than men’s leaping dances, indicating women’s participation in the transgressive acts. In all eight instances where the Bible specifies the performers of this activity, they are women (Exodus 15:20; Judges 11:34, 21:21, 23; I Samuel 18:6, 21:12; Jeremiah 31:4, 13).

Verse 20

<b><i>He took the calf…and so made the Israelites drink it.</i></b> This punishment resembles the ordeal of the suspected adulteress in Numbers 5:11–31, in which the woman suspected of adultery is forced to swallow a potion made with ink from a ritual scroll and with dirt from the Tabernacle floor. While it is doubtful that there is a historical connection between the two cases, the similarities between these texts form the basis of midrashic comments that understand the construction of the Golden Calf to be a form of theological adultery (see further the Post-biblical Interpretations at 32:19).

Verse 21



Verse 22

<b><i>22–24. Aaron said.</i></b> Aaron shifts the blame away from himself by identifying Moses’ prolonged absence as the root of the problem and limiting his involvement to the hurling of the gold into the fire (compare v. 8). Ironically, in his attempt to absolve himself, Aaron ascribes supernatural power to the calf.

Verse 23



Verse 24



Verse 25



Verse 26



Verse 27

<b><i>“Each of you put sword on thigh.”</i></b> The violence perpetrated by the Levites—which contemporary readers may find disturbing—resonates interestingly with the violence perpetrated by their ancestor Levi following the violation of his sister Dinah (Genesis 34). There, Levi and his brother Simeon massacre the residents of Shechem. In Genesis 49:5–7, Levi is also portrayed as violent. While the earlier acts of violence are condemned, this one is praised. (See also <i>Vayikra,</i> Contemporary Reflection.)

<b><i>“Dedicate yourselves.”</i></b> Literally, “fill your hands”—a term that is usually used for the ordination of priests. According to some interpreters, this verse means that by killing their kin, the Levites consecrated themselves to God and earned God’s blessing. Others conclude the opposite: because of their actions, the Levites must dedicate themselves in atonement in order to receive God’s blessing. Note that the massacre does not suffice as punishment or atonement for the people’s transgression, for Moses still needs to beg for the people’s forgiveness and God still sends a plague as punishment (see 32:30–35).
<i><b>“blood relations.”</b></i> [Literally, “his son and his brother.” Grammatically speaking, the reference is indefinite and nonspecific; hence the language does not specify social gender. The present translation presumes that the expression refers to fellow Israelite victims, women or men, to whom the Levites had felt personal devotion. —<i>Ed.</i>]

Verse 30

MOSES’ INTERCESSION AND GOD’S RESPONSE (32:30–35) Moses again intercedes on behalf of the people, pleading with God to forgive them. In response, God grants a suspended sentence, but not complete atonement. In the context of the parashah, this “atonement” forms a stark contrast with the expiation of 30:11–16 with which the parashah began.

Verse 31

<b><i>“Alas, this people.”</i></b> Compare the way that blame is assigned in 32:4–5, 8, 24.

Verse 32



Verse 33



Verse 34



Verse 35

<b><i>Then יהוה sent a plague.</i></b> This verse is in tension both with the preceding one, which indicates that God will reserve punishment until a later time, and with v. 14, which reported God’s decision not to annihilate the people.

Chapter 33



Verse 1

<i>Aftermath</i> (33:1–23)
This unit describes the reconciliation between God and Israel that takes in to account the lessons learned during the Golden Calf episode.
GOD’S REFUSAL TO ACCOMPANY THE ISRAELITES (33:1–6)
God reaffirms the promise of land made to the ancestors. However, God refuses to accompany the current generation, lest their wayward actions prompt divine retribution.

Verse 2



Verse 3



Verse 4

<b><i>4–6. finery.</i></b> Adornment is a prominent motif in the parashah. Jewelry is misused in the construction of the calf (32:2–3), and here “finery” is removed as a sign of penance.

Verse 5



Verse 6

<b><i>from Mount Horeb.</i></b> The Golden Calf episode transpired at Horeb (3:1, 12), also called Sinai (31:18), the very site of the formation of the covenant (Exodus 19 and 24). See also at 18:5.

Verse 7

GOD’S CONCESSIONS AND FORMS OF REVELATION (33:7–23) The focus now shifts to the question of how God will continue to become manifest to Israel and Moses. Several forms of divine revelation are presented, options that span a range of theological thinking, from the abstract—such as God’s name or goodness—to the highly anthropomorphic—like
<i>Tent of Meeting</i> (33:7–11) In the Torah, two different terms are used to refer to Israel’s portable wilderness sanctuary: Tabernacle and Tent of Meeting. The tent described here represents an alternate tradition that differs significantly from the Tabernacle tradition that dominates Exodus 25–31 and 35–40 (see also at 27:21; <i>Vayak’heil,</i> Another View). In the texts that refer to the sanctuary as “Tabernacle,” God’s presence is very powerful and potentially very dangerous; nevertheless, by rigorously maintaining the purity of the shrine, the Israelites can safely preserve the vital presence of God in their midst. Here, the Tent tradition—which is perhaps much older than the Tabernacle one—expresses a different perspective, one in which the stiffnecked nature of the Israelites is incompatible with the divine presence. Therefore, the Tent of Meeting stands outside the camp and only Moses and Joshua can enter it. While this view distances God further from the people, it imagines a far more direct relationship between God and Moses.

Verse 8



Verse 9



Verse 10



Verse 11

<b><i>face to face.</i></b> The word <i>panim</i> (face) is a key term in Exodus 33 (vv. 11, 14–16, 20, 23), appearing seven times. Here it signals a deeply intimate relationship between God and Moses.

Verse 12

<i>Moses</i>’ <i>Request for Revelation and God’s Response</i> (33:12–23) This passage resumes the action from v. 6, as Moses challenges God’s refusal to accompany the people. In his continued persistence in seeking God’s support for the people (see also 32:11–13, 31–32), Moses leverages God’s acknowledged special affection for him in order to benefit the people as a whole. God agrees to once again personally lead the people.

Verse 13



Verse 14

<b><i>“I will go in the lead.”</i></b> Literally, “My face (<i>panai)</i> will lead.” Here and in v. 15, <i>panim</i> is used to signal a degree of divine presence.

Verse 15



Verse 16



Verse 17



Verse 18

<b><i>“Presence.”</i></b> Heb. <i>kavod,</i> which refers here (as in 16:7; 24:17; 40:34–38) to a visible manifestation of God, usually in the form of cloud or fire.

Verse 19

 Here God offers to reveal four aspects of the divine presence: goodness, the name יהוה, grace, and compassion. These terms represent attributes of God that seem to be more abstract manifestations of the Divine than the <i>kavod</i> that Moses asked for.

Verse 20

<b><i>“But you cannot see My face.”</i></b> Here <i>panim</i> (“face”) refers to a manifestation of the Divine that is too intense for a human to experience safely. This verse seems to contradict the earlier account of Moses’ encounters with God “face to face” in the Tent of Meeting (33:11), although that phrase may not be meant literally but rather may denote intense intimacy.

Verse 21



Verse 22



Verse 23

<b><i>“My hand…My back…My face.”</i></b> Verses 21–23 present one of the most rigorously anthropomorphic representations of God in the Torah. The references to God’s face, hand, and back must be understood in literal terms. The radical anthropomorphism communicates a vision of God that is simultaneously dangerously transcendent and intimately protective: God’s body shields Moses from God’s face (<i>panim),</i> which is portrayed as so intense that viewing it would be fatal.

Chapter 34



Verse 1

<i>Restoration of the Covenant</i> (34:1–35)
In the final unit of the parashah, God restores the covenant with Israel, thus affirming that reconciliation is possible, even after a dramatic violation of their relationship. Unlike in Exodus 32, when Moses descends the mountain in fury and breaks the two tablets inscribed by God, this time Moses comes down from Mount Sinai with the new tablets he wrote himself and with his face radiant with his encounter with the Divine.
REVELATION OF GOD’S NAME (34:1–9)
The preparations for this divine encounter resemble the first Sinaitic revelation in Exodus 19–20, but now only Moses can set foot anywhere on the mountain. After exploring various means of divine revelation in Exodus 33, the text reverts to the revelation of the divine name as a central means of divine revelation. (On God’s name, see at 3:14 and 6:2.)

Verse 2



Verse 3



Verse 4



Verse 5



Verse 6

<b><i>6–7.</i></b> This divine self-description, referred to in the post-biblical period as the “Thirteen Attributes,” becomes a core part of the Jewish penitential liturgy for the High Holy Days, festivals, and fast days. This declaration asserts that God grants abundant mercy to the faithful and also inflicts trans-generational punishment for transgressors. (This last point is omitted from the liturgical uses of this passage.)

Verse 7



Verse 8



Verse 9



Verse 10

TERMS OF THE COVENANT (34:10–28) God responds to Moses’ request to accompany and pardon the people by restoring the covenant. This passage begins with God’s promise to drive out the current inhabitants of Canaan. In exchange, the Israelites are to refrain from forming alliances with these inhabitants and to commit to a set of commandments similar, but not identical, to those in Exodus 24.

Verse 11

<b><i>11–12. I will drive out… Beware of making a covenant.</i></b> If God drives out all the inhabitants, how can the Israelites make covenants with them? The conflict in this promise and admonition refleets a tension between two accounts of the settlement of the Promised Land in Joshua and Judges. In one version, the indigenous people are utterly displaced or destroyed; in the other, the Israelites live alongside them in the land.

Verse 12

<b><i>12–15.</i></b> Covenants with the indigenous people are viewed as dangerous because they will lead to the worship of foreign gods.

Verse 13

<b><i>sacred posts.</i></b> Heb. <i>asherim</i> (which appears in the Bible also with a feminine plural, <i>asherot;</i> singular <i>asherah).</i> These ritual objects were probably associated with the goddess Asherah, a goddess who is identified in 14th-century-<small>B.C.E.</small> Ugaritic (northern Canaanite) texts as the consort of the high god El, and who is mentioned in the Bible in conjunction with the Canaanite god Baal. In addition, inscriptions from ancient Israel identify Asherah apparently as the companion of the God of Israel. These inscriptions, and the repeated polemics against the <i>asherim</i> in the Bible, suggest that worship of Asherah through prayers and ritual objects was once a common part of Israelite worship. The rise of strict monotheism in ancient Israel and its insistence on the legitimacy of only one God mandated Asherah’s elimination.

Verse 14



Verse 15



Verse 16

<b><i>And when you take wives.</i></b> The Bible expresses a range of views about marriage between Israelites and non-Israelites, from the prohibition of all marriages between Israelites and non-Israelites, to the ban on marriages between Israelite men and indigenous women of Canaan as seen here. Such marriages are viewed as risky because the women might lure their husbands into the worship of other gods. (See also Another View.)

Verse 17



Verse 18



Verse 19

<b><i>Every first issue.</i></b> In ancient Israel, as similarly in many ancient cultures, the “first-born” of select animals and humans—males only—were perceived as belonging to God and were returned to the deity either through sacrifice or a redemptive substitution. (See also at 13:2, 15; Leviticus 27:26–27; Deuteronomy 15:19–23.)

Verse 20



Verse 21



Verse 22



Verse 23

<b><i>all your males shall appear.</i></b> The requirement to celebrate these three festivals is limited to men here and in 23:17. In contrast, Deuteronomy 16:11–16 requires women to participate in the festivals, although only men are required to make pilgrimage to Jerusalem.

Verse 24



Verse 25



Verse 26



Verse 27



Verse 28



Verse 29

A VISIBLE CHANGE IN MOSES (34:29–35) Moses is physically transformed by his intimate encounter with God. The rays of light radiating from his face provide evidence of his relationship with God; and they inspire fear and, at least temporarily, respectful obedience from the Israelites. This supernatural transformation validates Moses’ role as a legitimate mediator between God and Israel, the third strategy for maintaining a relationship with God.
<b><i>the skin of his face was radiant.</i></b> Heb. <i>karan or panav,</i> literally probably “the skin of his face radiated.” The words <i>karan or</i> were understood by Christian interpreters to mean “horns of light,” which led to the depiction of Moses with horns by many Christian Renaissance artists. Other scholars have argued that “horns” is in fact the correct translation. According to such a reading, as a result of his intimate encounter with God, Moses is supernaturally marked with the sacred symbol of Israel’s God.

Verse 30

<b><i>they shrank from coming near him.</i></b> In 33:12–23, concern was expressed about the revelation of God’s face; here it is Moses’ face that bears the fearsome mark of his intimacy with God.
<i>—Elsie R. Stern</i>  

Chapter 35



Verse 1

<i>Introductory Procedures</i> (35:1–36:7)
Before the Israelites begin carrying out the instructions for constructing the Tabernacle, several introductory steps must be taken. The first part of this parashah begins with two directives, the first concerning the Sabbath (35:1–3) and the second concerning materials (35:4–19). Next comes an account of the people’s response to this call for contributions (35:20–29). Finally, the appointment of artisans to with the materials that begin pouring in is announced (35:30–36:7).
SABBATH OBSERVANCE (35:1–3)
The prescriptive texts containing the instructions for the Tabernacle (Exodus 25–31) concluded with a passage about the Sabbath (31:12–17); the descriptive texts now begin with a somewhat briefer passage on the same subject. The prominence of the day of rest after six days of labor, a contrast to the intensity of the work on the Tabernacle, may relate to the importance of the Sabbath as part of Israelite identity at the time—during or after the exile—when these texts were being collected and redacted. (For the prescriptive text earlier in Exodus that parallels this descriptive section, see 31:12–17.)
<b><i>Moses.</i></b> It is fitting that Moses’ name appears at the beginning of <i>Vayak’heil,</i> for he is mentioned often in this parashah and the next, whereas Aaron’s name appears infrequently in these last two <i>parashot</i> of Exodus. Here, Mosaic (that is, prophetic) leadership dominates rather than priestly leadership.
<i><b>the whole Israelite community.</b></i> The word for community <i>(edah)</i> sometimes refers narrowly to adult males or to officers (as in Numbers 1:2; 27:21); in other instances the term signifies the entire people (see at Exodus 12:3). That the broader sense operates here is indicated by the fact that the Sabbath observance, about which Moses is to speak, includes everyone. Furthermore, when the “whole community” is enjoined to bring materials in v. 4, both women and men explicitly do so (vv. 20, 22). Although (male) priests largely will carry out the cultic activities (see <i>T’tzaveh,</i> Another View), the sacred shrine itself will belong to the entire community; and the resultant presence of God will benefit everyone.
<i><b>things.</b></i> Heb. <i>d’varim,</i> which is the same term used for the stipulations (“words”) of the Decalogue (“Ten Commandments”; see 20:1 and 34:1). Thus, the Sabbath and Tabernacle directives that follow are conceptually linked to the most significant of all divine commands, the Decalogue, as emblematic of the covenant between God and Israel.

Verse 2



Verse 3



Verse 4

DONATIONS FOR THE TABERNACLE (35:4–29) This unit, which elicits the donation of materials for the Tabernacle, is longer and also more systematic than the parallel prescriptive passage in 25:1–9. It specifies not only the materials that are to be collected but also the purposes for which they are to be used. It anticipates the somewhat fuller listing that comes at the completion of the project (39:33–43; compare 31:7–11).
<b><i>whole community of Israelites…יהוה has commanded.</i></b> The language here again indicates that both women and men are included, and it underscores God’s role in this project.

Verse 5

<b><i>heart is so moved.</i></b> when the root <i>n-d-b</i> (“to be willing, be moved”) is used with “heart,” it treats the heart as the source of human motivation. In biblical antiquity, people believed the heart to be the identity or essence of a person (see also at 28:29).
<b><i>for</i> יהוה.</b> The notion that the gifts are for God, which appears twice in this verse and again in v. 24, emphasizes the purpose for which they will be used, namely, to construct God’s dwelling place.
<i><b>gold, silver, and copper.</b></i> These three metals will be used for the components of the Tabernacle according to their proximity to the Holy of Holies. The most sacred objects will be made of gold.
<i><b>copper.</b></i> The Hebrew term also designates bronze (a copper-based alloy), which, given its strength and hardness, is more likely the intended meaning with regard to the Tabernacle.

Verse 6

<b><i>blue, purple, and crimson yarns.</i></b> These were the most desirable and expensive yarns in ancient Israel and the wider Near East. (On the manufacture of these yarns and on women’s role in this process, see at 25:4; at 35:25–26; <i>T’rumah,</i> Another View; <i>P’kudei,</i> Another View.)

Verse 7

<b><i>dolphin.</i></b> This meaning of this Hebrew term is uncertain; perhaps it represents a specific color—probably rust—of tanned and dyed sheep-or goat-skin, rather than a sea animal.

Verse 8

<b><i>oil.</i></b> Along with its many other vital uses in daily life, olive oil served as a clean-burning lamp fuel, and it was used to consecrate objects and individuals (see at 29:7). Like blood and water, oil was a liquid associated with transformation and holiness. The preparation of olive oil—at least in village settings in the Land of Israel—was likely a women’s task. See further at 27:20.

Verse 9

<b><i>lapis lazuli.</i></b> More likely onyx or possibly carnelian.

Verse 10

<b><i>skilled.</i></b> Although the commissioning of the artisans does not appear until the end of this parashah, their work is anticipated here. The word “skilled” translates the expression <i>chacham lev</i> (literally “wisdom of heart”), a phrase that treats the heart as the source of technical expertise and of wisdom more generally (compare at v. 5).

Verse 11

<b><i>Tabernacle, its tent and its covering.</i></b> The term Tabernacle (“dwelling”; see at 25:8 and 9) here has two components: the tent and its coverings.

Verse 12

<b><i>12–15.</i></b> The internal furnishings—the ark, table, lampstand, and altar—are listed in the same order as in Exodus 25, with the exception of the gilded incense altar, which in the prescriptive texts is not mentioned until 30:1–10.

Verse 13



Verse 14



Verse 15



Verse 16



Verse 17



Verse 18



Verse 19

<b><i>service vestments.</i></b> Even though the ceremonial priestly garments are not structural items, they are appended to the list of its components because they are considered part of the shrine.

Verse 20

<b><i>whole community.</i></b> As in vv. 1 and 4, this phrase includes women and men. Here, this designation for the people introduces the response to the call for contributions.

Verse 21

<b><i>everyone.</i></b> Heb. <i>ish,</i> which sometimes means “man” but here is used generically, as is confirmed in 35:22, 29, and 36:6.
<i><b>who excelled in ability.</b></i> The Hebrew expression (literally “whose heart was lifted”) is similar to “skilled” (literally “wise of heart”) in v. 10.
<i><b>spirit.</b></i> Heb. <i>ruach,</i> which refers to the vitalizing force given by God, the “divine spirit” mentioned in 31:3 and 35:31—and manifest in human mental abilities, talents, and emotions.
<i><b>Tent of Meeting.</b></i> The term <i>ohel mo’ed</i> is an alternate, perhaps more ancient, name for the tent shrine usually called the Tabernacle (see at 27:21 and at 33:7–11).

Verse 22

<b><i>Men and women.</i></b> The plural Hebrew word for “women” (<i>nashim</i>) appears rarely in Exodus, only six times: in 1:19 in reference to Egyptian women giving birth; in 15:20 to denote the women who performed with Miriam after crossing the sea; in 22:23 (translated “wives”) to indicate those who will become widows if their husbands disobey God; in 32:2 to signify the female donors of gold used to make the Golden Calf; here, to designate the female contributors of materials for the Tabernacle (note the singular used in 35:29 and 36:6); and in 35:26 to point out female artisans. More often, women are subsumed under collective “masculine” terminology that is employed inclusively, such as <i>ish</i> (in this book often translated generically as “everyone,” as in vv. 21, 23, 24) and <i>b’nei yisrael</i> (“Israelites”—literally “sons of Israel”). Nevertheless, female terms sometimes are essential, as is the case here because of the gender-specific ownership of the costly items to be donated. That is, women owned valuables and could make decisions, independently of their husbands or fathers, about using them as donations (see also at 25:2). The English translation “men and women” obscures the Hebrew (<i>ha-anashim <u>al</u> ha-nashim</i>), which seems to say that the men came “in addition to” the women, perhaps indicating primacy of women as donors.
<i><b>whose hearts moved them.</b></i> The narrative underscores that women were motivated to contribute their resources to this sacred endeavor (see at 35:5).
<i><b>elevation offering.</b></i> Heb. <i>t’nufah,</i> which denotes food offerings in 29:24–27, refers to a special sanctification ritual employed when dedicating something to God. Here, it indicates the special status of the objects to be used for God’s dwelling.
<i><b>brooches, earrings, rings, and pendants.</b></i> Textual and archeological evidence shows that men as well as women wore various kinds of jewelry in the ancient world. The impulse for self-decoration transcended gender, whether to connote status, to offer protection (because shiny jewelry was believed to keep harmful spirits at bay), to indicate a social or political position, to function in economic transactions, or to indicate piety. Note that in 3:22 both sons and daughters wear the precious metal objects taken from the Egyptians.

Verse 23

<b><i>23–24. possessed… possessed.</i></b> The verb (<i>m-tz-a,</i> “to find”) is used here in a passive form to indicate something that “is found” in a given place or with a given person. As shown by the way this verb is used in the legal prescriptions of Exodus (such as 21:16; 22:3), it indicates possession and is tantamount to ownership. Thus, women and men each owned and had the right to dispose of the items listed here.

Verse 24



Verse 25

 This verse and the next one confirm the vital role of women in textile production in the ancient world, a fact confirmed by archeological evidence (see <i>T’rumah,</i> Another View; <i>P’kudei,</i> Another View).
<i><b>skilled women.</b></i> Literally, “every women [with] wisdom of the heart,” thus indicating technological know-how, as in v. 10. Like other female professionals in ancient Israel (such as midwives and musicians), women who were experts in textile production made important contributions to community life and would have experienced the respect of others for their work and concomitant self-esteem.
<i><b>spun with their own hands…spun.</b></i> The word for “spin” occurs in the Bible only here and in the next verse, although references to spindles are found in Proverbs 31:19 and elsewhere. Plant and animal fibers, usually no more than a few inches long, cannot be used directly to make textiles; they must first be twisted tightly, by spinning them on a wooden stick (spindle), to form string or yarn. Spinning techniques, developed and carried out almost exclusively by women, were highly developed in ancient Israel and the wider Near East. Because it is such a time-consuming task, women typically gathered together to spin; such gender-specific group activities likely contributed to female bonding and networks. Proverbs 31 presents an idealized but accurate depiction of an adult women <i>(eishet chayil)</i> in a settled community who produces textiles for domestic use and market.
<i><b>with their own hands.</b></i> Spinning requires the use of both hands—one to hold the spindle and the other to feed fibers onto it—and even then it is difficult to maintain the separate actions of each hand.
<i><b>brought…linen.</b></i> The text is elliptical, in that it has mentioned spinning and now specifies the colored woolen and the linen fabrics; it omits the elaborate dying process required to produce the colored yarns. (For more details on this process, see <i>T’rumah,</i> Another View.)

Verse 26

<b><i>excelled</i></b> As in v. 21, a higher level of expertise is indicated for the female spinners.
<i><b>spun the goats’ hair.</b></i> Extra skill was needed for spinning goats’ hair, perhaps because the hairs tend to be shorter than those of sheep and thus more difficult to pull onto a spindle.

Verse 27

<b><i>chieftains.</i></b> The term for these officials <i>(nasi</i> in the singular) is used throughout the priestly literature of the Torah to designate tribal leaders (as in Numbers 1:16). As in any society with different socio-political ranks, gifts and tribute collected by leaders make them more affluent and thus able to provide the costly gemstones mentioned in this verse.

Verse 28

<b><i>spices and oil.</i></b> These substances for different parts of the ritual are mentioned together here. Although the chieftains bring these items, they likely were prepared by women, who were typically the “perfumers” in ancient Israel (see I Samuel 8:13). Women’s skills in food preparation probably suited them to be the keepers of the special formulas used to produce aromatic substances and fine oils (but see I Chronicles 9:30).

Verse 29

<b><i>men and women.</i></b> This summary of the donation of materials again emphasizes that everyone—women as well as men—participated (see at v. 22 and 36:6).
<i><b>freewill offering.</b></i> Heb. <i>n’davah,</i> which refers to private and voluntary offerings to God. Although Moses has called for contributions, the gifts are considered voluntary.

Verse 30

APPOINTMENT OF ARTISANS (35:30–36:7) With an abundance of materials in hand, the commissioning of the artisans is the last step before the actual construction of the Tabernacle can begin. The designation of these workers, given to Moses prescriptively in 31:1–11, is now announced to the community; and the materials are handed over to the artisans so that they can begin their task.

Verse 31



Verse 32

<b><i>inspiring him.</i></b> The Hebrew here consists of a verb-noun pair from the root <i>ch-sh-b</i> (“to think”), thus emphasizing the creativity and brilliance of Bezalel’s designs, artisanship, and leadership.

Verse 33



Verse 34

<b><i>give directions.</i></b> Although the translation says “directions,” the term generally means basic instruction, which is relevant here. The other workers will owe their artisanship to the teaching abilities of Bezalel and perhaps to those of Bezalel’s second-in-command, Oholiab (36:1), who are not only skilled artisans themselves but also skilled teachers.

Verse 35

<b><i>as workers in all crafts and as makers of designs.</i></b> This phrase divides the procedures into execution and planning. Four procedures have been mentioned: carving, designing, embroidering, and weaving.

Chapter 36



Verse 1

<b><i>all the skilled persons.</i></b> Literally, “every <i>ish</i> [with] wisdom of heart.” The word <i>ish</i> sometimes means “man” but is often used generically when it refers to a category of persons (see at 35:21), as it does here. Because of the mention of “the weaver” in the previous verse, and because the quality of being “wise of heart” was associated specifically with women in 35:25, the present translation presumes that women were among the artisans discussed here.

Verse 2

<b><i>Moses then called.</i></b> God has proclaimed who the artisans will be and has given them the requisite abilities, but it is up to Moses to assemble them.

Verse 3

<b><i>continued to bring.</i></b> Contributions arrive even after construction begins. It seems likely that they are going directly to the artisans, for the builders need to make Moses aware of this over-abundance.

Verse 4



Verse 5



Verse 6

<b><i>proclamation.</i></b> Only an official decree from Moses can stop the flow of donations.
<i><b>“no man or woman.”</b></i> Instead of using a generic term for those receiving the injunction to cease bringing materials, for the third time the genders are mentioned separately, probably because of the prominence of women in contributing items for the Tabernacle (see also at 35:22, 29).

Verse 7



Verse 8

<i>Building the Tabernacle Structure as a Place of God</i> (36:8–38)
With materials and artisans assembled, construction work can begin. The narrative proceeds in a fashion that makes sense technologically: here, the components for the structure are fabricated before its furnishings are crafted, whereas in the earlier, prescriptive texts the furnishings come first. However, the internal order of this unit is the same as in the corresponding unit in Exodus 26: first the coverings (36:8–19), then the frames (36:20–34), and finally the textile partitions (36:35–38).
COVERINGS (36:8–19)
The Tabernacle is a tent. Its major components are two layers of woven textiles (one of a linen-wool mix, the other of goats’ hair) covered by two layers (one of ram skins, the other of “dolphin” skins). The various fastening devices are also enumerated. (See further at the prescriptive text that parallels this descriptive section, 26:1–14. On women’s roles as textile artisans, see at 35:25.)
<b><i>tabernacle.</i></b> The translation does not capitalize this world in this passage (vv. 8–19), to indicate that here the Hebrew noun <i>mishkan</i> denotes only the dwelling’s inner fabric component, which is made of decorated linen.

TEXTILE PARTITIONS (36:35–38) This passage describes the construction of the fabric divider (“curtain” or <i>parochet)</i> that will separate the large interior space into two main sections: the Holy of Holies, and the Holy space—where the daily and weekly rituals of light, incense, and bread are to take place. The other divider (“screen”) will separate the interior space from the surrounding courtyard. (See further at the prescriptive text that parallels this descriptive section, 26:31–37.)

Chapter 37



Verse 1

<i>Constructing the Interior Furnishings</i> (37:1–29)
Once the directions for making the tent’s components have been obeyed, the narrative turns to the furnishings for its interior. The furnishings are made in the order for which instructions have been given in Exodus 25: first the Ark and its cover, followed by the offering table, and then the menorah. However, this unit differs from the prescriptive texts in that it includes the golden incense altar, which is to be placed between the table and the menorah, and also the oil and incense.
ARK AND ITS COVER (37:1–9)
The first item, the Ark, is the holiest. It will be placed in the most sacred space in the Tabernacle—the Holy of Holies—and it will serve as the repository for the covenant document, referred to as the “tablets of the Pact” (31:18). For a people generally reluctant to use anthropomorphic images of a deity, the Ark serves as a symbol of God’s presence. The Ark and its cover (<i>kaporet</i>) also seem to represent a footrest for the invisible God enthroned above it. (See further at the prescriptive text that parallels this descriptive section, 25:10–22.)

The table and the lampstand are to be placed in the second most holy zone, the main room of the tent shrine, along with the incense altar. These items provide two essential needs of a residence: food and drink, and light. (See further at the prescriptive text that parallels this descriptive section, 25:23–40.)

INCENSE ALTAR (37:25–28)
Incense altars were standard items in shrines in the ancient Near East, just as some mechanism for freshening the air was part of every household. (See further at the prescriptive text that parallels this descriptive section, 30:1–10.)

Verse 29

ANOINTING OIL AND INCENSE (37:29)
The section on the furnishings concludes with a single verse concerning two of the substances to be used in the Tabernacle: the anointing oil and the incense. Perhaps the anointing oil is paired with the incense because the two items are similarly associated in the prescriptive text of 30:22–38 and because anointing oil is blended with aromatic substances similar to those used in compounding incense. (See further at 30:22–28.) How the anointing oil is to be used is described in 40:9–15 (see also at 27:20–21); and the burning of incense is mentioned in 40:27 (see also at 30:7).

Chapter 38



Verse 1

<i>Completing the Courtyard</i> (38:1–20)
With the components of the tent prepared and the furnishings constructed, the narrative now turns to the one remaining part of the sacred precinct, the courtyard. Like most households and palaces in the ancient Near East, the Tabernacle is to have an unroofed outdoor space, a courtyard. whereas the other parts of the Tabernacle were reserved for the priests, the courtyard was a place where the rest of the people, including women, could enter and offer sacrifices.
ALTAR AND LAVER (38:1–8)
The altar and laver are to be placed in the courtyard, the third and least holy zone of the Tabernacle. (For the parallel prescriptive texts earlier in Exodus, see 27:1–8 and 30:17–21.)
<b><i>altar for burnt offering.</i></b> The horned altar is made of acacia wood and overlaid with bronze. It is described in 27:1 as being about 7½ feet (more than 2 meters) square and 4½ feet (almost 1½ meters) high. Such a massive wooden altar, even one covered with metal, is unlikely to have been functional; it is possible that altars familiar from a later period have been retrojected onto the image of the Tabernacle altar.

Verse 8

<b><i>laver.</i></b> Placed between the altar and the entrance to the tent, the bronze (“copper”) laver would be filled with water so that priests entering the tent or serving at the altar could perform the purifying and protective measure of washing their hands and feet.
<i><b>mirrors.</b></i> Handheld mirrors made of highly polished metal such as copper were highly valued in the biblical world. That these women owned them indicates they were persons of means.
<i><b>women who performed tasks.</b></i> The word “women” does not actually appear in the Hebrew, for these English words translate <i>ha-tzovot asher tzavu,</i> meaning “those who were doing service.” Because <i>tzovot</i> is grammatically feminine, these persons—sometimes called “servitors” or “women who serve”—are clearly female. (The word “women” actually appears in a similar passage in I Samuel 2:22.) The unusual Hebrew phrase, using a root that otherwise indicates military service, is used in a Tabernacle context both here and for the work of some (male) Levites in Numbers 4. The term seems to indicate the work of a support staff (rather than of officiating priests) that performed menial labor to maintain the sanctuary. This verse thus challenges the prevailing assumption that only men worked in the tent shrine. Moreover, the fact that these women are mentioned in an aside in relation to their mirrors, rather than in a listing of Tabernacle jobs, raises the possibility that there were other female workers in the sacred complex.
<i><b>at the entrance.</b></i> The fact that the narrator felt the need to identify these women on the basis of where they did their job suggests that there may have been other women working elsewhere in the holy precinct. This particular location, most likely in front of the tent and visible to the community, was an important part of the sacred space; certain rituals are carried out there (see, for instance, 29:4, 32, 42), and it is where the pillar of cloud rests when Moses enters the tent to meet with God (33:9–10). This location, at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting, was not off-limits to women (see Numbers 27:1–2).

Verse 9

ENCLOSURE (38:9–20) This parashah concludes with the fabrication of the enclosure, made of fabric panels attached to wooden posts set into metal bases, that surrounds the Tabernacle courtyard and serves as the boundary between the holy space within and the profane space outside. (For the prescriptive text earlier in Exodus that parallels this descriptive section, see 27:9–19.)

<i>Inventory of Donated Metals and Their Use</i> (38:21–31)
This section, which takes the form of archival data recorded by levitical priests, is an inventory of the metals—gold, silver, and “copper” (see at v. 29)—used for the Tabernacle. The kind of information provided about each metal varies. Prior to the tally, vv. 21–23 reiterate that specially designated artisans used these materials.
<b><i>records.</i></b> More precisely, this term probably refers to a record of things that are counted up, as in a tally. The verbal root of this noun <i>(p-k-d),</i> which gives this parashah its name, also is used in Numbers in reference to the census count (as in Numbers 1:3).
<i><b>Tabernacle of the Pact.</b></i> This is the only verse in Exodus in which the words <i>mishkan</i> (Tabernacle) and <i>edut</i> (Pact) are used together (see at 25:9 and 25:16); and the combination is found only three times elsewhere in the Torah (Numbers 1:50, 53; 10:11). The phrase emphasizes that the Tabernacle is the repository for God’s covenant with Israel as well as the place for God’s presence to abide. With this statement, the meaning of Sinai is transferred to the Tabernacle, ready to accompany the Israelites on their journey.
<i><b>at Moses’ bidding.</b></i> This emphasizes Moses’ involvement in administrative concerns, as well as in priestly and prophetic matters.
<i><b>work.</b></i> This refers to the job of producing the tally.
<i><b>Levites.</b></i> The Levites are entrusted with record-keeping for the Tabernacle, perhaps in anticipation of the role they will be given in Numbers 3:6–10.
<i><b>Ithamar.</b></i> One of Aaron’s four sons, he appears first in the genealogical passage in 6:23 and again in 28:1, at the beginning of the instructions for the priestly vestments.
<i><b>Aaron the priest.</b></i> This designation for Aaron rarely appears in Exodus. Aaron’s responsibilities as “the priest” are said to include various matters of ritual (for example, 27:21, 28:35, 30:7–8), judicial proceedings (28:29–30), and instruction (Leviticus 10:11). The Bible never refers to Aaron by the title “high priest”—a term that seems to refer to an office that developed over time so that its responsibilities included also finance and management.

Verse 22

<b><i>all that יהוה had commanded Moses.</i></b> This clause appears only a few times in Exodus up to this point. Now it recurs in rapid-fire succession, fourteen times in this parashah, especially in Exodus 39–40. The phrase emphasizes that the Tabernacle project is the result of Moses’ unique role as intermediary between God and the people.

Verse 23



Verse 24

<b><i>elevation offering.</i></b> Heb. <i>t’nufah</i> (“elevation offering”), which refers to a ritual used to dedicate something to God. Elevation offerings of food appear in 29:24–27 and of gold here and in 35:22. This phrase is also used for “copper” (bronze) donations in this inventory (v. 29), but silver is inexplicably omitted.

Verse 25

<b><i>100 talents and 1,775 shekels.</i></b> Another unlikely large and presumably symbolic amount—more than three times the quantity in the previous verse—is given for the quantity of donated silver.

Verse 26

<b><i>a half-shekel a head.</i></b> The military census that involved individual men’s contributions to the Tabernacle, mandated in 30:11–16, accounts here for all of the silver collected. For some reason, the freewill contributions of silver that presumably came from both women and men (35:24; compare 11:2) are not tallied.

Verse 27



Verse 28



Verse 29

<b><i>talents and 730 shekels.</i></b> Calculating the modern equivalents of biblical weights is imprecise; but it is estimated that a talent, which in the ancient Near East equaled three thousand shekels, would have weighed about seventy-five pounds (33 kilograms). The amassed gold would have weighed more than two thousand pounds (roughly a thousand kilograms), an unlikely amount. Thus, this inventory apparently deals in symbolic numbers, although the nature of the symbolism is no longer clear.
<i><b>sanctuary weight.</b></i> This may be different than the normal weight, but it may also be asserting that the priestly officials were the ones who set weights (see 30:13).
<b><i>copper.</i></b> The Hebrew term probably refers more precisely to bronze; see at 25:3.
<i><b>elevation offering.</b></i> Like gold (v. 24), the “copper” (or bronze) is dedicated through the ritual of the wave offering. The “copper” (or bronze) from the mirrors of the women serving “at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting” (38:8) is not mentioned, perhaps because the laver for which they donated their mirrors is omitted in the list of uses for the “copper” in the next two verses.

<b><i>,550.</i></b> This figure is equivalent to that of the military census in Numbers 1:46; both count only males above the age of twenty. This impossibly large and thus symbolic number, perhaps meant to include all Israelites in times to come, is slightly larger than the number of men who left Egypt: 600,000 men (Exodus 12:37).
<i><b>men.</b></i> Specification of gender does not appear explicitly in the Hebrew here, but it is implied by the act of a military census (see at 30:11–16).

Chapter 39



Verse 1

<i>Priestly Vestments</i> (39:1–31)
The catalogue of priestly vestments is similar to that of the earlier prescriptive texts that provide instructions for making these items (28:1–43). Apparently because of the focus in this parashah on construction rather than use, this unit adds technical details but omits some information about function. The most remarkable difference between the two accounts is the almost complete absence of any mention of Aaron, whose name appears some sixteen times in the equivalent unit in <i>parashat T’tzaveh</i> but only twice here (vv. 1, 27). In contrast, Moses’ name, which is absent from the earlier account of the vestments, appears repeatedly here.
INTRODUCTION (39:1)
The introductory verse mentions only the apparel of the chief priestly officer, whose elaborate vestments are described in considerable detail in the next section. (For the parallel prescriptive text earlier in Exodus, see 28:1–5.)
<b><i>yarns.</i></b> Although other materials are involved in making the priestly apparel, only the dyed woolen yarns, and not even the gold or the linen threads (which appear in subsequent verses), are mentioned.
<i><b>they…made the service</b></i> Although women are not explicitly mentioned, they are likely in view here, given that women were typically the textile workers in ancient Israel (see at 35:25), just as Hannah is said to have made her son Samuel’s robe when he served as a priest at Shiloh (I Samuel 2:19).
<i><b>Aaron.</b></i> This is one of only two places where Aaron’s name is used in this narrative (Exodus 39), in contrast to his prominence in the equivalent prescriptive texts. His complicity in the Golden Calf incident may account for his near absence here. In effect, the text emphasizes the enduring office, not one particular officeholder. It does, however, give Moses a relatively exalted place.
<b><i>as</i> יהוה <i>had commanded Moses.</i></b> This clause appears seven times in this unit (see at 38:22). With seven denoting totality or completeness in Semitic parlance, such repetition gives prominence to the role of Moses, not Aaron, as the authoritative conduit of God’s will, even for making the priestly garments.

Verse 2

RITUAL ITEMS (39:2–21) The vestments of the chief priestly official are not simply items of clothing; rather, they have ritual functions. This description differs from that of the earlier, prescriptive instructions (28:6–30) in adjusting to the different context and in being somewhat less detailed, especially by omitting information about the use of these items.
<b><i>The ephod.</i></b> The biblical sources that mention the ephod (such as Judges 8:24–27, I Samuel 30:7, and Hosea 3:4) contain such disparate information that it is difficult to understand what an ephod looked like or how it was used. Although the appearance and use of the ephod varied over time, what is constant is that the ephod always is related to ritual matters—sometime as a ritual garment, sometimes as a divinatory device, and sometimes as both. In Exodus, its details and its association with the breastpiece of decision make it likely that the ephod was worn by the priest and used for oracular (divinatory) purposes.

Verse 3

 Costly garments embroidered with gold threads, which other ancient Near Eastern cultures used to clothe the statues of deities, were considered to have special sanctity.

Verse 4



Verse 5



Verse 6



Verse 7

<b><i>stones of remembrance.</i></b> According to the earlier, prescriptive text, God had specified that both the ephod and breastpiece be adorned with gemstones engraved for “remembrance” (28:12, 29) with the names of the Israelite tribes. This feature has commemorative symbolic value, bringing all Israel into the Tabernacle with the chief priestly officer as he carries out the rituals thought to help secure the well-being of the people or to adjudicate their conflicts.

Verse 8

<b><i>The breastpiece was made.</i></b> The description of the breastpiece’s manufacture does not use the longer phrase “breastpiece of decision” (28:15, 29, 30), which indicates that the breastpiece plays a role in the judicial functions of the priesthood. Also missing from this passage is any mention of two associated items, the Urim and Thummim (see at 28:30), used by the priest to discern God’s will.

Verse 22

APPAREL (39:22–31) In addition to the ritual items, Aaron and the other priests wear special garments. The description of these garments in this section includes somewhat more detail than in the earlier, prescriptive account (28:31–43), but it abbreviates the information about when these garments are worn (28:34, 41–43). These items of clothing may not have a direct role in what the priests do, but they contribute to the over all sanctity of the Tabernacle and its rituals.
<b><i>The robe.</i></b> The artisans make the special robe for the chief priestly officer. The full-length robe was blue, with bells and multicolored tassels in the shape of pomegranates on the skirt (see at 28:31–35).

Verse 23



Verse 24

<b><i>pomegranates.</i></b> The pomegranate was a symbol of fertility and a well-known decorative element in ancient Near Eastern art.

Verse 25

<b><i>bells.</i></b> The sound of the bells apparently was intended to ward off danger. In this case, the danger would have been the intense holiness emanating from the presence of God as the chief priestly official enters the holy zone of the Tabernacle (28:35).

Verse 26



Verse 27

<b><i>tunics of fine linen.</i></b> A tunic was the standard garment for both women and men in the eastern Mediterranean region for about a thousand years (in the Late Bronze and Iron Ages, from the mid-2nd to the mid-1st millennia <small>B.C.E.</small>).

Verse 28

<b><i>headdress…decorated turbans.</i></b> The headdress of Aaron’s sons is actually more of a cap than a turban. The headgear of the chief priestly official is more elaborate and includes a crown or diadem (29:6); see also at 28:36.
<i><b>linen breeches.</b></i> Earlier in the text, God mandated these breeches to function as an undergarment worn by all priestly ranks, perhaps for reasons of modesty (28:42–43). Undergarments were not part of ordinary apparel in biblical times, nor were they sacral garments.

Verse 29



Verse 30



Verse 31



Verse 32

<i>Summary of the Completed Components</i> (39:32–43)
The completion of the vestments brings to an end the task of making all the components of the Tabernacle. The narrative proclaims this fact (39:32) and then describes how all the constituent parts are brought to Moses for him to see and bless (39:33–43).
ANNOUNCEMENT OF COMPLETION (39:32)
Although some consider this verse a concluding observation to the preceding unit on the vestments, the language seems to be quite general, referring to the completion of the components of the entire project.
<b><i>completed.</i></b> The term for completing the work is the same as that used in Genesis 2:1, 2 for the completion of God’s creation of the world. This allusion to divine creation, in which the construction of God’s earthly abode reflects aspects of the creation of the world, anticipates the profusion of such allusions in Exodus 40.
<i><b>Tabernacle of the Tent of Meeting.</b></i> These two designations, <i>Mishkan</i> and <i>Ohel Mo’ed,</i> are juxtaposed only here and in 40:2, 6, 29, thus bringing together the sacred shrine’s two functions: the Tabernacle (<i>Mishkan</i>) as dwelling-place for God (see at 25:8), and the Tent of Meeting <i>(Ohel Mo’ed)</i> as the place where God will “meet” with priestly and prophetic leaders to communicate the divine will (see at 27:21).
<i><b>The Israelites did so.</b></i> Artisans have actually done the work, yet they represent the Israelites. All the people—women and men—contributed materials; and the edifice will serve them all.
<b><i>as</i> יהוה <i>had commanded Moses.</i></b> This clause is used to attribute the making of the Tabernacle’s components to Moses’ role as mediator of God’s commands.

Verse 33

GENERAL INVENTORY OF COMPLETED COMPONENTS (39:33–43) Moses has commissioned all the components of the Tabernacle, which now are brought to him. The items are listed in the order in which they have been made.
<b><i>Tabernacle.</i></b> Here the term <i>mishkan</i> designates the entire complex, with its furnishings and installations, in contrast to 26:1–14 and 36:8–19, where the term denotes just the tent itself.

Verse 42

<b><i>Just as יהוה had commanded Moses.</i></b> In somewhat abbreviated and rearranged fashion, this verse repeats v. 32, which began this inventory passage.

Verse 43

<b><i>when Moses saw…Moses blessed them.</i></b> This verse contains another echo of the first creation account of Genesis. Just as God saw all the created components of the universe in Genesis 1, so Moses sees all the components of the Tabernacle. And just as God offers a blessing at the end of creation (Genesis 2:3; see also 1:22, 28), so Moses blesses the people who have completed their creative tasks.

Chapter 40



Verse 1

<i>Erection and Consecration of the Tabernacle</i> (40:1–38)
The last unit of this parashah mirrors Genesis 1, in which God’s creative acts are first stated (“Let there be…”) and then carried out (“…and so it was”). The first half of Exodus 40 is the equivalent of “Let there be…,” in which God gives Moses a final set of instructions for erecting the sacred shrine (vv. 1–16). The next part of the unit reflects the “…and so it was” aspect of the Tabernacle (vv. 17–33). Thus the erection of God’s earthly abode is tantamount to the creation of the world; indeed, as was the case for temple buildings in the ancient Near East, the Tabernacle is conceptually a microcosm of the universe. (See also <i>Vayak’heil,</i> Contemporary Reflection.)
The last few verses of Exodus describe God’s entry into the Tabernacle (vv. 34–38).
DIRECTIONS FOR ERECTING THE TABERNACLE COMPLEX (40:1–8)
The order of God’s succinct instructions fits the logic of building construction.

Verse 2

<b><i>first day of the first month.</i></b> This refers to New Year’s Day. Thus, the beginning of the existence of the shrine, which is a microcosm of the cosmos, is keyed to the creation of the world. It is as if God’s role as omnipotent creator is mirrored in and signified by God’s earthly abode. But the Tabernacle’s existence is also keyed to the beginning of Israel’s existence as a free people: it comes nine months after the people arrive at Sinai (19:1) and virtually on the first anniversary of the beginning of freedom, which was on the “fourteenth day of the first month” (12:6, 18). The month is not named, but it is probably Nisan. Thus the Tabernacle would be completed in time for the first celebration of Pesach (see Numbers 9:1–14).
<i><b>set up.</b></i> The priestly narrator frequently, as here, uses a causative form of the Hebrew verb (<i>k-w-m</i>, “to stand, rise”) to indicate the establishment of the <i>Mishkan.</i> (On the “priestly” voice in the Torah, see At the Tent of Meeting.) In priestly texts, the root also occurs as part of the expression “to establish the covenant” with God (see 6:4). Using the same verb for the Tabernacle and the covenant provides a connection between these two foundational aspects of Israelite national life.
<i><b>Tabernacle of the Tent of Meeting.</b></i> This phrase is an inclusive term for the portable wilderness edifice (see at 39:32).

Verse 3

<b><i>3–8.</i></b> This is the briefest of all the listings of the fixed components of the sacred shrine, and it excludes the vestments.

Verse 4



Verse 5



Verse 6



Verse 7



Verse 8



Verse 9

DIRECTIONS FOR ANOINTING THE TABERNACLE COMPLEX AND PERSONNEL (40:9–16) Erecting the shrine does not in and of itself make it sacred. A special ceremony of consecration—in which all the components (including the vestments), as well as the priests themselves are anointed—will change the status of the entire complex from profane to holy.
<b><i>anointing oil.</i></b> Anointing brings about an elevation of status in the ancient Near East and in ancient Israel (see at 29:7).
<i><b>consecrate.</b></i> The allusions to creation continue, for the Hebrew here echoes the language of Genesis 2:3, when God blesses and consecrates the seventh day (in the present translation, “made it holy”).

Verse 10



Verse 11



Verse 12

<b><i>12–15.</i></b> This section discusses the same three procedures—washing, enrobing, anointing—as prescribed in Exodus 29. However, there is no hint of the elaborate sacrificial offerings detailed in that unit. Perhaps the Aaron-centered nature of the sacrifices would have been out of place in this Mosescentered conclusion.

Verse 13



Verse 14



Verse 15

<b><i>throughout the ages.</i></b> This is language typically used to justify a status or practice at the time of the narrator on the basis of its authoritative origin (as in 12:14).

Verse 16

 Since Moses appears here and in 40:1, he frames the two sets of directives, thus intensifying his involvement with all these final tasks assigned by God.

Verse 17

EXECUTION OF THE DIRECTIONS (40:17–33) Moses now carries out God’s commands to erect the Tabernacle and all its components. There is no mention, however, of the vestments or the consecration of the priests (see Leviticus 8). The clause “as יהוה commanded Moses” appears seven times in this passage (vv. 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, and 32), echoing the seven units of time in the creation account of Genesis 1–2:4. As the world was created in seven days, so the Tabernacle—the microcosm of the world—is erected in seven stages. The exalted God-like role of Moses is reflected in the attribution to him alone of all the elaborate construction work, inconceivable without a team of workers.
<b><i>first month of the second year, on the first of the month.</i></b> The same information was given in 40:2, although here the year is added—presumably “the second year” after the departure from Egypt.

Verse 18

<b><i>18–33.</i></b> This passage presents a final listing of the components of the sacred shrine, including the initial use of all the ritual components. Moses eclipses Aaron once more in this parashah by initiating what are otherwise considered priestly assignments. Moses already possesses sanctity, which the priests do not gain until they have been sanctified by being washed, clothed, anointed, and daubed with ritual fluids—procedures not mentioned until Leviticus 8.

Verse 30

<b><i>He placed the laver between the Tent of Meeting and the altar.</i></b> The laver, or wash basin, was made from mirrors donated by women (see at 38:8). Washing from it symbolized or effected the purification of the priests before they performed sacral rites.

Verse 31



Verse 32



Verse 33

<b><i>When Moses had finished the work.</i></b> In this edition of the Torah, this clause is considered the beginning of a new unit of thought. However, it could also be translated “and Moses finished his work,” thus completing the account of Moses erecting the shrine. Either way, the language echoes Genesis 2:2, “God finished the work” of Creation.

Verse 34

ENTRY OF GOD’S PRESENCE (40:34–38) Moses has completed the creation of God’s earthy abode; now the divine presence can enter the sacred shrine. This passage is the climax of this parashah, and indeed of the entire book of Exodus. The promise that God would dwell among the people and be their God can now be realized (see at 25:8; 29:45). What an enormous contrast: the homeless people who departed Egypt now have a glorious home for their deity!
<b><i>cloud.</i></b> The narratives of the wilderness, Sinai, and the Golden Calf all associate the cloud with the divine presence (see at 13:21). Its appearance here links these major elements of the book of Exodus with the Tabernacle project.

Verse 35

 At first glance it seems surprising that Moses and God’s presence could not be in the tent at the same time—especially in light of 33:9–11, where God spoke directly to Moses inside the Tent of Meeting (outside the camp) while the cloud hovered at the entrance. However, the present passage concerns the function of the cloud (and fire) in the journey to the Promised Land that is about to start up again, not the oracular function of the tent as expressed in Exodus 33.
<i><b>settled.</b></i> The verb comes from the root <i>sh-k-n,</i> which means “to dwell” as well as “to settle” (see at 25:8); it is the root for the noun <i>mishkan</i> (Tabernacle) as well as <i>Shechinah</i> (see <i>T’rumah,</i> Post-biblical Interpretations).

Verse 36

<b><i>When the cloud lifted.</i></b> God does not permanently fill the shrine. When the cloud lifts, the people dismantle and pack up the Tabernacle and then travel onward. God is not confined to a single place or space, although God’s imminence is more likely in the sacred space—Tabernacle or Temple—that the people construct according to divine specifications.

Verse 37



Verse 38

<b><i>journeys.</i></b> Heb. <i>masa</i>. It is fitting that Exodus ends with this word; its verbal root <i>(n-s-e)</i> was used frequently in Genesis for the movements of the ancestors, including their descent to Egypt (Genesis 46:1). The same root then appeared in Exodus to indicate the stages of travel of the Israelites from Egypt to Sinai (12:37; 13:20; 16:1; 17:1; and 19:2). It is also found frequently in Numbers, in reference to the wilderness wanderings (as in Numbers 10:12). Thus, the word “journeys” situates the entire Exodus narrative within the larger story of the Torah. Just as important, the concluding verse of Exodus proclaims that the Israelites will not be alone on their long and difficult journey to the Promised Land. Rather, they are to be guided night and day by the luminous cloud of God’s presence.

Leviticus



Chapter 1



Verse 1

<i>Procedures for Three Basic offerings</i> (1:1–3:17)
The first unit of Leviticus functions as an overview and describes the “what” and “how” of the most common sacrifices that Israelites must bring. The emphasis falls on the types of offerings and the procedures for conducting the sacrifices, rather than on the occasions calling for sacrifices.
This unit reads like an instruction manual, which it may have been. But note that these instructions are to be disclosed to all Israel, whereas in other cultures priests typically guard the knowledge about their professional rites of worship. Although Leviticus preserves the priests’ privileged monopoly regarding the service at the altar and its sacrifices, these instructions demystify the priests’ role by making knowledge about their activities known to every Israelite.
The anthropologist Mary Douglas observes that the arrangement of the offerings on the altar recreates a movement from the outside (of the animal’s body) to the center and toward greater holiness. A similar journey takes place as a person enters the Tabernacle, or as Moses ascends Mount Sinai (<i>Leviticus as Literature,</i> 1999, ch. 4). Douglas also notes the relationship between what is offered on the altar and what a person may eat (Leviticus 11): The meat that one may offer God is the same as that which one may eat. The parallels make the human body an analogue to the Tabernacle: a holy place designated for serving God.
Sacrifice takes place at the altar located at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting. The procedure for most types of sacrifices is similar: First, someone brings a sacrificial offering either on their own behalf or on behalf of their household (some or all of whom may be present); that person presents the sacrificial offering to a priest. When the offering is an animal, the person lays a hand on it. Next, the animal is slaughtered, possibly by the person who provides the offering. (Most likely over time, the priests as experts assumed the task of slaughtering on the offerer’s behalf.) The priest collects the animal’s blood and dashes it on the four corners of the altar—apparently as a purifying substance. Afterward, the animal is skinned and sectioned (probably by the priest and his assistants), and its entrails and skin are washed. Finally, the priest prepares the fire and then lays down the appropriate pieces of the animal on the altar for the sacrifice. Burnt offerings are burned completely, while other offerings provide meat for the priests or the community as a whole. Eating the appropriate portions of the offering constitutes the final step of the ritual.
BURNT OFFERING<i>—olah</i> (1:1–17)
The Hebrew name of this offering, <i>olah,</i> comes from the root <i>e-l-h,</i> meaning “to go up,” and expresses the idea that the entire offering “goes up” to God as smoke, the substance into which the animal has been transformed by fire. The burnt offering is unique because all of it must be burned, except for the skin. The English term “holocaust” originally referred to this specific sacrifice. The text makes no mention of the purpose of the ritual. The idea seems to be that this gift of life belongs completely to God—who gives life. It may express a recognition that a part of what one has received from God must return completely to God. God demands of Abraham a burnt offering, namely, Isaac (Genesis 22). Leviticus 23 is one of several passages that describe occasions that require a burnt offering.
The fact that the burnt offering usually appears first in a series of sacrifices suggests that its purpose may be to open up communication with the Divine; if so, then that goal would be accomplished by manifesting generosity—giving part of one’s wealth to God (David Stein, personal communication).
 <b>יהוה <i>called to Moses.</i></b> This opening of Leviticus follows the conclusion of the book of Exodus (40:38), which describes the completion of the Tabernacle. Now that God’s abode is complete, Leviticus provides instructions for its proper use. The only other place in the Torah where God “calls,” rather than speaks, to Moses is when summoning him to the top of Mount Sinai (Exodus 24:16).
<i><b>from the Tent of Meeting.</b></i> The portable Tent, which will accompany the Israelites through the wilderness, symbolically replaces Mount Sinai as the source from which divine messages come.

Verse 2

<b><i>Speak to the Israelite people.</i></b> Leviticus begins with an address that is intended for the people as a whole, not only for an elite group of priests. In so doing, the book establishes the principle that priestly activities are open to scrutiny by the people as a whole. Just as this “manual” for priestly activities is to be taught to all Israel, so the legal precepts of the Torah are to be taught to all the Israelites (for example, Exodus 21:1).
<i><b>When any of you.</b></i> The Hebrew has “when an <i>adam</i> from among you.” Because the word <i>adam</i> refers to a human being in a generic sense (see at Genesis 1:26; 5:2), the language of this verse makes clear that the laws apply to both women and men. The subsequent verbs and pronouns appear in a masculine form only for the sake of agreement with <i>adam</i> as a grammatically masculine noun. (Hebrew has no neutral “it”; all verbs take a masculine or feminine form that matches the grammatical gender of the subject; in this case, as in many others, the noun’s grammatical gender has nothing to do with social gender. For example, “a table” is grammatically masculine and “a door” is feminine.)
<i><b>presents an offering.</b></i> English has no good way of reproducing the important wordplay embedded in this phrase. The two Hebrew words translated as “presents” and “offering” (<i>yakriv…korban</i>) are derived from the same root, <i>k-r-b,</i> meaning “to come near.” Thus, the language of sacrifice carries a sense of coming close to the Divine, describing a safe way to interact with the supreme power. The precautions taken by ancient worshippers and priests (such as approaching only in specified ways and times) are analogous to those taken by modern technicians when handling radioactive material: potent energy that can heal and kill must be approached with maximum attention to protective procedures.

Verse 3

<b><i>If your offering is…from the herd</i></b>. Different types of animals can be used as a burnt offering: cattle, sheep, or goats (1:10–13), or birds (1:14–17). The procedure is essentially the same for each one.
<b><i>your</i></b>. In Hebrew, a masculine third-person pronoun refers back to adam (see at v. 2). In this passage, the present translation conveys the gender inclusive sense by rendering such pronouns in the second person.
<b><i>male without blemish</i></b>. It is not clear what the animal’s sex symbolizes. Nicole Ruane, who examines the sacrificial system with regard to the sex of its victims, concludes that the highest level of holiness is symbolized in Leviticus by perfect masculinity. Femininity can express various gradations away from the ideal (<i>Sacrifice, Purity and Gender in Priestly Law</i>, forthcoming).

Verse 4



Verse 5

<b><i>The bull shall be slaughtered</i></b>. The Torah does not specify who slaughters the animal-the one who has brought the offering (hence either a woman or a man) or the priest. As Mayer Gruber points out, ancient Near Eastern texts and pictures portray sacrificial slaughter by women as well as by men (“Women in the Cult,” 1992, n. 37). The story of the woman in En-dor, who slaughters a stall-fed calf in her home to feed King Saul, suggests that it was considered unremarkable that a woman slaughtered large animals (I Samuel 28:24).
<b><i>blood.</i></b> Blood represents life. Thus, Leviticus 17:11 states: “For the life of the flesh is in the blood.…It is the blood, as life, that effects expiation.” In Leviticus, the blood of ritually slaughtered animals functions as the element that erases impurities, much like a disinfectant is used in the modern world to remove unwelcome bacteria.

Verse 6



Verse 7



Verse 8



Verse 9

 In contrast to other sacrifices, the burnt offering is to burn completely. This feature may express a belief that all that one owns belongs to God, and thus a part of one’s belongings must return completely to God.
<b><i>turn the whole into smoke.</i></b> The transformation of substance into smoke that rises into heaven seems also to convey the worshipper’s communication to an invisible God. This ephemeral substance visibly travels heavenward, the space often associated with God’s abode.

Verse 10

<b><i>If…from the flock.</i></b> See at 1:3.

Verse 11



Verse 12



Verse 13



Verse 14

<b><i>birds.</i></b> offering a bird provides an alternative to livestock, no doubt to make the ritual more affordable to persons with meager means (compare 12:8).

Verse 15



Verse 16



Verse 17

<b><i>pleasing odor to יהוה.</i></b> This refrain concludes the descriptions of other offerings as well. It signals the belief that the smoke reaches God, who welcomes this offering. This anthropomorphism (representation of God as possessing human characteristics) reflects a level of comfort with references to God’s physicality despite the theoretical rejection of God’s corporeal nature.

Chapter 2



Verse 1

MEAL OFFERING—<i>minchah</i> (2:1–16) This section contains two parts. The first passage (vv. 1–13) discusses wheat offerings that can be made throughout the year. The second part (vv. 14–16) concerns a special offering at the start of the wheat harvest. The word <i>minchah</i> means “gift” and expresses the idea that an offering is a gift to God (compare Genesis 32:14).
<b><i>1–13.</i></b> This passage describes a type of offering that can accompany animal sacrifices or be an independent offering. The ingredients for this <i>minchah</i> (“meal offering”) are semolina (the choice sifted granules from ground wheat kernels), olive oil, and frankincense. The offerer can prepare it in one of three ways: griddle, pan, or oven. According to Leviticus 5:11, a poor person can substitute this offering for more costly offerings in certain situations. This section does not specify the purpose of the offering or prescribe words to recite.
<b><i>person.</i></b> Heb. <i>nefesh</i>; like the word <i>adam</i> (see at 1:2), it is an inclusive term for a human being.

Verse 2



Verse 3

<b><i>the remainder…shall be for Aaron and his sons.</i></b> Unlike the burnt offering that is completely consumed by fire, the <i>minchah</i> offering is shared by the priests and their families. Priests were not to own land and thus were unable to grow crops or keep livestock. Their allocations from the sacrifices thus constituted their livelihood. (On the distinction between a priest’s sons and his daughters, see <i>Tzav,</i> Another View, and at Leviticus 22:12–13.)
<b><i>a most holy portion.</i></b> Heb. <i>kodesh kodashim,</i> which applies here to the remainder of the offering for the priests’ use. Elsewhere, it also designates the holiest part of the Tabernacle <i>(kodesh hakodashim,</i> the Holy of Holies; for example, Exodus 26:34) and later of the Temple. The language creates an analogy between sacred space and food offerings.

<b><i>14–16.</i></b> The second type of <i>minchah</i> refers to ripe grain from the new crop that is roasted and then made into grits. The priest offers a token portion of the roasted grain mixture to God. This offering may represent the produce of the earth returned, in gratitude, to the God responsible for the fertility of the land.

Chapter 3



Verse 1

WELL-BEING OFFERING—<i>sh’lamim</i> (3:1–17) The offering of <i>sh’lamim,</i> translated here as “sacrifice of well-being,” resembles the burnt offering but with one main difference: only a portion of it “turns into smoke” (see below for details). The largest part of the sacrifice is distributed between priests and offerers, thus providing food for the Israelites. This passage does not mention a specific occasion, but subsequent instructions link the <i>sh’lamim</i> with celebrations and show that often this offering was to be brought after a burnt offering. It constitutes the basic form of sacrifice for feast days (Deuteronomy 12:11–12). This means that when Israelites brought sacrifices, some offerings were solely for God, as it were, and some to be eaten by community members.
This practice turns the eating of meat into a sacred act (17:1–7) and reflects the concern for taking life for human consumption; the sacrifice has nothing to do with atonement. As Jacob Milgrom observes, this ritual allowed the Israelites to acknowledge the miracles of their lives and express gratitude for them (<i>Leviticus: A Book of Ritual and Ethics,</i> 2004, p. 28).
<b><i>your.</i></b> See at 1:2.
<i><b>well-being.</b></i> Heb. <i>sh’lamim,</i> a word related to <i>shalom</i> or <i>shalem,</i> and which therefore means “wholeness,” “well-being,” or “peace.” Baruch Levine renders it as “a sacred gift of greeting,” an expression that enriches one’s awareness of the function of this offering.
<i><b>of the herd.</b></i> A variety of animals qualify for this sacrifice. (See at 1:3.)
<b><i>a male or a female.</i></b> It is not clear why either male or female animals may be used in this case.
<b><i>bring.</i></b> The Hebrew root is <i>k-r-b,</i> which also forms the words for both “sacrifice” and “nearness” (see at 1:2).

Verse 2



Verse 3

<b><i>3–5.</i></b> These verses describe the parts of the animal that are consumed in their entirety. The procedures are similar to the burnt offering, except that only specified portions of the animal are placed on the altar to be burnt: certain fatty portions, including the fat that covers the entrails and the kidneys and is on the loins, as well as an appendage on the liver, and the two kidneys. The rest is divided between the priest and the one making the offering.

<b><i>you must not eat any fat or any blood.</i></b> The prohibition against eating blood is explicitly linked elsewhere with the conviction that blood represents life (see at 1:5 and 17:11). However, it is not obvious why the fat is prohibited. Perhaps this is another way of offering the best to God, since fat is considered valuable in a number of passages (see, for example, the expression “the fat of the land” in Genesis 45:18).

Chapter 4



Verse 1

<i>Procedures for Offerings to Restore Order</i> (4:1–5:26)
Leviticus 4 and 5 link two major types of offerings to offenses that undermine the balance of the created order. The book of Leviticus maintains that God has created a harmonious world and that persons must—and can—restore that harmony even when they have transgressed and thereby damaged such harmony. The earlier, conventional English terms for the two offerings in this unit are “sin offering” and “guilt offering” (based on the root meanings of the Hebrew names of these sacrifices; see below). But the more current terminology, which replaces “sin” with “purgation,” and “guilt” with “reparation,” better captures the function of these offerings: the purgation offering clears away the damaging substance; and the reparation offering reconstructs or restores the system to its normative, harmonious wholeness.
These offerings take place in a world in which the spiritual was perceived as integral to the physical—and thus directly affecting the physical. Israel’s neighbors (and no doubt many Israelites) believed in demons, a view that Leviticus rejects by ignoring it (see the lone, obscure mention of <i>se’irim</i> in 17:7).
Nonetheless, Leviticus regards (invisible) spiritual and moral transgressions as causes of physical (visible and invisible) harm that can be “managed” by proper rituals. At the most immediate level of priestly concern, the impurity of transgressions is considered capable of becoming airborne and contaminating the sanctuary. Thus, the purgation offering aims to cleanse the sanctuary of such contamination, much like a disinfectant purges a hospital room from harmful bacteria.
PURGATION OFFERING—<i>chatat</i> (4:1–5:13)
<i>Introduction</i> (4:1–2)
The name of this sacrifice, <i>chatat,</i> is derived from the same root as the word <i>chet</i> (sin); it means “that which cancels out sin.” The English term “purgation” (purification or decontamination) succinctly captures the ritual’s function. The analogy between the Tabernacle and the larger world—microcosm and macrocosm—means that such acts have even wider ramifications. In a symbolic sense, one is restoring order to the world as a whole.
The <i>chatat</i> follows upon any accidental—not deliberate—violation of certain ethical and ritual prohibitions, of things “not to be done” (4:2, 13, 22, 27). The person who brings the <i>chatat</i> then “shall be forgiven” (4:20, 26, 31, 35).
This offering takes different forms depending on the social status of the transgressor. The different steps indicate greater degrees of responsibility and culpability, with infractions by priests being subject to the most stringent procedures. The rules thus emphasize accountability rather than privilege.

Verse 2

<b><i>person.</i></b> Heb. <i>nefesh,</i> which indicates that the law applies equally to women and men (see at 1:2).
<i><b>unwittingly incurs guilt.</b></i> The concern is with inadvertent moral or physical violations.

Verse 3

<i>When the Priest Incurs Guilt</i> (4:3–12) Impurity of the priest in charge of sacrificial rituals (see 6:15) puts everyone at the greatest risk because his impurity infects the sanctuary most directly. The procedure for this offering resembles that of the well-being offering, with one telling exception: the priest, who in other instances benefits from animal sacrifices (see Leviticus 3), is not permitted such gain in this case.
The priest’s purification ritual is more extensive than that of a layperson who transgresses (see below, vv. 27–31). In addition to offering a sacrifice, the priest must also purify the inner altar and other parts of the sanctuary, especially just in front of the Holy of Holies (see Exodus 25–26 for the arrangement of the Tabernacle and its furnishings).

<b><i>the rest…outside the camp.</i></b> The priest who unwittingly transgresses does not benefit from the offering. (Ordinarily, a portion of the well-being offering is not placed on the altar but rather is available to the priest and layperson for their consumption. Here, the entire animal is eventually burned; parts are placed on the altar, but the rest is burned away from the altar.)

Verse 13

<i>When the Congregation Incurs Guilt</i> (4:13–21) This ritual of purification is essentially identical to the procedure for the offending priest: a bull is brought for sacrifice and the Tabernacle is purified, particularly the inner altar and the space separating the Holy from the Holy of Holies. On behalf of the community, the elders (persons who achieved distinction either due to age, experience, or wealth) place their hands on the bull at the beginning of the ritual. At the end, no one benefits from the animal’s meat.
<b><i>the community leadership.</i></b> Literally, “the entire community”; this translation aims to clarify that the word for community, <i>edah</i> (which is related to the word <i>eid,</i> “witness”), refers more precisely here to a representative body of some kind, most likely made up of adult males.
<i><b>congregation.</b></i> Ezra 10:1 defines a congregation as “men, women, and children.” The same meaning most likely applies here.

Verse 22

<i>When a Leader Incurs Guilt</i> (4:22–26)
<b><i>chieftain.</i></b> Heb. <i>nasi,</i> which in Numbers refers to a tribal leader (for example, 2:3) and in Ezekiel to a king (for example, 34:24); both meanings probably apply here, signifying a high—or the highest—political leader.

Verse 23

<b><i>or the sin…is made known.</i></b> The chieftain is responsible even when initially unaware of the violation and is only informed about it later by others. Ignorance does not absolve the offender.

Verse 24



Verse 25



Verse 26



Verse 27

<i>When Anyone Else Incurs Guilt</i> (4:27–35) The ritual for any ordinary individual resembles that of the <i>chatat</i> offering for a chieftain (see 4:22–26); however, the offerer may choose to bring either a female goat (v. 28) or female sheep (v. 32). No self-evident rationale accounts for the specified sex of the sacrificial animals. One could conclude that a female might represent a greater loss in terms of long-term investment (because more females than males are necessary for reproduction, and because females also produce milk). There is no mention as to what is to be done with the parts of the animal that are not burned on the altar. Usually, the remainder is shared by the priest and the offerer in the case of a well-being offering.
<b><i>person.</i></b> Heb. <i>nefesh,</i> an inclusive noun that refers to a woman or man. (See at 2:1.)

Chapter 5



Verse 1

<i>Specific Cases That Require offerings</i> (5:1–13) This passage includes types of violations of which only the offender would be aware. These constitute what we might call ethical offenses, like withholding information in legal situations (v. 1), or ritual violations, like touching something considered impure (v. 2). The word <i>yada</i> (“have known” or “have learned of”) appears in Hebrew with each of these transgressions (vv. 1, 3, 4) and the ritual includes making the transgression known, <i>hitvada</i> (a form of <i>yada,</i> translated in v. 5 as “confess”). This section also describes three options for the purgation offering, depending on a person’s economic resources. The placement of more affordable options at the conclusion of the section on purgation offerings (4:1–5:13) could imply that these options also apply to the earlier cases that require purgation offerings, not only to those in 5:1–4. (However, this is not how the Rabbis understand it.)
<b><i>has not given information.</i></b> This is the first specific transgression that the book of Leviticus mentions. It refers to a person who has refused to disclose information that is needed to establish the facts of a legal case. Such an offense might seem minor, but in fact it compromises a person’s integrity and also undermines the legal system. An after-the-fact ritual cannot change the external circumstances of the case, but it provides the transgressor with a means to amend symbolically a wrongdoing that has damaged the fabric of society and self.

Verse 2

<b><i>2–3.</i></b> Realizing later that one has touched a corpse does not undo the original damage of defilement, practically speaking; nonetheless, Leviticus offers a restoration of balance by means of a belated ritual.

Verse 3



Verse 4

 This passage acknowledges the importance of treating promises to oneself (when expressed as an oath) as seriously as promises to another.

Verse 5



Verse 6

 This verse first states the usual offering for persons in one of the foregoing situations: an animal from the flock. However, two more options will follow for persons in certain circumstances.

Verse 7

<b><i>But if one’s means do not suffice.</i></b> Like 1:14–17, this passage lists a more affordable offering—this time, however, stating a rationale that was only implicit in the case of the burnt offering. This second option uses two birds, one of which is entirely consumed, as in a burnt offering (1:17).

Verse 8



Verse 9



Verse 10



Verse 11

<b><i>And if one’s means do not suffice.</i></b> A third option for a poor person is limited to a grain offering, which resembles the meal offering (see 2:1–16).

Verse 12



Verse 13



Verse 14

REPARATION OFFERING—<i>asham</i> (5:14–26) The name for this offering, <i>asham,</i> elsewhere means “guilt,” which is why in English it is sometimes called a “guilt offering.” The more recent term, “reparation offering,” more accurately reflects the purpose of the ritual, which is to repair the damage done in specified cases. In contrast to the earlier instructions in this parashah, the section on the reparation offering focuses on the nature of the transgression and on payment of reparations, not on the presentation and disposition of the sacrificial offering. Restoration involves directly compensating those who have been harmed by the act.
The section begins with reparation of damage done to sacred items and concludes with damage to persons. These laws echo the Decalogue (Exodus 20:2–14; Deuteronomy 5:6–18) in that crimes against another person are considered a crime against God and thus require similar reparation. The assertion that crimes against persons are also crimes against God also stands out as the central message of biblical prophets like Amos or Isaiah, and it constitutes a distinctive contribution of the Bible to Western ethics. Leviticus presents this idea, radical for its own time, as the final point in this parashah.
<b><i>14–16.</i></b> Mishandling items that belong to the sanctuary, considered to be an overt crime against God, requires a sacrificial animal (a ram) or its substitution rendered in silver. The person must make restitution for the damaged item, plus twenty percent interest.

Verse 15



Verse 16



Verse 17

<b><i>17–19.</i></b> It is not obvious why a reparation offering rather than purgation offering applies in the case of an inadvertent transgression of a prohibition.

Verse 18



Verse 19



Verse 20

<b><i>20–26. When a person sins and commits a trespass against יהוה—by dealing deceitfully with another.</i></b> This parashah, which lingers so long on rites in the sanctuary, concludes with a list of offenses against another person, what we might call ethical and social or economic violations. Each of these wrongs requires first and foremost a restitution of the damage done to the other person. This section introduces the deep concern in Leviticus for social justice and equity, a concern often overlooked as a result of the book’s detailed information about ritual.

Verse 21

<b><i>trespass.</i></b> Heb. <i>maal;</i>, it can also be translated as “sacrilege,” a term that rightly highlights the religious component of what might otherwise be considered a civil matter.
<i><b>against</b></i> <b>יהוה.</b> Here Leviticus expresses the idea that crimes against another person are also crimes against God. This message, radical for its own time, also characterizes the message of Leviticus 19 and of prophets like Amos and Isaiah.

Verse 22

<b><i>swears falsely.</i></b> False testimony undermines the judicial system and makes a mockery of attempts at securing justice (see also Exodus 20:13 and Deuteronomy 5:17).

Verse 23



Verse 24

<b><i>shall repay.</i></b> These instructions insist on the equitable restoration of any ill-gained possessions, with an additional twenty percent compensation. Only after such recompense can a person approach the altar and offer a sacrifice.

Verse 25

<b><i>Then that person shall bring.</i></b> Only after restoring justice in the human realm should a person bring an offering to God. This emphasis on justice stands as the culmination of the parashah.

Chapter 6



Verse 1

<i>Supplemental Instructions to the Priests Regarding Sacrifices</i> (6:1–7:38)
INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE BURNT OFFERING (6:1–6)
Detailed instructions about this offering appeared in Leviticus 1, indicating that the entire animal is to be “turned into smoke” (see 1:9). The additional details here focus on the activity of the priests, instructing them concerning the permanent fire that must burn on the altar, and concerning the clothing the officiating priest must wear at different stages when disposing of the offering’s remains.

Verse 2

<b><i>Command Aaron and his sons.</i></b> Whereas Moses is charged with communicating most other laws to the people, here God directs Moses to convey these laws specifically to Aaron and his sons. (Because the laws apply to the priests themselves, it is reasonable to translate the plural noun <i>banim</i> here as “sons” rather than as “children.”) <i><b>ritual.</b></i> Heb. <i>torah,</i> which more widely means an “instruction” or “teaching” (see the introduction to Deuteronomy 6:20–25). Rendered as “Torah” (capitalized), this term comes to represent the entire first five books of the Bible (see at Deuteronomy 31:9). This is the first time that this term is employed in Leviticus.

Verse 3

<b><i>The priest shall dress in linen raiment.</i></b> The fabrics that the “skilled women” wove for the Tabernacle (Exodus 35:25) were nearly identical to the material specified for the priestly garments (Exodus 28:5). Thus women probably also wove the fabrics for the priestly garments such as those mentioned here. Weaving is one of the household crafts or tasks typically carried out by women in traditional cultures (see <i>T’rumah,</i> Another View; <i>P’kudei,</i> Another View).

Verse 4

 The change of clothing allows the priest to leave the sacred precinct of the altar and dispose of the remains of the offering.

Verse 5

<b><i>The fire on the altar shall be kept burning.</i></b> The fire both consumes the offerings and cleanses the altar from any leftover meat.

Verse 6

<b><i>perpetual fire.</i></b> The priest keeps the sanctuary’s fire going. He takes care of the altar in the ways that homemakers—typically women—take care of the home. On the priests as “God’s housewives,” see <i>Vayikra,</i> Contemporary Reflection.

Verse 7

INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE MEAL OFFERING (6:7–16) This section repeats some of the information from Leviticus 2 but adds a few details, namely who can eat the offering and what to do with it when a priest is being ordained. On this type of offering, see Leviticus 2.
<b><i>ritual.</i></b> Heb. <i>torah</i>; see at 6:2.

Verse 8



Verse 9



Verse 10

<b><i>most holy.</i></b> This term, also translated “holy of holies,” typically designates the innermost sacred section of the Tabernacle (see Exodus 26:34). The sacred status of food consumed in the Tabernacle highlights the analogy between the Tabernacle and the body (see the introduction to <i>Vayikra</i>).

Verse 11

<b><i>Only the males.</i></b> The translation here restricts eating of this sacrifice to Aaron and his sons. However, if one construes the Hebrew words as “every male” or “all males” (which is how this same translation understands the phrase in 24 out of 27 cases; see, for example, Numbers 1:20), the statement would permit all priests—not only the officiating priests—to partake in the offering. The purpose of the instruction may be to clarify that priests who are otherwise disqualified from officiating in the sacrificial ritual (because of characteristics described in 21:16–23; compare 22:1–7) nonetheless may eat of these portions. See also Another View, and at 10:12–14.
<i><b>Anything that touches these shall become holy.</b></i> “These” refers to the <i>kodesh kodashim</i> (“most holy”), which in this context means the portion of the offering designated for the priests. This statement conflicts with Haggai 2:12–13, which claims that only impurity, not holiness, is contagious when touched. In either case, the notion of holiness in the Bible can be likened in modern terms to electric energy or radiation, either of which has the power to heal or to kill, depending on how it is handled. Jacob Milgrom uses the analogy of “high voltage” (<i>Leviticus: A Book of Ritual and Ethics,</i> 2004, p. 64). It is also possible that the statement means that a person must be in a state of purity before touching this offering.

Verse 12

<b><i>12–16.</i></b> These verses essentially constitute a recipe for preparing the grain for the special meal offering on the occasion of a priest’s ordination. The priest offers it on his own behalf.

Verse 13



Verse 14



Verse 15



Verse 16

 Ordinarily the priest eats the meal offerings; however, at ordination, the priest does not eat this special offering.

Verse 17

INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE PURGATION OFFERING (6:17–23) These verses amplify the laws in Leviticus 4 by focusing on the different procedures regarding contact with the offering. They describe which portion of the sacrificial animal belongs to the priest and how priests must handle the dedicated food. While sometimes translated as “sin offering,” this sacrifice aims to cleanse the sanctuary from visible and invisible impurities that contaminate it. See further at Leviticus 4.

Verse 18



Verse 19



Verse 20

<b><i>Anything that touches its flesh shall become holy.</i></b> See at v. 11.

Verse 21

<b><i>An earthen vessel…a copper vessel.</i></b> Vessels in which the meat is prepared must be purified. Since earthenware is porous, it cannot be completely “disinfected” and therefore has to be destroyed; metal vessels, however, can be washed. While these rules may correspond to safety measures intended to remove bacterial contamination, the official basis for these precautions in Leviticus is religious, not medical.

Verse 22

<b><i>Only the males.</i></b> Or “every male.” See at v. 11.

Chapter 7



Verse 1

INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE REPARATION OFFERING (7:1–6) The instructions about reparation offerings in Leviticus 5 focused in large measure on who needs to bring it, and on the alternate offerings that depend on the circumstances of the transgressor. The present section supplements those earlier instructions by focusing on the priest’s role and on his share of the offering. While sometimes translated as “guilt offering,” this type of sacrifice aims to restore the system to a normative wholeness (see at 5:14–26).
<b><i>ritual.</i></b> Heb. <i>torah</i>; see at 6:2.

Verse 5



Verse 6

<b><i>most holy.</i></b> Heb. <i>kodesh kodashim,</i> which also means “holy of holies”; see at 6:10.

Verse 7

CONCLUDING INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE PRECEDING OFFERINGS (7:7–10) This section completes the earlier discussion of these sacrifices by designating explicitly what the priests are to receive in these cases. The officiating priest is to receive the benefit from both purgation and reparation offerings (7:7). The animal’s skin goes to the officiating priest in the case of the burnt offering (7:8). Presumably that skin would be made into leather used for clothing, footwear, and possibly writing material. One type of meal offering goes only to the officiating priest (7:9), whereas the other kind (7:10) goes to all priests. For more about these sacrifices, see Leviticus 1–5.

Verse 9



Verse 10



Verse 11

INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE WELL-BEING SACRIFICE (7:11–21) Leviticus 3 described the sacrifice of well-being in great detail, focusing on the types of animal to be offered. This section supplements those instructions by discussing the occasions and different types of well-being sacrifices, as well as the manner in which they are to be distributed and eaten. Well-being offerings include thanksgiving offerings, votive offerings, and freewill offerings. The Bible elsewhere presumes that women are among those who bring these types of offerings (Numbers 30:4; I Samuel 1:3–4, 21, 24–28; Proverbs 7:14.)
<b><i>ritual.</i></b> Heb. <i>torah;</i> see at 6:2.

Verse 12

<b><i>thanksgiving.</i></b> Heb. <i>todah</i> (“thanks”) designates the first type of well-being sacrifice. Whereas Leviticus 3 described the procedures regarding the sacrificial meat, this section describes the grain portion that accompanies the eating of the sacrifice.
<i><b>unleavened wafers.</b></i> Heb. <i>challot matzot,</i> combining the terms for two types of “breads”: the <i>challah</i> and the <i>matzah.</i> (Subsequently, both terms come to be associated specifically with rituals for the Jewish home: <i>matzah</i> for Passover, and <i>challah</i> for Shabbat.) Women in the ancient world were the ones typically responsible for household baking. In Genesis 18:6–7 Abraham instructs Sarah to bake cakes for the unexpected guests while a male servant prepares meat. Jeremiah 7:18 condemns women for kneading dough to make cakes for the worship of the “Queen of Heaven,” whom they presumably viewed as the female consort of Israel’s (male) God. See at Exodus 16:3 and 25:30 and at Leviticus 26:26 for more details about women and baking.

Verse 13

<b><i>cakes.</i></b> Heb. <i>challot,</i> the plural form of <i>challah;</i> in the Bible, this term does not refer to the braided bread associated with today’s use of this term.

Verse 14

 A portion of this offering goes to the priest. Another goes to the party who is offering the sacrifice. This sacrifice thus enables the entire community to share a meal with each other and—symbolically—also with God.

Verse 15

 There is no explanation as to why certain offerings (like thanksgiving or well-being offerings) must be eaten entirely on the first day, while others (like votive and freewill offerings, see next verse) can be kept for a couple of days. Health factors do not account for the difference.

Verse 16

<b><i>votive or a freewill offering.</i></b> These types of well-being sacrifices are also shared between the priest and the offering party. Their meat may be eaten for two days.

Verse 17



Verse 18

 Leftover sacrificial meat must be destroyed by fire when not consumed within the designated time period. Keeping meat for three days in the climactic conditions of Israel would have been a health hazard and may underlie the concern in this case. However, this reason alone cannot explain why the other well-being sacrifice—the one for thanksgiving—cannot be kept even for one day.

Verse 19

<b><i>Flesh that touches anything impure.</i></b> Because the meat of this sacrifice is eaten in a public place, it is not necessarily subject to the carefully monitored conditions of the Tabernacle; therefore, the Torah specifies the care that a person must take when eating this offering.
<i><b>only one who is pure.</b></i> The requirement of ritual purity (see Leviticus 15) means that a woman may not bring this sacrifice or eat from it during her term of menstrual impurity <i>(niddah),</i> nor for several weeks following childbirth (40 days after the birth of a son, and 80 days after the birth of a daughter; see at Leviticus 12). Likewise, a man who has an emission of semen or other discharges cannot offer the sacrifice or eat from it until he regains a state of ritual purity.

Verse 20

<b><i>cut off from kin.</i></b> This punishment of being “cut off” (Heb. <i>kareit)</i> can be understood in a number of ways. The expression could mean that the individual should be ostracized, that is, deliberately excluded from the community. The term could also refer to divinely inflicted childlessness, a condition that in time will “cut” that person’s bloodline from the community (a consequence that does not entail communal punishment). Jacob Milgrom suggests in addition that <i>kareit</i> could mean that such a person will not be buried with the ancestors—and thus be denied the kind of reunification that marks a full life (<i>Leviticus</i>, 2004, p. 66). There are eighteen cases in the Torah that prescribe <i>kareit</i> (see Milgrom, p. 65). The verb form of the root <i>k-r-t</i> also appears as the term for making a covenant, such as when God makes a covenant with Abram <i>(karat…b’rit)</i> in Genesis 15:18.
<i><b>kin.</b></i> Heb. <i>ammim,</i> which in this expression the text’s intended audience would have understood in a gender-inclusive sense, as the translation reflects. Despite the Bible’s penchant for patrilineal genealogies and patronyms, female relatives also counted as kin. See at Genesis 10:1. (See also “predecessors” in <i>The Contemporary Torah,</i> 2006, p. 408.)

Verse 21



Verse 22

PROHIBITIONS REGARDING THE FAT AND THE BLOOD (7:22–27) Leviticus 3:17 prohibits eating the blood and certain types of fat of the sacrificed animal. The present section adds a punishment for violating this command. The rationale for not consuming blood (according to 17:10–12) is that the life of a living being is in the blood. No explanation is given for not eating the fat. However, references to “fat” elsewhere as especially valuable (for example, Genesis 45:18), suggest that burning fat completely might represent offering a precious gift to God. Here end the instructions to the priests.

Verse 23



Verse 24



Verse 25



Verse 26



Verse 27



Verse 28

FURTHER DETAILS REGARDING THE WELL-BEING SACRIFICE (7:28–36) This section, addressed to all, describes a division of labor between those who bring the offering and the officiating priest. It specifies which portion of the sacrifice goes to the officiating priest (the breast and the right thigh) and which to the party making the offering (the rest of the offering).

Verse 29



Verse 30

<b><i>one’s own hands shall present.</i></b> Those making a sacrifice physically bring the offering to the altar. We learn from Numbers 30 that women make vows, and we learn from Leviticus 7:16 that vows often entailed making an offering. The present law implies that Israelite women, like Israelite men, would have access to the altar on these occasions if they were in a state of ritual purity. Note the story of Hannah: she vows to dedicate her son; then she brings him to the sanctuary where she also slaughters a sacrifice (I Samuel 1:11, 24–25).

Verse 31



Verse 32



Verse 33



Verse 34

<b><i>the breast…and the thigh.</i></b> These large portions of the animal provide economic compensation to the priests, who did not usually own land and therefore could not produce their own food like other Israelites (Numbers 18:20; but see Joshua 21, where priests do seem to get some pasture land).

Verse 35



Verse 36



Verse 37

AFFIRMATION OF THE SINAITIC ORIGIN OF THE SACRIFICIAL PRACTICES (7:37–38) This concluding section brings to a close the extensive instructions about sacrifices that began in Leviticus 1:2. These verses specify that the anointed priests must come from the line of Aaron.
<b><i>rituals.</i></b> Heb. <i>torah;</i> see at 6:2.

Verse 38

<b><i>on Mount Sinai…in the wilderness of Sinai.</i></b> The opening of Leviticus specified that God spoke to Moses from the Tent of Meeting (1:1) when commanding these sacrifices. The reference to Mount Sinai here stands in tension with that earlier mention of the Tent of Meeting. Contemporary critical scholars acknowledge the probability that various laws were assembled at different historical periods before reaching their final form. The attribution to Sinai aims to unify such traditions and communicate their antiquity and authority.

Chapter 8



Verse 1

<i>The Ordination of the Priests</i> (8:1–36)
Detailed instructions for the ordination of the priests appeared in Exodus 28. The present passage describes the execution of these instructions. The account of the ordination, like that of building the Tabernacle itself, emphasizes that the instructions were carried out precisely (even if some of the details vary slightly). The ceremony entails the formal dressing of Aaron and his four sons. In English, the words “investment” and “investiture” refer (among other things) to the ritual of placing clothing—vestments—upon the priest. (Nowadays the term “invested” also applies to the official status conferred on a cantor, analogous to an “ordained” rabbi.)
Two issues in this section pertain indirectly to women. First, the priesthood in Leviticus is bestowed exclusively upon Aaron and his sons. Although it is common for priests in the ancient world to come from specifically designated families, it is unusual to have only a single family serve exclusively for generations. Moreover, whereas women in ancient Mesopotamia could be priests, the Torah authorizes only males from the line of Aaron to supervise and formally officiate at the communal sanctuary. The reason for this difference is not clear; see <i>T’tzaveh,</i> Another View. As for the women in priestly families—wives, daughters, and sisters—Leviticus 21–22 indicate that women are beneficiaries of certain privileges and also accountable to special standards (see especially at 22:12–13).
Second, the emphasis on the priests’ garments raises the question as to who made (and also who repaired) them. Did women in the priests’ household participate by spinning the yarn, weaving the fabric, and fashioning the garments? The Torah does not provide this information here, but see at 6:3. What does appear to be important to the writer of these accounts is that the ordination of the priests—rather than other communal events—constitutes a turning point that deserves close attention.
The ordination ceremony includes sacrifices delineated in Leviticus 1–7. One of the most unusual aspects of the ceremony is the smearing of certain parts of the priest’s body with oil and blood (8:22–24). Such a ritual also marks the purification of a <i>m’tzora</i>—a person afflicted with certain types of skin disease (see 14:9–20 and 23–29).
GOD’S INSTRUCTIONS REGARDING THE ORDINATION OF THE PRIESTS (8:1–3)
The ordination of the priests begins when Moses places upon them their special accoutrements. Only priestly garments, not other clothes, receive an extensive description in the Bible. (Even the book of Esther, with its emphasis on the role of clothing, does not include detailed descriptions of clothes.) On the likelihood that women wove the fabric, see at 6:3.

Verse 2

<b><i>Take Aaron along with his sons, and the vestments.</i></b> A central feature of the ordination of the priests entails the formal dressing of the priests in “vestments,” an act that is reflected in English by the terms “vesting” and “investiture.” Exodus 28 describes these garments in detail, listing six items that are adorned with expensive material: a breastpiece, an ephod, a robe, a fringed tunic, a headdress, and a sash.

Verse 3

<b><i>community leadership.</i></b> Literally, “the whole community,” but the term can also refer to representative adult males, which better fits the present context. See at 4:13.

Verse 4

MOSES’ ORDINATION OF THE PRIESTS (8:4–30) Moses, who himself is not a priest but only a member of the tribe that claims descent from Levi, has the authority to sanctify and ordain the priests.

Verse 5



Verse 6

<b><i>brought…forward.</i></b> The Hebrew word is the same one used for offering a sacrifice (the root <i>k-r-b).</i> The priests in this ritual are, in a sense, an offering to God.
<i><b>washed them.</b></i> Ritual washing accompanies virtually all acts of purification. See, for example, 14:9.

Verse 7

<b><i>robe.</i></b> According to the book of Samuel, in the years after Hannah brings her young son to serve in God’s sanctuary, she makes for him “a little robe” (1 Samuel 2:19) to go with his linen ephod (2:18).
<i><b>ephod.</b></i> This priestly outer garment was made of a variety of materials, including fabric most likely woven by women (see Exodus 28:5–12 for details and at Leviticus 6:3, above).

Verse 8

<b><i>breastpiece.</i></b> This is a jeweled metal plate officiates; see at Exodus 28:15–30. (Nowadays the metal breastplate or breastpiece on Torah scrolls in many synagogues represents an attempt to reproduce or symbolize this item.)
<i><b>Urim and Thummim.</b></i> The reference is to some physical object that priests used for consulting with God. It is unclear what the name means and what the object or objects looked like, although scholars have suggested that it was somewhat like a pair of dice that, when tossed, gave a “yes” or “no” answer to questions posed by the priest. See also at Exodus 28:30. The names suggest the meanings “light” <i>(urim)</i> and “right” or “whole” (<i>tumim</i>).

Verse 9



Verse 10

<b><i>10–12.</i></b> As these verses indicate, the act of anointing sanctifies the Tabernacle and its furnishing, as well as the priests.

Leviticus does not explain the meaning of this act. Most likely it symbolizes the dedication and purification of the entire body or person. An identical ritual signals the purification of the <i>m’tzora,</i> the person stricken with a particular skin disease (on account of which he or she has been previously isolated from the community). This ritual is unique to these two occasions. It implies an analogy between the transition that the priest undergoes and that of the healed <i>m’tzora.</i> See Leviticus 14:9–20 and the comments there.

FINAL PREPARATORY STEPS: SEVEN DAYS OF THE PRIESTS’ ISOLATION (8:31–36) The ordination ritual bestows holiness on the priests. Their isolation, which echoes that of menstruating women or persons isolated for skin disease in Leviticus 13–15, emphasizes the power and danger of the holy. Only after these seven days can the priests officiate in sacrificial service. With the completion of this ritual, all is ready for initiating the sacrificial system of the Tabernacle for the benefit of the community. The next parashah begins by describing that event as taking place on the eighth day.
<i>—Tamara Cohn Eskenazi</i>  

Chapter 9



Verse 1

<i>Ritual Offerings Begin</i> (9:1–24)
The parashah begins on the eighth day (hence its name), the day after the seven-day ordination ceremony of the priests. Aaron now begins his priestly duties and the Tabernacle’s activities commence. The first part of Leviticus provided the rules for the sacrificial system, but only now that the priests have been ordained can the worship itself be inaugurated.
RITUAL OF PURGATION FOR AARON THE PRIEST AND HIS HOUSEHOLD (9:1–14)
Prior to officiating, the priests themselves must undergo a ritual of purification in order to protect both the sanctuary and the people from contaminating elements.
<b><i>Aaron and his sons.</i></b> Aaron’s sons begin now to function as priests, and they will lead the congregation upon his death. According to 10:14, Aaron also has (unnamed) daughters. Do they also participate in running the Tabernacle along with his sons? According to Exodus 38:8, women “perform tasks <i>(tzovot)</i> at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting.” As noted in the comment there, the verb <i>tzovot</i> seems to indicate the work of a support staff. Perhaps that reference to women alludes to, or at least includes, Aaron’s daughters. They might prepare the basins, the knives, the water, and other materials needed for the Tabernacle.

Verse 2

<b><i>2–4.</i></b> The inauguration involves four different types of sacrifice: a purgation offering (see Leviticus 4); a burnt offering (see Leviticus 1); an offering of well-being (see Leviticus 3); and a meal offering (see Leviticus 2). Every type of offering is brought except the <i>asham,</i> the reparation offering (see 5:15–26). There is no implication that the priests or the people had deliberately trespassed; therefore, perhaps, there is no need for the <i>asham.</i>
<i><b>“today</b></i> <b>יהוה</b> <i><b>will appear to you.”</b></i> The plural “you” in the Hebrew means that God is to appear to everyone present—men, women, and children.

Verse 5

<b><i>the community leadership.</i></b> Literally, “the entire congregation,” as in 8:3. [Because the whole community could not fit in the courtyard area in front of the Tent of Meeting, the present translation understands the term in its more restricted sense as representative leaders—presumably referring to the (male) elders mentioned in v. 1. —<i>Ed.</i>]

Verse 8



Verse 9

<b><i>Aaron’s sons.</i></b> The word “sons” can sometimes be translated “children,” but here—despite the fact that Aaron also has daughters (see 10:14)—the word “sons” must be retained.
<i><b>brought the blood.</b></i> Leviticus 4 describes how blood is used in the procedure to be followed when an anointed priest incurs guilt. This sacrifice is in case a sin is committed unintentionally and without the knowledge of either the priest or the congregation (Numbers 15:24).

Chapter 10



Verse 1

<i>The Strange Fire of Nadab and Abihu</i> (10:1–7)
In the tragic story that follows, Nadab and Abihu, Aaron’s two oldest sons, offer a ritual fire that God did not command. As a result, fire comes from God and kills them. Like good tragedy everywhere, the story is intended to elicit pity and fear—pity for Nadab, Abihu, their father, mother, and siblings; and fear that God’s terrifying power may burst forth again. The world is perceived as a dangerous place, and God can protect but also create harm (Isaiah 45:7). The ancient world’s protection is the sacrificial ritual correctly performed according to the prescribed rules. However, contact with the holy must be rigorously safeguarded from illegitimate incursion. If the procedures are performed incorrectly, the sanctuary becomes defiled, with disastrous consequences (15:31). This story, however, leaves the reader uncertain as to what precisely constitutes the sons’ transgression.
<b><i>alien fire.</i></b> Literally, strange or foreign fire. What makes the fire strange is unclear.
<i><b>which had not been enjoined upon them.</b></i> The verse implies that the offering might have been fine if it had been ordered by a proper authority. This episode underscores what everyone in the ancient Near East apparently believed: the deity must be worshipped precisely as specified or catastrophe occurs.

Verse 2

 <i><b>And fire came forth from</b></i> <b>יהוה <i>and…they died.</i></b> The exact reasons for this punishment are unclear. The Bible records another story where God destroys a person for touching the ark in an unauthorized manner: King David decides to bring the ark of God to Jerusalem. En route the ark begins to slip off the ox-cart. Unbidden, a man reaches out his hand to steady the ark and God kills him (II Samuel 6:6–7). Both that story and the present one illustrate the danger ascribed to the holy. Indeed, ritual aims to contain and protect against the danger inherent in the holy.

Verse 3

 <i><b>“This is what</b></i> <b>יהוה</b> <i><b>meant by saying.”</b></i> There is no record of God’s having said these words earlier.
<i><b>“Through those near to Me I show Myself holy.”</b></i> Or, “I sanctify myself by means of those near to me.” That is, I reveal my holiness among those near to me. The ones “nearest” to God were Nadab and Abihu: when they offered the incense they literally “came near” (10:1; see 16:1); and as priests, they are “nearer” to God than non-priests. These deaths evince God’s power as awesome and the Tabernacle’s status as holy. According to this reading, then, God uses the deaths of Nadab and Abihu to magnify Godself. The story of Nadab and Abihu may aim, among other things, to illustrate that priestly privilege may not be abused.
<i><b>“And gain glory before all the people.”</b></i> All the people saw the fire and the deaths of Nadab and Abihu. God’s awesome power is revealed in God’s acts.
<i><b>Aaron was silent.</b></i> There is not much that one can say when confronted with the awesome power of God. But what was the reaction of Nadab and Abihu’s mother, Elisheba (see Exodus 6:23)? The text does not record her response to this tragedy. On Aaron’s silence, see Contemporary Reflection.

Verse 4



Verse 5



Verse 6

<b><i>“bare your heads…rend your clothes.”</i></b> Moses describes two of the actions associated elsewhere in the Bible with mourning.
<i><b>“kin.”</b></i> Heb. <i>achim,</i> literally “brothers,” has a gender-inclusive sense here. The Bible takes for granted that ancient Israelite women feature in the public bewailing of communal tragedies such as the death of leaders (Jeremiah 9:16–19; II Chronicles 35:25; Exodus 33:4; see <i>Chayei Sarah,</i> Contemporary Reflection).

Verse 7

<b><i>“do not go outside.”</i></b> Aaron must not go out to bury his sons.
<i><b>“for</b></i> <b>יהוה</b><i><b>’s anointing oil is upon you.”</b></i> The anointing oil is holy and must be used in the manner prescribed, that is, by the high priest when he conducts the sacrificial rites (Exodus 30:30–33). If Aaron is outside the tent or in the presence of the dead, he defiles the oil and also the sanctuary (21:10–12). If the sanctuary becomes defiled, the entire community could perish (15:31). An ordinary priest may defile himself through burial of his son and other members of his immediate family (Leviticus 21:1), but not the chief priest (21:10–12).

Verse 8

<i>Laws for Aaron The Priest and His Household</i> (10:8–20)
The Tent of Meeting must be purged of the contamination of the corpse defilement that occurred with the deaths of Nadab and Abihu, but that report appears only later, in Leviticus 16. Here, following additional instructions to the priests (vv. 8–15), comes an odd story about the purgation offering. Moses suddenly chastises Aaron and his remaining sons for erroneously burning the goat rather than eating it (see 9:1–4 for relevant laws). Aaron obliquely asks: if they had eaten it, would his sons have been spared? Moses has no answer.

Verse 9

<b><i>Drink no wine or other intoxicant.</i></b> The mention of wine and strong drink here leads some to suggest that the placement of this verse implies that strong drink caused Nadab and Abihu to act precipitously. More likely, however, this placement is coincidental.

Verse 10

<b><i>you must distinguish.</i></b> That is, you must make a separation.

Verse 11

<b><i>and you must teach.</i></b> The priests are also to teach the people to make a separation themselves between the pure and the impure, the holy and the profane (see Ezekiel 22:26; 42:20; 44:23).

Verse 12

<b><i>12–13.</i></b> Two verses describe laws regarding the meal offering (see Leviticus 2).
<i><b>Eleazar and Ithamar.</b></i> Citing Aaron’s sons specifically by name may indicate that only the chief priest and his male heirs are entitled to the “most holy” offerings—daughters being excluded. As indicated by v. 14 (compare 23:20) and by 22:12–13, a priest’s daughter may eat “holy” food, if not the “most holy,” so long as she is part of her father’s household. (See further at 6:11; <i>Tzav,</i> Another View.)

Verse 13

<b><i>your due.</i></b> The priest’s food comes partly from these offerings.
<i><b>sons.</b></i> Heb. <i>banim,</i> which can also signify offspring of both genders (“children”). Here, the word refers specifically to “sons” if the injunction regarding this offering in 6:11 means that “only the males…may eat of it”; see the discussion there. See also at v. 12.

Verse 14

 The rules for the elevation offerings appear in Exodus 29:22–27 and Leviticus 7:29–34.
<i><b>you</b></i> [<i><b>and your wife</b></i>]. [This is one of several passages in the Torah where syntax and context together indicate that the Hebrew’s second-person masculine singular language implicitly addresses a conjugal pair: the head of household and his wife. See the introduction to the Decalogue; <i>Mishpatim,</i> Another View. —<i>Ed</i>] <i><b>your sons and daughters.</b></i> Designated parts of the meal and gift offering may be eaten by women as well as by anyone belonging to the priest’s household (22:10–13).
<i><b>a due to…your sons.</b></i> Here, as in v. 13, the word <i>banim</i> does not include daughters. These donations primarily compensate the (male) priests for their ritual role; only secondarily do they serve to feed members of the family who are not serving as priests.

Verse 15



Verse 16

 Moses’ anger regarding the sacrifice of the goat is puzzling. Was he not there when they burned it? Moses chastises Aaron and his remaining sons for further lack of scrupulousness in carrying out their responsibilities, but perhaps he is passing off his own derelication of duties onto them.

Verse 17

<b><i>17–18.</i></b> Moses’ point is that a purgation offering is not complete until the priests have eaten their share of the meat from it. The law requires that it be eaten in a pure place (“in the sacred precinct,” 6:19).

Verse 18



Verse 19

 <i><b>“would</b></i> <b>יהוה</b> <i><b>have approved?”</b></i> Aaron’s rhetorical question implies that God would not have approved. Aaron apparently has reasoned that the death of Nadab and Abihu has polluted the area (compare Numbers 19:14)—and yet Aaron and his sons cannot leave the vicinity (above, v. 7). Thus the priests have no place available where they can eat the meat.

Verse 20

 Moses is forced to agree.

Chapter 11



Verse 1

<i>Dietary Laws for The Israelite people</i> (11:1–47)
At this point in the narrative, the Israelites have set up the Tabernacle (Exodus 40), received specifications for the sacrifices (Leviticus 1–7), ordained the priesthood (Leviticus 8), and initiated formal worship (Leviticus 9–10). God has assigned the priests their task of teaching Israel to distinguish between the ritually pure and the impure (10:10–11). This task includes being able to differentiate between pure and impure foods, to which the text now turns. The people must make such distinctions in their daily, household life, not merely in relation to the sanctuary. The practice of differentiating between the pure and the impure in one’s eating creates a relationship between the priests’ work in the sanctuary and ordinary Israelites at home.
No explanation is offered for what makes these items unfit as food, and none is needed. These specific food prohibitions likely reflect ancient cultural dislikes (“taboos” is too strong a word) that eventually become solidified into law (see also at Deuteronomy 14:3–21). They later become explicit indicators of identity, however. That is, loyalty to one’s Judaism and to Judaism’s God came to be expressed via resistance to violating the dietary laws. For example, according to II Maccabees 7, a mother instructs her sons to die rather than eat pork publicly. [Some food prohibitions may also have had functional economic reasons behind them (such as an attempt to avoid economic dependence on other groups). Others may have been symbolic, such as avoiding predatory animals (possibly with a rationale that “you are what you eat”). —<i>Ed.</i>]
This unit has special relevance for women. The ancient Israelite diet consisted mostly of grains—supplemented with milk curds, cheese, yogurt, wine, olive oil, legumes, and fruits and vegetables. In ancient Israel preparing those foodstuffs was the domain of women; it was they who typically supervised or performed tasks such as building the fire, drawing water from the well, grinding the grain, kneading the dough, forming the cakes, milking the sheep and goats, making the cheese and yogurt, gathering the olives and dates, and treading the grapes. As a result, we can assume that women were responsible for maintaining the dietary laws.
Meat was reserved for special occasions. Scholars debate the role of women in slaughtering animals for meat in ancient Israel. Some suggest, on the basis of ancient reliefs, that during certain periods, animals were slaughtered domestically. In those periods, women may have participated in the task. (In 1 Samuel 28:24, the woman of En-dor slaughters a calf on her own initiative and prepares a meal with it.) However, other evidence suggests that women did not slaughter animals. If slaughtering was restricted to the sanctuary—even a local sanctuary—it would have been unlikely that women would perform the actual sacrifice. If women went at all, they would have been accompanied by a man who would have performed the sacrifice rite. (For a different opinion, see at 1:5.).
It has been suggested that women also controlled food distribution in the household. However, it is perhaps more likely that the customs in present-day traditional Arabic and Afghani societies are relevant in this regard. In these societies women do prepare the food, but the men and boys get the lion’s share; the women and girls wait in the back room until the men are done eating. The food is not allocated, but simply laid on the floor on platters in front of the men and boys, who eat with their hands from the common pot until they are done. Then the women eat. These customs go back into antiquity; they may also reflect the customs of ancient Israel. (A similar picture may be implicit in Genesis 18.) [It is also possible that the overall role of women in Islamic cultures today is significantly different from that of ancient Israel and thus may not provide a reliable analogy. Some ethnographic evidence indicates that in ancient Palestine the whole family ordinarily ate together, gathered around common dishes. —<i>Ed.</i>]
LAWS REGARDING ANIMALS THAT WALK ON LAND (11:1–8)

Verse 2



Verse 3

<b><i>any animal that has true hooves…and that chews the cud.</i></b> The text could simply restrict the permitted animals to those that chew (literally “bring up”) the cud, since every true ruminant has cloven hooves.

Verse 4

<b><i>impure for you.</i></b> That is, not impure intrinsically.

Verse 5

<b><i>the daman.</i></b> If this identification is correct, then this creature is a member of the hyrax family, which is native to Africa and southwest Asia, including Israel. A hyrax is a brownish-gray mammal that is rabbit-sized and resembles a guinea pig.

Verse 6

<b><i>hare.</i></b> The species that lives in Israel is a larger relative of the common rabbit. Neither the rabbit nor the hare chews cud, but like ruminants they digest their food more than once.

Verse 7

<b><i>the swine.</i></b> Pigs were raised in Syria and the Levant in antiquity prior to the advent of the Israelite presence in the Judean highlands. Iron Age Israelite settlements show only very few pig bones, in contrast to earlier settlements there, and in contrast to neighboring areas (of the Philistines, Moabites, and Ammonites) where pig bones are well attested during the same time period. It is thus likely that the prohibition against eating pig among the Israelites is very ancient.

Verse 8

<b><i>touch their carcasses.</i></b> Anthropologist Mary Douglas suggests that the prohibition of touching the carcass of the inedible mammals protects these animals in their lifetime. Since they cannot be skinned, dismembered, or exploited after death, they need not be hunted or killed. Thus elephants would not be killed for their tusks, alligators for their hides, mink or ermine for their fur, nor turtles for their shells. However, the Rabbis may be right in interpreting this prohibition as applying only to priests serving in the sanctuary (22:8) and not to the laity. The prohibition has meaning only for members of a priestly household: One who touches such a carcass is ritually impure. In order to eat of the sacred donations, he or she must bathe and remain impure until evening. (See further at v. 24.)

Verse 9

LAWS REGARDING ANIMALS THAT LIVE IN WATER (11:9–12)
<b><i>fins and scales.</i></b> Ancient Israelites would not have known many fish. There were few varieties or numbers of fish in the Sea of Galilee, and the southeastern Mediterranean was practically devoid of fish before the Persian king Darius dug his canal between the Red Sea and the Nile during the 6th century <small>B.C.E.</small> Most fish were purchased from the Phoenicians (Nehemiah 13:16). (Some later rabbinic opinions permit fish that have scales at one point in their life even though they lose them later, such as the swordfish.)

LAWS REGARDING ANIMALS THAT SWARM IN THE AIR (11:20–23)

Verse 21

<b><i>above their feet, jointed legs.</i></b> The locust is the migratory phase of the grasshopper. When conditions become sufficiently crowded, the usually solitary grasshopper undergoes a morphological and behavioral transformation during which it flies in huge swarms. The palace reliefs of Sennacherib at Nineveh (now in the British Museum) show that grasshoppers were delicacies fit for a king. A scene depicting a line of attendants carrying food items includes at least one figure with rows of grasshoppers skewered on two sticks (somewhat like corn dogs).

Verse 22



Verse 23



Verse 24

LAWS REGARDING CARCASSES OF NON-EDIBLE ANIMALS (11:24–28) These verses explain the ramifications of v. 8, above. They seem out of place here.
<b><i>carcasses.</i></b> The term is not defined. In a later era, the Rabbis considered the carcass to be the flesh only and permitted use of the bones, skin, hair, and teeth; the Dead Sea sect took a different position and forbade the use of even these items.
<b><i>impure until evening.</i></b> In contrast to carcasses, live animals do not impart impurity.

Verse 25



Verse 26



Verse 27



Verse 28



Verse 29

MORE LAWS REGARDING FORBIDDEN FOODS (11:29–43) This section describes what happens after prohibited swarming animals come in contact with other household objects.
<b><i>29–31–31</i></b> The reference is to creatures that enter a household on their own. The exact identifications are not certain.

Verse 30



Verse 31

<b><i>when they are dead.</i></b> See above at v. 24.

Verse 32

 Objects like containers, tools, and musical instruments that come into contact with the carcass of these animals must be washed. The prohibition does not apply to surfaces like floors or tables.

Verse 33

 Because an earthenware vessel cannot be purified, it must be broken. Anything inside it must be discarded. But if the carcass touches only the outside, the vessel is not impure, a provision motivated perhaps by economic considerations.

Verse 34

<b><i>any food…in contact with water.</i></b> Wet food becomes impure if it comes into contact with the carcass of one of the animals named in vv. 29–30. Dry food and seeds that come into contact with such carcasses are not affected.
<i><b>any liquid…inside any vessel</b></i>. A liquid that comes into contact with a carcass of one of the animals listed in vv. 29–30 is impure only if the liquid is inside a vessel. Liquids in a lake, stream, or well are not rendered impure.

Verse 35

<b><i>oven or stove.</i></b> These items were made of earthenware, like the vessels mentioned in v. 33.

Verse 36

<b><i>cistern.</i></b> A cistern was usually cut into bedrock and used for collecting and storing runoff. It was kept covered with a stone when not in use. If the rock was porous, the cistern was waterproofed by being plastered with lime. Cisterns, in which water could be stored for the dry season, made settled living possible in the Land of Israel, with its dry climate and its few year-round sources of water. A 9th-century-<small>B.C.E.</small> king of Moab boasts on his victory monument that he built a cistern for every house—using the labor of Israelite prisoners of war. [Cisterns near the household would have made women’s lives considerably easier, since drawing water was typically the work of women, often girls. (See Genesis 24:11, 13 and 1 Samuel 9:11.) —<i>Ed.</i>]

Verse 37

<b><i>37–38. seed grain.</i></b> Seed to be planted is pure even if it touched a carcass of the forbidden animals. Seed to be eaten is impure if it touches the carcass and it is wet.

Verse 38



Verse 39

<b><i>has died.</i></b> That is, without being ritually slaughtered.

Verse 40



Verse 41

<b><i>41–43. things that swarm upon the earth.</i></b> That is, the animals discussed in vv. 29–30.

Verse 42



Verse 43



Verse 44

SUMMARY STATEMENT AND RATIONALE: YOU SHALL BE HOLY (11:44–47) God’s holiness is given as the reason for all the dietary restrictions The statement in v. 45 suggests that there are parallels between what is offered to God and what Israelites have to do when striving toward holiness. To sanctify oneself is to keep apart from impurities as well as transgressions.
That verse, together with v. 44, are the first clear statements in which Israelites are commanded to emulate God’s holiness, an idea that is developed at length beginning with Leviticus 19.
<i>—Lisbeth S. Fried</i>  

Chapter 12



Verse 1

<i>Laws for the Impurity of a Woman after Giving Birth</i> (12:1–8)
The section that delineates purification rituals for women after childbirth differentiates between the birth of a son and that of a daughter. For the first 7 days after the birth of a son, and for 14 days after that of a daughter, the woman is in a ritual state equivalent to that of a menstruating woman (see Leviticus 15). Afterward she must still abstain from contact with the sacred items or the sanctuary for another 33 days in the case of a son and 66 days in the case of a daughter. Leviticus offers no explanation for the differences in duration.
Despite the fact that Leviticus 12 does not mention bathing, most commentators assume that the act of ritual bathing or immersion marks the end of a woman’s period of impurity. Bathing signifies the termination of impurity from other causes (see 14:8, 9). On bathing in a ritual bath (<i>mikveh</i>), which became mandatory for women in subsequent periods, see <i>Sh’mini,</i> Post-biblical Interpretations; Contemporary Reflection.
IMPURITY AFTER THE BIRTH OF A MALE (12:1–4)
The notion that the woman who gave birth bears impurity is characteristic of many ancient cultures. Among Israel’s neighbors, it was common for the parturient (a woman about to give birth) to be quarantined and taboo, and special purification rituals were performed for the woman and her newborn among some groups. In Leviticus, this period of severe impurity (as opposed to the lesser degree described in v. 4) terminates after seven days when the newborn is male and after fourteen days when the newborn is female; compare v. 5.

Verse 2

<b><i>at childbirth.</i></b> [Heb. <i>tazria</i> (which becomes the name of the parashah). The verb refers to a woman producing an offspring. In Genesis 1:11–12, it means “produce seed” or “bring forth seed” (regarding trees). The collective noun <i>zera</i> from the same root refers to offspring when used for persons, and to seed when used in agricultural contexts. Several texts mention a woman’s own offspring. See, for example, when an angel promises Hagar that her <i>zera</i> will be numerous (“descendants,” Genesis 16:10; see also the blessing of Rebekah in 24:60). More often the references are to a man’s offspring (as when God makes the covenant with Abraham in Genesis 17:7). Baruch Levine translates the clause with <i>tazria</i> as “when a woman is inseminated” (<i>Leviticus</i>, 1989, p. 72). That rendering, however, does not sufficiently highlight the active role of the woman in this parashah. —<i>Ed.</i>] <i><b>as at the time of her condition of menstrual separation.</b></i> Menstruation creates impurity and requires seven days of separation followed by a purification ritual. According to 15:19–24, those who have contact with a menstruating woman, or with any object upon which she lies or sits, become impure and must bathe, launder their garments, and wait till evening before having contact with the sanctuary or items earmarked for it.
<i><b>condition of.</b></i> Heb. <i>davah</i> could be associated with the idea of flowing (so Rashi) but also illness (for this sense, see Deuteronomy 7:15, 28:60; Isaiah 1:5).
<i><b>menstrual separation.</b></i> Heb. <i>niddah,</i> which designates menstruation. In later Jewish texts, this word expresses the supposedly repulsive state of women with a genital discharge. Here, however, the term designates a kind of impurity that requires attention yet without apparent stigma (see further at Leviticus 15, especially 15:19–24, and at Numbers 19:9).

Verse 3

 While this verse could be viewed as a sort of parenthetical reminder, a few commentators have suggested that the timing of a boy’s circumcision is coordinated with the diminishing of his mother’s impure status. It may be that the removal of the foreskin was viewed as a sort of purification ritual, so that both mother and son can achieve purity on consecutive days. Perhaps circumcision is delayed until the eighth day, when mother and (consequently) infant are in a less severe state of impurity, in order to prevent the contamination of the person who performs the circumcision. Therefore, circumcision may have been seen as a postpartum ritual associated with the separation of a male child from the impurity of his mother.
The renowned anthropologist Mary Douglas offers another interpretation of the role of circumcision in the context of postpartum impurity. She writes that circumcision played a protective role for mother and son, so that they were perceived as safer than a mother and daughter. This enhanced protection allowed the new mother and her son to venture out sooner, whereas a mother and her daughter had to lie low to avoid danger. Impurity was viewed as having a protective function. One might ask, “Protection from what?” Douglas’s theory assumes that the people of ancient Israel retained a strong fear of demons (for a possible allusion to such demonic forces, see Exodus 4:24–26). The Torah, however, makes no obvious allusions to such a fear, nor does it make an obvious link between impurity and protection with regard to individuals who become <i>tamei</i> for other reasons.
A baby boy who had completed his first week of life is ready for entrance into the covenant, similar to the acceptability of an animal for sacrifice after it had completed its first week of life (Exodus 22:29, Leviticus 22:27).

Verse 4

<b><i>a state of blood purification for thirty-three days.</i></b> This period differs from the initial seven-day period in that the woman now has access to the common sphere, including her husband. She remains impure only in regard to the sanctuary and holy objects. Thus, this section prescribes a total of forty days for the purification period following the birth of a boy.
<i><b>consecrated thing.</b></i> Heb. <i>kodesh,</i> a reference to items earmarked for donation to the sanctuary and its priesthood: these include first-fruits, tithes, and animals designated for sacrifice.

Verse 5

IMPURITY AFTER THE BIRTH OF A FEMALE (12:5) The purification period for a woman after giving birth to a female child is 80 days, twice as long as after a male child. But the provisions follow the same two-step pattern: for the first two weeks, she is in a state of impurity comparable to a menstruating woman; and for sixty-six days she remains impure in regard to the sanctuary and items consecrated to it. The reason for the longer state of impurity after the birth of a girl is unclear. One proposed explanation is that the baby girl is a potential menstruant and mother, and so a future source of impurity. [Nicole Ruane challenges this view in her recent dissertation (“Male without Blemish: Sacrifice and Gender Ideologies in Priestly Ritual Law,” 2005). Instead, she argues that the text presumes the following worldview: “While it is imperfect that women give birth to boys, it is even less perfect when a woman bears a girl” (p. 164). Thus a woman who bears a boy is “rewarded” by having the time of her impurity halved. This possible understanding of birth and of gender would apply to certain priestly writings for which patrilineal continuity is a central concern; we have no information as to how widespread this idea might have been, nor how widely practiced this regulation was. —<i>Ed.</i>] See also Another View.
Other less likely proposals attribute the longer time following the birth of a girl to the ancients’ notion that male embryos were completely formed in forty-one days and females in eighty-two, or posit that the Torah is accounting to the mother the occasional vaginal bleeding which afflicts newborn females (Jonathan Magonet, “…The Riddle of Leviticus 12:5,” in <i>Reading Leviticus,</i> 1996, pp. 144–52), or ascribe a protective function to the state of impurity (see at v. 3).
Some have suggested that the prolonged impurity of the baby girl’s mother reflects the social inferiority of females (a judgment not stated in the biblical text). Others counter that the greater potential for defilement does not indicate social status; after all, the handling of a human corpse defiles to a far greater degree than touching a dead lizard (compare 11:29–31 and Numbers 19), yet the status of the human is higher than that of a reptile.

Verse 6

SACRIFICES BY A WOMAN WHO GAVE BIRTH (12:6–8)
 When the mother reaches either the fortieth or eightieth day post-partum, she must take the necessary ritual steps to regain access to the holy sphere. Leviticus does not prescribe immersion for the woman’s post-partum purification (although the Rabbis assume a second immersion at this point, in addition to the ritual bathing at the end of seven or fourteen days). Rather, two sacrifices mark the end of the period of impurity.
<i><b>burnt offering.</b></i> Heb. <i>olah,</i> which elsewhere has one of several functions: to atone for sin, to offer thanksgiving, or to pay homage to God (see Leviticus 1).
<i><b>purgation offering.</b></i> Heb. <i>chatat,</i> which cleanses the sanctuary of the impurity generated by the mother’s severe discharge; blood from the sacrifice serves as a ritual detergent (see Leviticus 4). Thus, while human blood or discharge is a source of impurity, the blood of an animal sacrifice is what counteracts its effect on the sphere of holiness.

Verse 7

<b><i>she shall then be pure from her flow of blood.</i></b> The passage of time, the offering of sacrifices, and perhaps a ritual bathing (unwritten but apparently assumed) all contribute to her renewed ability to touch and eat sacred food and enter holy space. [To generalize, Leviticus presumes that women have access to sacred space whenever they are ritually pure. <i>—Ed.</i>]

Verse 8

 Provisions for a reduction in the cost of the sacrifice for the poor are found elsewhere in the Torah as well (5:7, 11; 14:21). Otherwise, poor Israelites would have had no means to eliminate impurity.

Chapter 13



Verse 1

<i>Laws for Diagnosing and Containing Skin Diseases</i> (13:1–59)
For a long time, biblical <i>tzaraat</i> has been equated with leprosy (also called Hansen’s Disease), but such a view is mistaken. This unit expects the skin eruptions that it describes to change in appearance or disappear at the end of seven or fourteen days (13:6–8, 27, 35–36), unlike what is known as leprosy today. The Torah appears to group together under the term <i>tzaraat</i> at least three different diseases that cause scaly or discolored skin: probably psoriasis, favus (a fungus infection), and vitiligo. These three conditions, however, do not change appreciably or disappear over the course of a week or two, which leads some scholars to hesitate in making a certain identification with <i>tzaraat.</i>
Modern translations use various terms for <i>tzaraat</i> (sometimes inconsistently), including “scaly affection,” “affection,” “eruption,” “scale disease,” and “leprosy.” Leviticus focuses on the appearance of the disease, not only upon the human body, but also upon fabrics, leather, and houses (13:47–59, 14:33–53). That is, Leviticus is primarily concerned not with the disease but with its manifestation.
Numbers 12 helps explain why the appearance of <i>tzaraat</i> causes its inclusion in the Torah’s system of impurities. There, Miriam and Aaron, Moses’ older siblings, criticize Moses on account of his Cushite wife and dispute Moses’ preeminence as a prophet. God punishes Miriam; and she becomes stricken with <i>tzaraat</i> that is “as snow,” a reference to its whiteness or its flaky nature. Aaron then pleads with Moses on her behalf: “Let her not be as a stillbirth, who emerges from its mother’s womb with its flesh half-eaten away!” (12:12). Thus, the person afflicted with <i>tzaraat</i> seems like a decomposing corpse, as the skin has the appearance of wasting away. This accords with the suggestion (see the introduction) that the common feature of all of the physical conditions that generate impurity is their association with death, a force antithetical to holiness.
The religions of the ancient Near East and ancient Greece regarded scale disease, like most maladies, as divine punishment, often for the violation of treaties. Numbers 12, along with II Kings 5 and II Kings 15 (II Chronicles 26), depicts <i>tzaraat</i> as a condition visited by God upon the sinner. In the case of Miriam, the Rabbis deduce that her sin is maligning Moses; they perceive the disease as the punishment for slander, among other sins. However, Leviticus never implies that the disease is a punishment from God. Rather, it refrains from imputing guilt to the affected individual and describes only the affliction and procedures for coping with its effect.
SKIN DISEASES AND PROCEDURES FOR DIAGNOSING AND CONTAINING THEM (13:1–44)
 Only Moses and Aaron initially receive the information concerning the diagnosis of scale disease. This contrasts with other legislation, which is to be conveyed to the people of Israel (compare 12:1 or 15:1–2). The priests descended from Aaron will be experts in the diagnosis and ritual treatment of <i>tzaraat</i> but not of other diseases, thus confirming the ritual—not medical—nature of the Torah’s concern.
<i>Shiny Marks</i> (13:1–8)

Verse 2

<b><i>person.</i></b> Heb. <i>adam,</i> which refers to both men and women (see Genesis 5:2, where God identifies both woman and man as <i>adam).</i> Miriam’s case in Numbers 12 demonstrates that women can be afflicted (see also below, vv. 29, 38).
<i><b>and it develops into a scaly affection.</b></i> If the initial eruptions grow, they may qualify as a “scaly affection” <i>(nega tzaraat).</i> In Hebrew <i>nega,</i> “affection” (literally “touch”) always refers to a divine punishment in other biblical books (Genesis 12:17; Exodus 11:1; II Kings 15:5), but Leviticus never presents the affliction as punishment.

Verse 3

 For a positive diagnosis of the disease, the hair in the affected patch of skin must also appear white, while the area must appear sunken compared to the skin around it.
<i><b>leprous.</b></i> [Here the original JPS translators note: “Where a human being is declared impure by reason of <i>tzaraat,</i> the traditional translation ‘leprosy’ has been retained without regard to modern medical terminology.” The reason for doing so, according to a member of the translation committee, was “to convey the horror that the Bible attaches to this affliction.” —<i>Ed.</i>]

Verse 4

<b><i>the priest shall isolate the affected person for seven days.</i></b> If the diagnosis is uncertain, the individual is quarantined. The priestly writers seem to advocate special quarters for the afflicted, probably outside the camp for the wilderness period and other quarters, after Israel’s settlement in the land of Canaan.

Verse 5



Verse 6

 If the infection has not increased, the priest will declare the person ritually pure. Seclusion ends after the laundering of clothes and perhaps immersion.

Verse 7



Verse 8

<b><i>the priest shall pronounce that person impure; it is leprosy.</i></b> Alternatively, if the infection has spread after the initial examination, the diagnosis is certain; so when the infection ceases, the individual must undergo the complex ritual described in 14:1–32.

Verse 9

<i>Discolorations</i> (13:9–17) This passage expands the previous criteria for diagnosis but adds a new element, the appearance of a “patch of undiscolored flesh” (v. 10).

Verse 29

<i>Infection of the Scalp or Beard</i> (13:29–37) Some moderns identify the condition with favus, a contagious skin disease caused by a fungus. Another possibility is that chronic protein deficiency has turned the normal hair color to a lighter shade.

Verse 30



Verse 31

 If there were black hair growing in the suspect patch of skin, the priest would have declared the individual pure, as yellow hair is characteristic of the disease. Thus, the priest isolates the person for seven days. Perhaps one can derive from the mention of black hair as the healthy norm that there were few or no blonds or redheads among the ancient Israelites, a possibility suggested by ancient Egyptian wall paintings that depict visiting Semites as black-haired.

<i>Vitiligo</i> (13:38–39) Some moderns identify this condition with vitiligo or leukoderma, which involves a deficiency in pigment. The Torah cautions the priest, however, that this condition should not be mistaken for <i>tzaraat;</i> and so the individual is declared pure.

Verse 39



Verse 40

<i>Baldness</i> (13:40–44) Biblical Hebrew has two terms for baldness. One refers to baldness at the top and back of the head, while the other refers to baldness at the front of the head or forehead.

Verse 41



Verse 42



Verse 43



Verse 44



Verse 45

RESTRICTIONS FOR THE PERSON WITH SCALE DISEASE (13:45–46) We learned above that the person with a suspected case of scale disease is confined or excluded from normal social relations, but now we see additional restrictions placed upon the woman or man judged by the priest to be impure.
<b><i>the clothes shall be rent, the head shall be left bare.</i></b> The first restriction is that the afflicted person should go about in ripped clothes. The second restriction means that the person’s hair shall be <i>parua,</i> that is, disheveled. Both of these are indicators of a person in mourning (see 10:6). Compare Numbers 5:18, where a priest dishevels the hair of a woman accused (without evidence) of adultery.
<i><b>the upper lip shall be covered.</b></i> This requirement may reflect the belief that the person afflicted with scale disease is able to contaminate others with her or his breath, an indicator of the power attributed to the impurity of <i>tzaraat.</i>
<i><b>“Impure! Impure!”</b></i> A warning for people to avoid the afflicted person, presumably so that they will not be rendered impure by touch or breath.

Verse 46

 The individual’s isolation is not simply because scaly disease is deemed contagious, but also because of the fear that impurity would spread from the afflicted party to pure persons in the same structure. The impurity of scale disease and of corpses share the ability to pollute others under the same roof (see Numbers 19:14). If the afflicted party remains in the community, others unaware of the impurity might enter the same structure. If that second individual then enters the sanctuary or eats sacred food, this would bring ritual impurity into a sacred context, leading to potentially disastrous consequences.

Verse 47

INFECTION OF FABRICS AND OF ARTICLES MADE OF SKIN (13:47–59) The Torah juxtaposes people with fabric or leather because <i>tzaraat</i> can afflict both. While <i>tzaraat</i> refers to scale disease when it afflicts persons, in the present context it seems appropriate to understand <i>tzaraat</i> as mold or fungus. The Torah nowhere indicates that the infection of the garment is the by-product of its owner’s <i>tzaraat.</i>
 Wool and linen fabrics are the only types mentioned because these were by far the most common in ancient Israel; cotton and silk were still extremely rare. (The mention of fabric calls women to mind, for typically it was women who produced fabrics; see <i>T’rumah,</i> Another View; at Exodus 35:25–26; and <i>P’kudei,</i> Another View.)

Verse 48

<b><i>in a skin or in anything made of skin.</i></b> The Israelites used leather for sandals and belts, an occasional loincloth (II Kings 1:8), vessels for liquids (Genesis 21:14), a writing surface (perhaps Jeremiah 36), and a covering for tents (Exodus 26:14).

Verse 49



Verse 50



Verse 51



Verse 52

 If the mold eruption has spread, it is considered an acute or malignant case, and so the article’s owner must destroy it by burning.

Verse 54



Verse 55



Verse 56

<b><i>he shall tear it out from the cloth or skin.</i></b> If, after laundering, the affected section is faded, this part alone may be torn away and the rest of the article retained. Clearly, economic considerations play a role in this injunction, for there are poor individuals who own only one garment or cloak, which also serves as a blanket for sleep (see Exodus 22:26, Deuteronomy 24:12–13).

Chapter 14



Verse 1

<i>Purification Ritual for a Person with nega tzaraat</i> (14:1–32)
The word <i>tzaraat</i> refers to a skin disease sometimes translated as “scale disease,” “scaly disease,” “eruption,” and (erroneously) “leprosy.” The diagnosis of <i>tzaraat</i> was the concern of the preceding passage at the end of <i>parashat Tazria.</i> There, we were told that the person whom a priest diagnoses as having <i>tzaraat</i> “shall dwell apart—in a dwelling outside the camp” (13:46). The present unit commences with the priest’s exiting the camp to initiate the ritual that will remove the afflicted person’s impurity. The process of rehabilitating the <i>m’tzora</i> (the afflicted person) has three stages: the first phase when the priest verifies that the individual is cured; the second, on the seventh day, when the afflicted person shaves, washes, and launders her or his garments; and the third stage, on the eighth day, when the afflicted brings a combination of sacrifices to the Sanctuary.
Of all the types of persons who become ritually impure, only the <i>m’tzora</i> undergoes such extensive ritual, preceded by exclusion from the community. Numbers 5:2 demands the removal of other categories of impure people from the camp of Israel, but their situation does not apply to the later period, after settlement in the Land of Israel.
The Bible’s ideas about purity are linked to the association of Israel’s God with life—as the Creator of life, whose life is eternal and whose laws give life. Thus the prophet Ezekiel calls the Torah’s legislation “laws of life” (33:15), while according to Psalm 116:9, one who walks with Israel’s God journeys in the “lands of the living.” Impurity, or estrangement from God, results from certain physical states that were associated with death. For example, a human corpse is a potent source of impurity that infects a house and the living people within it (Numbers 19). The association of <i>tzaraat</i> with death is evident from Numbers 12:12, when—after Miriam has been “stricken with snow-white scales”—Aaron implores, “Let her not be as a stillbirth [literally: a dead person], which emerges from its mother’s womb with half its flesh eaten away!” This suggests that the appearance of the person afflicted with <i>tzaraat</i> was—at least in one form of the disease—akin to that of a disintegrating corpse (see at 14:4). The priest in Leviticus is charged with diagnosing no other disease except for <i>tzaraat,</i> which also indicates the symbolic nature of this condition.
PURIFICATION RITUAL FOR THE AFFLICTED PERSON: DAYS 1–7 (14:1–9)
As noted above, scale disease renders the afflicted impure because of its association with death. The purpose of the ritual in vv. 1–9 is to rid the individual of impurity and perhaps symbolically restore the person to life; thus the Hebrew <i>chai</i> or <i>chayim</i> (“alive” or “live”) is a repeated element. As a result of this phase of the ritual, the <i>m’tzora</i> (the afflicted person) may enter the camp but may not yet return home (v. 8).
<b><i>leper.</i></b> Heb. <i>m’tzora</i> refers to the person suffering from one of several skin diseases. Traditionally the term for those diseases, <i>tzaraat</i>, has been translated as “leprosy,” but in English that word nowadays refers to something other than the conditions that the Torah describes; these are now called “scale disease,” “scaly disease,” or (in this translation) also simply “affection” or “eruption.” [The JPS translators note: “Where a human being is declared impure by reason of <i>tzaraat,</i> the traditional translation ‘leprosy’ has been retained without regard to modern medical terminology.” The reason for doing so, according to a member of the translation committee, was “to convey the horror that the Bible attaches to this affliction.” —<i>Ed</i>]

Verse 2



Verse 3

<b><i>If the priest sees that the leper has been healed.</i></b> The priest is not a healer; rather, he facilitates the removing of ritual impurity once the person is healed.

Verse 4

<b><i>the priest shall order two live pure birds.</i></b> One of the two birds is intended to carry the impurity out into open country (v. 7). Thus it must be a wild bird, or else it would bring that impurity back to the community. The Rabbis identify the bird as an untamed sparrow. (Note the similarity between the function of the bird here and the scapegoat that in the Day of Atonement ritual bears the accumulated sin of the people; see 16:21.)
<i><b>cedar wood, crimson stuff, and hyssop.</b></i> In Numbers 19, the ritual for the person rendered impure by a corpse specifies these same three substances. The similarity of ritual ingredients reinforces the link of <i>tzaraat</i> with death.

Verse 5

<b><i>fresh.</i></b> Heb. <i>chayim</i> (literally “living”), which refers to perpetually flowing water, such as from a spring or river.

Verse 6



Verse 7

<b><i>He shall then sprinkle it seven times on the one to be purified.</i></b> The purpose of the process seems to be purification: the effects of the disease are transferred to the bloodied water, then the live bird that is dipped in it seems to carry away the person’s defilement. Why the person is sprinkled with the bloodied water is unclear, but this act is akin to the sprinkling ritual performed on the individual made impure via contact with a corpse (see Numbers 19). In the latter case, the water is mixed with another reddish material, the ashes of a red (or brown) cow. Elsewhere in Leviticus the sprinkling of the blood of a purgation sacrifice removes impurity (4:6, 17).

Verse 8

 Laundering the garments worn during periods of impurity is a necessary element in rehabilitation (11:25, 40; Leviticus 15; Numbers 19). The person afflicted with <i>tzaraat</i> has to shave all body and head hair before bathing, which reflects the severity of the defilement.
<b><i>After that, the camp may be entered.</i></b> The individual may enter the camp—but not her or his tent, as impurity can still be communicated to those in the same dwelling.

Verse 9

<b><i>then shall be pure.</i></b> After seven days of waiting, and a second round of laundering, shaving, and washing, the individual can now go home.

Verse 10

SACRIFICE BY THE AFFLICTED PERSON: DAY 8 (14:10–20) The last phase of the process involves the decontamination of the Sanctuary and the complete rehabilitation of the individual. The ceremony of the final stage includes a procedure (v. 14) similar to the ordination of the priests in Leviticus 8 (see also Exodus 29), the only other case where such a ritual is required. This correspondence of the <i>m’tzora</i> with the initiated priest elevates the formerly excluded person.

Verse 11



Verse 12



Verse 13



Verse 14

<b><i>on the ridge of the right ear…on the thumb of the right hand, and on the big toe of the right foot</i></b>. In the Bible and the cultures that surrounded ancient Israel, the right is the preferred side (see Genesis 48:17–19). The extremities, from head to toe, symbolize the entire individual, whom the ritual both purifies and reintegrates into the community.

Verse 33

<i>Diagnosis and Purification of a House with nega tzaraat</i> (14:33–53)
Leviticus 13 detailed the diagnosis of <i>tzaraat</i> in people, fabric, and leather garments. The same symptoms could also characterize the interior walls of houses (see 13:47–59). <i>Tzaraat</i> in a house seems to be a kind of mold or fungus that attaches itself to building stones. After a seven-day quarantine, if the fungus has spread, the affected stones and all interior plaster have to be removed and transferred to a dump for impure waste, surely outside the city limits. The house is then repaired, unless the mold returns. If, after the initial seven-day quarantine, the infection has not spread, the priest conducts a purification rite (vv. 49–53) similar to that for an afflicted person on the first day after she or he has been declared healed (vv. 1–7).

Verse 34

<b><i>When…I inflict an eruptive plague upon a house.</i></b> This is the only case in Leviticus claiming that God causes a form of <i>tzaraat.</i> Even here, the text does not present illness and disease as being divine retribution. Leviticus offers no explanation for the cause of disease. Instead, it focuses only on protecting persons and the sanctuary from contamination once the disease appears.

Verse 35



Verse 36

<b><i>The priest shall order the house cleared.</i></b> The house is emptied prior to its inspection so that the owner incurs no financial loss from the priest’s diagnosis. According to vv. 46–47, only those who may have entered the house during the quarantine are considered impure.

Chapter 15



Verse 1

<i>Purification Laws for Persons with Genital Discharge</i> (15:1–33)
The arrangement of Leviticus 15 is chiastic, meaning that each section of the first half of this unit parallels a passage in the second half, but in reverse order:
    Male: abnormal discharge (vv. 1–15)
      Male: normal discharge (vv. 16–17)
        Concerning male-female intercourse (v. 18)
      Female: normal menstruation (vv. 19–24)
    Female: abnormal vaginal bleeding (vv. 25–30)
Normal genital discharges (semen or blood) render the individual impure and necessitate laundering, bathing, and waiting till nightfall in order to regain the state of ritual purity; for the male, this means the nightfall after the ejaculation, and for the female, since it involves blood, the evening of the seventh day. No sacrifice need be offered for normal discharges. No sin is imputed to the man with a seminal discharge. In fact, the commandment to “be fruitful and multiply” (Genesis 1:28) necessitates seminal emissions. When a man comes in contact with menstrual blood through intercourse with a menstruating woman, he too must wait seven days before he is ritually pure. Abnormal discharges (those described in vv. 2–15 and vv. 25–30) involve a longer waiting period and necessitate a purgation offering to eliminate the resulting impurity that accumulated in the sanctuary. Leviticus imputes no wrongdoing to the individual who suffers from those maladies.
THE ISRAELITE MALE (15:1–18)
<i>Laws about Abnormal Discharges from the Penis</i> (15:1–15)

Verse 2



Verse 3

<b><i>runs.</i></b> Heb. <i>zav;</i> when this term applies to a male, it refers only to one with abnormal discharge. The underlying condition might be a form of gonorrhea or an infection of the urinary tract or other organs. The term conveys the idea of “oozing” or “exuding greatly”; the same verb appears in the expression “a land flowing with milk and honey” (see, for example, Exodus 3:8). For the term’s specific application to females, see below (vv. 19, 25).

Verse 4

<b><i>4–10.</i></b> The basic principle that emerges is that all articles under a man with abnormal discharge are impure; as such, they in turn disseminate a one-day impurity to all who touch them. This principle also applies to the menstruating woman (v. 21).

Verse 5

<b><i>those.</i></b> [The Hebrew term is singular but used collectively. Here and elsewhere in Leviticus 15, the present translation renders such language in the plural, in order to convey the gender-neutral sense. —<i>Ed.</i>]

Verse 6



Verse 7



Verse 8



Verse 9



Verse 10



Verse 11

 This verse has puzzled commentators since ancient times, because it states that if the <i>zav</i> rinses his hands in water, the person whom he touches will not contract impurity. Most likely this is a concession to allow the person suffering from a chronic discharge to retain somewhat normal social relationships: as long as he rinses his hands on a regular basis, he may have contact with family and community. These rules would seem to apply as well to women with genital discharges, even though such is not stated in the text (see at v. 20).

Verse 12



Verse 13

<b><i>fresh.</i></b> See at 14:5.

Verse 14

<b><i>On the eighth day he shall take two turtle doves.</i></b> Severe impurities necessitate sacrificial offerings. The sacrifice of two birds corresponds to the offering given by the person of insufficient means in 12:8 and 14:21. The reason a <i>zav</i> makes a donation of lesser value is probably due to the correspondence of his title to the <i>zavah</i> (the woman who suffers from irregular bleeding); the Torah tries to minimize the economic burden for her (see at v. 29), and consequently, for him.

Verse 15



Verse 16

<i>Laws about Normal Seminal Emissions</i> (15:16–18) This section here probably refers to an involuntary ejaculation or nocturnal emission. Deuteronomy 23:11 bars the man who has had a nocturnal emission from remaining in an Israelite military encampment until he has washed and waited till evening.

Verse 17



Verse 18

 Just as seminal emissions render objects impure (vv. 16–17), so they also make a man’s sexual partner impure. The key term in each verse is <i>shichvat zera</i> (“emission of semen,” literally “a laying down of [what can become] offspring”). Many cultures in the ancient world share the idea that sexual intercourse and participation in religious ritual must be separated by washing and waiting. Earlier in the Torah, Moses anticipated God’s descent upon Mount Sinai by prohibiting the Israelites from sexual relations for three days (see at Exodus 19:10, 15).

Verse 19

THE ISRAELITE FEMALE (15:19–30)
<i>Laws about Menstruation</i> (15:19–24) Frequent menstruation is the product of various factors of modern life that were not relevant to our foremothers. Women in ancient Israel (and the ancient world in general) probably menstruated less frequently than modern women, for several reasons. Due to sparser diet, females in pre-modern times began to menstruate on average at age 14, as opposed to an average of age 12 today. Women married soon after they began to menstruate, and generally they experienced more pregnancies in their lifetime than their average modern Jewish counterparts (see <i>B’reishit,</i> Another View). Breast-feeding typically for three years (see at Exodus 2:10) would have further reduced the number of menstrual cycles they experienced. Therefore, the regulations in this passage probably had a smaller practical impact than we might at first imagine.
The original meaning of the key term for menstruation in the Bible, <i>niddah,</i> is unclear, but several Hebrew roots with the letter combination <i>n-d</i> have the general sense of “expel” or “throw.” It is possible that the word was used for the expulsion or elimination of the menstrual blood (see also at 12:2). In Leviticus 15, the term is neutral and without any stigma. In contrast to the pragmatic attitude in this parashah, some later biblical texts use the term <i>niddah</i> as a term of abomination and revulsion, including Leviticus 20:21; Lamentations 1:8, 17; Ezra 9:11; and 11 Chronicles 29:5. Ezekiel, a 6th-century <small>B.C.E.</small> prophet, justifies the destruction of Jerusalem by saying: “Their ways were in My sight like the impurity of a menstruous woman” (36:17). Note that there and in Ezekiel 18:6 and 22:10, the prophet uses the term <i>niddah</i> for the menstruating woman herself. At the same time, however, the expression <i>mei niddah</i> (“water of lustration”) refers to a potion that <i>removes</i> impurity generated by a corpse; it could be translated “water for <i>the elimination of</i> impurity” (Numbers 19:9, 13, 20, 21; see also Zechariah 13:1). On <i>niddah,</i> see also at Numbers 19:9.
[In Leviticus, the menstruant is separated from the sancta (the sacred). The social and ritual isolation of menstruating women is found in many cultures around the world (“Introduction,” Thomas Buckley and Alma Gottlieb, eds., <i>Blood Magic,</i> 1988, p. 12). However, the social functions of menstrual taboos are culturally variable and specific. In one society, these taboos function to subordinate women; in another, they give women exclusive ritual powers; and yet another culture views menstruation ambivalently, as both containing and enhancing women’s power (Buckley and Gottlieb, p. 14). The legislation in Leviticus can be seen as moderate in that the menstruating woman remains at home and has somewhat normal family and social relationships; see above at v. 11, and below at v. 20. —<i>Ed.</i>]
<b><i>discharge.</i></b> Heb. <i>zavah,</i> the feminine equivalent of the term that in v. 2 referred to the man with an abnormal emission. In women, however, this passage uses the word to refer to both normal and abnormal bleeding. (It is difficult to explain the omission of this term in Leviticus 12, which indirectly discusses postpartum bleeding.) The only identified difference between normal and abnormal female bleeding is timing (v. 25). See further below at v. 33.
<b><i>seven days.</i></b> The Torah limits the impurity of the menstruating woman to seven days, as opposed to rabbinic practice, which extends her taboo status seven days beyond the end of her period.

Verse 20

 What are the practical implications of the regulations in this passage? Leviticus 15 nowhere requires the isolation of the menstruant or her removal from her normal context to some other space. The rules concerning her are similar to those of the (male) <i>zav.</i> Objects under her are impure and impart a one-day impurity to all those who touch them (15:4–6, 20–22). The person who touches her becomes impure (15:7, 19). Two additional rules for the woman in <i>niddah</i> are absent for the <i>zav.</i> anyone who has sexual relations with her is impure for seven days (v. 24), and the person who touches an object on the same bedding or chair where she is sitting becomes ritually polluted (v. 23; the Hebrew is difficult). Thus, the menstruant has to be careful regarding where she lies and sits, and she must avoid the touch of others (although the laws are addressed to others, not the woman herself). According to v. 11, the <i>zav</i> may touch another person without consequence but only if he has rinsed his hands; the text does not say whether this applies to the menstruant, but logic suggests that it does. After all, menstruation, a “normal” cause of impurity, does not require a purgation offering as does the “abnormal” case of the man with a chronic discharge. Further, if the priestly regulations mean to imply that anyone whom she touches would become impure, then all the people for whom she cares in the course of her duties would be affected, whether they be her children or the elders of her household. It therefore seems likely that Leviticus intends that the frequent rinsing of her hands would allow the woman to function in her usual capacity.

Verse 21

<b><i>All those.</i></b> See above at v. 5.

Verse 22



Verse 23



Verse 24

 The central concern of Leviticus 15 is couched in this verse: the violation of purity rules when a man has sexual contact with a menstruating woman (see the outline in the unit introduction). Of all the various kinds of contact with a woman in <i>niddah</i> or her belongings, only sexual contact results in a period of impurity equal to that of the woman herself—seven days. Perhaps this is because the male comes into direct contact with her menstrual fluid. Leviticus 20:18 twice denounces both sexual partners as guilty for revealing “her source [or: flow] (of blood),” so it is the intimate nature of their contact that explains his extended period of pollution.
Elsewhere we find more severe consequences for sex with a menstruating woman than simply becoming ritually impure. Leviticus 20:18 decrees that “both of them shall be cut off from among their people.” Both that verse and Leviticus 18:19 place this act in the context of violations of the Covenant that imperil Israel’s tenancy in the land of Canaan. (On <i>niddah,</i> see also Ezekiel 18:6; 22:10.)

Verse 25

<i>Laws about Abnormal Discharge of Blood</i> (15:25–30)
 This verse defines the <i>zavah</i> as a woman who experiences either genital bleeding that is not consistent with her normal menstrual cycle, or a menstrual period that is prolonged beyond the Torah’s norm of seven days (v. 18). In both these cases, the rules that apply to the normally menstruating woman apply to the <i>zavah</i> here during the time of her bleeding and for seven additional days after the bleeding stops (v. 28). The Christians’ New Testament mentions a woman who experienced bleeding such as this for twelve years (Matthew 9:20; Mark 5:25; Luke 8:43).

Verse 26

<b><i>26–27.</i></b> These rules for the woman with abnormal bleeding correspond to those that apply to the woman in <i>niddah</i> in vv. 20–22. Although the additional strictures for the woman in <i>niddah</i> of vv. 23–24 are not repeated in this passage, it is logical to assume that they apply to the <i>zavah</i> as well: anyone who touches an object that is resting on the bed or chair upon which she sits is polluted; and the man who has intercourse with her is impure for seven days.

Verse 27



Verse 28



Verse 29

<b><i>On the eighth day.</i></b> Because of her prolonged period of impurity, she must bring a sacrifice, similar to that of the <i>zav</i> of vv. 3–15. Her donation is akin to that of a person of lesser means (12:8, 14:21), probably because of the frequent occurrence of such “abnormal” bleeding.

Verse 30



Verse 31

CONCLUSION (15:31–33)
<b><i>You shall put the Israelites on guard.</i></b> The exact force of the rare Hebrew verb here is disputed. The verbal root refers to separation. Thus this clause may well be telling Aaron (see v. 1) and his descendants—whose priestly function it is to “distinguish between…the impure and the pure” (10:10)—to “separate” the people of Israel from their impurity.
<i><b>lest they die.</b></i> That is, the consequence of allowing impurity to accumulate without taking the necessary remedial steps is national suicide. The “death” threatened here is not the death of the impure individual, but the collective existence of the people among whom God resides.

Verse 32

<b><i>Such is the ritual concerning.</i></b> Literally, “this is the <i>torah</i> of…a,” one of several places where the word <i>torah</i> (teaching) has a specific, limited sense (so also 14:2; see at 6:2, Deuteronomy 31:9).

Chapter 16



Verse 1

<i>Steps to Ensure Safety in Approaching the Divine</i> (16:1–34)
The parashah begins with a reminder about the penalty for the improper execution of ritual and for encroaching on the sanctuary. Aaron’s sons, Nadab and Abihu, deviated from sacrificial protocol by offering “alien fire” (10:1) that prompted their deaths. Leviticus 10 pointed to an incorrect way to approach the Divine; Leviticus 16 now details a correct one. Together the two passages function as an envelope enclosing the laws of purity. The priests who execute the purity rituals are themselves subject to the fluctuating states of purity and impurity. The system is upheld on every level.
The key to understanding the often arcane priestly rituals is the notion of boundaries. The priests are invested in maintaining distinctions: Divine and human, Israel and Other, priests and people of Israel. As anthropologist Mary Douglas has shown, those distinctions function as homologies in the interlocking system of priestly boundaries: enforcing one boundary in this tight system simultaneously upholds the others. The conceptual boundaries become real in the social sphere when the people of Israel abide by the laws and perform the rituals.
THE EXPIATION AND PURIFICATION OF THE SHRINE (16:1–19)
The demarcation of a specific area as the dwelling place of the Divine maintains the distinction between the holy and the profane. Other means of upholding this distinction include offering sacrifices at a precise time, and ensuring that all bodies involved in a ritual are in a state of purity—with no life-giving fluids seeping out.
<b><i>after the death of the two sons.</i></b> See discussion in 10:1–3 for the disturbing story of the death of Aaron’s sons.

Verse 2

 In order to avoid the death of more priests, a spatial boundary is established between the holy shrine and the Holy of Holies behind the curtain. Aaron, as well as his successors as chief priest, must not cross this line except on the Day of Atonement (16:29–33). Crossing at any other time will result in death, since God’s Presence is tangible beyond the curtain.
<i><b>the Shrine.</b></i> Heb. <i>ha-kodesh;</i> this most interior of sacred spaces that contains the Ark is elsewhere called <i>kodesh ha-kodashim,</i> “the Holy of Holies” (Exodus 26:33–34).

Verse 3



Verse 4

<b><i>sacral linen tunic, with linen breeches.</i></b> This simple raiment serves as a marker of the body’s purity while also demarcating the boundaries of the body. Similarly, clothing conveys that the body is in a state of ritual purity in the contemporary practices of wearing a white robe on Yom Kippur, and of the Muslim practice of <i>Ihram</i> (wearing white clothing) during the <i>Hajj</i> (pilgrimage to Mecca).
<i><b>he shall bathe his body in water.</b></i> Water in the priestly view is a powerful agent—it has the ability to dissolve impurity and usher a body into the state of purity. As he affects the transformation of all the people, the priest himself enters a different state bounded by a ritual bath before and after the rite.

Verse 5



Verse 6

<b><i>to make expiation for himself and for his household.</i></b> The premise here is that the chief priest can externalize misdeeds and transfer them to a sacrificial animal. As he sacrifices the animal, he removes the transgressions from an individual or from the community. (After the destruction of the Temple and the end of the sacrificial system, individuals became responsible for articulating their mistakes and separating from them through the language of repentance and prayer.)

Verse 7



Verse 8

<b><i>Azazel.</i></b> This is the name of the wilderness beyond the boundaries of settled life; most likely it originated as the name of a demon. Azazel in this case is best imagined as the antithesis of the Tabernacle/sanctuary, a place of disorder devoid of the relevant priestly distinctions. By carrying Israel’s impurities to such a wilderness, the scapegoat effectively conveys the chaotic aspects of human life back to a place of origin.

Verse 9



Verse 10



Verse 11



Verse 12



Verse 13



Verse 14

As the sacrifice of the animals dispenses with the people’s transgressions, the sacrificial blood serves as a purifying agent that transforms the inner sanctum.
<i><b>seven times</b></i>. The number seven alludes to the restoration of order and wholeness by recalling the seven days of Creation.

Verse 15



Verse 16

<b><i>the Tent of Meeting, which abides with them in the midst of their impurity.</i></b> In the priestly view, the body exists in a constant state of flux, moving in and out of various states. On one end of the spectrum rests the state of impurity. Although specific practices dissolve physical impurities, the residue of impurity accumulates at the central ritual site. Misdeeds also cause a kind of moral impurity that individuals must purge through acts of atonement. Since Israel’s actions impact its sacred space, the Tent of Meeting—like the body—must undergo a period of purification and subsequent transformation. In this sense, the body and sacred space are parallel domains.

Verse 17



Verse 18



Verse 19

 The priest brings the sanctuary into a state of purity and consecration. It is possible to see these two states as a result of all the actions performed by the priest (sacrifice, sprinkling of blood, and smearing blood on the horns of the altar). Jacob Milgrom sees the daubing of the altar horns as enacting purification, and the sprinkling as an act of consecration (<i>Leviticus</i> 1–16, 1991, p. 1040). Another perspective is that the sprinkling of blood absorbs the taint of the people’s misdeeds from the Shrine and thereby purifies it.

Verse 20

THE SCAPEGOAT RITUAL (16:20–22) Removed from the corporate body of the community and from the space of the Shrine, the people’s transgressions must be transferred elsewhere. The scapegoat is the vehicle of this transference. First the chief priest conveys the transgressions to the goat by laying his hands upon it; then, through the priest’s speech-act of confession, the goat carries this load into a distant wilderness.

Verse 21



Verse 22



Verse 23

POST-RITUAL PURIFICATION OF PRIEST AND PEOPLE (16:23–28) As discussed above at v. 4, the priests perceived water as a powerful annulling agent with the ability to dissolve physical states and usher the body into a new state of being. In priestly ritual, contact with water marks the place between the states of impurity and purity. Its cleansing power removes visible dirt as well as invisible impurities.
In prophetic thought, water has the ability to transform not only physical states, but also a moral state of impurity. The prophet Isaiah says: “Your hands are filled with blood / Wash yourselves; cleanse yourselves” (Isaiah 1:15–16). A combination of priestly and prophetic perceptions of the transforming power of water rests in the background of the immersion ritual that effects conversion in Judaism as well as the Christian ritual of baptism (see <i>Sh’mini,</i> Post-biblical Interpretations).

Verse 24



Verse 25



Verse 26



Verse 27

<b><i>consumed in fire.</i></b> Burning the remnants of the offerings beyond the boundaries of the community disposes of the remnants of human iniquities.

Verse 28



Verse 29

THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE RITUAL AS AN ANNUAL DAY OF ATONEMENT (16:29–34)
<b><i>in the seventh month.</i></b> The seventh month ushers the people into an annual period of renewal and redemption, much as the seventh day does in the weekly cycle.
<i><b>practice self-denial.</b></i> Self-denial pertains to the abstention from food. As water cleanses the surface of the body from transgression, so fasting cleanses the internal organs.

Verse 30

 <b><i>you shall be pure before</i></b> יהוה. The cleansing transforms the people in the eyes of God. It also maintains a good relationship between Israel and the Divine by restoring the people and the Shrine to a state of purity. Whereas an impure community exists in a precarious relationship to the Divine, a pure community can enjoy a proximate, reciprocal relationship.

Verse 31



Verse 32



Verse 33

<b><i>He shall purge the innermost Shrine.</i></b> After the priest removes past taint and transgression from Israel’s sacred sites, the priests and people alike enjoy safety and a new standing before the divine Presence in their midst. This tenth day serves as a day of collective transformation when all enter a renewed state of purity. All assume some responsibility for tainting the shrine and the community, and they release themselves from the consequences through the chief priest’s confessions and the symbolic rites of sacrifice.

Chapter 17



Verse 1

<i>Laws about Eating Meat</i> (17:1–16)
According to Leviticus, one must acknowledge and sanctify at all occasions the life-giving force of blood through precise adherence to the laws of sacrifice and of eating meat.
EATING SACRIFICIAL MEAT (17:1–9)
This section opens the Holiness Code (Leviticus 17–26), a biblical source concerned with defining the proper conduct for all Israelites as a holy people. (See at 19:2.)

Verse 2



Verse 3



Verse 4



Verse 5

<b><i>sacrifices which they have been making in the open.</i></b> In terms of the history of religion, a timeline becomes evident. In an early period of Israelite religion, people slaughtered animals in the fields or at local religious sites as part of regional festivals where the offering and eating of meat had ritual significance. As the priests began to assert centralized power, they outlawed such offerings and mandated sacrifice officiated by a priest at a specific site. (Compare to Deuteronomy 12:20–25.)

Verse 6



Verse 7

<b><i>the goat-demons after whom they stray.</i></b> Eating, sex, and worship are interrelated aspects of life in the biblical imagination. In the ancient world, meals and feasts alike were dedicated to deities. Thus the book of Numbers recounts an episode when the Israelite men go astray in the wilderness by eating contraband food, having sex with Moabite women, and thus drawing close to the god Baal-peor (25:1–3). Likewise, according to the present verse, eating meat whose blood does not come into contact with the altar of Israel’s God counts as an illicit tryst with goat-demons.

Verse 8



Verse 9



Verse 10

EATING NON-SACRIFICIAL MEAT (17:10–16)

Verse 11

<b><i>For the life of the flesh is in the blood.</i></b> The ingestion of blood crosses the boundary between life and death and thus mixes two discrete forces. When spilled, blood—the very force of life—represents death. Thus by consuming blood, a person eats death while also ingesting the life force of another being.

Verse 12



Verse 13

 After hunting an animal or bird, a person must drain and bury the prey’s blood before enjoying the yield.

Verse 14



Verse 15

 Ingestion of the flesh of an animal found dead will render a person impure. Dissolving the impurity then requires the washing, bathing, and time restraints of the basic purification ritual.

Chapter 18



Verse 1

<i>Laws about Sexual Limits</i> (18:1–30)
The book of Leviticus maps an elaborate terrain of states and objects both pure and impure, placing clear borders between them. As leading scholars of Leviticus emphasize, the states of “ritually pure” or “ritually impure” are not moral categories, but rather indices of how close a particular body can draw to the spaces demarcated as repositories of the holy. As the holy is bounded and separated from the profane, so must the body adhere to boundaries when approaching the holy. Leviticus defines geography and physicality by corresponding conceptions of boundaries. As collective recognition of limits uphold sacred space, so individuals maintain the sanctity of the body by policing what goes into and comes out of it.
THE BASIC PRINCIPLE AND THE REASON: DON’T DO AS THE CANAANITES DO (18:1–5)
The distinction that concerns the writers in Leviticus 18 is that of Israel versus other nations: the people of Israel are not to behave like Egyptians or Canaanites. Although the unit distinctly deals with prohibited sexual couplings, the issue here is one of geography and identity more than physicality. In this respect, the laws establish geographic and cultural borders between the people of Israel and the Egyptian empire, as well between Israel and the Canaanites among whom they live. Israel is different, according to Leviticus, in not allowing the perverse couplings permitted among the other peoples. This does not prove that the sexual practices forbidden to the Israelites were ones actually practiced by the Egyptians or Canaanites; rather, these laws help to produce the categories of Israel and Other. Geography is at stake because Israel’s most powerful memory is the exodus from Egypt. As for Canaan, in addition to divine promise, Israel’s land claim derives from the Canaanites’ having made the land odious by their practice, which requires the redemptive purification of Israelite settlement. By outlining the forbidden limits of Israelite sexuality, the priestly writers symbolically establish an ideal set of “geographic” borders that definitively separate Israel from other nations.

Verse 2



Verse 3



Verse 4



Verse 5

<b><i>human beings shall live.</i></b> The common thread through Leviticus 16–18 concerns how to live and stay alive alongside the powerful Presence of the Divine. The priests prescribe a lifestyle in which upholding distinctions maintains purity while ritual practice sheds impurity.

Verse 6

FORBIDDEN RELATIONS (18:6–23) The sexual laws, addressed to men as normative, begin with the prohibition of incest and sexual relations among close kin relations. Anthropologists maintain that prohibitions to establish distinctions in the familial realm are the very basis of culture. The prohibitions against incest—an act that effaces the difference between family members—are consistent with the priestly agenda of maintaining categories. This section outlines who an Israelite man cannot have sexual relations with because they are too close, while at the same time it points out bodies that are forbidden because they are too far from being Israelite. The nuclear family, even step and half-members, is too close, while members of nations such as Egypt and Canaan are too far. Setting such internal and external borders carves out a sexual identity for Israel in the space between.
With the exception of the law forbidding coupling with animals (18:23), this litany of sexual laws does not address women. Rather than subjects, women are objects to be or not be “uncovered.” One wonders how the laws might be different had they been addressed to women and men as equal sexual partners and also what unwritten codes determined the sexual practices of Israelite women.
<b><i>None of you men.</i></b> The overriding principle is that no man should pursue intimate relations with his family members. The family is thus defined in relation to a virile man positioned at the center.

Verse 7

<b><i>Your father’s nakedness.</i></b> The “uncovering” of nakedness refers to different types of sexual interactions. According to a story early in Genesis, Noah “exposed himself” in a drunken stupor after the Flood; his son Ham saw his “father’s nakedness” and related the observation to his brothers (Genesis 9:21–22). Noah cursed Ham’s Canaanite descendants as a result.
<i><b>your mother.</b></i> As in the commandment to honor one’s parents (Exodus 20:12; Deuteronomy 5:16), mother and father are grouped together in the law forbidding incest. A mother’s status is emphasized through repetition. The law prohibits the maternal body because it belongs to the father and because it is the site of birth. [It is noteworthy, however, that the mother’s nakedness is not explicitly tied to the father, unlike the case of the father’s wife (v. 8). —<i>Ed</i>]

Verse 8

<b><i>your father’s wife.</i></b> As noted earlier, in this section’s litany of sexual laws, women are objects to be or not be “uncovered.” Here, the prohibition against intimacy with a stepmother follows that of parental incest because a stepmother is seen as an extension of the father. Marriage, in the biblical view, conjoins two bodies as one flesh (Genesis 2:24).
In contrast to the sexual prohibitions enumerated in Leviticus 20, here there are no attendant penalties for perpetrating such acts. In Leviticus 20:11 a man who lies with his father’s wife is put to death along with the woman; here, it is simply forbidden. Reuben, who slept with his father’s concubine, Bilhah, is cursed by Jacob on his deathbed (Genesis 49:4).

Verse 9

<b><i>your sister.</i></b> A polygamous family in antiquity likely hosted siblings close in age born to different mothers. The verse makes clear that a sister, even a half-sister or one raised elsewhere, is always off-limits. The destructive effects of sibling incest and rape emerge in full force in the story of Amnon’s rape of his half-sister Tamar, both the offspring of King David (II Samuel 13).

Verse 10

<b><i>your son’s daughter.</i></b> The palpable absence here is the prohibition of intercourse with one’s own daughter. Although some scholars claim such a ban to be implicit, it is unsettling not to find it expressly stated. (See also Another View.) The nakedness of grandchildren is classified as “your” nakedness, perhaps conveying the sense that they are a man’s lineage and bearers of his name.
<i><b>your daughter’s daughter.</b></i> [This phrase reminds us that in the Bible, patrilineal relationships are not the only ones that count. Here, close kinship is defined via a woman, namely, the man’s daughter. On women and kinship, see further at Genesis 10:1. —<i>Ed.</i>]

Verse 11



Verse 12



Verse 13



Verse 14



Verse 15

<b><i>your daughter-in-law.</i></b> In Genesis 38, Judah transgresses this law by unknowingly having sex with his daughter-in-law, Tamar. Instead of punishment, Tamar’s action results in the birth of twins who are part of the Davidic line. A fascinating tension that arises from the combination of law and narrative in the <i>Tanach</i> is that characters in the stories sometimes violate the dictates of the laws. Many commentators claim that the laws are later than the narratives and seek to clarify some of the ambiguously ethical decisions made by biblical characters. However, it is best to view the tension between law and narrative as that which arises between principles and their execution in family and social life.

Verse 16

<b><i>your brother’s wife.</i></b> To a certain extent, this law contradicts the procedure of levirate marriage as stipulated in Deuteronomy 25:5–10.

Verse 17

<b><i>a woman and her daughter.</i></b> This prohibition alone emphasizes that it outlaws depraved actions. While having relations with a woman as well as with her daughter or granddaughter does not seem worse than the other forms of incest, perhaps the writers call it depravity since it injures two parties: the woman herself and her descendant.

Verse 18

 According to Genesis, Jacob marries two sisters, Leah and Rachel, who at an early point in the narrative engage in a fierce rivalry (Genesis 29)—although Jacob does not knowingly marry Leah or intend for her to be a rival to Rachel. On the tension between law and narrative, see at v. 15.

Verse 19

 The topic shifts in this verse from incest to other kinds of forbidden sexual acts. In Leviticus, the body in its pure state is discrete and bounded, with no internal fluids seeping out. In the creation story of Genesis 1, God orders the primordial chaos into distinct categories with boundaries between the elements. The blending of categories on the cosmic or the human level is a movement out of order and into chaos—or, in other words, from life to death. The impure body has sores or oozes fluids that transgress physical boundaries (Leviticus 14–15). That which the body should contain flows out and mixes with the external world. Priestly authorities disqualify such a body from participation in ritual. This, as well as an interest that sex result in procreation, lies behind the interdiction against approaching a menstruating woman in order to “uncover her nakedness.” Sex with a menstruating woman becomes an increasingly grave transgression in the sequence of Leviticus: In 15:24 the man who thus has sex with a menstruating woman enters a parallel state of impurity that lasts for seven days; in our verse, such a mingling is expressly forbidden; and in 20:18, the offense is grounds enough for the expulsion of both partners.

Verse 20



Verse 21



Verse 22

In the early 21st century, this is one of the most misinterpreted, abused, and decontextualized verses in the Torah. This verse, ripped from its place in the system of levitical laws, is often mobilized to justify discriminatory legislation and behavior against homosexuals and their families. While the act of anal intercourse would present a problem to the person who organized his life according to the levitical laws, it has no place in judicial systems not governed by the total system of Leviticus—and does not cohere with contemporary sexual notions of mutual consent and sexual preference.
In Leviticus, the priestly writers want to prevent the mixture of different types of fluid, as well as uphold distinctions. In terms of blending fluids, anal intercourse is problematic for the same reason as is intercourse with a menstruating woman: semen, an agent of life, potentially mixes with feces, a substance that symbolizes decay and death. This is similar to the mixture of semen and menstrual blood that indicates the absence of conception. In addition, the priestly writers want to avoid the blending of gender categories, as evident in their choice of language. They do not command “do not lie with a male,” but rather “do not lie with a male as one lies with a woman.” The problem arises when someone treats a male body like a female one. Indeed, such distinctions between the male and the female body define women as those who are penetrated during sexual intercourse and dominated during social intercourse. While treating a man in this manner is odious behavior, it is construed as the natural way to engage women. (See also at 20:13.)
<i><b>it is an abhorrence.</b></i> That is, homosexual sex transgresses the boundary between male and female by penetrating the male body as one does the female body. The priestly writers speak of it as an act of mixture that confused categories in the same way that combining certain foods, seeds, or fabrics confuse categories (see 19:19).

Verse 23

<b><i>Likewise for a woman.</i></b> Where the previous verse speaks of lying with a woman, this verse speaks of a woman directly. Unlike the male subject addressed as “you,” the female subject appears in the third person. Curiously, the only law directed to women is that forbidding bestiality. Perhaps this expresses a chain of sexual command in the priestly imagination, in which a man always has power over a woman and a woman is only more powerful than animals. (In the more severe context of Leviticus 20, woman and man alike who have carnal relations with a beast are slated for death.) However, this law also places a woman in charge of her own sexuality. Rather than holding men responsible for women who engage in bestiality, this law depicts women as commanding their own sexual actions in this instance.

Verse 24

REASONS AND CONSEQUENCES: DON’T DO AS THE CANAANITES DID (18:24–30) The writers justify Israelite penetration into the land because the other inhabitants have defiled it. The issue of which bodies can be penetrated (the topic of vv. 6–23) now finds its corollary in why the Israelites must penetrate and conquer the land. The land appears as a kind of geographic female body that rejects the practitioners of impure acts by spewing them out.

Verse 25



Verse 26



Verse 27



Verse 28

<b><i>So let not the land spew you out.</i></b> Adherence to the laws is the safeguard against rejection by the land. While Israel elsewhere figures as the bride in its relationship to God (see, for example, Hosea 2), it figures here as the groom in its relationship to the land. If Israel contaminates the land with non-sanctioned mixtures and couplings, then she will throw him out as she has earlier partners.

Chapter 19



Verse 1

<i>A Compendium of Paths to Holiness</i> (19:1–37)
Within the framework of holiness, <i>parashat K’doshim</i> groups together laws that, in the main, appear elsewhere in the Torah. Why do the biblical writers repeat and enumerate these particular laws at this point in Leviticus? A number of Jewish biblical scholars recently have argued that these units were written by priests who were influenced by the work of the prophet Isaiah. If this is correct, then Leviticus 17–26 can be read as a response by reform-minded priests (a group of anonymous writers) to an earlier group of priests whose writings are preserved in Leviticus 1–16 and elsewhere in the Torah. (Modern critical scholars refer to Leviticus 17–26 as “H,” which stands for the Holiness Code, in contrast to “P,” which stands for the earlier priestly writings.) <i>Parashat K’doshim</i> expresses, clearly and beautifully, the theological position of these presumed religious reformers.
<i>Parashat K’doshim</i> begins with echoes of three of the Ten Commandments, in laws that address respect for one’s parents, observance of Shabbat, and a prohibition against the worship of other gods. There may be further traces of the Decalogue elsewhere in this unit: the prohibition against murder has been likened to v. 16; the commandment against adultery, to v. 29; the law against stealing, to v. 11; the admonition against bearing false witness, to v. 11 or v. 16; and the commandment concerning coveting, to v. 18. But note a significant difference in the order of the commandments: the laws in this collection start with an emphasis on the relationships between human beings (in rabbinic parlance, <i>bein adam lachavero</i>), whereas the Decalogue begins with a focus on laws between people and God <i>(bein adam lamakom).</i> This arrangement suggests that Israel brings holiness into its communities with attention to the realm of everyday life, particularly the family.
THE HOLINESS FORMULA (19:1–2)

Verse 2

<b><i>Speak to the whole Israelite community.</i></b> The entire community is addressed, women and men.
<i><b>You shall be holy, for I…am holy.</b></i> The call to holiness and the identification of this deity as Israel’s God frame Leviticus 19, and these elements are intended to impact our understanding of our obligations in following these laws. The term <i>k’doshim</i> (holy), although familiar, is a difficult term to define. The basic word, in its varying formulations, appears fifty-nine times in the Holiness Code (Leviticus 17–26).
Our ancestors understood this notion of holiness in varying ways. The Holiness Code offers a distinct (and complex) understanding of holiness. In the book of Deuteronomy (see 7:6), all of Israel is considered holy by the fact of its covenantal relationship with God. Yet in most priestly writings (for example, in Leviticus 1–16), holiness is defined in cultic terms: the priestly writers ascribed holiness to God’s sancta (the sanctuary and its contents), to time—namely, <i>Shabbat</i> and holy days—and to the priests from the family line of Aaron. The priestly writers viewed holiness as a primary attribute of God; they believed, however, that certain people, places, and times could share the condition or status of holiness. Israel is commanded to follow God’s laws in order to maintain the boundaries between the holy and the not-holy, which thus assures God’s presence (<i>kavod</i>) in the sanctuary. Whereas the notion of holiness in the earlier priestly writings is highly static, the Holiness Code offers a radically new view of holiness that is dynamic and constantly shifting according to our actions in the world. Holiness is also democratized; it extends beyond the priesthood and the sanctuary to the entire community and the whole Land of Israel. Anyone in Israel can strive toward the holy through right action.

Verse 3

ON PARENTS AND IDOLS (19:3–4) These two verses together echo three of the Decalogue’s precepts.
<b><i>your mother and your father.</i></b> In other biblical passages that mention both of these parental roles, the father is listed before the mother (for example, Exodus 20:12; 21:15, 17; Deuteronomy 5:16; 21:18; Proverbs 1:8; 20:20). The inverted order here gives special honor to the mother.

Verse 4

<b><i>to idols or…molten gods.</i></b> Both <i>elilim</i> (“idols”) and <i>elohei maseichah</i> (“molten gods”) refer specifically to tangible, human-made representations of gods.

Verse 5

DEMOCRATIZATION OF SACRIFICE (19:5–8) Modern critical scholars believe that most of Leviticus 1–16 was originally intended as a priestly manual regarding procedures for communal sanctuaries. Leviticus 19:5–8 is an excerpt from that priestly manual, with modifications introduced for the laity. This passage conveys the message that holiness must attend to all aspects of life. By now applying the material that already appeared in Leviticus 7 to a wider audience, this writer communicates to the Israelites in general that they have a larger role in the complex system of sacrifice. They cannot rely completely on the priests but must themselves be invested in the rituals.
<b><i>offering of well-being.</i></b> Leviticus 7:11–21 breaks down the offering of well-being into different sub-categories. The Holiness Code writers are not concerned with expounding the details of each type of sacrifice. They are interested in the broad category of the well-being offering because it is the only holy object that a lay person may handle and even consume.
<i><b>be accepted on your behalf.</b></i> The writers of the Holiness Code added this phrase to the earlier formulation of the well-being offering, and they apparently did so for a specific theological purpose. By its form, the Hebrew word <i>lirtzonchem</i> is ambiguous; it means both “be sure that the offering is acceptable (to God) on your behalf” and “be sure that the sacrifice is offered by you willingly and with full heart.” The usage of the plural emphasizes that the writer addresses all Israel, not just the priests. This seemingly minor addition actually demands that the entire population become invested in what had become the domain of the priests alone.

Verse 6



Verse 7



Verse 8

<b><i>that person shall be cut off from kin.</i></b> This formulaic expression (which appears frequently in the Torah) probably indicates that the offender will suffer an untimely death, not excommunication (but see at 7:20).

Verse 9

RIGHTS OF THE POOR (19:9–10) This section moves from ritual duty to the domain of economic justice. The writers of the text acknowledge the uneven distribution of wealth, and they put measures into place to ensure that these inequalities are addressed, even if only in some small measure. The rationale for the precepts is neither mercy nor pity, but rather duty and justice. Deuteronomy 24:19–20 adds to this teaching, emphasizing that whatever falls to the ground during the reaping season cannot be picked up again in a second sweep. The book of Ruth describes the practice mandated in our passage. In Ruth 2 we find an example of women participating in this program. Ruth stands behind the reapers as they cut and gather the sheaves. Whatever they do not grab by hand is left on the ground for Ruth and others to pick up. Ruth 2 also mentions that Boaz, the property owner, orders his workers not to touch Ruth.

Verse 10

<b><i>pick…bare.</i></b> Although the meaning of the Hebrew verb <i>t’olel</i> is not entirely clear, the sense is that some grapes were to be left on the vine, in parallel to leaving a furrow of the field for the poor to harvest. In both cases, the poor were to have the opportunity to pick what had been dropped or left by regular workers.

Verse 11

THEFT, DECEIT, AND FAIR COURTS OF LAW (19:11–16) This collection of laws addresses potential opportunities for exploitation between neighbors and within courts of law. Justice is the central theme, whether the justice is to be carried out in courts of law or only in the eyes of God.
<b><i>steal.</i></b> Heb. <i>ganav,</i> a term that refers to kidnapping and not only to theft of property. There are only two cases in the Bible of women stealing: the matriarch Rachel stealing her father’s <i>t’rafim</i> (the household religious figurines) when she leaves her father’s household (see at Genesis 31:19), and the princess Jehoshabeath, who steals away the young prince Joash to protect him from a military coup and slaughter (II Chronicles 22:11; she is named Jehosheba in II Kings 11:2). In both cases, the act of theft is motivated by a desire to protect the continuity of the family line.

Verse 12



Verse 13



Verse 14

<b><i>insult.</i></b> Literally, “utter a curse.” Just as the blind cannot see a physical obstacle in their path, so the deaf cannot hear a curse and take precautions against it.
<i><b>You shall fear your God.</b></i> This phrase serves as a warning against haughtiness, reminding each individual that there is a force far beyond one’s understanding. Proper perspective helps persons to treat others with compassion.

Verse 15



Verse 16

<b><i>basely.</i></b> The corresponding Hebrew word is also associated with gossip, the misuse of speech. In this particular context, the Torah teaches that unfair accusations and rumors may have dire consequences. (Nowhere does the Bible explicitly associate women with gossip. It is only in rabbinic literature that gossip, <i>l’shon hara,</i> comes to be connected with women, through a midrash on Numbers 12 and Miriam.)
<i><b>Do not profit by the blood of your fellow.</b></i> Two other translations for this clause are “do not stand by idly” and “do not conspire against” your fellow.

Verse 17

HANDLING ANGER IN ACTION AND THOUGHT (19:17–18) The commandments in these two verses are particularly striking insofar as they command what one ought to feel. These laws deal with intentions and emotions. The biblical writers make no distinction between those laws that other people could monitor and enforce, and those that only God could watch, so to speak.
<b><i>hate.</i></b> The corresponding Hebrew term denotes both an emotion and a cognitive state of being. Our ancestors recognized that it is difficult to separate one’s emotions from one’s attitudes and actions.
<i><b>incur no guilt on their account.</b></i> There are a multitude of interpretations for this clause. Some suggest that if you do not reprove the offending individuals, you become an accomplice in their wrongdoing. Others believe that if you do not face the source of your disquiet, it may grow into rage and possibly result in injury.

Verse 18

<b><i>not take vengeance or bear a grudge.</i></b> Taking vengeance means a deed, and bearing a grudge reflects thought. Again, deed and thought—act and intention—are interwoven.
<i><b>Love your fellow.</b></i> The verb for love, <i>ahav,</i> is here followed by the preposition using the letter <i>lamed</i> (“l” in English). This form is found in only four cases in the Bible; Abraham Malamat notes that in all four cases, there is an implication of action, not just feeling (“You Shall Love…,” 1990). See, for example, Leviticus 19:34, where Israelites are commanded to love the foreigner in their midst, which implies merciful and kind action.

Verse 19

MAINTAINING DISTINCT CATEGORIES (19:19) This verse forbids the breeding or mixing of animals, seeds, or cloths of different species or categories (see also Deuteronomy 22:9–11). The rationale behind this prohibition is connected to the rationale behind the dietary laws (Leviticus 11, Deuteronomy 14), the law that forbids cross-dressing (Deuteronomy 22:5), and the law requiring that animals die for killing human beings (Exodus 21:29). Our ancestors believed that species and gender were set out at creation and were to be maintained as distinct categories. Genesis 1:20–30 describes the creation of trees according to their kind, and animals according to their place in the world; Genesis 1:27 states that God created human beings, male and female. Mary Douglas has shown that the dietary laws are an attempt to maintain these clear categories and differentiations. It is this kind of thinking, in sharp categories and distinctions, that leads to the banning of same-sex sexual relations in the Bible (see at Leviticus 20:13) and in other ancient texts—and that assigns different dress, behavior, and social roles for women and men.
<b><i>mixture.</i></b> Heb. <i>shaatnez</i>; the word’s precise meaning is unclear. It appears in the Bible only here and in Deuteronomy 22:11 (which clarifies that this term refers to a combination of wool and linen). Languages related to Hebrew seem to lack a similar word.

Verse 20

AMBIGUOUS STATUS OF THE SLAVE WOMAN (19:20–22) The transition to this topic is rooted in the idea that it is problematic to mix categories. In this case, the “mixing” involves sexual relations, and the complication concerns a woman who is both a slave and an intended wife. The slave woman has been designated for a man (who is not her owner) when another man has sexual relations with her. This passage portrays the woman as an object: the man performs the sexual act upon her (on this idiom, see at Exodus 19:15); and the guilty party is the man who has offended both her current owner and God, to whom the offender must make amends through a ritual sacrifice. The fate of the woman is not the primary concern of the writers of this text. They do not address whether she is likely to remain a slave or to become the wife of the prospective husband. (See also Exodus 21:7–11 for laws about women sold into slavery.)
<b><i>has carnal relations.</i></b> The verb <i>shachav,</i> “to lie down” or “to engage in sexual intercourse,” can take either the direct-object marker <i>et</i> or the preposition <i>im</i> (“with”). In this case, the writer has used the former. This grammatical form—in which the object is relatively passive—may be a linguistic convention, or it may be a clue to the priestly understanding of the relationship between the sexes in this case.
<i><b>slave.</b></i> In Leviticus 25, also part of the Holiness Code, the writers abolish slavery completely for all Israelites. This contradiction suggests that Leviticus 19 is a compilation of laws from various sources whose purpose was to express the specific concerns of this particular school of ancient Israel (see at 19:2). If the woman in this case had not been a slave, Deuteronomy 22:23–27 would have applied, prescribing the death penalty for the woman and man. But the woman here is in an ambiguous state, for she is both a slave woman and a nearly betrothed woman. As seen in v. 19, the Holiness Code writers are particularly interested in liminal states and concerned about confusion caused by overlapping categories.
<i><b>indemnity.</b></i> The corresponding Hebrew word appears only here in the Bible; others translate it as “inquisition.” The question is whether an investigation to clarify her status is required or whether the offender is required simply to pay a fine to the man who owns the woman (either the current master or the future husband).

Verse 21

<b><i>reparation offering.</i></b> Since this illicit sexual act is not subject to the death penalty (v. 20), the offender must appease God through a sacrificial offering.

Verse 22



Verse 23

FIRST FRUITS (19:23–25) The Holiness Code writers believed that the community of Israel maintains holiness not only by the way it treats its members and the sancta (the sacred things), but also by the way it cares for the fruit of the land. One was not to pick fruit from new fruit-bearing trees for three years. In the fourth year, Israelites would dedicate the first fruits to God.
<b><i>you shall regard its fruit as forbidden.</i></b> Literally, “you shall treat as foreskin its foreskin with its fruit.” As Jacob Milgrom has argued, the foreskin refers to the fruit while it is still in its bud; therefore the text commands the removal of the buds—with the incipient fruit inside—from juvenile trees during their first few years (<i>Leviticus 17–22,</i> 2000, p. 1679). Thus, the term <i>arel</i> (“foreskin” or “uncircumcised”) here has both a literal meaning (referring to the bud) and a metaphoric meaning (referring to its forbidden nature).

Verse 24

<b><i>set aside.</i></b> Heb. <i>kodesh;</i> that is, the fruit is to be considered <i>kadosh</i> (holy). This designation is no coincidence; biblical literature commonly distinguishes between “the uncircumcised” (see at v. 23) as foreign to God and “the holy” as a part of God.

Verse 25



Verse 26

WHAT WE DO WITH OUR BODIES (19:26–28) These prohibitions refer to practices that the writers associated with non-Israelite worship.
<b><i>You shall not eat…blood.</i></b> In Leviticus, meat may not be consumed until the blood has been drained and offered to God. The biblical writers understood blood as being the life-source of a being (as in 17:11; Deuteronomy 12:23).

Verse 27

<b><i>27–28.</i></b> These prohibitions refer to certain acts of mourning in the ancient Near East (see also at Deuteronomy 14:1–2). Mourning acts that the Bible considers appropriate include wearing sackcloth and ashes, and fasting.

Verse 28

<b><i>incise any marks.</i></b> The corresponding Hebrew term appears nowhere else and, in this context, is assumed to refer to tattoos.

Verse 29

THE SACRED STATUS OF DAUGHTERS (19:29–30) These verses reflect one of the central themes in the Holiness Code as a whole: the Israelite role in the maintenance and expansion of holiness. On the surface, v. 29 simply seems to prohibit the use of daughters as prostitutes. The key word in this verse is “degrade,” which should be rendered more accurately as “desecrate.” The verb <i>ch-l-l</i> is a technical term in the Holiness Code indicating a decrease in the level of holiness. The use of this verb implies that the daughter is not only a member of society, but also bears the responsibility for aspects of holiness in the community. If a father puts his daughter in a position that diminishes her holiness, that action affects the entire land negatively. This point is made even more strongly by coupling this teaching with a reminder to observe Shabbat and to keep watch over God’s holy space. To some degree, the holiness of a daughter is akin to the holiness of the sanctuary.

Verse 30



Verse 31

CONSULTING GHOSTS AND SPIRITS (19:31) Some scholars argue that consulting ghosts and using divination was problematic because of their inherent magical tendencies, that is, the attempt to manipulate the divine realm. Others assert that there were bans on such practices because they were considered too pagan-like. These conclusions fail, however, given the use of Urim and Thummim by the biblical priests (see Exodus 28:30), for this was a pagan-like device that arguably manipulates the divine. Therefore, one might conclude that the prohibition was motivated in part by the desire to curtail women’s access to the divine. (See further at 20:6.)

Verse 32

RESPECT FOR ELDERS (19:32) The biblical tradition is consistent in its call for respect and care for the elderly.

Verse 33

CARE FOR THE STRANGER (19:33–34) Every law collection in the Bible advocates care for the foreigner who resides in the land of Israel (for example, Exodus 22:20; 23:9; Deuteronomy 14:29; 24:14, 17). These admonitions frequently remind the reader that our ancestors were once strangers in the land of Egypt and that we should remember the vulnerability of the outsider. Elsewhere in the Bible, the stranger is mentioned alongside the widow and orphan.
<b><i>strangers.</i></b> The <i>ger</i> was the non-Israelite who lived either temporarily or long-term in the Land of Israel but did not belong to the ethnic (later political) body of Israel. [Because the <i>ger’s</i> situation and responsibilities do not require that only a male could have such a status, the present translation construes the Hebrew term as gender inclusive and renders the Hebrew masculine form in the plural. <i>—Ed.</i>]

Verse 34



Verse 35

FAIR COMMERCE PRACTICES (19:35–36a) The use of fair weights and measures is also discussed in Deuteronomy 25:13–16.

Verse 36

CONCLUSION (19:36b–37)
 <i><b>I</b></i> יהוה <i><b>am your God who freed you from the land of Egypt.</b></i> The formula <i>ani</i> יהוה (“I יהוה” or “I am יהוה”), which appears fifteen times in Leviticus 19, is an abbreviation for the full text that is now provided as a conclusion. This clause encourages the reader to remember that one must emulate God and seek to become holy because God saved Israel in the past.

Chapter 20



Verse 1

<i>Danger to Holiness and the Dynamics of Holiness</i> (20:1–8)
This unit warns against the practices that desecrate God’s sanctity.
DESECRATING GOD’S NAME THROUGH MOLECH WORSHIP (20:1–5)
The book of Kings mentions a practice wherein individuals (including kings) would sacrifice their children by putting them to the fire for the worship of Molech, the god of the Ammonites, who are Israel’s neighbors to the east (1 Kings 11:7; II Kings 23:10). Although some extra-biblical evidence suggests that such practices did take place, the biblical writers—as anti-pagan polemic—probably exaggerate their extent (see also Leviticus 18:21 and Jeremiah 7:31 on child sacrifice).

Verse 2



Verse 3

<b><i>profaned My holy name.</i></b> Traditional Jewish commentators have interpreted this phrase to mean that one can damage God’s reputation among the nations of the world through wrong actions. The concept is still current today in describing public acts that can bring shame upon the people Israel and its God as acts of <i>chillul haShem.</i> However, in the context of the Holiness Code, the teaching is much more profound, for the message is that wrong human actions can actually have an impact upon that aspect of God known as <i>shem,</i> name. One can increase God’s holiness through right actions, and one can diminish God’s presence in the world through wrong actions. Holiness, being pliable and malleable (see 19:2), is the arena in which persons are in relationship with the Divine. God is affected by human actions—both the good and the bad. According to the Holiness Code, God does not remove the divine Presence (<i>kavod</i>) from Israel’s midst, nor does God act out of great wrath. God may detach an individual from the covenantal promises (“I will set My face against X…whom I will cut off from among the people,” 17:10; 20:3; 20:6); but more often, wrongdoing simply diminishes God’s <i>shem.</i>

Verse 4



Verse 5



Verse 6

CONSULTING GHOSTS AND SPIRITS (20:6) The ban on practicing necromancy and certain types of divination appears three times in this parashah (19:31; here; and 20:27). With every prohibition against divination, the punishment becomes more severe, moving from impurity, to being cut off from one’s people, to the death penalty. See also at 19:31, 20:27, and Exodus 22:17.

Verse 7

THE DYNAMICS OF HOLINESS (20:7–8) These two verses express the heart of the Holiness Code. The ultimate goal is for the community to sanctify itself by observing the precepts outlined in the Code and to strive for holiness at all times. The reason behind this goal is that God is holy and that the proper medium for a connection between God and Israel is holy action. Through proper action, the people come closer to God, and God reaches out toward the community.

Verse 8



Verse 9

<i>Family and Sex Ethics</i> (20:9–21)
This unit closely parallels the material found in Leviticus 18. Both units list incest taboos, laws against male anal penetration, and prohibitions against adultery, bestiality, and Molech worship. The present unit adds prohibitions against cursing parents and the use of seers. Leviticus 20 organizes these laws by the severity of the punishment, whereas Leviticus 18 orders its material according to family relationships. The wording of some of the specific laws differs, but the basic sense of the prohibitions is similar in the two units.
 This verse introduces the new unit on sexual taboos; see further at Leviticus 18. Illicit sexual relationships, especially incest, are understood to be destructive to the family and clan.
<i><b>shall be put to death.</b></i> Heb. <i>mot yumat,</i> the technical term for the death penalty as prescribed by a court of law. In most cases within Torah, capital punishment was to be carried out by stoning.

Verse 10

 The parallel passage in Leviticus 18:20 indicates that when a man has sexual relations with his neighbor’s wife, it makes both parties impure. In contrast, this verse and Deuteronomy 22:22 specify that both the man and the woman are to be put to death. These passages focus on the man as the subject and provide no information about the woman’s complicity in the illicit sexual act. Some have argued that killing the woman makes the woman accountable for her own actions and therefore grants her a level of personhood that is absent from the text in Leviticus. It is also possible that the woman is to be put to death to avoid paternity confusion.
<i><b>If a man commits adultery.</b></i> Adultery in the Bible pertains to a sex act between a man and a married or betrothed woman; sex between a married man and a woman not designated to another man is not considered adultery.

Verse 11



Verse 12

<b><i>If a man lies with his daughter-in-law.</i></b> Both here and in Leviticus 18, there is no prohibition against a man having sexual relations with his own blood daughter, which is highly problematic. See <i>Acharei Mot,</i> Another View.

Verse 13

<b><i>If a man lies with a male.</i></b> Penile penetration with emission of semen defines the sexual act, so it is not surprising that there is no prohibition against female-with-female sex acts. What we today might define as sexual or erotic activity between two women was not a category of thought in the biblical mind-set. The “problem” with male-with-male sex acts apparently was that it put one man in the receptive position, thus emasculating him and confusing sex roles (see at 19:19 regarding the importance of maintaining category distinctions). (See also at 18:22.)

Verse 14



Verse 15



Verse 16

<b><i>If a woman approaches any beast.</i></b> This is the only verse in the unit in which the woman is the subject and agent of the action.

Verse 17



Verse 18

<b><i>menstrual condition.</i></b> Heb. <i>davah,</i> a relatively rare term that elsewhere conveys a sense of physical and emotional vulnerability (see also at 12:2 and 15:33). Possibly the primary concern behind this verse’s prohibition is not sexual intercourse with a menstruant (since it does not say <i>niddah,</i> “menstruant”), but sexual intercourse with a woman who is not well. This may include a woman’s discomfort during menstruation and other conditions in which there is a genital flow due to illness. Leviticus 15:24 establishes a period of seven days of impurity for a man who lies with a menstruant. Our passage prescribes <i>kareit,</i> a cutting off from the community—either as an untimely death or some other form of exclusion (see at 7:20). Leviticus 15 is concerned with impurities and their contagion, while the present unit attempts to curtail certain sexual acts. In other words, the same act is viewed differently through two different social (or theological) lenses.

Verse 19



Verse 20



Verse 21



Verse 22

<i>Holiness of the Land</i> (20:22–27)
The parashah concludes with a theme that appears many times in Torah: inheritance of the land. However, this passage offers an interesting and unique angle on the divine promise: if the people fail to observe the teachings of God, the land itself will spew them out. For the Holiness Code writers, the entire Land of Israel is God’s holy sanctuary. As such, all of the people throughout the land must maintain holiness and purity in order to allow for the holy community and the holy land to co-exist.

Verse 23



Verse 24



Verse 25



Verse 26



Verse 27

 The placement of this rule here appears to connect necromancy with the holiness of the land.
<i><b>a man or a woman.</b></i> In contrast to the Covenant Collection in Exodus (<i>parashat Mishpatim</i>), the Holiness Code rarely includes women explicitly. Such mention here suggests that one of the priestly writers’ concerns is with women’s accessing the divine realm. I Samuel 28 tells the story of King Saul’s consultation with the woman of En-dor, who provides him with access to the ghost of the prophet Samuel. The woman fears for her life because she knows that necromancy is banned, yet Saul has recognized that some Israelites must nevertheless be practicing it and that he needs the woman’s assistance. In a world in which only men could enter into the priesthood and in which men dominated the prophetic guilds, it is likely that women used other forms of divination to access the divine realm. (See also at 19:31 and 20:6.)

Chapter 21



Verse 1

<i>Holiness and Worship</i>
REGULATIONS FOR THE PRIESTS’ HOLINESS AND FOR THE OFFERINGS (21:1–22:33)
p<i>arashat Emor</i> opens with guidelines regarding the holiness of priests (Leviticus 21) and sacrificial offerings (Leviticus 22). Unlike <i>parashat K’doshim</i> (Leviticus 19–20), which addressed the entire people, Leviticus 21 and 22 primarily address the priests. The text places emphasis on avoiding desecration of the sanctuary by keeping the holy from coming into contact with impurity or with disqualifying imperfections.
REGULATIONS FOR PRIESTS’ FAMILIES (21:1–9)
Because the priests are charged with the performance of sacred rites, they must observe strict codes of purity, lest any sort of impurity profane the sanctuary or its sacred objects and thus drive out God’s Presence. This section addresses two primary issues regarding priests: defilement by corpses and the purity of their wives and daughters. In both instances there are obvious ramifications concerning women.
<b><i>None shall defile himself for any [dead] person.</i></b> While lay people may come into contact with corpses, priests must restrict such contact, since dead bodies are considered highly defiling. Although priests are generally prohibited from such exposure, a concession allows them to defile themselves for their closest blood relatives—but not for kinfolk related by marriage. The list of exemptions does not mention the wife. This raises the question: is a priest allowed to participate in the burial of his own wife? Although the topic is not addressed explicitly, this passage seems to preclude a priest from touching his dead wife and attending her burial. Presumably, he can supervise the burial from a certain distance. (See further at v. 4.)

Verse 2

<b><i>relatives.</i></b> Heb. <i>sh’eir</i> (literally “flesh”) is a kinship term that denotes what in English are known as “blood” ties. [The present translation renders the term literally in 18:12–13, which prohibit a man from sexual relations with his aunt because she is his parent’s “flesh.” —<i>Ed.</i>] The priest may defile himself only for certain “flesh and blood” relatives.
<i><b>his mother, his father.</b></i> The mother precedes the father in the list of blood relatives. Later, in v. 11, the father precedes the mother in a similar list. The inversion is most likely a literary device.

Verse 3

<b><i>virgin.</i></b> Heb. <i>b’tulah</i> is better understood here in a more general sense to refer to a stage in a woman’s life characterized by youth and nubility. A more accurate translation might be “adolescent,” since there are contexts in which a <i>b’tulah</i> evidently is not a virgin (Esther 2:17–19). Moreover, sometimes the term <i>b’tulah</i> is qualified by the clause “whom no man had yet known [sexually]” or its variant, “who had not [sexually] known a man” (as in Judges 11:37–39; 21:12; Genesis 24:16), further indicating that <i>b’tulah</i> is not always synonymous with what we mean by “virgin.” An adolescent girl who was not yet married in ancient Israel would have been presumed to be a virgin, since girls were married very young and bridal virginity was the expected norm. In certain cases (including vv. 13–14, below), the context dictates that the translation “virgin” is most appropriate. In the present verse, however, as in the great majority of cases, such a specific translation would be inappropriate.
<i><b>close to him because she has not married.</b></i> A sister is considered “close” until she marries and leaves the household to live with her husband’s family. Once she is living with her husband’s family, the concession that permits the priest to attend a sister’s burial no longer applies in her case because the wording presumes that her husband’s family will attend to her. However, if his sister is still living within the priest’s household when she dies, the priest is responsible for attending to her burial.

Verse 4

<b><i>as a kinsman by marriage.</i></b> Literally, “as a husband among his kin.” This obscure wording appears to prohibit a priest from attending to the burial of his wife or coming close to her place of burial, since she is kin by marriage, not by blood. In ancient Israel a husband normally would have been responsible for the burial of his wife; since priests were prohibited from burying anyone other than blood kin (v. 1), presumably they were expected to arrange for others—members of the household or designated agents—to bury her. (At a later period, the Rabbis, reading <i>sh’eiro</i> in v. 2 as “his wife,” found a way to interpret the law so as to include the priest’s wife among those members of the family that he could personally bury.)

Verse 5

<b><i>They shall not shave smooth…or make gashes in their flesh.</i></b> The law does not prohibit priests from all displays of mourning. However, this verse outlaws these particular mourning rites, perhaps because they were associated with Canaanite funerary practices (see at Deuteronomy 14:1–2).

Verse 6

<b><i>They shall…not profane the name of their God.</i></b> What does it mean to profane the name of God? In the Holiness Code (see the parashah introduction), God’s name stands for God’s reality and therefore has the power to sanctify the people and the priests, bringing the lay population closer to their aspired level of holiness. The concern with profaning God’s name runs throughout the parashah (for example, 21:6; 22:32; 24:10–16). Profaning the divine name takes away its power to sanctify and thus nullifies whatever holiness has been achieved through the observance of God’s laws and regulations. Why does the concern about desecration focus on God’s name, rather than on God? The Holiness Code carefully avoids anthropomorphic images of God (compare Deuteronomy 32). The priests responsible for this material hold that God cannot possibly be contaminated, desecrated, or directly affected in a way that diminishes God’s own holiness. Therefore it speaks in terms of the desecration of God’s name—rather than God’s self.

Verse 7

<b><i>7–8.</i></b> The restrictions concerning whom priests may marry reflect a concern with protecting both the priests’ lineage and their reputation. On the one hand, the priesthood passes down from father to son, and thus the marriage restrictions can assure priests that their sons are of their own line. On the other hand, priests—who are charged with the care and maintenance of the sanctuary—are most likely expected to behave in a way appropriate to their esteemed station. Since the members of a priest’s family partake of his portion of the holy sacrifices and live in his household, the Holiness Code (see the parashah introduction) likewise expects them to conduct themselves with a certain level of propriety; thus, only women of good repute are considered appropriate wives. For the same reason, a priest’s daughter comes under close scrutiny, and her father should take action if her behavior is inappropriate for one of her station.
<b><i>a woman defiled by harlotry.</i></b> This phrase, literally “a harlot woman and one defiled,” is a hendiadys (the use of two words to express a single concept). Here the term “defiled” is probably intended in a figurative rather than a literal sense, and thus we should understand it as “degraded by harlotry.” According to the Holiness Code (see the parashah introduction), a man who makes his daughter into a prostitute “defiles” (that is, degrades) her; moreover, his action results in the land’s being filled with depravity—since other fathers, following his example, will prostitute their daughters (19:29). The reason for the disqualification of a harlot as an appropriate wife for a priest is two-fold. First, pragmatically speaking, the priest would never be sure that the harlot’s offspring would be his own. Second, given that the Holiness Code considers prostitution to be a form of depravity, having a harlot for a wife would be highly inappropriate. The very existence of this prohibition raises the possibility that the Holiness Code does not object to lay members of the community marrying prostitutes.
<i><b>nor…one divorced from her husband.</b></i> There are only a few references to men divorcing their wives in biblical texts. Deuteronomy 22:13–14 presents the case of a man, apparently seeking to divorce his wife after taking an aversion to her, who makes up charges of sexual misconduct against her (claiming that she was not a virgin when they married). In Deuteronomy 24:1, a man divorces his wife because he finds in her <i>ervat davar,</i> literally “the nakedness of the thing,” a term whose meaning is unclear, but could refer to some type of behavioral impropriety, possibly sexual in nature. (Deuteronomy 23:15, the only other place where this expression appears, seems to support this interpretation.) In Hosea 2:4–7, God’s metaphoric wife Israel is threatened with divorce because of her infidelities. Each of these cases involves either improper behavior or false charges of improper behavior on the part of the wife, mainly of a sexual nature. This pattern or assumption might explain why the present verse prohibits a priest from marrying a divorcée. Marriage to a woman possibly prone to sexual promiscuity is problematic for priests, who must be sure that their progeny is their own, and whose family must maintain a certain level of propriety. Note that widows, who generally were above such suspicions, are acceptable marital candidates for priests, except for the chief priest (see v. 14). [As for divorce, Jewish documents from Elephantine, Egypt, dating to the 5th century <small>B.C.E.</small>, show that a woman could divorce her husband. Either partner could initiate a “no-fault” divorce, indicating that moral failing was not necessarily an integral part of divorce for either party. —<i>Ed.</i>]

Verse 8



Verse 9

<b><i>harlotry.</i></b> There are two possible interpretations of the verbal root <i>z-n-h</i> (“harlotry”) in this passage. The term could refer to the actual practice of prostitution, as it does in Genesis 38:15 and Leviticus 19:29; or it could be used in a metaphoric sense to denote illicit sexual activity by a woman (premarital sex or adultery), as it does in Genesis 38:24 and Deuteronomy 22:21. Both interpretations would work equally well in this context. A priest’s daughter, like his wife, is expected to maintain a high level of propriety, since her behavior reflects upon her father. As noted above (v. 7), although the Holiness Code does not prohibit prostitution outright, it considers the practice to be degrading and thus inappropriate for the daughter of a priest. Either prostitution or promiscuity would have brought shame and disgrace to the woman’s family.
<i><b>it is her father whom she defiles.</b></i> The unity of the household means that a daughter’s action is not an independent action but an extension of the father. Impropriety on her part profanes the father and interferes with his ability to carry out his priestly duties.
<i><b>she shall be put to the fire.</b></i> There are only three other cases in the Bible in which we read of such a punishment, and two of them involve sexual offenses. In Genesis 38:24, Judah demands that his daughter-in-law, Tamar, be put to death by fire for committing adultery while awaiting levirate marriage, although in the end she avoids punishment. Leviticus 20:14 states that if a man marries both a woman and her mother, all three are to be put to the fire. In Joshua 7:25, the Israelites stone and burn Achan (a certain member of the tribe of Judah) and his household for his violating the sacred ban (<i>cherem</i>), a prohibition against taking enemy property that was dedicated to God. Since fire is often regarded as a purifying substance, it may have been reserved for offenses where a form of purgation was deemed necessary due to the level of pollution incurred by the offender.

Verse 10

REGULATIONS FOR THE CHIEF PRIEST, INCLUDING CHOICE OF A WIFE (21:10–15) Even stricter regulations follow for the chief priest concerning matters of defilement by corpses, mourning practices, and whom he may marry. (On the more common English designation “high priest,” see at Exodus 28:1.)

Verse 11

<b><i>he shall not defile himself even for his father or mother.</i></b> While a concession allows ordinary priests to defile themselves for their immediate blood relatives (vv. 1–3), no such concession is made for the chief priest. Note the order of father and mother here: a reversal of the reference to mother and father in v. 2.

Verse 12



Verse 13

<b><i>virgin.</i></b> Heb. <i>b’tulim</i> is an abstract noun derived from <i>b’tulah</i> (see at v. 3). In some biblical passages such as the reference to Jephthah’s daughter in Judges 11:37–38, the word seems to simply refer to a young woman’s adolescence, that is, the stage of her life characterized by youth and nubility. Other passages, such as Deuteronomy 22:13–21 and the verse at hand, appear to use the noun as a technical term for virginity.

Verse 14

<b><i>A widow…he may not marry.</i></b> In contrast to ordinary priests, the chief priest is not permitted to marry a widow.
<i><b>virgin.</b></i> Heb. <i>b’tulah</i> in this context is best translated as “virgin” (see at v. 3), since it appears that the chief priest cannot marry any woman who has had prior sexual relations. Since the chief priest must maintain the highest level of purity, it is logical that the purest possible woman is required for his wife. A virgin has not been “defiled” by sex with another man.
<i><b>of his own kin.</b></i> This added restriction is probably out of concern for the purity of his line by assurance of paternity. That is, it seeks to ensure that the chief priest will unquestionably be descended from Aaron.

Verse 15



Verse 16

REGULATIONS FOR DISQUALIFIED PRIESTS (21:16–24) This section stipulates that only priests with no physical defects are able to approach the altar and make sacrifices. Priests with physical impairments, whether as a result of a birth defect or accident, are ineligible to approach the altar to make offerings because they are not considered whole. Although they may not officiate, disqualified priests still are considered priests—and thus entitled to eat the priestly portions of the sacrifices.

Chapter 22



Verse 1

REGULATIONS FOR SACRED FOOD (22:1–16) This section addresses questions regarding who may partake of the sacred donations, which portions of the sacrifices are assigned to the priests, and who among the lay population may share in these portions. The passage ends with a discussion of what to do if a lay person accidentally partakes of the sacred donation.

Verse 2

<b><i>sacred donations.</i></b> This phrase refers to the portions of sacrifices assigned to the priests. Some sacred donations only the priests may eat, while others, such as gift offerings, they may share with their household. See Leviticus 6–7; regarding women’s access to this food, see <i>Tzav,</i> Another View.

<b><i>cut off from before Me.</i></b> See at 7:20 for a similar expression and its implications.

Verse 11



Verse 12

<b><i>12–13.</i></b> These verses give special attention to the question of when a priest’s daughter may partake of the sacred offerings. A priest’s daughter is entitled to partake of her father’s portion of the sacred donations so long as she is part of his household. If she marries a member of the priesthood, her entitlement then derives from her husband. If she marries outside the priesthood, she becomes a part of the lay community and thus loses her entitlement to partake of the sacred donations. This passage indirectly sheds light on the status of daughters and is consistent with intimations elsewhere (see v. 9).

Verse 13

<b><i>without offspring, and is back in her father’s house as in her youth.</i></b> It is not clear under what conditions a widow in ancient Israel would inherit her husband’s estate. A widow or divorcée without children might well have no claim to that estate, in which case she would likely have to go back to her father’s household, since she would have no other means of support (see the story of Tamar in Genesis 38). Here, when a priest’s daughter who has married a lay person re-enters her father’s household under such circumstances, she regains her entitlement to partake of her father’s portion of the sacred donations.
Some widows or divorcées may have had independent means of support. According to biblical law, when a householder dies without making a will, his sons inherit his estate; if he has no sons, his daughters inherit—as in the case of the daughters of Zelophehad, Numbers 27:7–9. If be has no children, the estate stays within his family. Furthermore, a householder apparently could either will his property to his wife or gift it to his daughter, as with Achsah in Joshua 15:16–19.

REGULATIONS FOR BLEMISHED SACRIFICIAL ANIMALS (22:17–25) The instructions shift to identifying acceptable animals for two types of sacrifices: the burnt offering and the sacrifice of well-being. The list of disqualifying defects for sacrificial offerings has twelve items, just like the list of disqualifying defects of a priest in Leviticus 21:18–20; there is a close correspondence between the two passages.

 This verse’s restriction is similar to the teaching about the mother bird in Deuteronomy 22:6–7. Such laws appear to stem from a perception that animals have an emotional attachment to their young, and from a humane concern to limit their distress.

Verse 31

CONCLUDING EXHORTATION (22:31–33) The reminder that Israel’s God brought the people out of Egypt serves as the basis of the demand for obedience to God’s commandments.

Verse 1

<i>Sacred Times</i>
REGULATIONS FOR THE SABBATH AND FESTIVALS (23:1–44)
Leviticus 23 presents a calendar of sacred occasions—dates set apart and designated as belonging to God. This calendar includes the weekly Sabbath, as well as the annual festivals, beginning in the spring with the paschal offering and ending in the fall with Sukkot and Sh’mini Atzeret. The parallel calendar in Numbers 28–29 focuses on the required sacrificial offerings for each sacred occasion, information provided in some of the instructions here. The present passage focuses mainly on explicating the times of the sacred occasions and prohibiting work on certain days. For a discussion of women’s roles in these sacred times, see “Women in Ancient Israel—An Overview.”
INTRODUCTION (23:1–2)
Leviticus 21–22 largely addressed the priests and dealt with priestly matters. But the regulations for sacred times concern the community at large and thus are addressed to the entire people. Women are not specifically mentioned in these laws, yet there is no reason to presume that they are excluded from this legislation.

Verse 2



Verse 3

THE SABBATH AND FESTIVALS, AND CONCLUSION (23:3–44)
The sequence in this section is as follows: the Sabbath (v. 3); the Passover Offering and the Feast of Unleavened Bread (vv. 5–8); the First Barley Offering (vv. 9–14); the First Wheat Offering (Shavuot) (vv. 15–22); the Festival of Alarm Blasts (Rosh HaShanah) (vv. 23–25); the Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur) (vv. 26–32); the Festival of Booths (Sukkot) (vv. 33–35); the Solemn Gathering (Sh’mini Atzeret) (v. 36); conclusion (vv. 37–38); and further laws for the Festival of Booths (vv. 39–43).
 The Sabbath is described as a day without work. In contrast to Numbers 28:9–10, there is no reference to sacrifices here. The passage does not specify what counts as “work,” although other passages do supply some details (see Exodus 3 5:1–3 and Numbers 15:32–36). On the meaning of the Sabbath, see Exodus 31:12–17.

Verse 7

<b><i>you shall not work at your occupations.</i></b> This clause, which is also used in vv. 8, 21, 25, 35, and 36, is apparently distinct from “you shall do no work,” which is commanded for the Sabbath and Day of Atonement (vv. 3 and 28). Rabbinic law accordingly holds that work required for the preparation of food is permissible on festival days, but not on the Sabbath or Day of Atonement; see also Exodus 12:16 (Mishnah <i>Beitzah</i> 5:2; <i>M’gillah</i> 1:5).

Verse 43

<b><i>that future generations may know.</i></b> This commemorative explanation for the requirement to dwell in booths during the festival is unique to Leviticus in the Torah. Numbers 29:12–34 and Deuteronomy 16:13–15 also deal with Sukkot.

Chapter 24



Verse 1

<i>The Tabernacle</i> (24:1–9)
Much of the book of Exodus focused on aspects of the Tabernacle, the portable sanctuary that the Israelites construct while encamped at Mount Sinai. The present unit contains further regulations concerning the Tabernacle’s lamp and bread of display, focusing on their maintenance. Perhaps these instructions appear here because the daily maintenance of the Tabernacle objects was considered supplementary to the observation of sacred times addressed in the previous unit.
<b><i>1–4.</i></b> Similar instructions regarding oil for the Tabernacle lamps, which must remain lit throughout the night, appear in Exodus 27:20–21.

Verse 10

<i>The Case of the Blasphemer</i> (24:10–23)
The parashah closes with the second of two narratives in Leviticus that interrupt laws (the first being the story of Nadab and Abihu in Leviticus 10). This passage recounts the crime of the blasphemer and its resolution. A man whose mother is Israelite and whose father is Egyptian utters God’s name in blasphemy, meaning that he may have done something such as curse God, saying, for example, “May such and such befall יהוה!” An unusual facet of this story is that it records the name of the mother, Shelomith (an Israelite), along with her tribal ancestry, information not provided for the father (see v. 11).
THE STORY OF THE BLASPHEMER (24:10–16)
The story of the blasphemer touches on a number of issues in addition to the desecration of God’s name: What is the status of a person from a “mixed marriage” of an Israelite woman and an Egyptian man? To what extent do Israelite laws apply to such a person?
<b><i>a man whose mother was Israelite and whose father was Egyptian.</i></b> The Hebrew identifies the offender first as “a son of an Israelite woman,” then adds, “and he is a son of an Egyptian man.” The blasphemer’s mixed ancestry seems central to this episode. Since his mother is Israelite but not his father, he has become a member of the clan but is not considered a full-fledged Israelite (Deuteronomy 23:8–9). The man’s mixed ancestry raises the question of whether those not considered full-fledged Israelites can be held liable for blasphemy as Israelite citizens. It is noteworthy that no overt criticism is made about the marriage itself.

Verse 11

<b><i>pronounced the Name in blasphemy.</i></b> Blasphemy consists of pronouncing the divine name in a curse against God, that is, uttering an imprecation against the Deity that includes God’s name (see Exodus 22:27, which prohibits it). In I Kings 21:1–16, Queen Jezebel frames a landowner named Naboth for the crime of blasphemy in order to have him stoned to death so that her husband can obtain Naboth’s land.
<i><b>his mother’s name was Shelomith daughter of Dibri of the tribe of Dan.</b></i> The author takes great care to note the name, lineage, and tribe of the blasphemer’s mother—the only place in the Bible where her name appears. This unusual attention to the lineage of the blasphemer’s mother may be part of a subtle condemnation of the tribe of Dan and their northern Israelite temple, which the Jerusalemite priesthood considered illegitimate. The mention of her lineage could also indicate Shelomith’s prominence in the community.

Verse 12



Verse 13



Verse 14

<b><i>lay their hands upon his head</i></b> By laying their hands on the blasphemer’s head, those who heard the blasphemous words transfer onto the blasphemer the guilt they incurred from hearing God’s name desecrated.
<i><b>community leadership.</b></i> On this translation, see at 8:3 and compare at 4:13.

Verse 15



Verse 16

 This verse establishes the principle that the desecration of the divine name is a capital offense, whether committed by an Israelite or a resident alien <i>(ger).</i>
<i><b>community leadership.</b></i> See at v. 14.
<i><b>stone that person.</b></i> The public, communal, and visually arresting nature of stoning aims to discourage others from engaging in such activities and also serves to unify the community in a common stance against such behavior. In addition, this form of punishment, reserved for especially serious offenses, allows people to express their outrage as a unified group.

Verse 17

THE RETALIATION LAWS <i>(lex talionis)</i> (24:17–22) The message of this parenthetical collection of laws is simply that with regard to retaliation (eye-for-an-eye) laws, the resident alien is under the same obligations as the citizen.

Chapter 25



Verse 1

<i>Introduction</i>
ADDITIONAL TEACHINGS FROM SINAI (25:1)
Leviticus 1:1 states that God spoke to Moses “from the Tent of Meeting”; but here, God speaks to Moses “on Mount Sinai.” According to many scholars, Leviticus 25 represents an independent tradition that concludes in 26:46. The attribution to Sinai emphasizes the critical importance of ensuring freedom and combating social and economic injustice: breaking these rules constitutes breaking the Sinai covenant.

Verse 2

<i>Laws Regarding the Land’s Sabbath</i> (25:2–7)
The land, like the people, must have a sabbath rest, and therefore it must lie fallow every seventh year. The idea may seem like a utopian fantasy, but Baruch Levine points out that letting the land lie fallow was a practical aspect of ancient agriculture, especially where extensive irrigation was utilized. He explains that it “served to reduce the quantity of alkalines, sodium and calcium deposited in the soil” (<i>Leviticus</i>, 1989, p. 272) and thus helped preserve the land’s fertility. Practical considerations aside, for Leviticus this law expresses the supremacy of God, to whom Israel and the land ultimately belong.
<b><i>When you enter the land.</i></b> Unlike the weekly Shabbat that the Israelites are to observe in all places and at all times, the land’s <i>shabbat</i> is to be observed only in the Land of Israel.

Verse 3



Verse 4

<b><i>in the seventh year.</i></b> Exodus 23:10–11 also mandates letting the land lie fallow every seventh year. Scholars suggest that Exodus refers to a rotating fallow year; each Israelite farmer would calculate every seventh year individually for his or her own parcel of land. Our parashah, however, describes a uniform calendar in which every farmer must observe the fallow year at the same seventh year, as part of a fiftieth-year jubilee. Josephus, the 1st-century Jewish historian, reports that the Jews were exempt from a certain imperial tax on the seventh year “which they call the Sabbatical Year, because thereon they neither receive the fruits of their trees, nor do they sow their land” (<i>Antiquities of the Jews</i> 14.10.6).

Verse 5

<b><i>5–6.</i></b> Israelite farmers and their households may eat from the aftergrowth of their fields—making it possible for families to live off the land. With a fixed seventh-year land rest, only fallow land would be available every seven years. Because this system would not provide a social network for the poor, Leviticus 19:9–10 and 23:22 state that one must leave the edges of one’s field and the gleanings of one’s harvest for the poor and the stranger, and not pick one’s vineyards bare or gather fallen fruit. (Exodus 23 does not specify these provisions but implies a rotation of fallow land; see the previous comment.)
<i><b>you, your male and female slaves, the hired and bound laborers.</b></i> Here the Hebrew term for ‘‘you’’ is masculine singular, yet it clearly includes the entire extended family. This usage confirms that elsewhere the text’s second-person masculine language does not necessarily exclude women from its audience.
This phrase contains one of only two explicit references to females in the parashah (see also vv. 44–46). The language echoes the Sabbath ruling in Deuteronomy 5:14 in which the entire household is to rest. Here the goal is to provide food for these otherwise vulnerable members of the household.
Landowners are responsible for feeding those individuals directly under their control, but not the poor or disenfranchised at large, perhaps because the predictable aftergrowth was not abundant (see Jacob Milgrom, <i>Leviticus 23–27,</i> 2001, p. 2162).

Verse 6



Verse 7



Verse 8

<i>The Fiftieth-Year Jubilee</i> (25:8–54)
Jubilee laws demand the release of land and persons every fifty years. The purpose of the laws is to ensure the economic and social freedom of the Israelites, whom God collectively redeemed from slavery in Egypt. These statutes attempt to preserve land tenure. (In Numbers 36, clan leaders—concerned about land transfer to another tribe—invoke the laws of the jubilee when they raise questions about the land granted to Zelophehad’s daughters, Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.) The laws also aim to guarantee that no Israelite will be permanently destitute. Land and people constitute the most basic resources necessary to ensure livelihood. Therefore, the jubilee laws address these issues together—and in doing so, solidify the claim that only God can own Israelite people and land.
JUBILEE LAWS FOR THE LAND (25:8–22)
Leviticus 25 demands that the land, like the people, have a Shabbat in the fiftieth year (in addition to every seventh year). Such legislation symbolizes the intimate bond between the Land of Israel, the people, and God. Some scholars question whether Jews actually observed these laws in ancient times—and if so, to what extent. Josephus, when discussing the jubilee year, does not mention any land lying fallow (<i>Antiquities of the Jews</i> 3.12.3).

Verse 9

<b><i>seventh month.</i></b> The jubilee and sabbatical years begin in the month of Tishrei. (Nisan remains the first month, commemorating the exodus from Egypt.)

Verse 10

<b><i>hallow.</i></b> The Hebrew verbal root is <i>k-d-sh.</i> Just like the seventh day (see for example, Genesis 2:3), so too the jubilee year is sanctified. See also v. 12.
<i><b>proclaim release throughout the land for all its inhabitants.</b></i> This verse sums up the goal of the laws in the parashah: to ensure the fundamental freedom from economic oppression. Heb. <i>dror</i> (“release”) has often been translated as “freedom” or “liberty.” In 1751, the Pennsylvania Assembly ordered a bronze bell to be cast with an English translation of this clause inscribed on it, to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of that American colony’s constitution; the inscription on that bell, now known as the Liberty Bell, is: “Proclaim Liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof.” <i><b>jubilee.</b></i> Heb. <i>yovel,</i> a word that in the Torah is confined to Leviticus 25 and 27 (seventeen times), with one exception (Numbers 36:4; see the introduction to this unit, above). The word also means “a ram” or “a ram’s horn.” <i><b>return to your holding…return to your family.</b></i> The jubilee system aims principally at reuniting families and allowing them to live on their land.

Verse 11



Verse 12



Verse 13

<b><i>your holding.</i></b> Land holdings are inalienable, meaning that persons who sell such holdings regain them automatically and freely at the time of the jubilee. Holdings that have been sold can be redeemed prior to the jubilee by paying for them.
Several biblical texts take for granted that Israelite women sometimes own land. In Numbers 27, five sisters—Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah—demand and inherit their father’s land. From Joshua 15:16–19 and Judges 1:12–15, it seems that a certain Achsah requested and received land from her father after she had married. In addition, II Kings 4:8–37 and 8:1–6 describe a wealthy woman who owns land.

Verse 14

<b><i>14–22.</i></b> Persons with little or no reserve food sources become especially vulnerable when they cannot raise crops. Leviticus repeatedly warns against exploiting these vulnerable Israelites, and it promises sufficient produce for all if the society follows these laws and reveres God.
<b><i>neighbor.</i></b> Heb. <i>amit,</i> which refers to a fellow Israelite.
<i><b>you shall not wrong one another.</b></i> In this verse, the assumed relationship is between one Israelite and another—a relationship of equals. Elsewhere, the Torah commands the Israelites not to wrong a stranger, a foreigner (Exodus 22:20, Leviticus 19:33), or a runaway slave (Deuteronomy 23:17).

Verse 15

<b><i>15–16.</i></b> The number of years to the jubilee’s release determines the price of redemption.

Verse 16



Verse 17

<b><i>Do not wrong one another.</i></b> This repeated prohibition (see v. 14) links ethical behavior between Israelites with their relationship to the Divine.
<i><b>but fear your God.</b></i> Fearing God stands in direct contrast to wronging another person.

Verse 18

<b><i>18–19.</i></b> These verses promise security to the people if they follow God’s rules. Security includes having ample food—enough to satisfy (<i>sova).</i> It also includes living securely in the land—being safe from enemies.

Verse 19



Verse 20

<b><i>20–22.</i></b> These verses address pragmatic concerns regarding the economic viability of the jubilee system. God promises agricultural surplus and instructs the Israelites how to prepare for it and use it. This passage underscores the convictions that the land belongs solely to God and that God controls its productivity. Assurance is given that God will provide for those who observe the jubilee laws.

Verse 21



Verse 22



Verse 23

REASONS FOR THE JUBILEE: PROCLAMATION OF LIBERTY (25:23–24) These verses articulate the rationale for the jubilee laws that preceded, and they set the stage for the ones that are to follow: The land, like the people (see also v. 55), belongs exclusively to God. People’s claim to the land and to each other cannot supersede God’s claim. The jubilee’s laws of redemption are an expression of God’s ultimate ownership of the land (and of the people).

Verse 24



Verse 25

LAWS PROTECTING ISRAELITES FROM PERMANENT POVERTY AND SERVITUDE (25:25–54) Jubilee regulations stipulate both the return of land and the release of Israelites who were indentured on account of insolvency. The laws in this section apply to persons compelled to sell their land, home, and persons—three related stages of decline into poverty. Initial responsibility to help falls on relatives of the impoverished seller. If they do not do so, chances are that the seller will fall victim to further stages of destitution. The laws that follow aim to prevent the decline from becoming irreversible.
<i>Laws to Protect Land Holdings</i> (25:25–28) Once the ancient Israelites are established in the Land of Israel, they live in an agricultural society—in which land equals life. Selling a portion of one’s inherited holding would mean giving up a vital source of livelihood, because most Israelites are members of farm families that depend on the land’s produce. Such a sale would be a first step in the slippery slope toward potential destitution. Jubilee laws presume that agricultural land holdings are inalienable: they belong to God, who gave each one to a particular Israelite clan in perpetuity.
<b><i>If one of your kin.</i></b> Verses 48–49 list genealogical relationships from nearest to the more distant. Generally speaking, kinship ties in the Bible include female as well as male relations. For example, Jacob goes to the family of his mother Rebekah to escape his brother’s wrath (Genesis 28; see further at Genesis 10:1. Leviticus 25, however, seems to extend the notion of kinship to embrace the entire Israelite community.
<i><b>redeemer.</b></i> Heb. <i>goel,</i> meaning a family member with means, who is obligated to “bail out” destitute relatives. Since Leviticus 25 extends the notion of kinship, it fundamentally makes all members of the Israelite community responsible for the economic welfare of the disadvantaged. The book of Ruth illustrates a redemption process: Boaz, a relative of impoverished Naomi, informs a closer relative that Naomi had sold or is selling land. Boaz invites the other man to redeem the land, though he proposes to redeem it himself if this potential redeemer does not (4:1–12). The land is presumably expected to revert back to Naomi’s (or Ruth’s) heir, which may explain why the less affluent relative lets wealthy Boaz acquire the land. It is noteworthy that Naomi sells the land but that Boaz negotiates on her behalf.

Verse 26



Verse 27

<b><i>27–28.</i></b> The original owner has the right to redeem the holding at any point. If that does not happen, the holding reverts back to the original owner in the jubilee year. The price for redeeming the land early must be computed fairly, taking into account the value that the buyer already received and the number of harvests (years) to the next jubilee.

Verse 28



Verse 29

<i>Laws to Protect Homes</i> (25:29–34) Loss of a home through foreclosure or sale represents the next step in the economic decline. Nehemiah 5:1–5 describes persons mortgaging their fields and homes in order to get food—and even losing them due to insolvency. The laws of jubilee seek to enable persons to repossess their homes.
<b><i>29–31–31</i></b>. Leviticus 25 reflects the different economic realities of urban and rural communities. Urban dwellings are not as protected by jubilee laws and do not revert back to the owner. They can, however, be redeemed within a year. Possibly these dwellings were not perceived as integral to a person’s work.

Verse 30



Verse 31



Verse 32

<b><i>32–34.</i></b> This is the only mention of Levites in the book of Leviticus. The Levites function as sanctuary personnel for all Israelites and therefore do not have their own tribal land. Instead, they receive 48 towns scattered among other tribe’s portions (see Numbers 35:1–18). Their urban holdings are therefore inalienable (like farm holdings), remaining theirs in perpetuity.

Verse 33



Verse 34



Verse 35

<i>Laws to Protect Israelites from Debt-Slavery</i> (25:35–54) Debt-slavery represents the most severe consequence of insolvency. Some biblical evidence suggests that daughters may have been especially vulnerable to being used as indentured labor for the household’s debts (see at Exodus 21:7–11). Thus indenture may have been particularly unfortunate for nubile females, whose virginity (and thus marriageability) may have been at risk in an indentured context. At the same time, it is possible that children benefited from access to food in the more affluent household to which they were indentured.
Several laws in the Torah seek to regulate and ameliorate the conditions of Israelite debt-slaves. Exodus 21:2–11 and Deuteronomy 15:12–18 demand the release of slaves in the seventh year, and Deuteronomy 15:1–3 requires canceling debts in the seventh year. These laws stand in tension with Leviticus 25, which mentions mandatory release only in the fiftieth year.
Some scholars attempt to account for the inconsistency by claiming that Exodus and Deuteronomy refer to selling a <i>dependent</i> member of the household, whereas Leviticus 25 pertains to the head of the household (so Gregory C. Chirichigno, <i>Debt-Slavery in Israel and the Ancient Near East,</i> 1993, pp. 352–54). More likely, however, the tradition preserves diverse perspectives in the attempt to cope with complex issues and changing circumstances.
<b><i>35–46.</i></b> The Hebrew that refers to impoverished kin is couched mostly in the singular. To reflect the gender-inclusive sense here, the present translation extends the plural language of the summary statement in v. 42 to the rest of the passage, as needed.
<b><i>35–38.</i></b> These laws attempt to protect Israelites from irreversible poverty by prohibiting Israelites from charging interest on loans to other Israelites in distress.
<b><i>If your kin.</i></b> Scholars debate whether the reference pertains only to a blood relative or extends to any member of the Israelite community.
<i><b>let them live by your side.</b></i> Immediate relatives are urged to support the poor member of the family. A 21st-century analogy might be finding the person a job in one’s own business so as to prevent homelessness and starvation.

Verse 36

 A drought, a bad harvest, or an illness might force a farmer to seek loans. To help prevent decline into irreversible poverty, these verses permit only interest-free loans to fellow Israelites (a practice that is still maintained today through the “Hebrew Free Loan” associations). Ancient Mesopotamian documents show interest rates for loans of money, seed, or food as high as 60 percent. Such rates would make repayment impossible and push the debtor deeper into destitution.
<i><b>do not exact.</b></i> Israelite lenders may not take advantage of the economically vulnerable members of the community when misfortune strikes.
<i><b>advance…interest.</b></i> That is, taking a “bite”—a discount—from the loan. (The Hebrew for “advance” relates to the verb for “bite.”) See also Deuteronomy 23:20–21 (but unlike Deuteronomy 15, Leviticus does not mention cancellation of debt). The prohibition also applies to confiscating a pledge (person or property) when the loan is delinquent. The book of Kings mentions a widow who begs the prophet Elisha to help her: “a creditor is coming to take away my two sons to be his slaves” (II Kings 4:1; Elisha provides a miraculous source of oil, which enables her to pay off the creditor and keep her family intact, 4:7).

Verse 37



Verse 38



Verse 39

<b><i>39–43.</i></b> These verses address the next stage of economic decline: insolvency that forces persons into debt-servitude. The children of the widow in II Kings 4:1 (see previous comment) are subject to such servitude. Likewise, Nehemiah 5 describes the predicament of Judeans in the 5th century <small>B.C.E.</small>: “There was a great outcry by the common people and their wives against their fellow Jews. Some said, ‘Our sons and daughters are numerous; we must get grain to eat in order that we may live!’ Others said, ‘We must pawn our fields, our vineyards, and our homes to get grain to stave off hunger.’ Yet others said, ‘We have borrowed money against our fields…we are subjecting our sons and daughters to slavery—some of our daughters are already subjected—and we are powerless’” (Nehemiah 5:1–5). For insight into the complex circumstances of women slaves, see also at Leviticus 19:20–22 and Exodus 21:7–11.
Indentured Israelites must be treated as day laborers or hired hands, not as slaves. Chirichigno, basing his view on Mesopotamian laws, suggests that this includes providing them with housing and fair allowances (<i>Debt-Slavery</i>, p. 343).

Verse 40

<b><i>until the jubilee year.</i></b> Unlike Exodus 21 and Deuteronomy 15, Leviticus does not mention slaves’ release in the seventh year but only in the jubilee year. The fiftieth year is part of the national calendar. According to this law, one who begins service in the forty-sixth year of the jubilee’s cycle would be released less than four years later.

Verse 41

<b><i>they, along with any children.</i></b> The Hebrew uses masculine language (which, in its most restricted sense, means “he and his sons with him”), raising the question whether wives and other female members of the family are to receive their freedom (see Another View). Presumably a daughter, if she became sexually attached to a man in the “owner’s” house, did not have the option of release; however, she might have other legal protections (see at Exodus 21:7–11). In Jeremiah 34:12–16, a law about slavery formulated in masculine language explicitly applies to women as well as men. (That passage describes the release of slave women and men in a time of siege. Jeremiah also notes, however, that these released slaves are repossessed shortly after, and he condemns the repossession as profaning God’s name.) Here, too, there is no reason to exclude women from view; war, famine, plague, and the like could easily put women in the position of becoming debt-slaves if they (or their husbands) suddenly found themselves without the normal protection of a household or clan and its access to land. To convey the gender-inclusive sense of the Hebrew wording, the translation here uses plural language.

Verse 42



Verse 43

<b><i>ruthlessly.</i></b> The same Hebrew word describes the abuse that the Israelites suffered in Egypt (Exodus 1:13). They are not to perpetuate such oppression.

Verse 44

<b><i>44–46.</i></b> Indentured foreign females and males do not go free. When sold into slavery, foreigners become the Israelites’ possession “for all time” (v. 46). This harsh ruling contradicts other laws in Leviticus that specify an identical law for the Israelite, the foreigner, and the resident alien (as 24:22 states: “you shall have one standard for stranger and citizen alike”; see also Exodus 12:49 and Numbers 15:16). Later rabbinic traditions attempt to ameliorate this legislation by interpreting “for all time” to mean “until the jubilee year,” but such a generous reading contradicts the plain sense of this passage.
<b><i>male and female slaves.</i></b> This is the second place in this parashah that mentions women explicitly (see also females slaves in vv. 6–7). The specification of females at this juncture may serve to emphasize that there is no special treatment for women slaves when they are foreign (whereas other biblical laws such as Exodus 21:2–11 do distinguish between the fate of female and male slaves). Verse 46 makes it clear that a foreign female (or male) slave was to have no automatic chance of regaining freedom. | The term for “female slave,” <i>amah,</i> is best translated as “handmaid” because <i>amah</i> also refers to the forearm (and, like “foot” in English, also functions as a measuring unit—namely, in this case, the cubit). Sarah refers to Hagar the Egyptian as <i>amah</i> when she demands her expulsion (Genesis 21:10), and both Bilhah and Zilpah receive this title on occasion (see Genesis 30:3), although the more common term for all three women is <i>shifchah.</i> Free women can use <i>amah</i> to express deference, as when Ruth the Moabite calls herself an <i>amah</i> when addressing Boaz in Ruth 3:9.

Verse 45



Verse 46



Verse 47

<b><i>47–54.</i></b> A family member must redeem an Israelite whom a resident alien purchases or seizes to cover a debt. The price of redemption is to be determined fairly on the basis of expected years of servitude until the year of the jubilee. These laws apply only within Israelite settlements in the Land of Israel. The Bible meanwhile includes some stories about Israelite slaves in non-Israelite households outside the land. One such anecdote in II Kings 5:1–4 mentions a young Israelite slave girl (a war captive) serving a household in a neighboring country. Seeing that her mistress’s husband—the general Naaman—had contracted a skin disease (<i>tzaraat</i>), the Israelite slave girl informs the wife that a prophet in Israel could cure the husband. Grace Aguilar, the English Jewish poet, novelist, and theologian (1817–1847), claimed that this story was proof that even a young slave girl in biblical times knew about her “Jewish” tradition and resources. Aguilar used this story to campaign for extending Jewish education to women in her own time.

Verse 48

<b><i>right of redemption.</i></b> Implicitly, the foreign owner cannot reject an offer of redemption.
<b><i>48–49. [Typically,] a brother… or an uncle…anyone in the family.</i></b> The line of kinship bond of those who must redeem an indentured Israelite extends to all blood relatives.

Verse 49

<b><i>same flesh.</i></b> From how Leviticus 21:2–4 defines this term, we can suppose that the line of potential redeemers here includes mothers, sisters, and daughters.

Verse 50

<b><i>50–51.</i></b> The redeemer must offer a fair price. The redeemed is obligated to repay the redeemer and can do so by working for the redeemer as a hired hand until the year of the jubilee.

<i>Conclusion</i>
GOD’S OWNERSHIP OF THE ISRAELITES AS BASIS FOR JUBILEE LAWS (25:55–26:2)
The conclusion of the parashah expresses the theological or religious underpinning of the jubilee and slavery legislation: Israelites are God’s servants and therefore may not belong to others. In keeping God’s sabbaths, both people and land experience the freedom that service to God entails.
<b><i>My servants.</i></b> Heb. <i>avadim (eved</i> in the singular) can refer variously to servants, slaves, and worshippers. In the Torah, the difference between servitude and freedom depends on whom one serves. God instructed Moses to tell Pharaoh not merely “Let My people go!” but “Let My people go so that they may <i>serve</i> Me!” (Exodus 7:16). Significantly, many editions translate the verb <i>e-v-d</i> in Exodus 7:16 and elsewhere as “worship,” which highlights the nuanced ways in which that verb functions.

Chapter 26



Verse 1



Verse 2

<b><i>My sabbaths.</i></b> In Deuteronomy 5:15, the purpose of the Sabbath is to enable female and male slaves to rest because “you were a slave in the land of Egypt.” The entire jubilee system is rooted in the multiple ways in which the observance of the Sabbath is to be implemented.
<i><b>venerate My sanctuary.</b></i> In the context of this parashah, the sanctuary appears to include not only the Tabernacle but also the Land of Israel and the people of Israel. (See also at 26:11.)

<i>Epilogue</i>
ENSURING OBEDIENCE TO GOD (26:3–46)
The opening unit of the parashah presents an epilogue to the book of Leviticus as a whole. God addresses the Israelites who are about to enter the Promised Land, assuring them of great rewards if they follow God’s instructions, and threatening them with a series of increasingly severe punishments if they disobey. The laws pertain to women and men together as a community. The rewards and the punishments are symmetrical: the punishments reverse each of the promised rewards via a contrasting threat. For example, a promise of fertility of the land (vv. 4–5 and 10) contrasts with the threat of a barren and fruitless land (vv. 16, 19–20). The symmetry, among other things, expresses a balanced and ordered universe, a theme that is important in priestly writings (see Genesis 1). These blessings and curses resemble those that conclude Deuteronomy’s laws (Deuteronomy 28–30) and many ancient Near Eastern treaties. In all of these instances, the curses section tends to be much longer and more detailed than the blessings section, most likely to frighten the hearers into obedience through the threat of divine enforcement.
BLESSINGS FOR OBEDIENCE (26:3–13)
The blessings that will be bestowed upon Israel if the people follow God’s laws include: peace, prosperity, safety from wild beasts, fertility of both the people and the land, and victory over their enemies. God will uphold the covenant and reside in Israel’s midst, ensuring that the people will flourish and prosper and be free from all oppression.

Verse 4

<b><i>rains in their season.</i></b> Survival in this agricultural economy depended on timely rain. Too much at the wrong time or too little devastated crops and resulted in famine. (See also Deuteronomy 11:11, 33:13.)

Verse 5

 The blessing will consist of having such bountiful harvests that the harvesting season will last until the next planting season.

Verse 6



Verse 7



Verse 8



Verse 9

<b><i>I will…make you fertile.</i></b> On God’s role in fertility, see the introduction to Genesis 16:1–6 and at Deuteronomy 33:13.
<b><i>I will maintain My covenant with you.</i></b> God’s covenantal faithfulness serves as guarantee that these promises will come true.

Verse 10



Verse 11

<b><i>abode.</i></b> Heb. <i>mishkan</i> is translated elsewhere as “Tabernacle” (as in Exodus 25:9 Leviticus 8:10); here, however, the term carries a much broader sense. God assures the people that the Deity will reside with Israel in the land. The text emphasizes the presence of God with the people as a whole, not confined to the sanctuary.
<b><i>I will not spurn you.</i></b> Spurning (or rejecting) is something of a leitmotif in this unit. First, God promises never to spurn Israel if the people follow the laws and commandments (v. 11). Next, if the people choose to spurn these laws and commandments (v. 15), the punishments will begin. Finally, God will spurn Israel temporarily should the people fail to return to God after a series of increasingly severe punishments (v. 30; but see v. 44, when God relents nonetheless).

Verse 12

<b><i>I will be ever present in your midst.</i></b> Literally, “I will walk about in your midst.” This description might refer back to the story of the Garden of Eden when God is depicted as walking about the Garden (see Genesis 3:8). The establishment of God’s abode in Israel’s midst will ensure a period of prosperity and peace—as well as a palpable relationship with God.
<i><b>I will be your God, and you shall be My people.</b></i> This expression refers back to the covenantal promise made at Sinai (Exodus 6:2–8) and reiterates mutual commitment.

Verse 13

 The blessings’ section concludes by reminding Israel of their special relationship to God, and of what God has done for them in the past, thereby also alluding to what God is capable of doing for them in the future.

Verse 14

CURSES FOR DISOBEDIENCE (26:14–45) In contrast to the rather brief section of blessings, the list of curses is longer and more detailed. It threatens Israel with the consequences that will follow if the people spurn God’s rules and fail to observe God’s laws. The curses in Leviticus 26:14–45 largely mirror the blessings in the previous section and also have many similarities to the curses in Deuteronomy 28:15–68. However, in Deuteronomy the curses appear as punishment, while here they are presented also as God’s attempt to influence the people to return to the right path (see vv. 18, 21, 23, and 27). With each increasingly severe measure, God hopes that Israel will have learned its lesson. The punishments will stop at any point when the Israelites relent and turn back to God.
These writings probably gave hope to the people of Israel after the Babylonian Exile (597/587–538 <small>B.C.E.</small>) because they provide an explanation for how God could have allowed the downfall of Jerusalem and the Exile to come about; Leviticus 26 also emphasizes the promise of restoration once the people repent.

Verse 26

<b><i>ten women shall bake your bread in a single oven.</i></b> Many women will all share one oven, whether for lack of dough or for lack of wood to fuel the oven. Either way, the threat is that of famine. Variations on this theme are common in ancient Near Eastern curses. For example, a curse in the Aramaic Sefire inscription (mid-8th century <small>B.C.E.</small>) reads: “And may his seven daughters bake bread in an oven but not fill it”; and a curse in the bilingual Assyrian-Aramaic Tell Fekheriyeh inscription (9th century <small>B.C.E.</small>) reads, “May a hundred women bake bread in an oven and not fill it.” [It appears that ovens were beehive-shaped forms, made of a mixture of chopped clay and straw, sometimes with broken shards pressed onto the oven. They could be slightly recessed into the ground. (See P. King and L. Stager, <i>Life in Biblical Israel,</i> 2001, p. 67.) They were generally in the courtyard and probably served several adjacent dwellings. But they could also be in interior space; a baker would more likely fire up an interior oven in cold rainy weather. The bread could be baked on a baking tray, set over the fire inside the oven. —<i>Ed</i>] Oven fuel consisted of branches or dung (see Malachi 3:19; Jacob Milgrom, <i>Leviticus 23–27,</i> 2001, p. 2314).
Here the text specifies women as the ones who bake the bread. This provides some insight into the division of labor in the ancient Israelite household. While women were the ones responsible for childbearing and childrearing, they also divided with men the other duties necessary to sustain and support the household. This text, then, provides evidence that women were predominantly responsible for tasks related to food production, that is, the transformation of raw foodstuffs into consumable goods. In the ancient world this was a very important and time-consuming task. Other biblical texts, through their association of women and food production in various forms, support this conclusion. For example, in I Samuel 28:24, the medium of En-dor prepares a calf and makes bread for King Saul. In Jeremiah 7:17–18, women are described as kneading dough for cakes to offer to the Queen of Heaven. In 1 Samuel 8:13, the prophet Samuel warns the people that monarchy will make many demands of them, including that the king “will take your daughters as perfumers, cooks, and bakers.” This last text implies that women indeed served those functions at the royal palace, as well as in ordinary households. See further at Exodus 16:3.

Verse 27



Verse 28



Verse 29

<b><i>You shall eat the flesh of your sons and the flesh of your daughters.</i></b> The horrific prospect of cannibalism as a result of siege, extreme famine, or both is a recurrent theme in Israelite and other ancient Near Eastern curses. An extreme version of this theme appears in II Kings 6:28–29, when a king in besieged and famine-struck Samaria must decide between two women who had agreed to eat their respective children, first one and then the other, to stave off starvation. A conflict erupts when, after having shared in eating the first woman’s child, the second mother hides her son. (The story is an ironic twist on the episode in which King Solomon demonstrates his superb wisdom by determining which harlot is the rightful mother of a baby; see I Kings 3:16–28.) In Lamentations 2:20 and 4:10, references to women desperate enough to eat their own children show how terrible the situation for the people of Judah has become. In both of these texts, the image of women eating their children exemplifies a crisis so severe that it reverses even the maternal instinct: instead of being willing to sacrifice everything—even themselves—for their children, these mothers sacrifice their children in the most horrific way possible, so that they may live. The image is that of a world turned tragically upside down by the horrors of wartime siege and famine.

Verse 30

<b><i>I will destroy your cult places and cut down your incense stands.</i></b> Biblical references use neutral terms for cult places (sometimes translated as “high places”) or local shrines in early stages of Israelite life but criticize these for the period after the building of the temple in Jerusalem (in the 10th or 9th century <small>B.C.E.</small>). For example, I Kings 22:44 and II Kings 15:35 mention people worshiping God at such high places; that author does not approve of the practice yet apparently tolerates it. More so than men, women most likely depended on local shrines to enable them to participate in communal events. (They probably also had home shrines.) The Bible—and probably the Israelites in general—apparently considered worship of God at these local shrines to be a legitimate religious outlet until centralization of worship at the Temple began to be enforced (see at Deuteronomy 12:2–14). The Bible suggests that this centralization began around the 7th century <small>B.C.E.</small>, in the reigns of King Hezekiah and, later, Josiah. The Bible associates worship at local shrines after that time with idolatry, regardless of who was worshiped there.
Centralization of worship probably had a huge impact on women, who would have been less able than men were to leave their families and their domestic and reproductive responsibilities in order to travel to Jerusalem. Once the worship of God at local shrines ceased to be legitimate, women lost important communal religious practices. When the Bible mentions women’s worship from the period of the monarchy on, it mostly categorizes it as worship of false deities, probably considered noteworthy because such practices undermined the central sanctuary. See, for example, the association of women with the worship of Asherah (I Kings 15:13 = II Chronicles 15:16; I Kings 18:19; and II Kings 23:4); references to female worship of the Queen of Heaven (Jeremiah 7:18 and 44:15–25); and women weeping for Tammuz (Ezekiel 8:14). From an Israelite woman’s perspective, many of these practices were probably traditional and legitimate (see women’s defense of the worship in Jeremiah 44).

Verse 31



Verse 32

 Those who will replace the deported or destroyed Israelites will be so horrified by the level of desolation and destruction of the land that they will wonder what the inhabitants had done to incur such divine wrath against them (see also Deuteronomy 29:21–23).

Verse 33



Verse 34

<b><i>Then shall the land make up for its sabbath years.</i></b> In a case of poetic justice, the land in its desolation will at last lie fallow. This will make up for all of the years that the Israelites abused it by continuous cultivation, contravening laws such as Leviticus 25.

Verse 41

<b><i>obdurate heart.</i></b> Literally, uncircumcised heart.” The metaphor implies that their heart is covered as if by uncircumcised foreskin: it is unresponsive and unfeeling.

Verse 42

<b><i>Then will I remember My covenant.</i></b> This theme of God recalling the covenant and responding in compassion appears in Exodus 6:5 (in the context of the liberation from Egypt) and throughout the Bible. Especially interesting is Isaiah 54:1–10, where God addresses Israel as a wife and promises “her” eternal covenant faithfulness (in the context of restoration).
<b><i>Jacob…Isaac…Abraham.</i></b> The reversed order of the patriarchs may reflect God’s looking backward in time to the very first commitment to this people.

Verse 43



Verse 44

<b><i>I will not reject them or spurn them.</i></b> That is, even though Israel spurned God, God will never spurn Israel completely by annulling the covenant.

Verse 45

<b><i>the covenant with the ancients, whom I freed from the land of Egypt.</i></b> Reference to the generation of the Exodus includes those who took part in the Sinai covenant.

Verse 46

CONCLUSION (26:46) The book of Leviticus probably ended with this verse at one point. The reference to Sinai aims to emphasize the authority of these laws (see also at 25:1). The subsequent unit most likely is a later addition to this earlier conclusion.

Chapter 27



Verse 1

<i>Appendix</i>
THE SANCTUARY: FUNDING, GIFTS, AND DUES (27:1–34)
This last of Leviticus specifies how to make various dedications to the sanctuary, how their value is determined, and whether they can be redeemed (that is, whether a monetary substitute is acceptable). These details supplement the laws about sacrifices with which the book began (Leviticus 1–7). [Monetary valuation may also be related to the redemption laws of Leviticus 25 in that, like “actuary tables,” they help estimate what redemption costs might entail. —<i>Ed.</i>]
Vows are essentially conditional promises to God, to be fulfilled if and when the requested conditions come to pass. According to biblical portrayals, one is most likely to utter a vow at a time of great distress, when direct appeal to God seems the only option left. A person often promises to dedicate or sacrifice an animal; but sometimes one offers service to the shrine, either by oneself or one’s child, such as in the case of Hannah (I Samuel 1:1–11), who promises God that if granted a son, she will dedicate his service to the sanctuary at Shiloh. The warrior Jephthah vows to sacrifice what comes from his house; it turns out to be his daughter (Judges 11:29–40; see at Numbers 30:10). As an act of individual piety or desperation, one could utter a vow anywhere; therefore, vows were a popular form of religious devotion, one in which women could participate freely. (See additional references to women making vows in Numbers 6:2, 30:4–17; Jeremiah 44:15–25; and Proverbs 31:2.)
VOTARY PLEDGES OF PEOPLE (27:1–8)
Leviticus 27 opens with instructions concerning the fulfillment of vows. There is evidence that at certain periods vows could be fulfilled at any sanctuary. In I Samuel 1–2, Hannah appeals to God at the sanctuary at Shiloh, and that is where she brings her son Samuel for the vowed service. However, at some point the priesthood set limitations regarding whose vows were binding, what one could promise, and where payment could be made. Often these regulations limited the ability of women to make and keep vows. According to Numbers 30:10, vows made by independent women, whether divorcées or widows, are binding. However, the vow of a woman who is under a male’s authority can be annulled by that father or husband upon first hearing of it (Numbers 30:4–9; see further at Numbers 30:2–17). The centralization of worship further limited the ability of women to partake fully in this form of religious devotion by restricting the payment of vows to a central location (Deuteronomy 12:5–6, 11, 17, and 26).
Leviticus 27 lists fixed monetary equivalents for pledges to the sanctuary according to age and gender. Noteworthy is the lower value assigned to females in each age group. Carol Meyers suggests that the Leviticus valuation may accurately reflect the relative potential for economic productivity of each gender at various stages of life (see below) and does not reflect a notion that men are inherently more valuable than women. A high mortality rate is also no doubt a factor. Carol Meyers reports that skeletal remains in some ancient tombs help to determine mortality rates among different age and gender groups in ancient Israel. These remains indicate that the death rate was highest among the pre-adult population. In one tomb group, for example, nearly half the population did not survive to the age of 18 (“The Roots of Restriction: Women in Early Israel,” 1978, p. 95).

Verse 2

<b><i>When anyone explicitly vows to יהוה</i></b>. The practice of vowing the value of a person to the sanctuary presumably has its roots in the earlier practice of dedicating people for lifelong service to the sanctuary (such as the vow made by Hannah in I Samuel 1:1–11). The monetary value in Leviticus 27 represents the amount of money that a vowed person’s service to the sanctuary would be worth. Thus, instead of using the services of the vowed person, the priests can use the money, presumably for the maintenance of the sanctuary. The option of dedicating materials to the sanctuary not only seeks to fill a vower’s personal need but also provides resources for maintaining the national sanctuary—including its personnel, especially priests (see also Numbers 6:2–21 and 30:3–15).

Verse 3

<b><i>If it is a male from twenty to sixty.</i></b> There is some biblical evidence that men, at least, were considered to be most productive between twenty to sixty years of age. The book of Numbers legislates military conscription at twenty (Numbers 1:3) and service in the Tabernacle to between twenty and fifty (4:3, 23).

Verse 4

<b><i>if it is a female.</i></b> The calculated 30 shekels for a woman in this category, when compared with 50 shekels for the male, places the woman’s relative economic worth in this age category at 38% of the total contribution of both genders. As Meyers notes, sociological studies show that when women contribute 40% to the economy’s productive labor, their status is at its highest. Their status diminishes if their contribution is higher (“Procreation, Production, and Protection: Male-Female Balance in Early Israel,” 1983, pp. 569–93, especially p. 575). See further Another View.

Verse 5

<b><i>If the age is from five years to twenty.</i></b> The relative valuation of females in comparison with males is lowest in the five to twenty age group (for the female, 33% of the total contribution of both genders). Meyers observes that this period coincides with peak childbearing years, when women, occupied with childbearing and childrearing, could not provide as much in the way of other economic productivity. In addition, the fact that many women died in childbirth would also explain a devaluation of women’s economic worth relative to men in this age group.

Verse 6

<b><i>If the age is from one month to five years.</i></b> A child could not be dedicated before it was one month old, most likely reflecting a high newborn mortality rate. This also accounts for the relatively low monetary value. Only at one month was a child considered viable and more likely to survive.

Verse 7

<b><i>If the age is sixty years or over.</i></b> The woman’s relative economic worth is highest in the over sixty category (40% of the total contribution of both genders), when male efficiency declines, while females are able to continue their domestic responsibilities with only a minimal decrease in productivity (“Procreation, Production, and Protection,” pp. 584–93).

Verse 8

<b><i>But if one cannot afford the equivalent.</i></b> This flexibility allows poor people who wish to make dedications of this kind to the sanctuary even if they cannot afford the listed amounts. The sacrificial system incorporates similar concessions to the poor (see 12:6–8).

Verse 9

VOTARY PLEDGES OF ANIMALS (27:9–13) The next section concerns two categories of animal offerings: those that are fit for sacrifice (vv. 9–10) and those that are not (vv. 11–13). Once a sacrificable animal is pledged, it must be brought in to fulfill the vow and cannot be replaced by another animal. However, a pledged animal that is unfit for sacrifice because it is ritually impure (see Leviticus 11 for a list of animals) is brought to the priest, who assigns it a value, for which the Tabernacle’s staff will sell it to raise money for the sanctuary. The owner can also choose to redeem the animal, for twenty percent more than the value assessed by the priest.
The ritually pure sacrificial animals that are vowed are eaten by the priests and their households (after certain parts are burned entirely as God’s portion). Leviticus 22:1–16 indicates who may partake of the priest’s portion of the sacred donations. Of special interest is the question of when a priest’s daughter is entitled to part of her father’s share. Verses 12–13 of that passage determine that she is entitled to partake of her father’s portion of the sacred donations so long as she is part of his household. If she marries a member of the priesthood, her entitlement then derives from her husband. If she marries outside the priesthood, she becomes part of the lay community and thus loses her entitlement to partake of the sacred donations. However, if she is then widowed or divorced without children, and thus has no claim to her husband’s estate, she can go back to her father’s household and regain her entitlement to partake of her father’s portion of the sacred donations.

Verse 14

CONSECRATIONS OF PROPERTY (27:14–25) This section treats three types of property pledges: dwellings (vv. 14–15), personal land holdings (vv. 16–20), and acquired land (vv. 22–25). Personal landholdings, that is, parcels of farmland, are assessed at a fixed rate according to how much seed it takes to plant them, which probably measures their size rather than how much the land has produced. The assessed value also depends on the timing of the jubilee (see 25:29–34), decreasing every year as the jubilee approaches. Several biblical texts mention women’s holding land, including Zelophehad’s daughters, Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah (see at Numbers 27:1–11 and 36:1–12); the wealthy woman from Shunem (II Kings 4:8–37 and 8:1–6); Achsah, whose father apparently gave her land as a dowry (Joshua 15:16–19 = Judges 1:12–15); and Naomi (Ruth 4:3–11), who is selling her dead husband’s land, which seems to indicate that under certain circumstances widows could inherit and sell their husband’s property. Presumably a female landholder could consecrate land to the sanctuary.
<b><i>consecrates.</i></b> The verbal root is <i>k-d-sh</i> (“holy” or “set apart”). Here the verb means dedicating something to God, thus making it holy.
<i><b>house.</b></i> This probably refers to urban dwellings, for houses located elsewhere are subject to being returned to their owner in the jubilee year (see 25:29–31).

Verse 26

FIRSTLINGS (27:26–27) The Torah’s legislation views all firstlings as automatically consecrated to God; their owners cannot dedicate them to the sanctuary, since they are already God’s property (see, for example, Exodus 13:2). Animals that are not fit for sacrifice can be redeemed by the owner. Otherwise, the sanctuary may sell them as a source of income.

Verse 27



Verse 28

PROSCRIPTIONS (27:28–29) While most references to <i>cherem</i> (proscription) in the Bible deal with the proscription of Israel’s enemies and their property at times of war (for example, Numbers 21:2–3), Leviticus 27 seems to be addressing cases within the Israelite community. Proscribed property becomes the permanent property of the sanctuary.
These verses seem to presume a distinction between two types of persons. Verse 28 treats non-Israelite slaves who are proscribed as part of an owner’s property and then become the permanent property of the sanctuary. Verse 29 applies to individuals whom some authorized communal body (probably a court) has proscribed, and who are thus under a death sentence.
<b><i>totally consecrated.</i></b> Heb. <i>kodesh kodashim.</i> Objects permanently dedicated to God have the status of most holy; they are immutably sacred.

Verse 29



Verse 30

TITHES (27:30–33) These laws about two categories of tithes, agricultural and livestock, diverge from other biblical sources on tithes (see, for example, Numbers 18:21–24). As such, this section may represent either a very old tradition or a radical attempt at reform.

Verse 31



Verse 32



Verse 33

 The tenth animal, whatever its condition, is designated for the tithe. It is unclear how in practice the status of tenth animal was to be assigned.

Verse 34

CONCLUSION (27:34) The final verse functions as a new conclusion to the book of Leviticus, complementing and completing the one in 26:46, which it closely resembles. Leviticus concludes by claiming that God gave these commandments to Moses on Mount Sinai. That is, even the material that seems to be appended has its origin in the original revelation and is essential to the covenant at Sinai.

Numbers



Chapter 1



Verse 1

<i>Names and Numbers</i>
THE ISRAELITES IN THE WILDERNESS (1:1–54)
B<i>’midbar</i> opens by setting the date of the census: <i>Rosh Chodesh Iyar,</i> the start of the second month of the second year since Israel departed from Egypt. Although the Israelites are more than a year deep in their journey, this date marks something of a new beginning since they are now in possession of laws as well as the Tabernacle. A central theme of the book of Numbers is transition; the census relates to this theme by depicting the transition of the tribes into a national body.
How are we to understand the litany of names that fill this parashah? The ordering of the camp is akin to the necessary preparations that precede any expedition or long trip, as departure requires taking stock of what one brings along. The dominant motivation of this census is to organize Israel into battalions in order to begin the march toward Canaan. As the Torah reminds us, other nations inhabit the Promised Land; so before Israel claims the destination as home, it will have to reconstitute itself as a nation of warriors.
But the census also represents a point reached in every community when the group takes stock of who stands in its ranks. This, then, is a moment of Israel’s self-assessment, where the generation previously numbered only as slaves in Egypt perceives itself as a unified nation. However, in an important sense, the opening of Numbers is utopian; as the rest of the book demonstrates, the generation that once knew slavery in Egypt proves incapable of remaking itself into a nation of warriors and reaching the Promised Land. Their fate instead will be to perish in the wilderness and find consolation in the fact that their children will achieve what they could not.
THE TRIBES (1:1–19)

Verse 2

<b><i>Take a census.</i></b> A census is a practical tool but also a mode of enforcing power. Who does the recording and who is recorded are not incidental issues; rather, the answers provide a form of centralizing authority and of creating a definitive hierarchy. The <i>Tanach</i> records several censuses and (in its characteristic way) includes examples that express ambivalence about this practice. While there is something rousing about the emergence of organized troops from the newly liberated and still somewhat beleaguered people of Israel, other occasions of census taking unleash chaos on the Israelites (II Samuel 24:1–10; I Chronicles 21:1–8; 27:23–24). There is thematic tension between the idea that Israel should be numberless (Genesis 15:5; I Kings 3:8) and the occasions of census taking.
<i><b>ancestral houses.</b></i> Heb. <i>beit avot.</i> The tribes are made up of clans comprised of families, and the family unit in turn includes a cluster of households. The “ancestral house” (extended family) is the core institution of the agricultural and tribal system of ancient Israel. This unit claims a specific tract of land as well as its yield and workers. The <i>beit avot</i> (also called <i>beit av,</i> as when Rachel and Leah speak in Genesis 31:14) is an extended-family structure made up of all the descendants of a living ancestor, whereas the larger clan and tribal units rally around the memory of a more distant patriarchal figure. When a female member of the <i>beit avot</i> marries, she generally departs from her <i>beit avot</i> and joins that of her husband. At no level in this parashah are women recorded, but the very notion of a family or a household as a basis of society demands recognition of female power and agency.
<i><b>every male.</b></i> The hierarchy at work becomes apparent as only men are counted as Israelites at this juncture, and as priests and Levites secure exemptions. The census regroups Israel along military lines, yet we note that all of the potential fighting men of Israel comprise less than half of the community, not the whole.

Verse 3

<b><i>groups…bear arms.</i></b> Heb. <i>tz’vaot</i>…<i>tzava.</i> These terms refer here to military roles fulfilled by men. However, the same root (<i>tz-v-a</i>) is used elsewhere to describe the women who served at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting (see at Exodus 38:8; I Samuel 2:22). In Isaiah 40:2 the same term, referring to conscript service, is ascribed to Jerusalem personified as a woman. When the prophet Deborah commands the Israelites to go to war, she appoints a man, Barak, to lead the troops. (Upon Barak’s insistence, however, Deborah accompanies him in battle; see Judges 4:1–10.)

Verse 4

<b><i>representative of each tribe.</i></b> At certain junctures in the wilderness, it becomes apparent that Israel comprises twelve tribes. Each tribe adheres to an internal order while participating in the larger community. Maintaining tribal boundaries with respect to land inheritance will later prompt one group to challenge the unqualified grant of land to the daughters of Zelophehad: Mahlah, Tirzah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Noah. See at 36:1–13.

Verse 5

<b><i>These are the names.</i></b> The list of tribal chieftains groups the tribes according to their ancestral mothers (Genesis 35:22–26). The Leah tribes appear first, followed by the Rachel tribes; the Bilhah and Zilpah tribes are then interspersed.

Verse 6



Verse 7

<b><i>Nahshon son of Amminadab.</i></b> The tribal representative from Judah is the nephew of Elisheba, wife to Aaron the chief priest and mother of the priests Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar (Exodus 6:23). The tribes of Judah and Levi were thus allied when a prominent woman of Judah married Aaron. This foreshadows the fact that the Temple will be built in the territory of Judah. The book of Ruth also enumerates Nahshon in its genealogy (Ruth 4:20).

Verse 17



Verse 18

 <i><b>they convoked the whole company</b></i> [<i><b>of fighters</b></i>]. Following the census, those listed in the ranks gather under the banner or “standard” of their tribes and stand proud as the army of Israel. The army that here appears well poised for battle will not prove psychologically ready, so invasion is postponed for a generation (see Deuteronomy 2:14–16). The representation of the people Israel as an army renders women invisible.
<i><b>who were registered.</b></i> [The Hebrew word that is uniquely translated here as “registered” is a form of the verbal root <i>y-l-d,</i> which elsewhere means “to give birth.” The self-reflexive nature of the verb here almost suggests that this army gave birth to itself. <b>—</b><i>Ed.</i>]

Verse 19

 <b><i>As</i></b> יהוה <i><b>had commanded Moses, so he recorded them in the wilderness of Sinai.</b></i> This summation of the command closes this section, which began, “God spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai” (1:1). Divine speech frames this section and legitimizes the subsequent census by marking it as a reflection of divine will. This emphasis is important in light of God’s reported opposition elsewhere to taking a census (see, for example, II Samuel 24:1–10, where God punishes Israel for King David’s decision to take a census).

Verse 20

THE CENSUS (1:20–46) In military formation, the twelve tribes of Israel are Reuben, Simon, Gad, Judah, Issachar, Zebulun, Ephraim, Manasseh, Benjamin, Dan, Asher, and Naphtali. (The tribe of Levi is counted separately; see below at 1:47–54.) Rachel’s son Joseph is represented in terms of his and Asenath’s two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh. According to this parashah, the men of Israel over twenty years of age number 603,550; but the sum is more impressive when one thinks of more than double the number of women and children. Exodus 12:37 counts the number of men who leave Egypt as roughly six hundred thousand. Jacob Milgrom suggests that the tribal numbers may symbolize astronomical calculations intended to present Israel as God’s battalions (Exodus 7:4; 12:41) corresponding to the astral bodies metaphorically understood as God’s celestial troops <i>(Numbers</i>, 1990, p. 338).

THE LEVITES (1:47–54) The book of Numbers divides the men of the tribe of Levi into subordinate Levites and superior priests (the latter being of direct descent from Aaron). The Levites were not listed among the other tribes previously counted since they are exempt from military service. The Levites will not inherit territory in the land, claiming their patrimony instead in the sphere of Tabernacle service (see Numbers 3–4 and 8). Although Levites will not face the dangers of war, they must contend with the dangers of the holy, for if they do not maintain optimal holiness, they risk being destroyed by proximity to the Divine.

Verse 48



Verse 49



Verse 50

<b><i>the Levites in charge of the Tabernacle.</i></b> Levites set up the portable shrine, maintain its various components, dismantle it when it is time for Israel to journey forward, and carry it to the next encampment. After they set up the Tabernacle at a certain place, the Levites camp around it, in order to buffer divine power.
<i><b>Tabernacle.</b></i> See at Exodus 25:9.
<i><b>Pact.</b></i> See at Exodus 25:16.

Verse 51

<b><i>any outsider who encroaches shall be put to death.</i></b> This severe prohibition aims to maintain boundaries. The Levites buffer and protect the Tabernacle from outside encroachment. The severe penalty of death is meant less as an assurance of inevitable violence and more as a means of maintaining the definitive boundaries between the holy and the profane, as well as between Levites and Israelites. An analogue is at work between the Israelite body and the Tabernacle. As the body undergoes purification rituals when interior fluids seep out, so the priests sanctify the Tabernacle interiors. As the body must be protected from foreign organisms, so the Levites shield the Tabernacle margins.

Verse 52

<b><i>each man with his division.</i></b> [The translator notes: Or “each [household] with its division.” (Similarly in 2:2, 34.) —<i>Ed.</i>] <i><b>standard.</b></i> Heb. <i>degel.</i> This military term can be translated as “banner.” We know that in the ancient Jewish colony at Elephantine, Egypt, <i>degel</i> designated a military unit. So the term means not only a standard but also the force that marches beneath the standard. (In modern Hebrew it refers to a flag.) The twelve tribes will be organized under four such standards or banners.

Verse 53

<b><i>around the Tabernacle.</i></b> This literary unit ends with an image of the Tabernacle encircled by the Levites, who are surrounded by a perimeter of Israelite tribes unified under their banners.

Chapter 2



Verse 1

<i>The Geometry of the Holy</i> (2:1–34)
The sacred structure houses a Tent of Meeting or Tabernacle (the terms appear to be used interchangeably in this parashah) at its center. Priests sacrifice in the court and offer incense inside as a way of communicating with God. Four groups of Levites surround the Tent, one group on each side, with Moses and Aaron’s family in the most privileged position (see below). The tribes of Israel appear around the Levites’ camp in four groups, each composed of three tribes united under a single standard or division. When Israel marches through the wilderness, the eastern (Judah) and southern (Reuben) divisions lead, followed by the Levites transporting the Tabernacle and backed up by the western (Ephraim) and northern (Dan) divisions.
It is most likely that such a configuration never actually existed in the historical past. Instead, the Tabernacle is the mythic structure behind Israelite—and later, Jewish—sacred space. According to the book of Kings, it is this structure—with concentric spheres of increasing holiness—that King Solomon employs when building the Temple in Jerusalem. The synagogue, which after the Temple’s destruction (70 <small>C.E.</small>) would stand at the center of Jewish life, realizes this myth by placing the Ark that holds the Torah in a prominent place in the sanctuary. The biblical Ark of the Torah signifies the Ark of the Covenant, and the shared contents bind contemporary Jews to their ancient ancestors. (For more on the Tabernacle, see the introduction to <i>T’rumah,</i>; and <i>Vayak’heil,</i> Another View.)
THE EAST (2:1–9)
The notion that the cardinal directions provide orientation assumes a double meaning here. Not only do the directions augment a geographic sensibility, but they also determine the marching order of the Israelite tribes.
The Judah tribe leads the eastern division, which includes Issachar and Zebulun, all offspring of Leah.

Verse 2

<b><i>camp around the Tent of Meeting at a distance.</i></b> The God who spoke to the Israelites from atop Mount Sinai now dwells in their midst and travels with them. The distance between the divine dwelling and the rest of Israel’s camp is determined and mediated by the Levites and priests.
<i><b>Tent of Meeting.</b></i> See at Exodus 27:21.

Verse 3

<b><i>Camped on the…east side.</i></b> The east side is favored. The Tabernacle’s entrance is located on this side. This is where Aaron and the Judah tribes are positioned.

Verse 4



Verse 5



Verse 6



Verse 7



Verse 8



Verse 9

<b><i>These shall march first.</i></b> When the camp marches forward, the tribes who hold the position of the rising sun (the east) move first. The configuration of the camp has both ritual and military implications. During periods of encampment, the band of tribes surrounding the Tabernacle serves as a line of defense protecting the sanctuary; and during the march, the infantry tribes are reinforced by God’s presence hovering over the sacred items of the Tent.

Verse 10

THE SOUTH (2:10–16) The Reuben tribe leads the southern division, which includes two Leah tribes, Reuben and Simeon, and one Zilpah tribe, Gad. In the formation, the tribes that predominate are the descendants of the less-loved sister, Leah, whose sons were not as beloved by Jacob as Rachel’s. (See also Another View.)

Verse 17

THE CENTER (2:17) When the people of Israel travel, the levitical Merari and Gershon clans carry the Tent of Meeting. They buffer the privileged Kohath clan that transports the sanctuary furnishings. The sacred center is maintained in transit and well as in encampment.

Verse 18

THE WEST (2:18–24) The western, or “seaward” (<i>yamah</i>), tribes include Benjamin, Ephraim, and Manasseh. All three are Rachel tribes, as Ephraim and Manasseh are the two tribal divisions stemming from Joseph and his Egyptian wife, Asenath. The tribes descended from Rachel are stationed farthest from the Tabernacle entrance, perhaps referencing Rachel’s untimely death outside the entrance of the town of Ephrath (Genesis 35:16).

CONCLUSION (2:32–34) The concluding summary reports that Israel carries out God’s instructions, maintaining this tribal order and sacred geometry when they camp and when they march.

Chapter 3



Verse 1

<i>The Levites</i> (3:1–4:20)
The tribe of the Levites, to which both Moses and Aaron belong, was barely mentioned in Leviticus, which focuses on the priests. In Numbers, however, the Levites receive privileges that set them apart from other tribes. This step enlarges the structure of those who officiate at the Tabernacle. This broader circle of official personnel does not seem to include women. On women and Israel’s priesthood, see <i>T’tzaveh,</i> Another View.
The tribe of Levi is favored in this parashah. For example, the priests and Levites who camp around the Tabernacle are also elected to maintain it. In addition, the Levites stand in for Israel’s first-born sons, who belong to God as an eternal ransom for the first-born sons who were not killed during the tenth plague on Egypt (see vv. 12–13). Such features suggest that it was priests who edited or authored the first part of the book of Numbers.
THE ELECTION OF THE PRIESTS (3:1–10)
In this section, the text’s composers—presumably Aaron’s descendants—give first priority to the authority of the priests. However, they are not apologists. Their honored ancestor, Aaron, is recorded later in Numbers as transgressing (20:1–13) and dies far from the Promised Land (20:22–29).
<b><i>This is the line of Aaron and Moses.</i></b> The priestly writers are invested in a kind of deterministic genealogy. In other words, they see social position as arising from one’s station at birth. Such a hereditary principle supports the idea of priestly distinction. Although they are brothers, only Aaron, not Moses, transmits the priesthood. Aaron’s sons become the religious elite.

Verse 2

<b><i>These were the names of Aaron’s sons.</i></b> The book of Numbers distinguishes Aaron’s family as the only legitimate priests among the tribe of Levi.

Verse 3

<b><i>anointed.</i></b> As a standard of hygiene and often as a form of luxury, people in the ancient Near East—including women—used to anoint themselves and their children with oil (I Samuel 14:2; Ezekiel 16:9; Ruth 3:3). But here the Hebrew uses a special verb that, when applied to persons, refers to pouring oil on the head in order to signal the assumption of an office, usually the kingship or the priesthood. That verbal root (<i>m-sh-ch</i>) also forms the noun <i>mashiach,</i> which later becomes the title “Messiah.” (See also at Exodus 27:20 and 29:7.)

Verse 4

<b><i>Nadab and Abihu.</i></b> These two sons of Aaron and Elisheba (Exodus 6:23) were instantly annihilated when they encroached upon the Holy with the wrong sort of offering (see at Leviticus 10:1–2). Since they had no sons, no trace of them remains except in their substitution by their younger brothers Eleazar and Ithamar.

Verse 5



Verse 6

<b><i>the tribe of Levi…Aaron the priest.</i></b> Just as the Levites have a distinct position within Israel, so the <i>kohanim</i> (priests) of the family of Aaron have a preferred position within the tribe of Levi. This social configuration parallels that of the Tabernacle by recognizing a particularly holy family within a holy tribe that is within a holy people.

Verse 7

<b><i>before the Tent of Meeting.</i></b> The priestly hierarchy is realized in the system of access to the various interiors of the Tent of Meeting. As the priests perform their sacred duties inside it, the Levites stand watch around the perimeter; all other members of Israel may approach the Divine at the threshold at specified times when they are in the correct state of purity. The priests supervise Israel’s access to the Tent of Meeting.

Verse 8



Verse 9



Verse 10

<b><i>any outsider who encroaches shall be put to death.</i></b> The border lines of the holy are not to be breached; the severe penalty associates these borders with the boundary that separates life and death.

Verse 11

THE ELECTION OF THE LEVITES (3:11–22) The Levites replace first-born Israelites who would otherwise belong to God (according to Exodus 13:12–13). The male members of the tribe of Levi now function as a hereditary caste of personnel dedicated to God’s service but serving under the priests.

Verse 12

<b><i>the first issue of the womb.</i></b> This verse defines who exactly counts as first-born for the purpose of this legislation. The definition refers specifically to a woman’s first-born (not a man’s first-born). By speaking of the womb rather than the woman, the fertile womb is disassociated from the mother. The image is of a womb magically yielding offspring in the absence of female reproductive agency. (See also at Exodus 13:2.)

Verse 13

<b><i>For every male first-born is Mine.</i></b> This verse explains that all first-born males belong to God as an eternal ransom for the sparing of Israel’s first-born males at the tenth plague (Exodus 11:1–10; 12:29–36). According to this passage, God is willing to accept the substitution of the Levites for all of Israel’s first-born males. The status of the first-born male is unstable in the <i>Tanach</i>; although first-born sons have the right of predominant inheritance, they are constantly being supplanted (see Jacob’s supplanting of Esau in Genesis 25–27).

Verse 14



Verse 15

<b><i>from the age of one month up.</i></b> A Levite is recognized after one month of life. However, scholars dispute at what age a Levite is to actually begin his service.

Verse 23

THE ORGANIZATION OF THE LEVITES (3:23–39) As the outer ring of the encampment follows a hierarchy, so does the inner ring of levitical families.
<b><i>The clans of the Gershonites.</i></b> The Gershon clan represents the first-born of Levi, who was the third son of Jacob.

Verse 24



Verse 25

<b><i>, 26.</i></b> The Gershonites not only guard the western side of the Tabernacle but also transport its curtains, fabrics, and screens. In other words, the Gershonites carry and set up the flexible boundaries that define the sacred space. Numbers 4:21–49 delineates their duties more fully.

Verse 26



Verse 27



Verse 28



Verse 29

 The Kohath clan carries the most holy objects on the journey—including the Ark, the table, the menorah, the altars, and the sacred utensils. They set up their own camp on the south side. The Kohath clan represents the second-born of Levi. According to Exodus 6:17–21 and Numbers 3:19, this clan includes Aaron and Moses, who are Kohath’s grandsons.

Verse 30



Verse 31



Verse 32



Verse 33

<b><i>33–37.</i></b> The Merari clan carries the structure of the Tabernacle, including bars, posts, sockets, and planks. While they carry the tent poles, their cousins—the Gershonites—carry the coverings. The Merari clan represents the third son of Levi.

Verse 34



Verse 35



Verse 36



Verse 37



Verse 38

<b><i>before the Tent of Meeting, on the east.</i></b> While all sides of the Tabernacle are recognized as holy, nothing tops the elite east—opposite the Tabernacle entrance where Moses, Aaron, and Aaron’s offspring dwell. The administration of the Tabernacle as well as the entire camp is in their hands, and anyone who approaches without invitation can be put to death. Prohibition as well as position maintain the status of the Aaronide family. We are left to wonder about the role of women on the east, as well as on the other sides of the Tabernacle complex.

Verse 39



Verse 40

THE PRICE OF REDEMPTION (3:40–51) In this parashah, the title of “first-born” applies to a woman’s first-born male alone. Genesis 29–30 provides glimpses of how an Israelite mother celebrated his birth—and that of her other children as well. There, mothers Leah and Rachel named their children in ways that reflected their experiences of fertility, conception, pregnancy, and birth. One wonders whether women had specific rituals to celebrate the birth of a first child, and also about what roles levitical mothers played in rearing and raising the clerical class.

Verse 48

<b><i>give the money to Aaron and his sons as the redemption price.</i></b> The practice of redemption in this section grants special benefits to the priests who receive money. It also exempts Israelites from special service at the sanctuary. This exchange confers 1,365 shekels on Aaron and his sons. On redemption, see also at Exodus 13:15.

Chapter 4



Verse 1

THE SERVICE OF THE LEVITES (4:1–20) This section describes the work of the Levites as caretakers of the Tabernacle—“housekeepers,” as it were—in contrast to the priests, who officiate and conduct the sacrifices (see also <i>Vayikra,</i> Contemporary Reflection).

Verse 2

<b><i>Kohathites.</i></b> When the people of Israel travel, the Kohath clan is to carry the sacred Ark. In addition, they are to transport the table on which the bread of display is laid, the menorah, the lamps and oils for Tabernacle lighting, and the altar (see Exodus 25:10–40 for descriptions of these objects). Because Aaron and his sons wrap each instrument of worship in blue or purple cloths and skins, the Kohathites never touch them. Should a Kohathite come into direct contact with any of the items, then he is to be killed (v. 15, below).

Verse 3



Verse 4

<b><i>the most sacred objects.</i></b> Heb. <i>kodesh hakodashim</i> usually designates either the innermost room of the Tabernacle or the status of certain sacrificial offerings, but in this section the term refers to the objects inside the Tent.

Verse 5

<b><i>cover the Ark of the Pact.</i></b> Only Aaronite hands ever touch the Ark when they wrap it for transport, and no one ever looks at it.

Verse 6



Verse 7

<b><i>7–8. cloth.</i></b> On women as spinners and weavers of the Tabernacle’s furnishing, see at Exodus 35:25–26; <i>T’rumah,</i> Another View; and <i>P’kudei,</i> Another View.

 The Tent of Meeting retains its sanctity even when dismantled, and therefore it endangers all but Aaron and his descendants. As each Tabernacle piece remains part of the whole even when wrapped in its own cover, so are Kohathites and priests part of the tribe of Levi even when distinguished by individual roles. The boundaries of the holy reverberate on every level.
<i>—Rachel Havrelock</i>  

Verse 21

<i>Cultic Administration</i>
CENSUS OF THE LEVITES (4:21–49)
According to Numbers 1:48–49, the tribe of Levi is subject to a census separate from the greater Israelite community. Although the Torah does not provide a clear reason for this, one explanation is that the men of this tribe are exempt from regular military service and assigned to protect the Tabernacle. The Torah records two levitical censuses: one counts males older than one month (3:15), and the other counts men aged 30 to 50, presumably, the work force (see 4:1–3). The Torah does not explain why Levites could not begin service before the age of 30 nor work past 50. The mandated retirement age makes sense given the physical demands.

Verse 22

<b><i>Gershonites.</i></b> Gershon was Levi’s eldest son (Exodus 6:16). His descendants comprise one of the three levitical clans who care for the Tabernacle and its associated sacred objects (Numbers 18).

Verse 23

<b><i>from the age of thirty years up to the age of fifty.</i></b> This census is concerned only with those eligible for the work force. The starting age for a Levite’s service is given as 30 years (Numbers 4:3, 23, and 30), and as 25 years (Numbers 8:23–24).

Verse 24

Verse 26



Verse 27

<b><i>on orders from Aaron and his sons.</i></b> That is, Levites are subordinate to priests—the direct de harmonious relationship between Levites and priests, tension is evident in the story of Korah (Numbers 16). Deuteronomy 18:1–8 portrays the status of the Levites as more on a par with that of the priests.

Chapter 5



Verse 1

<i>Maintaining Community Sanctity by Countering Threats of Impurity</i> (5:1–31)
No matter how well organized the Tabernacle and surrounding camp may be, the community remains vulnerable to physical and spiritual impurities. In Leviticus and Numbers, women often figure prominently in discussions of impurity. Therefore, it is no surprise that women are mentioned in each of the cases described in Numbers 5. Although the situations appear unrelated, they all reflect a concern for communal purity.
PROCEDURE FOR THE PHYSICALLY IMPURE (5:1–4)
The first threat addressed is that of accidental impurity: individuals who are blameless—perhaps even passive—recipients of physical impurity resulting from disease, or from contact with the dead. Such individuals must be expelled physically before their impurity penetrates and thus defiles the sacred camp; and they must remain outside the camp until purification takes place.

Verse 2

<b><i>eruption.</i></b> This refers to the ailment detailed in Leviticus 13–14. It is translated there as “scaly affection” and as “leprosy” (to convey the horror attached to the condition in question), but the actual disease remains unknown.
<i><b>discharge.</b></i> This refers to an abnormal genital discharge, not a typical menstrual flow. The laws relating to this condition are found in Leviticus 15, though that passage does not mandate expulsion from the camp. Note that neither the impurity resulting from menstruation (Leviticus 15:19–24) nor from giving birth (Leviticus 12) is mentioned here. The absence of these more common impurities emphasizes the unexpected and irregular nature of the conditions that the text does mention.
<i><b>anyone defiled by a corpse.</b></i> Numbers 19 details the purification ritual for someone who comes in contact with a dead body.

Verse 3

<b><i>male and female alike.</i></b> Heb. <i>mi-zachar ad n’kevah.</i> Everyone is subject to these temporary impurities. What is the difference between this expression and the expression <i>ish o ishah</i> (“men or women,” literally “man or woman”) in Numbers 5:6 and 6:2? The first expression is applied to animals more often (Genesis 6:19; 7:3, 9, 16; Leviticus 3:1) and seems to identify sexuality as opposed to gender. The primordial humans were created as “male and female” (biological categories) in the image of God in Genesis 1:27, but become gendered as “man and woman” (social categories) in the Garden of Eden in Genesis 2:23–24.
<i><b>in whose midst I dwell.</b></i> This rationale for the expulsion of these individuals from the camp makes it clear that the goal of removing the infected individuals is to protect the sanctity of the Israelite camp and maintain the divine Presence there.

Verse 4



Verse 5

PROCEDURE FOR A PERSON WHO BETRAYS ANOTHER (5:5–10) The crime of betrayal that here is called <i>maal</i> is illuminated by Leviticus 5:14–16 and 5:20–26, where the term <i>maal</i> refers to the inadvertent and intentional misappropriation of property. According to Leviticus, the penalty for this crime is a form of economic restitution.

Verse 6

<b><i>When men or women.</i></b> Having moved away from the clinical language used in the preceding section to describe impure bodies, the inclusive phrase “male and female” becomes “men or women” (see at v. 3). The specific mention of “women” presumes that women could commit this type of crime, and some probably did.
<i><b>breaking faith.</b></i> Heb. <i>maal,</i> which has both the technical or legal meaning of misappropriation of property as well as a broader idiomatic meaning of betrayal. The next section in this parashah will apply the idiomatic meaning of <i>maal</i> to a faithless wife. This use of the identical term for crimes against both God and other people (5:6) indicates that both varieties of <i>maal</i> may have been considered acts of betrayal against God.

Verse 7

<b><i>they shall confess.</i></b> Unlike the Leviticus passages describing <i>maal</i> (Leviticus 5:14–16, 20–26), this verse demands that the guilty party confess before making restitution. As in the case of the <i>sotah</i> (5:22), <i>maal</i> (“breaking faith”) requires a potent ritual including a verbal expression and a physical action.

Verse 8

Verse 10



Verse 11

PROCEDURE FOR A WIFE ACCUSED OF ADULTERY (5:11–31) One of the most enigmatic passages in the Torah, this description of the ritual inflicted upon a suspected wayward wife (whom rabbinic literature refers to as a <i>sotah;</i> see at v. 12) has elicited a wide range of reactions. It has inspired enormous efforts at interpretation extending from rabbinic to contemporary times. Some readers consider the ritual to be unforgivably misogynistic, demonstrating the vulnerability of women and the privileged position of men in Israelite society. Others believe this ritual works to protect accused women.
The ritual of the <i>sotah</i> is unique in the <i>Tanach.</i> Perhaps the closest analogue is the ritual used in response to an unsolved murder (Deuteronomy 21:1–9). Both rituals are to be performed when the community faces the possibility of a capital crime without the necessary evidence to determine innocence or guilt. The <i>sotah</i> ritual may be a biblical example of a “trial by ordeal.” Used throughout the ancient Near East, such trials helped to decide cases in which witnesses were conflicted or lacking. The Laws of Hammurabi (see ¶ 132) provide a relevant example in which a woman is accused of adultery without evidence and must undergo a trial by ordeal in a river to determine her fate. The <i>sotah</i> ritual is likewise administered to a woman accused by her husband of adultery (5:13–15).
If found innocent, the vindicated woman will remain fertile. If guilty, her body will swell grotesquely; and she will presumably be rendered infertile (5:19–22). [Note that there is no mention of, or procedure for, the man who is a necessary suspect along with the woman; he is never formally confronted or tested. —<i>Ed.</i>] In biblical law, the crime of adultery warranted death (Leviticus 20:10; Deuteronomy 22:22). Therefore this ritual, which does not result in death even of the guilty woman, may reflect a more compassionate form of punishment. The question “Whom does the ritual protect, the suspicious husband or the accused wife?” receives no easy answer. Because of linguistic difficulties that riddle this passage, an accurate understanding of the details of the ritual and the motivation behind them may forever elude readers. Yet the ambiguity of the passage, if not intentional, is a gift for interpreters who value indeterminate meaning in a text. Particularly for feminist readers, the ritual of the <i>sotah</i> reflects the ambiguity of women’s roles in the Bible and the vulnerability of women within ancient Israelite society.

Verse 12

<b><i>gone astray.</i></b> Heb. <i>tisteh.</i> The verbal root <i>s-t-h</i> appears four times in this passage (5:12, 19, 20, 29), but only twice more in the rest of the <i>Tanach,</i> when Proverbs 4:15 and 7:25 warn young men to remain righteous and resist the seductions of dangerous women. In both Numbers and Proverbs, the verb connotes illicit sex. Yet it is interesting to note that the more explicit term used for adultery, <i>naaf,</i> is missing in this passage. Perhaps the vagueness of the accusation due to the lack of concrete evidence explains the use of a less exacting, more suggestive term for the alleged crime. (From this verbal root the Rabbis derived their term for the woman in question, <i>sotah</i>.)
<i><b>broken faith.</b></i> Heb. <i>maal.</i> The repetition of this word links the <i>sotah</i> with the preceding passage (see at v. 6).
One might imagine that the Torah would say that a man who has sexual relations with a married woman has, in effect, taken what belongs to another man. In this passage, however, it is the woman, and not her lover, who is accused of the crime of <i>maal,</i> misappropriation of property. Certainly, an act of adultery would be an act of betrayal. Yet the use of this term may also carry its legal meaning and suggest that the errant wife has taken something belonging to her husband—perhaps his honor, her fidelity, or the exclusive right to her sexuality.

Verse 13

<b><i>a man has had carnal relations with her.</i></b> When referring to sexual intercourse, the subject switches from the wife to the adulterous man; grammatically, the woman thus assumes a passive position. On this idiom, see at Exodus 19:15.
<i><b>she keeps secret.</b></i> The accused woman again becomes the subject of the verse. Her silence perpetuates his ignorance of the crime.
<i><b>she has defiled herself.</b></i> The mention of her defilement reflects one of the central concerns of this parashah: the purity of the camp depends on the purity of its members. A woman’s self-defilement suggests ethical, not ritual defilement. It was not the semen that rendered her impure, but rather her unethical betrayal of her husband.
<i><b>without being forced.</b></i> There are two possible readings of this phrase. One interpretation is that the phrase refers to the woman’s sexual consent, meaning that she was not raped (see how this verb is used in Deuteronomy 22:28). Another reading understands the verb <i>tapas</i> as meaning “caught,” which would indicate that she escaped detection.
<i><b>there is no witness against her.</b></i> The lack of a witness is what necessitates the ritual. According to Deuteronomy 22:22, if there is a witness, the court is to execute the woman and her lover.

Verse 14

<b><i>fit of jealousy.</i></b> The husband’s suspicions trigger the ordeal, in order to determine whether the woman is guilty or not. Perhaps the <i>sotah</i> trial serves mainly to allay the husband’s jealousy, in which case he, not she, is the true focus of this ritual, as some scholars suggest. Proverbs 6:34–35 describes a husband’s jealousy, <i>kinah,</i> as a powerful and violent force.
<i><b>although she has not defiled herself.</b></i> The text does not assume that the woman is guilty. The stated possibility that the woman is innocent supports the interpretation that the ritual works to protect her from her husband’s unfounded jealousy and restore some semblance of emotional stability to the household.

Verse 15

<b><i>the husband shall bring his wife to the priest.</i></b> From this point on, the narration of the ritual depicts the woman as a passive participant. The husband brings her and her “meal offering of jealousy” (v. 15) to the priest. The priest loosens her hair (v. 18) and offers her a liquid that enters her body and apparently affects her fertility (v. 22).

Verse 16

<b><i>before יהוה.</i></b> The ritual must take place in front of the Tabernacle, the place where adjudication usually takes place (see 12:5). The public location adds to the woman’s humiliation.

Verse 17



Verse 18

<b><i>the priest shall bare the wife’s head.</i></b> Baring her head further humiliates the woman. The <i>sotah’</i>s bare head links this passage with the subsequent section describing the <i>nazir</i> (see at 6:1–21).
<i><b>the water of bitterness.</b></i> Heb. <i>met ha-marim.</i> The precise meaning of this expression eludes translators, who contend that a little earth does not make water bitter. Alternative translations based on different or cognate roots are “water of blessing,” “water of contention,” and “water of revelation.” Tikva Frymer-Kensky translates the phrase in vv. 18, 19, and 24, as “the ‘spell-effecting revelation waters,’ indicating that the ‘spell-effecting waters’ would enter the woman to effect the revelation of guilt or innocence” (“The Strange Case of the Suspected Sotah: Numbers V 11–31” in A. Bach, ed., <i>Women in the Hebrew Bible: A Reader,</i> 1999, p. 472). The potion mixes sanctified water and earth from the Tabernacle floor inside a clay vessel (5:17). The symbolism of combining holy water with holy earth is clear: the possibly impure woman ingests a pure and holy liquid to see if her body rejects it. Yet the potion’s purported physical impact on the body remains unclear.

Verse 19

<b><i>The priest shall adjure the wife.</i></b> The priest presents two possible outcomes, indicating that the woman is presumed neither innocent nor guilty.
<i><b>be immune.</b></i> This verb, literally “be cleansed,” appears elsewhere as a legal term for innocence (Exodus 21:19; 23:7).

Verse 20



Verse 21



Verse 22

<b><i>causing the belly to distend and the thigh to sag.</i></b> Although the exact nature of the potential affliction remains unclear, the damage appears to relate to the woman’s fertility. Most likely the thigh, used frequently as a euphemism for male genitalia (Genesis 24:2, 9; 46:26; Exodus 1:5), is here a euphemism for female genitalia. Since an innocent woman will be able to conceive (5:28), the implied contrast suggests that a guilty woman will be rendered infertile. There is no reason to restrict this ritual to cases where the guilty woman is already pregnant and promptly miscarries. (For a different interpretation, see Another View.) Identifying an apt illness seems beside the point; what matters more is recognizing that the ritual targets the woman’s reproductive system—the part of her that belongs to her husband, nurtures his heirs, and secures her value within her community.
<b><i>“Amen, amen!”</i></b> When the woman finally speaks, her simple acceptance of the oath contrasts with the passage’s repetitiousness and the priest’s verbosity. Though her verbal consenting to the oath is formulaic (see Deuteronomy 27:15–26), her voice momentarily draws attention to herself as a flesh-and-blood human being who is suffering an ordeal.

Verse 23

<b><i>rub it off into the water of bitterness.</i></b> After the priest dissolves the writing in the “bitter” waters, the <i>sotah</i> must ingest the oath to release its magic potency within her body (compare Jeremiah 51:59–64).

Verse 24

<b><i>He is to make the wife drink.</i></b> As the verbs in this passage demonstrate, the priest is the central actor in the ritual.

Verse 25



Verse 26



Verse 27



Verse 28

<b><i>able to retain seed.</i></b> This expression refers to her ability to conceive.

Verse 29



Verse 30



Verse 31

<b><i>The husband shall be clear of guilt.</i></b> If the husband’s accusations prove false, he suffers no punishment. Yet the lack of repercussions for the wrongly suspicious husband also may protect his wife by convincing him to initiate the ritual. Assuming the “bitter” waters are humiliating but harmless, it may be better for the wife to undergo the trial than to live with a jealous husband.
<i><b>but that wife shall suffer for her guilt.</b></i> If the woman is guilty, she is not executed, as an adulteress would be. Without a witness to the crime, the woman cannot be put to death. The expression “suffer for her guilt” indicates that God, not the court, determines the punishment (Leviticus 5:1, 17; 20:17; Numbers 9:13).

Chapter 6



Verse 1

<i>Maintaining Community Sanctity through Religious Leaders</i> (6:1–27)
Moving beyond concerns with threats to the sanctity of the Israelite community, the parashah now focuses upon individuals who enhance and maintain that sanctity. Strikingly, women are included among those individuals. By dedicating themselves as nazirites, women are able to contribute to the holiness of Israel.
LAWS OF THE NAZIR (6:1–21)
With the introduction of the <i>nazir,</i> an individual who dedicates herself or himself to God, the parashah shifts its focus from a problematic woman to a respectable, if not honored, woman or man. Yet, the shared mention of bare or untrimmed hair (5:18, 6:5) suggests an implicit relationship between the <i>sotah</i> and the <i>nazir.</i> Both are marginal, set apart from the community-at-large. However, while the <i>nazir</i> chooses to distinguish herself or himself, the <i>sotah</i> is at the mercy of her husband. Placed together, these figures represent a typology, albeit extreme, of women within Israelite society that issues a message. A disciplined woman who controls her wildness and dedicates herself (and her wildness) to God may become a <i>n’zirah</i> (the specifically feminine form of <i>nazir).</i> One who does not discipline her wildness may become a <i>sotah.</i>
The Bible distinguishes between the life-long <i>nazir,</i> such as Samson (Judges 13–16) and Samuel (I Samuel 1), and the temporary <i>nazir</i> of this passage. Because the laws of the <i>nazir</i> pertain to prohibitions, they reveal little about whether or how the <i>nazir</i> functioned within the community. Although nazirites behaved similarly to priests in certain ways, there is no indication that they served alongside them in the sanctuary. Still, the existence of female nazirites illustrates that women, like men, could and did dedicate themselves to God.

Verse 2

<b><i>If any men or women explicitly utter a nazirite’s vow.</i></b> The word <i>nazir</i> comes from the root <i>n-z-r,</i> meaning to “dedicate” or “to set aside,” and may be related to the root <i>n-d-r,</i> meaning “vow.” Women can make binding vows; according to Numbers 30, either their fathers or their husbands can annul them, but only upon first hearing of them (30:4–16). Thus, a married woman or a daughter in her father’s house—unlike a widow or a divorcée living on her own—depends on the consent of a man in order to become a <i>nazir.</i> The two biblical nazirites, Samuel and Samson, are designated as nazirites by their mothers. During her pregnancy, Samson’s unnamed mother follows the prohibitions for the <i>nazir</i> in Numbers and effectively becomes a temporary nazirite herself (Judges 13:3–5, 13–14).

Verse 3

 All intoxicants and grape products are forbidden to the <i>nazir.</i> This prohibition resembles a less severe version imposed on priests, who are forbidden intoxicants when they enter the sanctuary (Leviticus 10:9; Ezekiel 44:21), but otherwise are allowed to drink (Isaiah 28:7).

Verse 4



Verse 5

 Untrimmed hair is the defining physical characteristic of the <i>nazir</i> and reflects the vitality of an individual dedicated to God. In ancient cultures, hair—which grows throughout life and appears to grow even in death—represented vitality and was often offered as a gift to one’s deity. In the Bible, hair also reflects a character’s strength. A haircut renders mighty Samson impotent (Judges 16:17); the hair of a captive woman must be shaved at first as a sign of mourning (Deuteronomy 21:12).

Verse 6



Verse 7

 The <i>nazir</i> is forbidden to bury even immediate family members; in this respect a nazirite is like only the chief priest (compare Leviticus 21:1–4, 11). Contact with a corpse contaminates anyone temporarily (Numbers 5:2; 19:11), but such contact in addition disrupts the status of <i>nazir</i> (below, vv. 9–12), just as it can ruin a priest’s ability to function. (Note that the list of deceased family members does not mention a spouse. Regarding spousal death, see the analogous case of a priest at Leviticus 21:1–4.)

Verse 8

<b><i>they are consecrated to יהוה.</i></b> Priests are also described as “consecrated to יהוה” (Leviticus 21:7).

Verse 9

<b><i>shall shave the head.</i></b> If the <i>nazir</i> becomes contaminated by unexpected exposure to a corpse, she or he must first observe the rite of purification (Numbers 19) before shaving the hair. The requirement to shave after purification suggests that hair cannot be purified and so it must be removed.

Verse 10



Verse 11



Verse 12

<b><i>since the consecrated hair was defiled.</i></b> Although one should be cautious about drawing conclusions from silence, it must be observed that other sources of contamination are not mentioned, particularly those incurred via menstruation or the emission of bodily fluids. It is interesting to consider what may have happened to female nazirites when they menstruated.

Verse 13



Verse 14



Verse 15



Verse 16

<b><i>the priest shall present them.</i></b> Just as the priest brings the <i>sotah</i> before God (5:16) the priest assumes the active role and presents the <i>nazir</i> and the offering God. Despite a seemingly common passivity of these two figures (in contrast to the active priest), their differences stand out. Through an act of dedication and religious desire, the <i>nazir</i> comes willingly before God. Charged with deception and sexual desire, the <i>sotah</i> is forcibly brought before God.

Verse 17



Verse 18

<b><i>put them on the fire that is under the sacrifice.</i></b> The placement of the nazirite’s consecrated locks directly <i>under</i> the ram suggests that the <i>nazir’s</i> hair is considered one of the offerings.

Verse 19



Verse 20



Verse 21



Verse 22

PRIESTLY BLESSING (6:22–27) According to Leviticus 9:22, at the conclusion of the ceremony consecrating the priests and the Tabernacle, Aaron raises his hands and blesses the community of Israel. Although the text does not report Aaron’s words, rabbinic commentators suggest that he recites Numbers 6:24–27, which has become known as the “Priestly Blessing.” Its words affirm that God blesses and protects, deals kindly and graciously, bestows favor, and grants peace. Each of its three verses contains two blessings, yet the verses expand in length from three to five to seven words, suggesting that God’s blessing expands. Verse 27 echoes both the form and content of v. 23, creating an envelope structure for the blessing.
In 1979, archaeologists discovered in Jerusalem two small silver scrolls dated to the late 7th or early 6th century <small>B.C.E.</small>, inscribed with a text nearly identical to the Priestly Blessing. Although their function remains unknown, these silver scrolls provide the earliest known parallel to a biblical text and probably served as protective amulets. The blessing as found in the Torah remains an integral part of Jewish liturgy and is recited as part of the <i>Amidah</i> prayer.

Verse 23



Verse 24



Verse 25

<b><i>יהוה deal kindly.</i></b> Literally, “may the face of יהוה shine upon you.” The next verse also mentions God’s face (translated as “favor”). The desire for God’s face to be “directed toward” the people is best understood in contrast to the “hiding” of God’s face, which is a painful—often punitive—consequence of sin that appears throughout the Bible (see at Deuteronomy 31:17; 32:20; Isaiah 54:8; Psalm 13:2). Though the mention of God’s face may be a metaphor for divine grace, it also carries a sense of intimacy. God’s presence and personal engagement bring blessing.

Verse 26



Verse 27

<b><i>Thus they shall link My name with.</i></b> Literally, “they shall place my name on,” which perhaps refers to amulets hung on one’s body—as with the silver scrolls mentioned above, which were designed to be worn.

Verse 1

<i>Record of the Tribal Chiefs’ Gifts</i> (7:1–89)
Having addressed matters related to the sanctity of the camp, the parashah concludes as it began—with administrative records.
GIFTS FOR THE LEVITES (7:1–9)
From the tribal chiefs’ gifts in honor of the consecration of the Tabernacle, Moses allocates carts and oxen to be used by the Gershonites and the Merarites. (The Kohathites, who are responsible for the most sacred objects, carry them on their shoulders.)

CONCLUSION (7:89)
Although the parashah is concerned mostly with the sanctity of the community at large and with the individuals responsible for that sanctity, it concludes by describing a private moment between God and Moses. Whereas the moment appears intimate, the verse makes clear that even Moses stands at an appropriate distance from the Divine when he enters the Tabernacle’s interior. Despite the promise in the Priestly Blessing that God’s “face” will shine down upon Israel (see at 6:25), Moses’ experience of revelation is purely auditory. Even Israel’s greatest leader, the only one who elsewhere speaks to God face-to-face or mouth-to-mouth (Exodus 33:11; Numbers 12:8; Deuteronomy 34:10), listens in the Tent of Meeting to a disembodied voice emanating from above the cover of the Ark.

Chapter 8



Verse 1

<i>Final Ritual Preparations</i> (8:1–9:14)
The parashah opens with the final commands for the Israelites before they begin their journey away from Sinai. It includes rituals regarding the kindling of the menorah’s lamps, the purification of the Levites, and the passover sacrifice.
LIGHTING THE LAMPS OF THE LAMPSTAND (8:1–4)
Aaron is charged with lighting the menorah (see Exodus 27:21) and now does so. This completes the story of the Tabernacle’s erection and dedication and also concludes the story of the dedication offerings brought by Israelite chieftains at the conclusion of the previous parashah (Numbers 7), pointing out the unique “offering” that was presented by Aaron, the chieftain of Levi’s tribe. For descriptions of the lampstand and its function, see Exodus 25:31–40 and 37:17–24.

Verse 3



Verse 4



Verse 5

PURIFYING, CONSECRATING, AND APPOINTING THE LEVITES (8:5–26)
Even before this parashah, a number of passages have singled out the tribe of Levi (to which Moses and Aaron belong). In Exodus, the men of Levi zealously side with Moses following the incident of the Golden Calf, wreaking vengeance on the guilty parties (Exodus 32:26). Numbers 1:46–49, 2:33, and 3:15 make clear that the men of Levi are counted separately from the other tribes in the census since they have to be dedicated to God’s service by being appointed over the holy work in the Tabernacle (1:50–54).

Verse 6

<b><i>Take the Levites from among the Israelites and purify them.</i></b> Now the Levites are singled out further, this time formally dedicated to God’s service, such as by assisting the priests, the sons of Aaron. (For the purifying, consecrating, and appointing of Aaron and his sons as priests, see Exodus 28–29 and Leviticus 8.)

Verse 7

<b><i>7–12.</i></b> Moses is instructed to purify the Levites through a special ceremony.

Verse 8



Verse 9

<b><i>community leadership.</i></b> Literally, “the entire community”; this translation construes the word for community, <i>edah,</i> as referring here to a representative body made up of adult males. However the terms are parsed, the entire community is to formally bestow its agreement to accept the Levites as representing it before God; but practically speaking, only a part of the Israelites will lay their hands (v. 10) on the Levites.

Verse 10



Verse 11



Verse 12



Verse 13

<b><i>13–20.</i></b> The Levites are “set apart” as attendants to Aaron and his sons (the priests), and are <i>themselves</i> dedicated as an elevation offering before God. The Levites are further set apart as dedicated to God’s service, in lieu of the male first-born of each Israelite woman outside of the Levite tribe (8:16–17; see also at 3:12–13). As the parashah continues, it reiterates that each of the three levitical familial groupings—Gershonites, Kohathites, and Merarites (named for the grandfather and great-uncles of Moses, Miriam, and Aaron) has its own task in the Tabernacle service and its own Tabernacle components to carry (10:17, 21; compare 3:23–39).

<b><i>participate…work force.</i></b> Forms of the Hebrew word <i>tzava</i> appear twice in this verse (and again once in the next verse). In the context of the Levites, <i>tzava</i> means to fulfill a duty or to undertake a task. [Similar forms of the word also appear twice in Exodus when referring to women “who performed tasks at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting”; see at Exodus 38:8. —<i>Ed.</i>]

Chapter 9



Verse 1

CELEBRATING THE PASSOVER OFFERING AND ADDING A “SECOND PASSOVER” (9:1–14) This section records an existential problem addressed to Moses, namely, the fact that it is impossible for some Israelites to be ritually pure in time for the passover sacrifice. The section concludes with a legal mandate from God, instituting a second opportunity for the people to observe the passover offering a month later. This legal mandate widens to include also Israelite householders (and perhaps others) who happen to be distant from the Tabernacle and are unable to perform the passover offering at the right time. We find four other cases in the Torah when a query prompts a new law: the case of the blasphemer (Leviticus 24:10–16); the case of the man gathering sticks on the Sabbath (Numbers 15:32–36); and twice, the case of the daughters of Zelophehad, namely Mahlah, Milcah, Noah, Hoglah, and Tirzah (see at 27:1–11 and 36:1–12).

Verse 2



Verse 3



Verse 4



Verse 5



Verse 6

<b><i>householders.</i></b> The original passover offering was arranged by household (Exodus 12:3), which is the basic unit of Israelite society. This translation presumes that it is a household’s head who would normally “present” the passover sacrifice (v. 7) on behalf of the household, before sharing it with all of its members. (Presumably householders were males, a fact that would go without saying.) It is also possible that the group in question was composed of other impure individuals, women and men, not specifically householders.

Verse 7

<b><i>7–8.</i></b> Moses brings the problem before God: what to do when ritual impurity bars an Israelite (who is commanded to carry out a passover sacrifice) from making the sacrifice at the designated time?

 God mandates that those unable to observe the Passover ritual at the designated time, on the fourteenth day of the first month, offer their sacrifice a month later, on the fourteenth of the following month.
[This option of an alternative passover offering a month later (what the Rabbis called “Second Passover” or <i>pesach sheni</i>) illustrates a capacity to modify time-bound obligations on account of certain circumstances. One wonders whether this precedence and flexibility could also apply when women were ritually impure because of childbirth or menstruation. However, there is no mention of such modifications regarding women. —<i>Ed</i>.]

Verse 12



Verse 13



Verse 14

<b><i>There shall be one law for you, whether stranger or citizen of the country.</i></b> This rule applies specifically to observing Passover but can be interpreted as a general principle that applies in other cases as well.

Verse 15

<i>The Israelites’ Travel Protocol</i> (9:15–10:36)
The Israelites’ long journey from Egypt to Canaan is full of starts and stops (see 33:1–49). Unlike conventional journeys, in which travel is dictated by constraints of geography, climate, and security, the Israelites’ journey is directed supernaturally. This unit provides instructions for the journey.
PLANNING THE TRAVEL PROTOCOL (9:15–10:10)
God has led the people by means of a cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night, both of which traveled before the camp (Exodus 13:21–22). Here we learn that the cloud’s coming to a halt and resting over the Tabernacle signals that they must encamp (9:17–23).

Verse 16



Verse 17



Verse 18

<b><i>At a command of יהוה</i></b>. God alone determines the duration of their travel and encampment, as well as the direction of their travel.

Verse 11

LEAVING SINAI (10:11–28) Previously, all the details of the travel protocol were theoretical; now, they are going to be applied. The Torah recounts this first journey from Sinai with great pomp by describing the rank and file of the tribes and the transportation of the Tabernacle. The arrangement of the tribes reflects the status of the tribal ancestors’ mothers, namely Leah, Rachel, Bilhah, and Zilpah. (See also <i>B’midbar,</i> Another View.)

Verse 12

 Finally, after all the detailed preparations, the Israelites embark from Sinai for the first time.

Verse 13



Verse 14

 The first three tribes to embark on the journey are descended from three of the sons of Leah: Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun.

Verse 15



Verse 16



Verse 17

 The first group is followed by the dismantled Tabernacle, borne by the levitical clans of Gershon and Merari.

Verse 18

 The next group that sets out are the tribes of Reuben, Simeon, and Gad, who are descendants of Leah and her maid Zilpah.

Verse 19



Verse 20



Verse 21

 The sons of the levitical clan of Kohath follow with the well-covered Tabernacle vessels. Since they travel behind the Gershonites and Merarites, who carry the dismantled Tabernacle, the latter can fully set up the Tabernacle at each site by the time the Kohathites arrive to place the holy vessels inside it.

Verse 22

 After the Kohathites, the group that sets out are the tribes of Rachel: Ephraim, Manasseh, and Benjamin.

Verse 28



Verse 29

INVITING HOBAB TO ACCOMPANY ISRAEL (10:29–32) Amid all the details of the journey, the Torah weaves in a human interest story. Here, Moses addresses Hobab the Midianite, who until now has been staying with the Israelites in the Sinai wilderness—asking him to accompany them on their continuing journey to the Land of Israel.
<b><i>Hobab son of Reuel the Midianite, Moses’ father-in-law.</i></b> Hobab is either another name for Moses’ father-in-law, Jethro (father of Zipporah), or perhaps Moses’ brother-in-law. [Either way, it remains unclear what happens to Zipporah, Moses’ wife. In Exodus 18, Jethro brings his daughter back to Moses, along with “her two sons” (see Exodus 18:6); presumably these are also Moses’ children. The soon-to-be-mentioned controversy about Moses’ wife (Numbers 12) makes this question all the more pressing. —<i>Ed.</i>]

Verse 30



Verse 31



Verse 32

 Though the dialogue between them seems incomplete, we can learn from Moses’ request how strongly he wishes Hobab to accompany Israel, and how convinced he is of the great goodness promised by God that await the Israelites upon their arrival in the land.

Verse 33

BEGINNING THE JOURNEY WITH THE ARK (10:33–36) While the cloud leads the way before the people, thereby giving expression to God’s constant accompaniment of Israel, the Ark symbolizes God’s intimate presence among the people (see also Exodus 25:22), as well as God’s role in protecting and defending them.
<b><i>traveled in front of them.</i></b> Whereas vv. 17–21 describe the Tabernacle as traveling <i>with</i> the camp, this passage depicts the Ark as traveling ahead of the camp.

Verse 34



Verse 35

<b><i>35–36.</i></b> Jewish tradition has woven these verses containing Moses’ two prayers into the liturgy of the Torah service, often before and after the Torah reading.

Verse 1

<i>Israelite Challenges to Moses and God</i> (11:1–12:16)
This unit describes three major challenges to Moses and God. In all three cases, fixed elements appear in a similar order: the sin of the people (or a group among the people); God’s punishment; a petition to Moses requesting that the punishment be removed; Moses’ prayer; the punishment’s termination; and the naming of the site after the episode that occurred there.
COMPLAINING (11:1–3)
This first tale of woe—the incident at Taberah—is exceedingly concise (three verses), yet it comprises an entire story. Despite its brevity, this episode is instructive in its content and can serve as a good introduction to all three challenges in this parashah; it contains all of the fixed elements described above.
<b><i>The people took to complaining.</i></b> This passage does not indicate what the people complained about. By not making the content of the complaint clear within these verses, the story of the incident at Taberah suggests that their sin was in the very act of complaining.

Verse 2



Verse 3

<b><i>Taberah.</i></b> Heb. “fire.” The site receives its name because of the divine wrathful fire that burns there as a consequence of the people’s complaint.

Verse 4

CRAVING MEAT (11:4–35) This story is more complex and developed than the tale of the complainers (11:1–3), and its plot has more twists. In contrast to the previous episode, here the people’s sin is specified: they crave meat. Moses, in anguish, places his two problems before God. How is he to carry all these people whom he did not produce? Where will he get meat to feed them? These two questions shape the structure and development of the story. God responds by commissioning seventy representative elders to help Moses and by providing meat.
<b><i>“If only we had meat to eat!”</i></b> This statement—literally <i>“Who</i> shall give us meat to eat?”—alludes to the people’s lack of faith in God’s will and ability to provide them with meat (compare Exodus 17:7).

Verse 5

<b><i>“We remember the fish.”</i></b> Their great craving leads them to fantasize nostalgically about the food they enjoyed in Egypt.

Verse 6

<b><i>“Nothing but this manna.”</i></b> They express contempt for the manna, the gift of heaven, that descends from heaven each morning (Exodus 16:21). They argue that it is unvarying and boring.

Verse 7

<b><i>Now the manna was like coriander seed.</i></b> The details about manna’s virtues refute each of the arguments that the people raise, especially their claim that the manna is dry. Their complaints, together with this report of the manna’s merits, reflect the people’s gluttony and ingratitude. Their nostalgia for Egypt, which was known as their house of bondage (as in Exodus 13:3), shows their ingratitude for all the bounty that God showered and continues to shower upon them.

Verse 8



Verse 9



Verse 10



Verse 11

<b><i>Moses said to יהוה.</i></b> Moses turns to God before the punishment that befalls the people. Rather than praying that God’s punishment be lifted from the people (as in the story of the complainers, 11:1–3), Moses here bares his soul regarding his own bitter fate and complains about the difficulty of leadership.

Verse 12

 Moses’ questions are rhetorical and the simple meaning of the verse is: “I did not produce all these people, so why do you put all this burden on me?” As he attempts to illustrate the absurdity of his situation, Moses uses motherhood as the ultimate symbol of devotion. He cites a mother’s enormous love and compassion, concern for all of her children’s needs, and boundless dedication. One way to read Moses’ questions is that he is comparing himself to that ideal mother. [The rhetorical questions also suggest that it was not Moses who was Israel’s mother, but rather God. The verbs that Moses uses specifically refer to pregnancy (<i>hariti</i>, here rendered as “produce”) and birthing (<i>yalad’ti,</i> here translated as “engender”). By implication Moses asserts that God is the one who—as it were—conceived Israel, was pregnant, gave birth to Israel, and now should carry Israel. Although Israel’s God transcends gender, the Bible contains gendered images of the Divine: male imagery is more common (see at Exodus 15:3 and Deuteronomy 32:6), but we do find female imagery for God (see the introduction to Exodus 15:22–17:16, and see at Deuteronomy 32:13, 18). Here in Numbers we have a striking depiction of God that refers to women’s activities such as giving birth. Moses uses such strong maternal language to characterize God’s unique relationship with the people. —<i>Ed</i>.]

Verse 13

<b><i>“Where am I to get meat.”</i></b> Before focusing on his own needs, Moses asks a question on behalf of the people.

Verse 14



Verse 15



Verse 16

<b><i>“Gather for Me seventy of Israel’s elders.”</i></b> God offers to divide the burden of leadership between Moses and seventy representative assistants.

Verse 17

<b><i>“I will draw upon the spirit that is on you.”</i></b> In Exodus 19, Moses’ father-in-law, Jethro, advised Moses to appoint judges in order to reduce his administrative burden. Here, the seventy elders, upon whom God bestows some of Moses’ spirit, are to be selected to fill a prophetic-spiritual role.

Verse 18

<b><i>“tomorrow…you shall eat meat.”</i></b> God’s promise to provide meat in response to the people’s craving is also a threat, as v. 20 makes unmistakably clear.

Verse 19



Verse 20



Verse 21



Verse 22



Verse 23



Verse 24



Verse 25



Verse 26

<b><i>they spoke in ecstasy in the camp.</i></b> Eldad and Medad stir up a tempest by prophesying in the camp without having Moses’ spirit bestowed upon them among the seventy elders (vv. 24–25).

Verse 27

<b><i>27–28.</i></b> First, a young assistant runs to Moses, in excitement and alarm, to inform him about this irregular behavior. Next comes Joshua, who suggests that the offenders be restrained, either as a punishment or to prevent further illegitimate prophecy.

Verse 28



Verse 29

<b><i>“Would that all יהוה’s people were prophets.”</i></b> Only Moses, with enormous generosity of spirit, reacts with happiness and acceptance. He is neither threatened nor jealous but, instead, expresses a desire that there be more, rather than fewer, prophets among God’s people. (His response is all the more striking given God’s reaction to Miriam and Aaron’s boast of their prophetic gifts; see at Numbers 12.)

Verse 30



Verse 31

<b><i>31–33.</i></b> In response to Moses’ petition in v. 13—“Where am I to get meat?”—God supplies meat from an unexpected source: a flock of quail blown in by sea wind, which arrives at the Israelite camp. The plentiful quantity suffices for the entire people. However, the people’s craving and hunger are so great that they fall upon the birds without restraint or embarrassment, filling their mouths and bellies. Their frenzied consumption of the quails causes a plague that spreads among those who consume them.

Verse 32



Verse 33



Verse 34

<b><i>Kibroth-hattaavah.</i></b> The people bury the many victims at a site whose name translates as “Graves of Craving.” This name indicates that the people’s sin is in craving for meat when God has already provided sufficient manna to sustain them. The Torah blames the people for not making do with manna as their food.
Generally speaking, the Torah displays a multifaceted relationship to meat consumption. Genesis 1:29 seems to advocate vegetarianism; Genesis 9:4 and Deuteronomy 12:16 allow eating meat but prohibit the consumption of blood; Leviticus 11 and Deuteronomy 14 limit the consumption of meat to specific animals. Only in reference to meat consumption does the Torah use the verb “crave” (also Deuteronomy 12:15, 20, 21). [At the same time, priests and other Israelites are expected to eat the meat that they have together consecrated as sacrifices (see Leviticus 1–7). —<i>Ed</i>.] If cravings for meat so angered God, then why does God supply the people with what they ask, and in such great quantities? The story indicates that God’s intent in bringing the quails is chiefly “educational,” to prove God’s unlimited powers to the people. On the one hand, God has power complete enough to satisfy all creatures’ needs, if God so desires. On the other hand, God is liable, where needed, to punish them as well.

Chapter 12



Verse 1

CRITICIZING MOSES:
MIRIAM, AARON, AND THE CUSHITE WOMAN (12:1–16) The presence of two female characters stands out in this story. One, Miriam, is active and central; she constitutes the story’s axis. The other, Moses’ unnamed wife, called the “dark-skinned” or “Cushite” woman, is unseen and silent; though from her behind-the-scenes position, she is the story’s catalyst. The story constitutes a family drama of siblings who speak out against their brother and his wife.
This section contains numerous gaps, making it difficult to bridge from one verse to the next (particularly in the first three verses) and provoking a variety of questions—as discussed in turn, below.
<b><i>Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses.</i></b> The verb “spoke” is in the feminine singular form, indicating that Miriam is the chief spokesperson.
<i><b>Cushite woman.</b></i> Heb. <i>cushit,</i> which may have been understood either to mean “Cushite” (that is, from Cush) or “dark-skinned.” In the Bible, Cush seems to be located in the south of Egypt, east of Sudan. However, references to <i>cushim</i> (Cushites, plural) pertain to tribes who lived in different places in Africa and Asia, as well as in the southern part of ancient Israel. The Bible refers to Cushites with awareness of their dark skin (Jeremiah 13:23). In Jeremiah 38:7–13, a Cushite saves Jeremiah’s life. In Amos 9:7, Cushites are presented as equal to Israelites in God’s view.
<i><b>he had married.</b></i> Who is this woman? Have we encountered her before? Is she Zipporah, the wife of Moses and the daughter of the Midianite priest (Exodus 2:21)? If so, she may well have been “dark-skinned” (Ibn Ezra). Or, is this another wife—unnamed and mentioned in the Bible only here—a native of Ethiopia, whom Moses married in addition to Zipporah, or after Moses sent Zipporah home (see Exodus 18:2)?
<i><b>“He married a Cushite woman!”</b></i> What is Miriam and Aaron’s complaint against their brother and his marriage? Are they attacking Moses for marrying a woman with dark skin? Is it a diatribe against marriage outside of the Israelite tribal structure?

Verse 2

<b><i>“Has יהוה spoken only through Moses?”</i></b> What connection does the previously mentioned woman bear to this complaint about Moses in relation to his siblings’ prophetic roles? The statement highlights one of several crucial gaps in this story. As prophets themselves, the siblings may think that they are entitled to the same privileged status accorded Moses. Indeed, if status is Miriam and Aaron’s primary concern, then perhaps they oppose Moses’ marriage because his wife is of the “wrong” status. Alternatively, this complaint may parallel what will be expressed by Korah and his assembly when they accuse Moses and Aaron of exalting themselves “above” God’s congregation (16:1–3).

Verse 3

 The Torah insists that Moses, far from raising himself above others, is more modest than any other human being on earth. Moses, in his great humility, does not react or protest Miriam and Aaron’s words. That is why God now proceeds to intervene on behalf of Moses, reproaching Miriam and Aaron.

Verse 4

<b><i>יהוה called to Moses, Aaron, and Miriam.</i></b> All three siblings are summoned, with Miriam in the third position—as in the words of the prophet Micah (Micah 6:4).

Verse 5



Verse 6

<b><i>“Hear these My words.”</i></b> God speaks in the second person <i>plural,</i> censuring both Miriam and Aaron; but only Miriam will be punished (below). God’s verbal castigation of the siblings only addresses the issue of Moses’ prophetic leadership and not the issue of Moses’ marriage.

Verse 7

<b><i>“Not so with My servant Moses.”</i></b> God asserts that Moses’ prophetic status is unique. This undermines both of the siblings’ demand that their prophetic status be honored.

Verse 8

<b><i>“mouth to mouth.”</i></b> God describes the great and unique intimacy between Moses and God, as well as the unique authority of Moses as God’s spokesperson. Only Moses receives words directly from God, whereas all other prophets have access to the Divine through other means, like dreams and visions.

Verse 9



Verse 10

<b><i>there was Miriam.</i></b> Why is Miriam alone punished for the siblings’ complaint? Is it because she is a woman who demands a leading position? Many commentaries hold that she—and not Aaron—is punished because she is the primary speaker against Moses. Whereas both of them complain about Moses’ prophetic status (v. 2 uses the plural verb <i>vayomru),</i> it is possible that only Miriam criticizes Moses’ marriage (v. 1 uses the feminine singular <i>va-t’daber);</i> and thus only Miriam receives God’s punishment for that criticism. Some contemporary commentators, who consider the text here to be sexist, also argue that Miriam alone is punished because she is a woman who dares challenge authority. However, if we understand the word <i>cushit</i> (“Cushite” in our translation) to mean “dark-skinned,” then Miriam may be punished for insulting a dark-skinned woman. She alone turns white (in an ironic twist) because she alone spoke out on that particular subject.
<i><b>stricken with snow-white scales.</b></i> [The same words describe the temporary condition of Moses’ hand in Exodus 4:6 when God prepares him to face Pharaoh. There the condition implies an example, not a punishment. In II Kings 5:27, the only other use of these words, the expression refers to a punishment. —<i>Ed</i>.]

Verse 11

<b><i>“the sin which we committed.”</i></b> Aaron confesses both his and Miriam’s sin and asks for forgiveness for Miriam.

Verse 12

<b><i>“Let her not be as a stillbirth.”</i></b> As her partner in crime, Aaron intervenes on Miriam’s behalf; this is fitting since all the burden of punishment has fallen upon her.
<b><i>“half its flesh eaten away.”</i></b> This description conveys an association with death. Commentators suggest that this is why <i>tzaraat</i> (scale disease) is subject to special strictures (see <i>parashat M’tzora).</i>

Verse 13

<b><i>“O God, pray heal her!”</i></b> Moses reacts immediately to Aaron’s words, without any grudge or hesitation. The words of his succinct prayer seeking his sister’s cure have since become part of Jewish healing services (see Contemporary Reflection).

Verse 14

<b><i>“If her father spat in her face, would she not bear her shame for seven days?”</i></b> God’s response includes a symbolic punishment after Moses’ intercession. The full ramifications of God’s explanation remain obscure. Three points, however, are clear. First, God’s words imply that the reason for the seven days’ seclusion is shame—like the shame that befalls a daughter who was insulted by her father. This is not like the usual seclusion of the <i>m’tzora</i> (the person stricken with scale disease; see at Leviticus 13). Second, the statement (that a daughter is shamed for seven days when her father spits on her) discloses something of an assumed and accepted practice in the community. Third, the father-daughter analogy seems to soften the harshness of the incident by referring to God as father and Miriam as God’s daughter: she is still a member of God’s household, as it were (compare v. 7).
<i><b>“Let her be shut out of camp for seven days.”</b></i> Miriam is to be quarantined outside the camp. Leviticus 13 prescribes a seven-day seclusion for a person stricken with <i>tzaraat</i> (a scale disease). But here God uses a different rationale for Miriam’s seclusion (see previous comment). On the relative leniency of this punishment, see the introduction to Numbers 16:1–35. Miriam’s affliction and quarantine are referred to again in Deuteronomy 24:8–9.

Verse 15

<b><i>the people did not march on until Miriam was readmitted.</i></b> Without necessarily taking sides in Miriam’s dispute with Moses, the people demonstrate their solidarity with her by waiting until she can rejoin the camp.
<i>—Masha Turner</i>  

Chapter 13



Verse 1

<i>The Scouts’ Expedition and Report</i>
<small>FEAR AND FAITHLESSNESS (13:1–33)</small>
The opening of this Torah portion is set in the Israelite encampment in the wilderness. At God’s command, Moses appoints twelve chieftains, one from each tribe, for a scouting expedition to Canaan to spy out the land and its inhabitants. During their reconnaissance, the scouts cut down a huge cluster of grapes, as well as pomegranates and figs, to bring back to camp as samples of the land’s produce. As they make their report, the scouts claim to have encountered populations of giants, inhabitants that dwarf their own size, convincing ten of the scouts that any conquest attempt is doomed to failure. Notably, subsequent scouting expeditions mentioned in the Bible produce the opposite effect, frightening the enemy rather than the Israelites (see Joshua 2; Judges 18). Most significant is the story about Rahab, the harlot in Jericho who risks her life by hiding the two Israelite spies sent by Joshua. In that account, a woman of Canaanite origin is depicted as a God-fearing individual who trusts in Israel’s victory. In essence, she becomes the hero of the story, the conduit to Israel’s military success.
The narrative in Numbers is a conflation of at least two traditions that reflect different written sources and result in discrepancies. (On J, E, and P as the scholarly names for those sources, see Women and Interpretation of the Torah, page xxxvi.) The differences revolve around two issues: the geographical area of Canaan that is scouted, and the number of scouts who bring a positive report. In the earlier version (JE), the scouts reconnoiter the southern portion of Canaan (13:17), and Caleb alone recommends that Israel proceed with the conquest (13:30). The later priestly account (P) expands the scouting expedition so that they traverse the entire land of Canaan (13:21), plus it adds Joshua as a spokesman for undertaking the conquest (14:6–9).
MOSES CHOOSES AND INSTRUCTS THE SCOUTS (13:1–20)
The scouts represent the twelve tribes of Israel. The text reiterates their leadership status, probably to underscore their ultimate failure as leaders and to highlight their faithlessness. Moses instructs them to assess the strength of Canaan’s inhabitants, both the size of their population and the settlements in which they reside. The scouts are also to evaluate the productivity of the land and return with samples of the fruit of the season (summer).

Verse 2

<b><i>emissaries.</i></b> Heb. <i>anashim,</i> whose basic meaning is “representative members of a group”; traditionally it has often been translated as “men” or, more inclusively, “people.” Throughout this commentary, these individuals are referred to as “scouts,” not “spies” (as the Rabbis and later commentators often call them), since according to the present account, their mandate is to survey the land, not engage in espionage.

Verse 16

<b><i>son of Nun.</i></b> It is noteworthy that Joshua’s genealogy does not include a mother’s name (“matronymic”), like that of Moses (Exodus 6:20) and of notable Israelite kings, such as Amaziah, whose mother’s name is Jehoaddan (II Kings 14:2), and Hezekiah, whose mother’s name is Abi (II Kings 18:2).
<i><b>Joshua.</b></i> Moses emends this chieftain’s name, which originally appears as <i>Hoshe’a</i> (Hosea, v. 8), to <i>Y’hoshua</i> (Joshua). The new first syllable <i>y’ho</i> may signify the deity name (“theophoric element”) associated with Israel’s God (as in the names of the Israelite kings Jehoshaphat, Jehoahaz, Jehoram, and others).

Verse 17



Verse 18



Verse 19

<b><i>open or fortified.</i></b> Canaanite settlements in the Bronze and Iron Ages consisted both of unwalled villages and of walled cities with fortified gates. The latter were constructed to withstand attacks and sieges; they required more advanced military machinery to penetrate. This information would have been strategically vital to a conquest plan.

Verse 20



Verse 21

THE SCOUTS RECONNOITER CANAAN (13:21–24) The expedition outlined in these verses reflects a conflation of two traditions: the scouting of the entire land (v. 21) and the scouting of only the area of the city of Hebron and south (vv. 22–24). In the region of Hebron, the scouts encounter clans of aboriginal giants.
The grapes, pomegranates, and figs that they bring back—all late summer fruit—suggest the season of the expedition. But since in the Bible these fruits commonly symbolize the productivity of the Promised Land, they may also be simply a literary device.

Verse 22



Verse 23



Verse 24



Verse 25

THE SCOUTS GIVE THEIR REPORT AND EVALUATION (13:25–33) Upon their return, the scouts begin by highlighting the positive aspects of the land. Yet, they quickly change their tone and dwell on its negative features, mainly its formidable population and cities.
At first, Caleb is the only scout who speaks favorably of an Israelite conquest of Canaan. Joshua’s role as a faithful leader does not appear until later in the narrative (14:6), which is a section clearly derived from an alternate tradition. (Caleb, the chieftain who represents Judah, will continue to play a key role in the conquest of Canaan, particularly in the tribal territory of Judah. In Joshua 15:13–19 and Judges 1:12–15, he promises his daughter Achsah in marriage to the conqueror of the city of Kiriath-Sepher, also known as Debir. The narrative then gives voice to Achsah as she cleverly appeals to Caleb’s sense of honor as a father, prompting him to bestow property with water springs in the Negeb to her and her new husband, Othniel.)
<b><i>forty days.</i></b> The duration of the scouting expedition is formulaic and reminiscent of other significant events, such as the length of the Flood (Genesis 7:17) and the amount of time Moses spent on Mount Sinai (Exodus 24:18).

Verse 26



Verse 27

<b><i>flow with milk and honey.</i></b> As an epithet for the Promised Land, this biblical phrase (also Exodus 3:8, 17) has been used through the ages, even in modern times.
Heb. <i>d’vash</i> can refer either to a sweet syrup made from mashed dates or to bees’ honey. A recent archeological discovery in the Beit She’an Valley of a large beehive colony dated to the 10th-9th century <small>B.C.E.</small> now proves that beekeeping for production of honey was an industry in biblical Israel.

Verse 28

<b><i>Anakites.</i></b> They and the Nephilim (v. 33) are giants or super-humans mentioned also in other biblical texts. Genesis 6:1–4 recounts the origin of the Nephilim. David’s Philistine adversary, Goliath, is depicted as a giant (I Samuel 17:4) descended from another group of giants, the Rephaim (I Chronicles 20:5–6).
It is difficult to interpret the meaning of “giants” in the scouts’ report. In the case of the Philistines, it may be that their tall headdresses (pictured in Egyptian art) contributed to their gigantic image. More importantly, the report of giants in the land makes the Canaanites more intimidating and their eventual defeat by the Israelites more spectacular. Notably, Anakites are also mentioned in Egyptian literature (Papyrus Anastasi 1, <i>Context of Scripture,</i> 2002, 3:13) where they are identified as Shasu (a nomadic group) about 6’8”–8’6” (2–2.6 meters) tall. The Shasu were enemies of the Egyptians and their depiction as giants functions as a literary device similar to that in the biblical story. Some scholars actually connect the Shasu with proto-Israelites.

Verse 29

<b><i>Amalekites…Hittites, Jebusites, and Amorites.</i></b> For the indigenous population of Canaan, see the table of nations in Genesis 10:15–20. Deuteronomy 7:1–3 includes most of these among the people who must be destroyed upon Israel’s entering the land; that passage (as well as Exodus 34:11–16) also forbids giving daughters in marriage to these groups or taking daughters from them.

Verse 30



Verse 31



Verse 32

<b><i>devours its settlers.</i></b> Most likely, this phrase alludes to the results of frequent warfare, which ravaged Canaan (see Ezekiel 36:13–14). An alternate explanation is that the expression refers to the infertility of the land, but this would contradict the scouts’ earlier report and hence is less likely.

Verse 33

<b><i>we looked like grasshoppers.</i></b> The scouts underscore the enormous size of the giants of Canaan by depicting their own stature in comparison.

Chapter 14



Verse 1

<i>Aftermath of the Scouting Expedition</i>
THE PEOPLE’S REBELLION AND DIVINE RETRIBUTION (14:1–45)
In the continuous cycle of rebellions by the Israelites in the wilderness, this one is the most egregious. The ten scouts who incite the populace advocate abandoning Israel’s ultimate goal of settling the Promised Land. This extreme display of faithlessness before God, similar to that in the Golden Calf episode (Exodus 32), provokes God’s fiery anger—which threatens to annihilate the whole nation. As before, Moses becomes an intercessor, a part he has learned to play well. Still, here the punishment is most severe and far-reaching.
THE SCOUTS DISCOURAGE THE PEOPLE WITH THEIR REPORT (14:1–5)
Reacting to the scouts’ frightening description of the fierce inhabitants of Canaan, the Israelites cry out in fear. Clearly, they have accepted the veracity of the scouts’ military analysis and expect to be defeated. They are ready to return to Egypt rather than face the enemy in Canaan, apparently having forgotten the wrath of the Egyptian army that pursued them when they escaped from Egypt. It appears that the series of murmurings and rebellions in the wilderness has reached a climax at the gates of the Promised Land.
<b><i>The whole community.</i></b> This phrase indicates the widespread nature of the rebellion. Presumably the women are included.

Verse 2



Verse 3

<b><i>“Our wives and children will be carried off!”</i></b> Several biblical texts describe situations in which women and children are carried off as booty. In one case, I Samuel 30, David rescues the wives and children of his men (and his own family as well). Commonly, the attackers kill the captive wives but keep alive the virgins, “women who have not known a man” (see Judges 21). Deuteronomic law regulates the treatment of women taken captive by Israelite men (Deuteronomy 21:10–14).

Verse 4

<b><i>“Let us head back.”</i></b> The Hebrew phrase can also mean “let us appoint a leader,” indicating that the Israelites are ready to replace Moses and return to Egypt under new leadership.

Verse 5

 Desperate, Moses and Aaron prostrate them selves before the people. They seem helpless in the face of a national rebellion that questions not only the Israelites’ allegiance to God but also their human leadership.

Verse 6

JOSHUA AND CALEB CONTRADICT THE REPORT (14:6–9) In the face of Moses and Aaron’s temporary abdication of leadership, Joshua and Caleb assume responsibility. They staunchly articulate that the outcome of the mission will be determined by Israel’s God, not by military fortitude. The extent of the people’s rebellion is evident by their readiness to stone Joshua and Caleb. It is only the sudden appearance of God’s Presence before the people that saves them.
<b><i>rent their clothes.</i></b> This act, a sign of grief and mourning, probably took the place of mutilating oneself with gashes and the like (a biblical prohibition, Leviticus 19:28). Tearing one’s garment is an ancient custom that has survived to the present day. In the Bible, for example, King David’s daughter Tamar rends her garments, puts dust on her head, and cries loudly, grieving after her half-brother Amnon rapes her (II Samuel 13; compare also Genesis 44:13).

Verse 10

GOD PUNISHES THE COMMUNITY FOR ITS LACK OF FAITH (14:10–38) God is prepared to eradicate all Israel in a plague—with the exception of Moses, from whose descendants God proposes to create a new nation. Since the sins surrounding the scouting expedition and the Golden Calf (Exodus 32) are the only two events eliciting such severe divine retribution, it seems that their gravity is comparable. As in the past, Moses intercedes on behalf of the people. He argues first that God’s reputation among the nations as a most powerful deity must be preserved; his second argument appeals to God’s attribute of mercy (see Exodus 34:6–7). Moses’ lengthy prayer for the nation contrasts sharply with his very brief prayer on behalf of his sister Miriam (12:13), who was stricken with a skin disease for challenging Moses’ position.
As is often the case in the Torah, God responds favorably to Moses’ plea, promising to spare the nation. The Israelites are condemned to wander in the wilderness until nearly all the adults have died, presumably of natural causes (vv. 22–23, 28–33); but the ten faithless scouts are struck down on the spot (vv. 36–37). The tribe of Levi is not among those who are doomed to die in the wilderness, apparently because it had not been represented among the scouts. Of the remaining Israelites, only Joshua and Caleb and the children “born in the wilderness” will enter the Promised Land.
God’s decree in this passage is woven from two sources or traditions, JE (vv. 20–24) and a priestly source (vv. 26–38). (On these sources, see Women and Interpretation of the Torah, page xxxvi.) In the former, only Caleb is singled out to be spared (v. 24) because he alone among the scouts was faithful; in the latter, both Caleb and Joshua are listed as those who will settle Canaan (v. 30).
<b><i>Presence.</i></b> Heb. <i>kavod,</i> the typical term for describing God’s manifestation in a cloud in priestly writings.

Verse 18

 <b><i>“</i>יהוה<i>! slow to anger…visiting the iniquity of parents upon children.”</i></b> The entire formula of God’s attributes is found in Exodus 34:6–7; portions are quoted here as well as in the Decalogue (Exodus 20:5–6; Deuteronomy 5:9–10). Moses is clearly appealing to God’s merciful nature, which should prevent God from carrying out the threat to slaughter the entire nation. Simultaneously, Moses notes that God does not remit full punishment; in fact, future generations share the punishment of their guilty ancestors. Deuteronomy offers a different perspective on this matter, arguing that subsequent generations are punished only if they persist in those sins (Deuteronomy 5:9–10).

Verse 19



Verse 20



Verse 21

<b><i>“as I live.”</i></b> This expression, also found in v. 28, is an oath formula. God vows to mitigate the people’s punishment so as to not wipe out the entire nation.

Verse 22

<b><i>“none of the adults.”</i></b> Except for Joshua, Caleb, and the tribe of Levi (see above), the current adult generation will not inherit Canaan; instead, they will perish in the wilderness according to their wish expressed earlier (v. 2). In essence, the wilderness becomes a vehicle for cleansing the sin of the older generation and preparing the younger Israelites to become the new inheritors of the Promised Land.

Verse 33

<b><i>“suffering for your faithlessness.”</i></b> Literally, “bearing your harlotry,” indicating the infidelity of the older generation to God. The Bible often uses the term “harlotry” metaphorically to refer to Israelite idolatrous practices, a manifestation of their infidelity to God (see especially Hosea 1–3). This pejorative image is underscored in some of the biblical depictions of the harlot (as in Proverbs 23:27).

Verse 36



Verse 37

 The ten scouts who incited the rebellion with their negative report die in a plague sent by God. Their sin is too grave to mitigate. That they get no second chance is a reflection of just how seriously the Bible treats the responsibilities of leadership; indeed, these scouts demonstrated the huge impact that a leader can have.

Verse 38



Verse 39

THE PEOPLE ATTEMPT A MILITARY EXPEDITION (14:39–45) A group of Israelites attempts to invade Canaan despite a warning to the contrary. Their motivation is either regret for their previous open lack of trust in God or a hope to reverse God’s decree. In any case, the invasion fails, and they are defeated. The message here is clear: without God’s blessing and presence in battle (marked by the accompanying Ark), conquest is impossible. The function of the Ark in the military camp is also emphasized in this section.

Chapter 15



Verse 1

<i>An Insertion of a Miscellany of Laws</i> (15:1–41)
Legal material interrupts the narrative of the wandering in the wilderness. Its purpose, immediately following God’s punishment of the faithless Israelites, may be to reiterate the promise that eventually they will indeed inherit Canaan—as signaled by the introduction to the first two sets of laws: “When you enter the land” (vv. 2, 18). The laws in this unit, with the exception of the last, deal with the sacrificial system. The last law, about <i>tzitzit</i> (fringes), is preceded by a case study of a wood-gatherer who violates Shabbat and is stoned to death by the community. The placement of the law of <i>tzitzit</i> after that case is probably designed to illustrate how to prevent such violations of the commandments in the first place.
Many scholars maintain that the laws in Numbers 15 are late (post-exilic), serving to complement and supplement earlier laws in other parts of the Torah.
SACRIFICES AND THEIR ACCOMPANIMENTS (15:1–16)
This section of laws addresses the individual Israelite regarding the correct combination of ingredients for the various sacrifices. The rituals outlined here call for animal burnt offerings (<i>olah)</i> and offerings of well-being (<i>zevach</i>) to be accompanied by a grain and oil mixture and wine (see Leviticus 1–3; 6–7), the combination being reminiscent of a complete meal. In the case of sacrifices, the meal is for the Deity. Although the Bible describes these offerings as “producing an odor pleasing to יהוה,” it never states that God actually eats them.

Verse 16



Verse 17

CHALLAH: OFFERING OF THE FIRST DOUGH (15:17–21) The <i>challah</i> (dough offering) is the first part of dough made from grains prepared in the kneading basin. While somewhat analogous to the first fruits offering (Deuteronomy 26:1–11) and the tithes (Deuteronomy 14:22–29), the dough offering seems to be an additional levy, in this case for a product manufactured from already tithed grain. The dough, a gift dedicated to the sanctuary, is given to the priest; in turn, the homes of the Israelites are blessed (see Ezekiel 44:30). Women played an important role in food production in ancient Israel (see also at Exodus 16:3; 25:30). Not only did they perform agricultural tasks, but also they prepared the family meals. Making bread would have been a woman’s daily chore. Tabuns (“ovens,” from the Arabic) are often uncovered in excavations of residential courtyards. The Bible describes several women as kneading bread or cakes (Sarah in Genesis 18:6; the unnamed medium of En-dor in I Samuel 28:24; Tamar in II Samuel 13:8; see also at Leviticus 26:26). According to Jeremiah, women kneaded dough for cakes offered to the Queen of Heaven, a local goddess (Jeremiah 7:18).

Verse 18



Verse 19



Verse 20

<b><i>the first yield of your baking.</i></b> Literally, “the first of your baking vessel.” The “baking vessel” <i>(arisah)</i> is evidently the term for a type of vessel used for kneading dough, possibly shaped like a crib <i>(eres).</i>
<b><i>loaf.</i></b> Heb. <i>challah,</i> a noun that seems to derive from the verbal root <i>ch-w-l,</i> “to be round.” This type of raised loaf differs from the flat pita-like bread (so common in the region from antiquity to the present day) that the Bible likewise associates with offerings (like matzot in Leviticus 2:4). <i>Challah</i> may be related to a type of Egyptian bread that was baked in pans to produce rounded domeshaped loafs (Tomb painting of Ti, 5th Dynasty—Sakkara). Egyptians considered flat-bread undesirable (as in <i>lechem oni</i> or “bread of distress” in Deuteronomy 16:3).

Verse 21



Verse 22

INADVERTENT COMMUNAL AND INDIVIDUAL WRONGS (15:22–31) This section deals specifically with sacrificial offerings that function as expiation for inadvertent violations of the commandments. As prescribed for other sacrifices (vv. 1–16), these too require the proper accompaniments. This section ends with a warning.

Verse 23



Verse 24

<b><i>community leaders.</i></b> Literally, “the entire community”; this translation aims to clarify that the word for community, <i>edah,</i> refers more precisely here to a representative body of some kind (most likely made up of adult males).

Verse 25



Verse 26



Verse 27



Verse 28



Verse 29

<b><i>one ritual.</i></b> More correctly, “one law (<i>torah</i>)” applies to both Israelites and alien residents. Breaking a law has a negative effect on the Land of Israel’s ability to retain God’s Presence, therefore any lawbreaking inhabitant must make expiation.

Verse 30

<b><i>that person shall be cut off.</i></b> Defiant, willful violation of ritual law cannot be expiated in the manner of an inadvertent sin. <i>Kareit,</i> the “cutting off” of a person, is a punishment enacted by the Divine. What exactly constitutes the punishment is not defined here but can be gleaned from other biblical passages that indicate punishments affecting both sinners and their progeny (for example, Malachi 2:12, “To the one who does this, may יהוה leave no descendants…”).

Verse 31



Verse 32

A CASE OF WILLFUL SHABBAT VIOLATION (15:32–36) The case of the wood-gatherer illustrates a most severe violation of the law, the willful desecration of Shabbat, which is a capital offense. It is not totally clear why Moses consults God regarding the offender’s punishment. Possibly, the reason is that earlier legislative texts that prescribe the death penalty are unclear as to whether punishment is to be exacted by a human court or by God (Exodus 31:14–15). So that no doubt remains, God sentences the violator to stoning at the hands of the community. This serious offense apparently is an affront to the entire community.

Verse 37

THE LAW OF TZITZIT (15:37–41) In antiquity, tassels and fringes were common on Canaanite and Mesopotamian clothing, and they held special significance. For example, prophets from the Babylonian city of Mari (second millennium) legitimated their oracles to the king by sending a fringe from their garment. Symbolically, the fringe was like a signature. The imprinting of fringes on clay tablets was also a way of endorsing or verifying a written document. Like garments and hair, fringes were considered part of the individual’s identity; thus, for example, giving one’s fringe to another person signified a pledge of loyalty. Artistic depictions from these cultures show women wearing tasseled garments, especially women of high status.
Since in the ancient Near East both genders customarily wore fringed garments, and since biblical laws are commonly prescribed for the people as a whole, we can assume that the law of <i>tzitzit</i> was ordained for all Israelites, females and males. According to this text, the purpose of the tassels on the corners of the outer garments was to call the Israelites to action regarding the fulfillment of the commandments. What seems to distinguish these tassels from the more popular garment fringes is the addition of a colored cord that is to stand out in contrast to the other tassel fibers and remind the wearer of the commandments. It is probably not accidental that this cord is identical to the one that hangs from the high priest’s headdress (Exodus 28:37). The <i>tzitzit</i> on the garments of Israelites identified them as being holy to God and symbolically may have connected them to the priests. Israelites who pledged loyalty to God also would have been loyal to the priests who oversaw God’s laws.

Verse 38

<b><i>fringes.</i></b> Heb. <i>tzitzit</i> probably means “ornament,” something that draws attention to itself. In Exodus 28:36, the related noun <i>tzitz</i> describes the gold frontlet suspended on a blue chord that dangled from the priest’s headdress.
<i><b>cord of blue.</b></i> Deuteronomy 22:12 refers to nonspecific garment tassels <i>as g’dilim</i> (“twisted threads”), making no mention of any colored cords.
<i><b>blue.</b></i> Heb. <i>t’cheilet,</i> a violet blue. On the dyeing of this color and on its social significance, see <i>T’rumah,</i> Another View.

Verse 39

<b><i>recall</i></b> Heb. <i>zachor,</i> meaning “to remember,” is often in the Bible a verb of action rather than thought (see Exodus 12:14).

Verse 40

<b><i>Thus you shall be reminded.</i></b> [Verses 40 and 41 are the concluding part of the Jewish prayer known as Recitation of the <i>Sh’ma.</i> The Rabbis considered this prayer, which begins with “Hear, O Israel!” and continues with “You shall love your God יהוה with all your heart…,” to be central to the liturgy (see at Deuteronomy 6:4–9). —<i>Ed</i>.] <i><b>be holy.</b></i> On the call to holiness, see at Leviticus 19.

Verse 41

 <i><b>I</b></i> <b>יהוה</b> <i><b>am your God who brought you out of the land of Egypt.</b></i> The parashah ends with reference to the redemption from Egyptian slavery, a theme often employed as grounds for Israelite allegiance to God (as in Exodus 6:7; 20:2–5; Leviticus 11:45).

Chapter 16



Verse 1

<i>The Rebellions</i> (16:1–35)
Two distinct groups, from two separate tribes, rise up together against Moses and Aaron. Moses addresses them in parallel fashion in two incidents that culminate in the destruction of each group. Because of the separate nature of the two rebellions and their ensuing punishments, scholars suspect that these were originally independent, unconnected stories. This theory is strengthened by Deuteronomy 11:6, which refers to Dathan and Abiram without, however, mentioning Korah or any Levites.
Korah, a first cousin of Moses and Aaron (Exodus 6:18–21), and certain Levite representatives challenge Aaron’s exclusive right to the priesthood, whereas Dathan and Abiram question Moses’ leadership abilities. That incident resembles Miriam and Aaron’s challenge of Moses’ role as prophet (Numbers 12), though the contrast in God’s retaliation may suggest a leniency with respect to Miriam—and even more so, Aaron—in Numbers 12. The Korah rebellion frames the separate confrontation by Dathan and Abiram, who challenge Moses.
KORAH’S CHALLENGE TO THE AARONITE PRIESTHOOD (16:1–11)
Korah’s challenge to the Aaronite priesthood can be explained by his own Levite lineage, which the narrator pointedly notes (v. 1). Korah protests to Moses that all Levites should be considered holy enough for the priesthood. (In 8:5–22, God had uniquely consecrated the Levites, providing some grounds for Korah’s presumption.)
[When the daughters of Zelophehad (from the tribe of Manasseh) later confront the leadership, they find it politic to contrast their challenge with Korah’s rebellion. When they demand their father’s land, they cleverly distance their dead father from Korah by hastening to say: “Our father…was not one of the faction, Korah’s faction, which banded together against יהוה” (27:3). —<i>Ed</i>.]
<b><i>Korah…son of Levi…along with Dathan and Abiram…descendants of Reuben.</i></b> Korah is identified by his father, grandfather, and tribal affiliation. This partly accounts for his claim to the priesthood: he is Aaron’s patrilineal first cousin. But Dathan and Abiram’s rebellion against Mosaic leadership is not readily explicable by lineage. Perhaps Dathan and Abiram are simply representative of the general Israelite unhappiness with the wilderness experience and Moses’ leadership, an unhappiness that forms a theme throughout Exodus and Numbers. [Reuben was Jacob’s first-born son; Reubenites may have seen themselves as rightful leaders. —<i>Ed</i>.]

Verse 2

<b><i>together with two hundred and fifty representatives of the Israelites: chieftains of the community.</i></b> Later in the narrative, these chieftains who join the mutiny against Moses are connected with the Levites who challenge Aaron (v. 35), providing a good example of the redactional activity that links these originally separate texts.

Verse 3

<b><i>“You have gone too far!”</i></b> Heb. <i>rav lachem,</i> an idiom that more literally means: “It is more than enough for you.” <i><b>“For all the community are holy.”</b></i> This statement is the focus of Korah’s challenge to Aaron’s exclusive right to the priesthood, but the language is abstract enough that it works for Dathan and Abiram’s rebellion against Moses’ civic leadership as well. That they are two separate rebellions, with distinct foci, is evidenced instead from Moses’ different responses to each party. One thing that they share in common, however, is that they address their complaints about leadership choices to Moses.
<b><i>“and</i> יהוה <i>is in their midst.”</i></b> The rebels state that the entire congregation is holy because God dwells within it, and this appears to be consonant with priestly literature in which God promises to live in Israel’s midst (see Exodus 29:45) and where the people are called to be holy (see Exodus 19:6). This ideal of a holy nation recurs throughout the priestly texts, including the ending of the previous story, which again calls Israel to be holy (Numbers 15:40). But the challengers miss the point of these divine injunctions toward holiness: the congregation is not holy by virtue of God’s presence, but in fact they must maintain holiness in order to ensure God’s continued residence among them. Korah challenges the need for a priestly hierarchy if all are holy. The lesson to be derived from his fiery death is that the priestly hierarchy is necessary in order to maintain the congregation’s holiness.

Verse 4



Verse 5

<b><i>“will grant…access.”</i></b> Literally, God “will bring him closer.” The verb <i>hikriv</i> (from the root <i>k-r-b)</i> means “to bring near” and is related to the noun for “sacrifice” (<i>korban</i>). The priests possess a higher degree of holiness by virtue of their closeness to God. The test that Moses poses will separate those who are closest to God from the rest of the congregation.

Verse 6

<b><i>6–7. “take fire pans…and lay incense on them.”</i></b> It was precisely a misuse of incense that had resulted in the deaths of Aaron’s sons Nadab and Abihu (Leviticus 10:1–2). Korah is making a claim on the priesthood, so Moses challenges Korah to demonstrate that he can perform a priestly task. Moses’ test does not aim to show who can <i>best</i> perform priestly services for the community. Rather, it is designed to demonstrate that God is the one who has chosen Aaron for the priesthood.

Verse 7



Verse 8



Verse 9



Verse 10

<b><i>“Levites…priesthood.”</i></b> General holiness is demanded of a congregation in which God dwells (see at 16:3). Moses here refers to two higher levels of holiness. Above the general congregation is the additional holiness of the Levites (<i>b’nei Levi)</i> who are “close to” God (<i>k-r-b</i> again; see at v. 5) and can therefore minister on behalf of the congregation at the Tabernacle. The third and the highest level of holiness is demonstrated by the additional closeness to God enjoyed exclusively by Aaron and his descendants, the priests (<i>kohanim</i>). Note that since only Aaron and his descendants are priests, Moses himself implicitly belongs among the Levites, like the rest of the house of Levi apart from his brother’s line.

Verse 11

<b><i>“it is against יהוה that you and all, your company have banded together.”</i></b> God is the one who elevated Aaron’s status beyond the other Levites; neither Aaron’s appointment as chief priest, nor the punishment that Korah receives for attempting to replace him, result from choices that Moses has made. By deferring judgment and punishment to God in the test-by-incense, Moses demonstrates that Korah’s complaint to Moses should have been addressed to God in the first place.

Verse 12

DATHAN AND ABIRAM’S MUTINY AGAINST MOSAIC LEADERSHIP (16:12–15) Dathan and Abiram criticize Moses’ leadership, blaming him for the poor conditions of the people in the wilderness and accusing him of not fulfilling his promises to them of land and possessions. As with Korah, the accusations are misplaced. Moses is responsible for neither the wilderness situation nor the choice of Aaron as high priest. The second story of rebellion begins when Moses sends for Dathan and Abiram, but they refuse to come—complaining bitterly about Moses’ leadership of the people in the wilderness.
<b><i>“We will not come!”</i></b> This translation of Dathan and Abiram’s response does not convey the subtle irony inherent in the use of the verb <i>alah</i> (“to go up”). Here they declare, “We will not come <i>up</i>”; later, they will indeed be punished by being brought <i>down</i> into the depths of the earth (vv. 31–33), never to “come up” again.

Verse 13

<b><i>“a land flowing with milk and honey.”</i></b> The rebels’ sarcastic remarks invert Moses’ promises to bring the Israelites from Egypt to a land flowing with milk and honey (Exodus 13:5; Numbers 14:8). They use the expression instead to describe Egypt as a paradise (see also Exodus 16:3).
<i><b>“to have us die.”</b></i> Literally, “to kill us.” Dathan and Abiram imply that Moses aims to cause their deaths through the harsh conditions in the wilderness (see also Exodus 16:3). Ironically, the reason for the delay in reaching the Promised Land is a similar protest in Numbers 14. There, when the people complained that God had brought them out of Egypt only to die in the wilderness (14:2), God threatened to destroy the entire congregation (14:12). Moses pleaded with God on their behalf, and God relented (14:23). Again, it is clear that the present complaint against Moses is misdirected, as Moses points out to God in the following verse, and as he will further inform the people in v. 28.
<i><b>“you would also lord it over us.”</b></i> More precisely, “you continue to act as a prince over us.” The Heb. <i>tistarer</i> is a verbal form of the noun “prince” (<i>sar</i>). This is a direct challenge to Moses’ continued leadership, based on his perceived failure to deliver on his promise of fields and vineyards in a land flowing with milk and honey (Exodus 3:8, 17; 13:5; 33:3). These words echo an earlier accusation against Moses in Exodus 2:14, when one of the Hebrews asks Moses, “Who made you a prince <i>(sar)</i> and judge over us?”

Verse 14



Verse 15

<b><i>“Pay no regard to their oblation.”</i></b> Moses asks God not to accept the rebels’ sacrificial offering, protesting that he has done nothing to deserve their accusations. This type of plea to a god or gods was common in ancient Near Eastern treaty curses and execrations, which implore the deity not to accept the offerings of anyone who either violates the terms of the treaty or who acts disrespectfully toward the king (see Malachi 2:13).

Verse 16

KORAH’S TEST (16:16–24) Having set forth the two types of challenges, one about priestly authority and the other about civic leadership, the narrative turns from Dathan and Abiram back to Korah. Korah’s entire company will undergo the test, including the 250 chieftains mentioned in 16:2, as they all attempt to offer incense alongside Moses and Aaron in front of the divine Presence at the Tent of Meeting.

Verse 17



Verse 18



Verse 19



Verse 20



Verse 21

<b><i>“Stand back from this community.”</i></b> Moses and Aaron are instructed to move away from the congregation, all of whom, it appears, are to be punished for the sins of the rebels (see 16:26 and 17:10).

Verse 22

<b><i>But they fell on their faces.</i></b> Moses had the same reaction in v. 4 when he first heard the rebels’ complaint. Earlier, it was an act of grief (see also 14:5); here, Moses and Aaron are bowing before divine authority, appealing to God for assistance, and attempting to appease God’s wrath against the innocent members of the community.
<i><b>“When one member sins, will You be wrathful with the whole community?”</b></i> Korah has included the entire community in his challenge (v. 19), and God has threatened to destroy all of them (v. 21); but Moses and Aaron ask that only the sinners be punished. This key question about theodicy, that is, God’s justice, recurs throughout the Bible. Abraham appeals to God’s justice when he asks God to not destroy the righteous along with the wicked (Genesis 18:23–25). Ezekiel articulates this concept most strongly when he asserts, “The person who commits an offense—he shall die” (Ezekiel 18:4).

Verse 23

<b><i>23–24.</i></b> God responds to Moses by now instructing the community at large to withdraw from the tents of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram; only they—and their families—will be destroyed (see at v. 27).

Verse 24



Verse 25

DATHAN AND ABIRAM’S PUNISHMENT (16:25–31) The names of Dathan and Abiram were likely inserted in v. 24 by a later hand when linking their mutiny with Korah’s. The story of Dathan and Abiram resumes in v. 25, in which Korah is not mentioned (but note the insertion of his name in v. 27, with nothing following it up).

Verse 26



Verse 27

<b><i>with their wives, their children, and their little ones.</i></b> Not only Dathan and Abiram are to be punished, but also the family as a whole. This seems to contradict Deuteronomy 24:16, which states that children are not to suffer for their parents’ actions; in addition, Ezekiel 18:4 tells us that each person is responsible for his or her own crimes. But it seems from the current passage, and a parallel passage in Joshua 7:24, that this principle applies only to laws that do not concern sacred items or places. When there has been a violation of ritual law, anyone who comes into contact with the source of the offense is tainted by it, even to the third and fourth generations (Exodus 20:5). Thus, the fact that the punishment is enacted against the entire household of each of the rebels further demonstrates that the offense is understood to be against God, and not against God’s human representatives—even though Korah, Dathan, and Abiram perceive themselves to be challenging only the authority of Moses and Aaron.

Verse 28



Verse 29



Verse 30

<b><i>“if יהוה brings about something unheard-of.”</i></b> Moses’ ability to dictate the terms of Dathan’s and Abiram’s deaths is interesting. His point is, “By this you shall know that it was יהוה who sent me to do all these things; that they are not of my own devising” (v. 28). And yet, without prompting from God, Moses announces the terms of the rebels’ deaths, bringing about a sudden earthquake that swallows up Dathan, Abiram, and their families. To the onlooking Israelites, this presumably would have appeared to be a result of Moses’ own power; and perhaps that is intended to serve the purpose of quashing potential future challenges to his authority. In fact, however, it will have the opposite effect (see 17:6–7).

Verse 31



Verse 32

KORAH’S PUNISHMENT (16:32–35) In this section the interweaving of the two stories of insurrection is particularly confusing. Later, at 17:5, Korah’s death by fire will be confirmed, but here in v. 32 it appears that “Korah’s people,” the 250 incense-offerers described in vv. 18–19, are consumed in the earthquake along with Dathan and Abiram. Reading the Hebrew closely, however, reveals the editor’s cleverness in tying together the different endings for each rebel group. In v. 35 we are told literally that “fire had gone forth” (a past perfect verb). According to the final, redacted version, the incident described in this verse, namely the burning of Korah’s incense-offering group, occurred before the earthquake swallowed them along with Dathan’s and Abiram’s households.
Thus, in vv. 18–19, Korah and his 250 companions attempted to offer incense with their fire pans at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting. God’s immediate annihilation of them is described now in v. 35. Note that Moses does not act at all here. God’s Presence appears in view of the entire community (v. 19), and a fire issues forth directly from God to consume the offenders.
The difference in the enactment of each punishment highlights the difference between the two types of rebellion. The challenge to Moses’ leadership is punished by Moses with God’s backing. This pattern reflects the overarching model in which the leader—Moses, whom God has chosen—acts on God’s behalf and behest in order to take care of the people. Conversely, God handles the challenge to priestly authority directly.

Verse 33

<b><i>Sheol.</i></b> This term for the underworld appears 65 times in the <i>Tanach.</i> The ancient Israelites believed in a shadowy post-mortem existence for all—regardless of moral virtue—in Sheol. Dathan, Abiram, and their households are brought down alive to the land of the dead.

Verse 1

<i>The Aftermath</i> (17:1–28)
Further accusations against Moses and Aaron follow, as the community holds them responsible for the deaths of the rebels. Clearly, the people have missed the point of the earlier punishments, and God acts immediately by sending a plague. Moses instructs Aaron to quickly make an expiation offering on behalf of the people to avert further destruction by God, and the plague is stopped after 14, 700 deaths.
God decides to further establish Aaron’s supremacy, and his divine backing, by demanding that the staff of each tribal leader be placed in the Tent of Meeting. Aaron’s staff bears fruit, proving that God has chosen the house of Aaron alone as priests.
TRANSFORMATION OF THE FIRE PANS (17:1–5)
Paradoxically and inexplicably, the copper fire pans that Korah and his companions used are rendered holy, either by the act of having been offered to God improperly or by the holy fire that consumed their bearers. The fire pans are to become a visible warning intended to stop those who would presume the powers of the priesthood and the ability to approach God at the Tabernacle.

Verse 5

<b><i>It was to be a reminder to the Israelites.</i></b> The same Hebrew terms are used to describe the function of the <i>t’fillin</i> (Exodus 13:9) and the rainbow at the end of the flood story (Genesis 9:12–17). They refer to an action or an object that is symbolically, rather than intrinsically, significant.

Verse 6

MORE REBELLION (17:6–7) Once again, the congregation misses the point. Not only do they focus on Moses and Aaron instead of on God, but also they blame their human leaders for causing the deaths of the rebels, although Moses had taken pains to demonstrate that both his authority, and the punishments wrought, came from God.
<b><i>“יהוה’s people.”</i></b> In referring to the human leaders in this way, the community claims them as their own—while ironically placing them in opposition to God.

Verse 7



Verse 8

PLAGUE AND EXPIATION (17:8–15) As in the incineration of Korah and his company (16:35), this punishment comes directly from God. As proof, the human leaders intervene on behalf of the community to save them from God’s wrath, demonstrating both that God is the one who has determined the punishment and enacted it, and that they are God’s legitimate human representatives.

Verse 9

<b><i>9–10.</i></b> God’s response compounds the bitter irony: the congregation accuses Moses and Aaron of killing God’s people (see at v. 6), so now God threatens to kill the people for their accusations of Moses and Aaron.

Verse 10



Verse 11

<b><i>11–13.</i></b> The irony culminates when Moses and Aaron save the people from God’s wrath and the plague that follows—and they do so through the proper and sanctioned burning of incense to God.

Verse 16

AARON’S BUDDING ROD (17:16–28) God establishes another test to demonstrate the election of the House of Aaron to the priesthood. This time the miracle requires no human intercession and thus the people should perceive it as wholly divine in nature—in order, God says, to “rid Myself of the incessant mutterings…against [Moses and Aaron]” (v. 20). On the earlier role of Aaron’s rod in Egypt and its import, see at Exodus 7:9; on almonds, see <i>Vayak’heil,</i> Contemporary Reflection.

Chapter 18



Verse 1

<i>Priestly Responsibilities</i> (18:1–32)
Like 8:5–26, this unit discusses the special duties of the Aaronite priests relative to the Levites. Having addressed challenges to the priesthood and its hierarchy, the narrative turns to rules that illustrate and sustain the correct ritual system. This text makes it clear that with duties come privileges. For their services to God on behalf of the people, the priests and Levites are to be supported by the community via a system of gifts and tithes.
PRIESTS AND LEVITES (18:1–7)
The priests, that is, the men from the family of Aaron, are responsible for preserving the purity of the sanctuary and its contents. The Levites are to have access only to the outer areas of the sanctuary. (Exodus 38:8 mentions women who are serving at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting. It is not clear whether that fleeting depiction conflicts with the current instructions.)
<b><i>to Aaron.</i></b> God speaks directly to him, rather than through Moses. This occurs in only one other place in the Torah: Leviticus 10:8.
<i><b>you…shall bear any guilt.</b></i> God’s introduction to the instructions here emphasizes that it is on Aaron and his descendants that God is placing the burden of responsibility for maintaining the sanctity of the Tabernacle.

Verse 2

<b><i>to be attached to you.</i></b> Heb. <i>yillavu</i>, which is a verbal form of the noun “Levite.” Originally, the term “Levite” may have referred to someone attached to the sacred in order to perform rituals—that is, a priest. However, here the term refers to those who are attached to the preists in order to serve them. The book of Numbers, with its privileging of priests, thus designates Levites as secondary clergy whose duties are to assist the priestly descendants of Aaron. (Deuteronomy presents a different understanding; see at Deuteronomy 18:1.)

GIFTS (18:8–20)

Verse 9

<b><i>from the most holy sacrifices.</i></b> The Bible’s sacrificial laws divide priestly portions into two types, “most holy” and “holy,” which are designated for consumption accordingly, by males in the sacred precinct and by their female relatives at home (see Ezekiel 44:29–30). “Most holy” includes the parts of the purgation and reparation offerings that are not burnt (see Leviticus 6:1–7:10).

Verse 10

<b><i>only males may eat them.</i></b> The “most holy” portions from the meal, purgation, and reparation offerings are to be consumed only by the male priests. See also at Leviticus 6:11 for a discussion of such a phrase and its implications.

Verse 11

 <i><b>to you</b></i> [<b><i>and your wives</i></b>]…<i><b>and to the daughters that are with you.</b></i> Women in priestly families could share heave offerings and first fruits. The explicit mention of daughters, rather than wives or women, may be necessary in light of the shifting position of a daughter within a household, after she marries. (See <i>Tzav,</i> Another View; and at Leviticus 21:12–13 for rules concerning a priest’s daughter.) The mention of wives in this translation reflects the understanding that the “you” here refers to the household’s primary couple, who runs the household (see <i>Mishpatim,</i> Another View).

Verse 19

<b><i>everlasting covenant of salt.</i></b> The expression “covenant of salt” occurs in the Bible only here and in II Chronicles 13:5. Due to salt’s preservative qualities, many interpreters (including Rashi) construe its mention here as a symbol of permanence. Perhaps this is why Leviticus 2:13 commands that the Israelites season every grain offering with salt. To commemorate this practice in the absence of sacrificial offerings, it is a custom to this day to sprinkle salt on the bread of the Sabbath meal.

Verse 20



Verse 21

TITHES (18:21–32) Laws concerning tithes are also detailed in Leviticus 27:30–32 and Deuteronomy 12:17–19; 14:22–29. For their service, Levites are to be compensated with tithes, although they in turn have to donate one-tenth of the tithes they collect to the priests. This addition to the law in Leviticus 27 further distinguishes the status of Levites from that of priests; like other Israelites, the Levites also must themselves pay tithes, while priests are exempt.

Chapter 19



Verse 1

<i>The “Red Cow” Ritual after Contact with a Corpse</i> (19:1–22)
The parashah begins with God’s instructions for creating a water-based mixture called “water of <i>niddah</i> (lustration).” The reader learns only in v. 9 that the mixture is an antidote for specific contaminations that trigger the need for purification. These include a corpse, human bones, or a grave. Contamination may occur inside a tent or out in the open field. Such contact is presented as a real and present danger, requiring an immediate antidote.
INSTRUCTIONS FOR HANDLING THE RED COW (19:1–10) The preparations of the “water of lustration” begin with a series of steps performed by Eleazar, Aaron’s son. The officiant takes the red cow outside the camp, slaughters it, and then purifies those involved. The entire procedure is considered highly impure (<i>tamei</i>).

Verse 2

<b><i>red.</i></b> This color reinforces the use of blood in aid of purification (see at Leviticus 1:6).
<i><b>cow.</b></i> The present offering, which is intended for individual use, calls for a female of the herd (Jacob Milgrom, <i>Numbers,</i> 1990, pp. 437–47).
<i><b>without blemish.</b></i> Heb. <i>t’mimah,</i> which could also be translated as “faultless,” signals that the animal is suitable for sacrifice (see Leviticus 14:10) and is “whole or complete” (Leviticus 3:9).

Verse 3

<b><i>outside the camp.</i></b> Priestly texts are vigilant concerning boundaries. This unit deals repeatedly with such delineations: outside and inside the camp, as well as inside a tent, and out in an open field. The Israelite priestly outlook emphasizes containment and order in the face of the chaos and unpredictability of death.

Verse 4

<b><i>take some of its blood.</i></b> In this case, the priest sprinkles the blood at the front of the Tent of Meeting. At other times, the priest sprinkles blood directly on the altar. Jacob Milgrom draws an analogy between sacrificial blood and a cleansing agent such as detergent (<i>Numbers</i>, 1990, p. 439; see also at Leviticus 1:6).
Stephen Geller offers a trenchant summation of blood’s use both as a sign of sinfulness and its opposite—an agent of creative purification (“Blood Cult,” 1992, pp. 97–124). As he points out, blood signals loss of life, including murder; for instance, the blood of Abel testifies that Cain murdered him (Genesis 4:10). But blood also symbolizes life itself; therefore, according to the Bible, God has forbidden humans to eat flesh without first draining its blood (Genesis 9:4–6). Blood saves Israel from death in Exodus 12:13. Paradoxically, in Leviticus 12, after the woman gives birth she remains in a state of “blood purification” that marks the arrival of new life; but in Leviticus 15, blood of the menstruating woman represents the missed opportunity of conception. Both conditions make a woman temporarily impure.
These symbolic dimensions of blood are captured in the ritual of the red cow. An actual encounter with death requires that one be washed with a watery mixture containing the ashes of incinerated blood. The mixture is acquired through an animal’s death in a ceremony of purifying renewal that allows one to return to the community of the living.

Verse 5

<b><i>its hide, flesh, and blood.</i></b> Every part of the animal is to be used. While the present ritual is unusual in adding the blood of the sacrifice to the mixture, in other respects it follows priestly precedent (as in Leviticus 4:12).

Verse 6

<b><i>cedar wood hyssop, and crimson stuff.</i></b> In Exodus 12:22, God ordered the Israelites to dip hyssop into blood to smear on their doorposts, thus associating hyssop with the life-saving dimension of blood. “Crimson stuff” (dyed yarn) is used in Exodus 36:8, 35, 37 as part of the material in the Tabernacle, and in Exodus 39:1–2 as part of the sacred vestments of the high priest. Thus these materials are already connected with the saving of life, a sacred site, and a religious leader, marking them as powerful and efficacious—which also explains their present use. All three materials are also used in the purification rituals for <i>tzaraat</i> (see Leviticus 14).

Verse 7



Verse 8

<b><i>The one who performed the burning.</i></b> [Both here and in the next verse, the probable reference is to a (male) priest or Levite; on the other hand, these may have been the kinds of tasks in which an Israelite sanctuary’s female staff could be expected to take part, if there were indeed such workers. (On women’s working at the sanctuary, see at Exodus 38:8.) Possibly gender is not an issue in the text at this point, which is why the translation is couched in gender-neutral terms. —<i>Ed</i>.]

Verse 9

<b><i>Another party who is pure.</i></b> Those involved in burning the cow and in collecting the ashes, including the priest, become impure (<i>tamei</i>) until evening. A person who is pure (<i>tahor</i>) deposits the ashes in a pure site. The terms <i>tamei</i> and <i>tahor,</i> which priestly texts almost always juxtapose to each other, make their appearance together in Numbers 19. Their frequent use in this passage suggests their importance as the focus of the discussion.
The priestly system functions through a series of opposites—purity and impurity, holiness and unholiness, life and death—that mimic God’s creation of the world in Genesis 1 through the imposition of an orderly plan for the earth based on distinct categories. In the face of disorder and death, the priestly legislation strives to restore such a state of order.
<i><b>water of lustration…for purgation.</b></i> The term for lustration, <i>niddah,</i> illustrates the way in which a word may take on contradictory meanings in different biblical traditions. Later commentary has conflated those meanings and woefully misunderstood them.
The noun <i>niddah</i> derives from the root <i>n-d-d</i> “to depart, flee, wander”; the causative use of the root means “to chase away, put aside,” related to the Akkadian cognate, “to throw, cast down.” Jacob Milgrom understands <i>niddah</i> as having originally referred to the menstrual blood, which was discharged or eliminated. <i>Niddah</i> came to refer to the menstruant herself, “for she too was ‘discharged’ and ‘excluded’ from her society not by being kept at arm’s length from others but, in many communities, by being banished to and quarantined in separate quarters” <i>(Leviticus 1–16,</i> 1991, p. 745). <i>Niddah</i> occurs 29 times in the <i>Tanach,</i> conveying at least three possible meanings: menstrual impurity (the most frequent meaning), indecency, and purification (the present case).
<i>Niddah</i> is used in Leviticus 12 and 15 matter-of-factly, in the midst of details concerning states of impurity for males as well as females, to designate the flow of blood during menstruation. It does not convey a negative attitude toward a menstruating woman. In Leviticus 20:21, however, the term takes on a more negative meaning as “indecency” when used in reference to when a man marries his brother’s wife. Milgrom captures the distinction between these texts, explaining that in Leviticus 12 and 15 “the word <i>niddah</i> is a technical term for menstrual discharge”; yet in Leviticus 20 and derivative literature, “it becomes a metaphor for impurity, indecency or disgrace that stems from moral rather than physical causes” (<i>Leviticus 1–16,</i> p. 744).
A prime example of the derivative literature is Ezekiel 36:17, where the prophet uses the term in an explicitly degrading sense, comparing Israel’s defilement of the land to a menstruating woman. Reading the continuation of this passage, Jonathan Klawans suggests that the menstruating woman in Ezekiel is an apt image since she “can cleanse herself quickly and easily from her ritual impurity, so too will God purify the people from the defiling force of their sins” (<i>Impurity and Sin in Ancient Judaism,</i> 2000, p. 31). However, one can read it in a more blatantly pejorative way, and legitimately conclude that Ezekiel resorts to the image in order to impugn Israel severely (see also Ezekiel 7:19; 18:6; 22:10).
Similarly, Ezra 9:11 borrows the analogy of the menstruating woman to emphasize that the land had been defiled by its inhabitants’ abominations. In II Chronicles 29:5, <i>niddah</i> is used in contradistinction to holiness. Nevertheless, none of these increasingly negative uses of <i>niddah</i> explains its use in Numbers 19.
In the present verse, <i>niddah</i> conveys the nuance found in the term’s original meaning—being set apart—since the watery mixture is to remain <i>outside</i> the camp. Yet through purification it restores the individual to her or his proper place <i>within</i> the camp. Zechariah 13:1 highlights that sense of restoration. The prophet envisions the day on which God will vindicate Jerusalem: “On that day a fountain opened to the…inhabitants of Jerusalem for cleansing [<i>chatat</i>] and for sprinkling [<i>niddah</i>].” Thus, both that oracle and the present verse use <i>niddah</i> in close connection to <i>chatat.</i> In both texts <i>niddah</i> is understood not as defiling or abhorrent, but as its opposite, ensuring purification. Both passages suggest a moment of restoration and joyous relief.

Verse 10



Verse 11

<b><i>Those.</i></b> [In this paragraph, the Hebrew is couched in the singular but is impersonal. The translator found nothing in the Bible or ancient Near Eastern cultures to imply that women would be excluded from consideration in this ritual law. So that the gender-neutral sense is clear in translation, the English is phrased in the plural. —<i>Ed</i>.]
RITUALS AFTER CONTACT WITH A CORPSE, HUMAN BONES, OR A GRAVE (19:11–22) A person who touches or is exposed to the dead becomes contaminated (ritually impure). Verses 11–13 set up the general principle: the contaminated individual remains so for seven days. The individual must undergo purification on the third day and then becomes pure on the seventh. Although the individual is referred to as male, v. 14 states that whoever enters a tent in which someone has died faces contamination. Surely a woman runs the same risk of encountering the dead as a man. Yet, as in many other ritual procedures, the woman goes unmentioned. Given the inclusive use of the masculine pronoun elsewhere in priestly writings, one can conclude that these laws apply to women as well.
A contaminated individual who fails to purify herself or himself remains impure and will defile the Tabernacle. To discourage such an outcome, the negligent individual is threatened with one of the most severe penalties possible in ancient Israelite law: <i>kareit</i> or excommunication. The prominence and intermingling of the words for purity (twice) and impurity (four times) along with purification (three times) urgently draw attention to maintaining the Tabernacle in its required state of purity—so that God remains in the midst of Israel.

Verse 16



Verse 17

<b><i>fresh water.</i></b> In this procedure of purification, “living water” (as in Genesis 26:19) is added to the ashes, mixed together, and sprinkled on the contaminated tent, vessels, and person. Leviticus 14:5 and 50 cite “living water” as part of the rituals to purify a <i>m’tzora</i> (the so-called leper, that is, a person afflicted with <i>tzaraat</i>) or a similarly afflicted house (along with the three substances cited in 19:6). Close connections exist between the present ritual of purification and that found in Leviticus, strengthening the claims that both texts are priestly, and that death and <i>tzaraat</i> are intertwined in the priestly imagination. (See further the introduction to Leviticus 14.)

Verse 18



Verse 19



Verse 20

<b><i>cut off from the congregation.</i></b> The instructions repeat the warning declared in v. 13, highlighting the threat to Israel: the possible defilement of the sanctuary and the banishment of God from their midst. (On being “cut off,” see at Numbers 15:30.)

Chapter 20



Verse 1

<i>The Deaths of Miriam and Aaron</i> (20:1–29)
The ritual of purification is immediately relevant since Miriam now dies. Perhaps as a result of her death, Moses and Aaron behave at Meribah in such a way as to be denied entry into the Promised Land. Aaron dies at the end of the unit, so the deaths of Moses’ siblings bracket a unit that also recounts unsuccessful negotiations with the King of Edom.
Death reports in the Bible are highly political. Here, the politics of gender appear to play a role in the greater length and quantity of details reported of Aaron’s death versus that of his sister, Miriam. Through the shaping of their deaths in Numbers 20, the biblical writer reinforces and strengthens the status of Aaron at the expense of his sister. However, we readers are free to revise that opinion.
MIRIAM’S DEATH (20:1)
In one brief verse—astonishing in its terseness—we learn of the death of Miriam.
Miriam remains an enigmatic figure. Unlike the majority of other women in the <i>Tanach</i> (the Hebrew Bible), her reputation does not rest on being someone’s mother or wife. She has an independent existence. The <i>Tanach</i> even accords her the title of “prophet” (Exodus 15:20). That she is mentioned as late as the book of Chronicles testifies to “the tenacity of her place in Israel’s memory” (Rita J. Burns, <i>Has the Lord Indeed Spoken Only Through Moses?,</i> 1987, pp. 92, 129). Rita Burns suggests that Miriam’s name derives from the Egyptian <i>mry,</i> meaning “beloved” (Burns, p. 10).
In spite of tantalizing hints like these, we see her fleetingly in powerful and contradictory images: joyously leading the women in song at God’s deliverance of Israel from the Sea (Exodus 15), or punished by God with “snow-white <i>tzaraat</i>” after challenging Moses’ exclusive leadership (Numbers 12). These fragmented views of Miriam suggest a more elaborate tradition that has not been preserved. Perhaps she held such an established reputation as a leader of Israel that she threatened the interests represented by the Torah’s later editors, and therefore Numbers 12 extinguishes her voice. Unlike Moses and Aaron, Miriam has no successor.
Nonetheless, the details of Miriam’s death in this verse—the first new moon, the place of her burial, especially the notice that she is buried—suggest that she is a leader of significant import in the Torah. After all, the death of most characters in the Bible receives no notice. This is true especially of women; elsewhere the Torah records the deaths only of Sarah (Genesis 23:2), Rachel (35:19), and Rebekah’s nurse, Deborah (35:8). In addition, Miriam’s death is to be followed by that of her brothers, which cannot be coincidence. The three die, each in turn, on the last three stops of the journey.
In her extensive study of Miriam, Burns draws the following conclusion: “Six of the seven…texts which mention her represent her as a leader. In her initial [named] appearance in the narratives (Exodus 15:20–21), Miriam officiates at a celebration of the foundational event of Hebrew religion…. In designating Miriam as ‘sister’ of Aaron (Exodus 15:20) and of Aaron and Moses (Numbers 26:59; I Chronicles 5:29) the biblical writers use kinship terminology to express Miriam’s parallel status in religious leadership vis-à-vis that of the two other leading figures in the wilderness…. Micah 6:4…[says] that Miriam (along with Moses and Aaron) was divinely commissioned as a leader in the wilderness” (Burns, p. 121).

Verse 2

MOSES AND AARON PUNISHED: FATEFUL INCIDENT AT MERIBAH (20:2–13)
Following closely on the heels of Miriam’s death, God now informs Aaron and Moses of their impending deaths. In contrast to Miriam’s death, the deaths of the brothers are explicitly considered a punishment.
<b><i>The community.</i></b> Verses 1 and 2 mention “the Israelites,” “the people,” and a verbal form of “joined” which also appears in the unit as “community.” The interweaving of these terms focuses on Israel as a collective in all its manifestations. Everyone is implicated in the events of the journey; we learn that even the fates of Moses and Aaron connect irretrievably to that of Israel.
<i><b>without water.</b></i> Is the timing of the present complaint for water significant? Miriam is closely associated with water: she observes the deliverance of Moses from drowning in the Nile (Exodus 2:1–9), and she celebrates with him at the sea (Exodus 15:20–21). Right before she dies, new ritual instructions require “water of lustration” that is made from “living water” (Numbers 19). And now, immediately after Miriam’s death, the people desperately cry for water. Because the two episodes follow each other sequentially, the Rabbis explicitly connect Miriam’s death to the lack of water. The linkage suggested to the midrashic imagination that she was the source of the water now gone.

Verse 3

<b><i>3–5.</i></b> Israel’s complaint resembles that of Numbers 14, in which the people bitterly complain about leaving Egypt only to die in the wilderness (see also Exodus 16:3). Denied entry to Canaan due to their lack of belief in God’s power to ensure its conquest, they now pine after the food of that promised land: grain, figs, vines, and pomegranates.

Verse 6



Verse 7



Verse 8

<b><i>“order the rock to yield its water.”</i></b> In a parallel episode in Exodus 17:5–6, God instructs Moses to use his rod <i>to strike</i> the rock to release its water. This time, God tells Moses <i>to speak</i> to the rock before their eyes (so that the people see him do so and not just hear the words) to release its water.

Verse 9



Verse 10

<b><i>“rebels.”</i></b> Heb. <i>morim.</i> In frustration, Moses addresses the Israelites with a term that echoes Miriam’s name (see Another View).

Verse 11

<b><i>struck the rock twice.</i></b> Instead of speaking to it (v. 8).

Verse 12

<b><i>12–13.</i></b> These verses describe God’s punishment of Moses and Aaron. What wrong could Moses and Aaron have committed severe enough to warrant God’s punishment after years of loyal service? The laconic quality of the narrative has provoked thousands of years of interpretation in an attempt to identify their misdeed. [Because Moses’ and Aaron’s “crime” here is not self-evident, contemporary scholars, like early rabbinic interpreters, have offered a wide range of possible explanations in addition to the one proposed here. Some suggest that the “crime” concerns striking the rock: Moses struck the rock instead of speaking to it, or perhaps he violated God’s instructions by striking it twice instead of once. Others suggest that God is angry because the incident discloses problematic aspects of Moses’ character as a leader: Moses lost his temper in an inappropriate manner. Still others suggest that Moses’ language was wrong: By phrasing his words as a question (v. 10), he could have been misunderstood as doubting God; by saying “shall we get water for you” (v. 10), he positioned himself and Aaron—instead of God—as the chief actors; or by calling the people “rebels” he denigrated them. —<i>Ed</i>.]
<b><i>“affirm…sanctity.”</i></b> The verbal root <i>k-d-sh</i> echoes the place name Kadesh, returning the audience to v. 1 and the death of Miriam. Her death haunts this literary unit.
<i><b>“in the sight of the Israelite people.”</b></i> The emphasis on sight—as in v. 8, God mentions literally the “eyes” of Israel—suggests that by not following the letter of God’s instructions in the sight of Israel, Moses provides an example that would be fatal to Israel if they followed him.
<i><b>“the land that I have given them.”</b></i> To “them”—and not to “you.” God’s ultimate concern is a divine relationship with the people Israel, not with any one leader.

Verse 13

<b><i>Waters of Meribah.</i></b> Heb. <i>mei m’rivah,</i> which echoes the “water of lustration” and “fresh water” (both terms being plural in the literal Hebrew) in Numbers 19. In contrast to the hopefulness of the ritual of purification and the renewal offered by it, Israel is again plunged into a dark moment in its journey. The term also picks up on the verb “quarreled” <i>(vayarev)</i> in 20:3.

Verse 14

FAILED NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE KING OF EDOM (20:14–21) Seemingly undeterred, Moses faces the next challenge of the journey as he attempts to negotiate safe passage through Edom. Not succeeding, Moses turns away without a fight.

Verse 23



Verse 24

<b><i>“Let Aaron be gathered to his kin.”</i></b> This phrase is found in the Torah only in connection with the deaths of six characters, all of whom are male leaders: Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, and Aaron.

Verse 1

<i>Toward the Journey’s End</i>
ITINERARIES AND SONGS, NEGOTIATIONS AND BATTLES (21:1–22:1)
This unit begins by reporting on a successful battle (vv. 1–3), and in so doing introduces the unit’s most important topic: the positive change in Israel’s fortune. After yet another episode of complaint (vv. 4–9), a set of itineraries in vv. 10–20 bracket obscure materials: the “Book of the Wars of יהוה” (v. 14) and a poem celebrating the discovery of water (v. 17). An account of two successful battles follows (21:21–22:1), including an apparently ancient victory song (vv. 27–30).
Several topics link Numbers 20 and 21, including parallel episodes of complaint, the motif of water, and negotiations with foreign kings. Yet the discovery of water and the successful battles of Numbers 21 serve to underline a crucial difference: the fortunes of Israel have now decidedly improved for the new generation.
SUCCESSFUL BATTLE AGAINST THE KING OF ARAD (21:1–3)
Israel will be victorious in all subsequent battles on the way to the Promised Land. The use of the name Hormah cleverly signals the change in their fortunes. Earlier, Israel received a “shattering blow” at Hormah (14:45); here, after the deaths of almost all of the earlier generation, Israel emerges victorious.

<b><i>seraph serpents.</i></b> In the ancient world, snakes often symbolized fertility and healing, since they shed their skins only to grow new ones repeatedly in a cycle of destruction and rebirth. In the <i>Tanach,</i> the combination of <i>seraph</i> and “serpent” also occurs in Deuteronomy 8:15; in both cases, the creatures signal terror and cruelty as part of the wilderness setting. Since they are deadly, only God’s interventions allow the people to survive.

Verse 7

<b><i>“We sinned by speaking.”</i></b> For the first time, the people acknowledge the effects of their speech and its contaminating influence on their collective fate.
<i><b>And Moses interceded for the people.</b></i> In spite of their repeated failures, Moses advocates to God on behalf of the people, as he does following the Golden Calf and the incident with the scouts (Exodus 32:31–32; Numbers 14:5–19).

Verse 8



Verse 9

<b><i>anyone who looked at the copper serpent would recover.</i></b> Healing and new life follow death yet again in this parashah, much as the ritual of the healing water in Numbers 19 responds to the pervasiveness of death with purifying restoration. The snake as a symbol of both destruction and rebirth brilliantly represents the movement between death and life so prevalent in the narrative of the wilderness journey.

Verse 10

ITINERARY OF TRAVELS AND ISRAEL’S SONG (21:10–20) Itineraries locate the journey along specific stops, lending an air of authenticity to the wilderness wanderings. Reference to an outside source long lost to Israel, “the Book of the Wars of יהוה,” further suggests a documented past.

Now, as part of the positive tone of Numbers 21, the well assuages the people’s thirst, leading to an outpouring of grateful and celebratory song. The Rabbis later trace both the well and the song back to Miriam, which is fitting since v. 17 begins with a phrase that parallels the lead-in to the Song at the Sea in Exodus 15:1. (For the suggestion that the Song at the Sea should be attributed to Miriam, see at Exodus 15:1–19.)

SUCCESSFUL POLITICAL NEGOTIATIONS AND MILITARY VICTORIES (21:21–22:1) The unsuccessful petition made by Moses to cross the territory of Edom in 20:14–21 is now followed in 21:21–25 by the successful possession by the Israelites of the land of the Amorites. Previously Moses, who was near to his own death, failed; now Israel succeeds.

Verse 25

<b><i>and all its dependencies.</i></b> Literally, “all its daughters.” The <i>Tanach</i> uses terms of female relations to describe a walled city as a “mother” and an open village as a “daughter.” The “mother” city (since walled) is better protected than her daughter from attack. As F. S. Frick observes, these female terms reflect and reinforce a pattern of domestic relations as well as societal conceptions of the strengths and weaknesses of a female at different points in her life: “Mothers had considerable authority over their daughters—hence the analogy of a walled mother-city exerting control of the unwalled. Just as a mother had major responsibilities in caring for her children, so the city provided protection for its people…. The fundamental awareness of maternal care permeates the concept of cities as female” (“Mother/Daughter as Territory,” in <i>Women in Scripture,</i> 2000, pp. 532–33).

Verse 1



Verse 2

<i>Balak Hires Balaam to Curse Israel</i> (22:2–41)
The main part of this Torah portion consists of the pericope about Balak and Balaam. The story fits well with other events of the wilderness experience in the sense that it recounts another link in what seems to be an endless chain of obstacles to Israel’s entrance into Canaan. It begins when the Moabite king, Balak, seeks to hire the seer Balaam to curse Israel to oblivion. The notion that cursing is an efficacious means of subduing one’s enemy was well accepted in antiquity. Certain Egyptian texts composed in the early 2nd millennium <small>B.C.E.</small> exemplify that practice; these “Execration Texts” are smashed ceramic vessels and figurines inscribed with curses directed at Egypt’s enemies, including the rulers of Canaanite cities. Balaam’s role as a prophet and diviner likewise fits with other known examples from Mesopotamia, also from the early second millennium.
The material about Balak and Balaam seems to be an independent composition. Its narrative and poetry probably originated in a different scribal circle than those associated with other portions of Numbers.
Evidence indicates that the biblical composition is related to the non-biblical tradition attested in a wall inscription found at Deir Alla, a site east of the Jordan River. The inscription, written in a language close to Aramaic and dated to the early 8th century <small>B.C.E</small>., records the night visions of a seer named Balaam son of Beor. That Balaam is credited with saving his people and the land from perpetual darkness by his use of oracles and exorcism. Apparently, his powers reversed the edict of a group of troublemaking deities and freed the goddess Shagar-and-Ishtar (a local version of the Mesopotamian high goddess Ishtar), whom those deities had imprisoned and forced to comply with their evil directives. It is unclear whether Balaam was a legendary character of antiquity, or a real person of some fame in the region. At any rate, the talents of that Balaam are precisely what the Moabite king, Balak, is looking for in the biblical account.
Whether legendary or historical, the Balaam story was clearly known in the 8th century (the date of the Deir Alla texts). An unanswered question is: were these traditions already circulating in Israel’s early settlement period (12th century), or did a later biblical writer cast them into the historical memory of that period?
BALAK’S INVITATION TO BALAAM (22:2–21)
Having witnessed Israel’s destructive power in her recent encounter with the Amorites (21:21–32), Balak seeks to engage the prophet Balaam, apparently because of Balaam’s reputation as a seer who can effectuate curses. Balaam refuses to come, after having consulted with the Israelite God and been warned not to curse the people that God has blessed. Balak ignores Balaam’s initial refusal and sends additional dignitaries tempting Balaam with promises of riches. With God’s approval, Balaam agrees to go, but only to prophesy God’s message.
The Bible gives conflicting reports of Balaam’s intentions, apparently due to inconsistent pre-biblical traditions. The account here presents Balaam in a positive light. His words and actions are bound to the will of Israel’s God. Likewise, the 8th-century prophet Micah views Balaam favorably (Micah 6:5). In contrast, in Deuteronomy (23:4–7) and Joshua (24:9–10), it is God who reverses Balaam’s actual intent; and another narrative in Numbers (31:16) blames Balaam for Israel’s apostasy at Baal-peor.

Verse 3



Verse 4



Verse 5

<b><i>Balaam son of Beor.</i></b> The seer of the Deir Alla inscription (see the unit introduction, above) bears the same name and patronymic.

Verse 6



Verse 7

<b><i>elders.</i></b> [Heb. <i>z’kenim,</i> a plural noun that refers to social status. Given what we know about the ancient Near East, the presence of women among a given group of elders is unlikely, yet it cannot be entirely excluded. For instance, II Samuel 20:15–22 depicts an Israelite woman of apparently special status who fills the role that we would expect an elder to play: she represents her town in emergency negotiations with a hostile army commander. Described as an <i>ishah chachamah</i> (literally “wise woman”) and unnamed, she says of herself, “I am one of those who seek the welfare of the faithful in Israel.” The commander then treats her as having an elder’s authority. Claudia Camp suggests that the story “attests to what must have been a regularized public role for women, at least through the early period of the Israelite monarchy” (<i>Women in Scripture,</i> 2000, p. 267; see also Tikva Frymer-Kensky, <i>Reading the Women of the Bible,</i> 2002, pp. 58–61). —<i>Ed.</i>] <i><b>divination.</b></i> Heb. <i>kesem</i> (plural in this verse) refers to the taking of omens, a practice popular in the ancient Near East. Most likely these elders were professional diviners. Professional diviners who served at court are widely known from the ancient Near East. Divination was regarded as a legitimate “science” in antiquity. The Bible condemns it as abhorrent to God (see Deuteronomy 18:10–11, 14), implying that control of natural forces and events are God’s dominion. On Israel’s practice of certain types of divination and women’s role in it, see further at Leviticus 19:31, 20:6, and 20:27.

Verse 21

<b><i>ass.</i></b> Heb. <i>aton</i> refers specifically to a jenny (she-donkey). [The Bible mentions three women of means as riding on donkeys. The wealthy woman of Shunem rides a jenny when she hurries to get help for her son (II Kings 4:22–24). The text is not sex-specific with regard to the other women’s mounts (Achsah in Joshua 15:18 and Judges 1:14; Abigail in I Samuel 25:20, 42). —<i>Ed.</i>]

Verse 22

THE STORY OF THE TALKING SHE-DONKEY (22:22–35) This tale of Balaam and the jenny—which breaks the action of the main narrative—contradicts the more favorable view of Balaam expressed by the main story; this episode apparently derives from a different tradition. In this fable, in which an animal speaks, God is angry with the seer and depicts the donkey as the actual visionary. Balaam becomes the object of mockery, being blind to the divine will that only the jenny sees. Thus the usual biblical roles of humans and animals are reversed.
Speaking animals of various kinds, including equids (horses and donkeys), are known from other ancient Near Eastern literary sources.
Perhaps significant is the fact that the donkey is female (see above at v. 21). Her role as the insightful one of the pair is reminiscent of the biblical notion of Lady Wisdom (especially in Proverbs 8–9). Perhaps, however, the story is merely suggesting that even a female donkey, the lowliest of the low animals, is more perceptive than Balaam.
<b><i>angel.</i></b> The Hebrew word for “angel” and “messenger” is the same.
<i><b>as an adversary.</b></i> Heb. <i>satan,</i> a term that is used here attributively (as in I Samuel 29:4, where Philistines worry that David “may become our <i>satan</i> [adversary] in battle”). When personified (Job 1:6–12; I Chronicles 21:1), <i>satan</i> refers to a divine being who answers to God. In Job, the adversary functions as a kind of prosecutor in God’s court. (The concept of Satan as God’s adversary is a post-biblical development.)

Verse 23

<b><i>when the ass caught sight.</i></b> The jenny, not the seer, is the one who sees their obstacle. Balaam is unaware of the danger.

Verse 24



Verse 25

<b><i>The ass, seeing the angel.</i></b> Apparently, God’s angel is revealed only to the animal. The seer, who is clearly blind to the ongoing events, is being mocked, perhaps in keeping with his doomed mission.

Verse 26



Verse 27

 Balaam, totally unaware of the situation, beats the ass for being insubordinate. He is about to learn that God’s will can be realized even through the meekest of creatures, and that his status and reputation do not guarantee success if Israel’s God opposes it.

Verse 28

 <b>יהוה <i>opened the ass’s mouth.</i></b> God is clearly in control, giving speech even to a donkey in order to make the divine will known. This jenny, however, does more than speak. In a comic twist, she sees what Balaam the seer cannot. She is perceptive, a gift attributed to the wise woman (see the Woman of Valor in Proverbs 31) and more generally to Lady Wisdom (Proverbs 8 and 9).

Verse 29



Verse 30



Verse 31



Verse 32



Verse 33

<b><i>“you…I should have killed, while sparing her.”</i></b> It is unclear whether the anger is actually a reaction to Balaam’s ill treatment of his she-donkey or to Balaam’s refusal in this episode to heed God’s warning.

Verse 34



Verse 35



Verse 36

BALAAM’S ARRIVAL IN MOAB (22:36–41) The account interrupted by the tale of the jenny continues here. After arriving in Moab, Balak, playing the proper host, offers a sacrifice of well-being as a gesture of welcome; it is eaten by Balaam and his entourage.

Chapter 23



Verse 1

<i>Balaam’s Oracles and Balak’s Responses</i> (23:1–24:25)
This unit features the reports about four oracles uttered by Balaam. It repeatedly reminds the reader that Balaam’s words are God’s message, not his own. The first three reports follow the same pattern: Balaam prepares to divine; this is followed by the oracle itself (in poetic form), concluding with Balak’s (frustrated) reaction to the oracle. The fourth oracle breaks the pattern and ends with Balaam’s returning home. The first oracle contains a brief summary of the introductory narrative (Numbers 22), hinting that originally the poems may have existed independently of the story. The poetic form of Balaam’s oracles contrasts with the surrounding narratives. The poetry seems to lend authority to the narrative, and its composition may actually be older in time than the narrative.
BALAAM’S FIRST ORACLE AND BALAK’S RESPONSE (23:1–12)
Before seeking omens and revelation, Balaam instructs Balak to sacrifice seven bulls and seven rams. In the biblical world, the number seven often signals completeness or perfection (see Genesis 1:1–2:4). Balak’s offerings indeed elicit the Deity’s message. But instead of curses from Balaam, blessings for Israel come forth.

Verse 2



Verse 3

<b><i>“grant me a manifestation.”</i></b> The verbal root <i>k-r-h</i> means “to encounter occasionally,” and its use here and in v. 4 may reflect the unusual, occasional circumstance in which Israel’s God communicates with a non-Israelite prophet.
The book of Ruth uses the same root when Ruth ends up gleaning in her kinsman Boaz’s field (Ruth 2:3). In both instances the language may imply that these are <i>not</i> happenstance occurrences.

Verse 4



Verse 5



Verse 6



Verse 7

<b><i>theme.</i></b> Heb. <i>mashal,</i> indicative of wisdom sayings that have a particular message.

Verse 8

<b><i>God.</i></b> Heb. <i>el,</i> which here may be short for <i>elohim,</i> the noun usually translated as “God,” or it may refer to the Canaanite god El, which at one time was apparently also worshipped by Israel. In the Deir Alla inscription (see the introduction to the previous unit), Balaam’s mission is charged by the deity El.

Verse 9



Verse 10

<b><i>Who can count the dust of Jacob.</i></b> This expression reverberates in the ancestral blessing (Genesis 13:16).

Verse 11



Verse 12



Verse 13

BALAAM’S SECOND ORACLE AND BALAK’S RESPONSE (23:13–26) Balaam’s second oracle (vv. 18–24) expands on the themes of the initial message. It focuses on God’s attributes of faithfulness vis-à-vis Israel and acknowledges Balaam’s task to actually bless Israel. The poem closes with a statement of Israel’s great power. Balak, however, is unwilling to accept the inevitable and persists in resisting the finality of the prophecy.
<b><i>13–17.</i></b> After the initial blessing of Israel, Balak attempts to elicit a curse from Balaam by having the prophet view the Israelite camp from a less awesome angle. The narrator mocks Balak, who fails to understand that God’s desire may not be contravened in this manner.
<b><i>“a portion of them.”</i></b> Literally, “its edge,” indicating that Balaam would only see a small segment of the Israelite camp. Apparently Balak believes that Balaam might actually curse them if they did not appear so overwhelming to him.

Verse 14



Verse 15



Verse 16



Verse 17



Verse 18

<b><i>18–24.</i></b> The message of the second oracle underscores that of the first. Balaam emphasizes God’s constancy in general—and specifically a devotion to Israel’s welfare. Balaam cites the redemption from Egypt as evidence of God’s power and allegiance to Israel.

Verse 19



Verse 20



Verse 21



Verse 22



Verse 23

<b><i>no augury.</i></b> Heb. <i>nachash,</i> like <i>kesem</i> (“divining,” see at 22:7), refers to the taking of omens, a practice popular in the ancient Near East but prohibited in the Bible (see Deuteronomy 18:10–12).

Verse 24

<b><i>like a lioness…like a lion.</i></b> These similes preview Israel’s military victories and kingdom in Canaan (see Genesis 49:9–10).

Verse 25

<b><i>25–26.</i></b> The distressed and foolish Moabite king, in contrast to the seer, is not resigned to accept God’s expressed will as the last word.
<b><i>“Don’t curse them and don’t bless them!”</i></b> The implication is that Balaam’s attempted curse translates into a blessing; therefore, it is better to abandon the entire enterprise.

Verse 26



Verse 27

BALAAM’S THIRD ORACLE AND BALAK’S RESPONSE (23:27–24:11) The section begins with Balak’s acknowledgment that Israel’s God is the one who controls Balaam’s ability to curse Israel. This time, when Balaam utters his prophecy, he is apparently imbued with the divine spirit common to Israel’s prophets. It seems that his role has changed from that of pagan seer to a prophet of God. The third oracle sings the praises of a triumphant Israel and concludes by cursing her enemies.
<b><i>27–24–24:2.</i></b> This time the narrator states that Balaam does not search for omens in the process of seeking the divine spirit, implying that he did so previously. For the first time, Balaam views the entire Israelite camp (compare 22:41; 23:13).

Verse 28

<b><i>the peak of Peor.</i></b> The site, high on a hill, is not only ideal for viewing the Israelite camp, but also would have housed a sanctuary to the god Baal-peor, a site that will soon become infamous when Israelite men consort there with local women (see below at 25:1–18).

Chapter 24



Verse 1



Verse 2



Verse 3

<b><i>3–9.</i></b> This third vision describes the Israelite encampment as a lush oasis (vv. 6–7), which stands in stark contrast to the wilderness background of Balaam’s actual view of that encampment (24:1). The oracle ends by reiterating the promise to Israel’s ancestors (Genesis 12:3; 27:29) that anyone who blesses Israel will be blessed in turn, but that anyone who curses Israel is cursed in return. Verse 5 from this oracle has become a part of Jewish liturgy.

Verse 4

<b><i>the Almighty.</i></b> Heb. <i>shaddai</i> is an epithet of God common in the stories of the patriarchs and matriarchs (Genesis 17:1; 28:3; 35:11). Its likely meaning, “high,” is related to the Akkadian term for mountain. (See further at Genesis 17:1 and Exodus 6:2.) In contrast to the biblical <i>shaddai</i>, in the Deir Alla inscription (see the introduction to the previous unit), the <i>shdyn</i> (“Shadday-gods”) are independent deities with powers to challenge those of the head god El.

Verse 5

<b><i>How fair are your tents, O Jacob.</i></b> Heb. <i>mah tovu ohalecha yaakov.</i> This verse from Balaam’s blessing of Israel is preserved in modern times in the opening of the morning liturgy. The picture of Israel residing securely in its tents provides an idyllic image.

Verse 6



Verse 7

<b><i>Agag.</i></b> Agag is the king of Amalek at the time of Saul’s reign (I Samuel 15:8). Saul’s victory is in effect foretold here. Critical scholars take this as evidence that this text dates from after that event, that is, after approximately 1000 <small>B.C.E.</small>

Verse 8



Verse 9



Verse 10

<b><i>Enraged at Balaam.</i></b> Balak’s reaction to Balaam’s third oracle is no doubt exacerbated by the pronouncement that he who curses Israel will be cursed in turn.
<i><b>struck his hands together.</b></i> A gesture of anguish and anger attested elsewhere in the Bible. The book of Lamentations depicts Jerusalem as a disgraced woman, whom passersby jeer as they strike their hands in derision (Lamentations 2:15).

Verse 11

 Balak sends Balaam home without payment for his services.

Verse 12

BALAAM’S FOURTH ORACLE (24:12–25) Balaam makes it clear to Balak that even great riches cannot entice him if Israel’s God does not will it. In the power struggle between earthly king and the kingship of God, the victor is clearly the God of Israel. In that sense, the encounters between Balak and Balaam are comparable to those between Moses and Pharaoh prior to the Exodus.
Balaam utters a fourth oracle on his own accord following his dismissal by the angry Moabite king. This last speech not only prophesies Israel’s ultimate triumph over the other nations, but it assumes the rise of kingship and an Israelite empire.
This fourth oracle refers to several ethnic groups in the context of Israel’s future victories. Balaam predicts the destruction of Moab at the hands of an unnamed Israelite king. Judging by other biblical accounts, either David or Ahab qualifies as that king (II Samuel 8:2; II Kings 3:4–5). Indeed, the Mesha Stele—a Moabite inscription of the 9th century <small>B.C.E</small>.—commemorates the independence of Moab after years of subservience to Israel. Overall, the fourth oracle is the climax of Balaam’s prophecies, predicting a more distant but bright future awaiting Israel. As Balaam relates each of the first three oracles, his status rises; with the fourth and final oracle he becomes a universal prophet in the sense that his visions encompass future events for the entire region. A very common pattern in biblical literature is followed here: the 3+1 pattern, where the fourth element is climactic.
The narrative ends with Balaam and Balak returning home, the latter’s mission having failed. No additional words are exchanged between the Moabite king and the seer.

Chapter 25



Verse 1

<i>Apostasy at Baal-peor</i> (25:1–9)
Numbers 25 continues the narrative begun in 22:1 that was interrupted by the insertion of the story of Balaam and Balak. It recounts a specific event that occurs while Israel is still encamped on the plains of Moab, awaiting the crossing into Canaan. According to the account, which is apparently woven from different traditions, a group of Israelite men mingle with local non-Israelite women; the resulting sexual relationships lead to idolatrous worship of the local god, Baal-peor, and ultimately to the slaughter of thousands of people.
Three smaller segments comprise the story: vv. 1–5; 6–9; and 10–19 (which appears in the next parashah, <i>Pinchas).</i> In the latter two segments Phinehas, Aaron’s grandson, is central to the expiation of the sin, his role superseding even that of Moses. Clearly, that rendition’s objective is to support the claim that the Aaronite priesthood was divinely appointed.
Memory of Israel’s apostasy at Baal-peor and subsequent punishment is preserved in several biblical accounts outside the book of Numbers (see Deuteronomy 4:3; Joshua 22:17; Hosea 9:10; Psalm 106:28). But it is the account in Numbers that specifically develops the theme of the dangerous foreign woman who entices the men to sin (as in Proverbs 2:16; 5:3, 20; 7:5; 23:27; 27:13). Except for Hosea 9:10, all other references to the sin of Baal-peor focus solely on the idolatrous worship.
ISRAEL’S FLIRTATION WITH FOREIGN WOMEN AND IDOLATRY (25:1–5)
The setting of this episode is the last Israelite encampment outside Canaan, at Shittim—just east of the Jordan River. Israel’s apostasy, actually involving only males, centers around their contact with Moabite women, whom the writer clearly condemns in keeping with a strand of biblical ideology that prohibits marriage with foreign women (see Deuteronomy 7:3). King Solomon himself is condemned for marrying foreign women, among them a Moabite, because they ostensibly enticed him to worship foreign gods (I Kings 11:1–6). A contrasting tradition, which welcomes a foreign woman, is the story of Ruth the Moabite. The brief story of Israel’s apostasy in Numbers 25 moves swiftly from a sexual encounter to idolatrous worship and God’s reprisal.
<b><i>Moabite women.</i></b> The Moabite women in this account are viewed as dangerous enticers. Unlike Ruth, who is accepted into Israelite society and even identified as the ancestor of King David (Ruth 4:17), Moabite women in this parashah are considered totally unacceptable partners for the Israelite men. Undoubtedly, Ruth’s complete break with her own family and religion and total adoption of Israelite culture differentiates her case.

Verse 2

<b><i>invited the menfolk.</i></b> The text makes it clear that it is the Moabite women who entice the Israelite men to join their ritual feast. In that way this sin differs from the one of the Golden Calf, whose construction and worship was initiated by Israel (Exodus 32:1–6). [While the case of the Golden Calf implicates women and men alike, the present story singles out women as enticers to sin, while it labels men as sinners. —<i>Ed.</i>] <i><b>partook of them.</b></i> Heb. <i>vayochal,</i> literally “ate,” seems to refer to a ritual sacrificial feast, possibly connected with a funerary cult. (See <i>Va-y’chi,</i> Another View.)

Verse 3

<b><i>Baal-peor.</i></b> Baal-peor is the local manifestation of the storm-god Baal of the Canaanite religion. Peor is a geographical name previously mentioned in the Balaam saga (23:28; also Deuteronomy 3:29).

Verse 4

<b><i>“Take all the ringleaders and have them publicly impaled.”</i></b> The ringleaders, in Hebrew “heads of the people,” are to be put to death; perhaps included are those who did not take part in the apostasy but were liable for the people’s actions nonetheless. Their execution and subsequent public impalement serves as expiation for Israel’s violation of the Sinai covenant, which prohibits foreign worship. The extreme measure is needed to control divine wrath.

Verse 5

<b><i>“slay those…who attached themselves to Baal-peor.”</i></b> Moses apparently intervenes, instructing Israel’s officials to slay only the guilty.

Verse 6

PHINEHAS’S VENGEANCE (25:6–9) This passage focuses on one particular couple guilty of apostasy. Interestingly, the man and woman are not identified by name or status until after Phinehas kills them and expiates their sin (25:14–15). Clearly, the emphasis in this portion of the account is on the brave, redeeming act of Phinehas, the priest who preserves the community’s sanctity. The couple is identified in the next parashah, where we learn that they come from leading families. Their actions as leaders and role models render them even more culpable.
<b><i>Midianite woman.</i></b> Verse 1 identified the women in question as Moabite. According to the Torah, Moses had married Zipporah, a Midianite, the daughter of a priest, more than forty years earlier (Exodus 2:21 and 18:1–12). The Midianites are said to be descended from Abraham and his wife Keturah (Genesis 25:1–4). The Bible preserves conflicting traditions about relations with Midianites.

Verse 7



Verse 8

<b><i>the chamber.</i></b> Heb. <i>hakubbah,</i> which probably refers to a tent (as in Arabic) that is part of the cultic area. Thus the transgression involves worship of a foreign deity.

Verse 9

<b><i>Those who died of the plague.</i></b> Punishing offenders by a divinely sent plague is known from elsewhere in the Bible. (Presumably any remaining members of the Exodus generation are among the victims of this plague, since the census that will follow shortly in Numbers 26 indicates that by that point they have all been wiped out.) The sin of the Golden Calf, especially, is a comparable example (Exodus 32:35). Possibly, the reference at the end of that account to future divine reprisal (32:34) is fulfilled by the punishment exacted now at Baal-peor.
<i>—Nili Sacher Fox</i>  

Verse 10

<i>The Legacy of Priestly Leadership</i>
PHINEHAS AND THE COVENANT OF PERPETUAL PRIESTHOOD (25:10–18)
Although the five sisters Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah will feature prominently in this Torah portion, it begins with Phinehas (in Hebrew, <i>Pinchas</i>). It concludes the gruesome episode that took place in the previous parashah: Israel succumbed to the sin of idolatry, and Phinehas the priest—Aaron’s grandson—responded by slaying a couple who had committed idolatry in front of the community. Now God rewards Phinehas. (For a different interpretation, see <i>Balak,</i> Another View.)
This opening scene is disturbing for a number of reasons: first, because the new generation of Israelites falls prey to idolatry—and does so within view of the Promised Land; second, because Phinehas is rewarded for acting violently and without recourse to due process; and third, because women (albeit foreign) receive a disproportionate blame for the people’s downfall.
PHINEHAS’S REWARD: PERMANENT PRIESTLY LEADERSHIP (25:10–13)
God rewards Phinehas with hereditary priesthood, elevating him above other descendants of Aaron. Why? The reason seems to be Phinehas’s swift and ruthless response to idolatry. Unlike his grandfather Aaron, who collaborated with idolators in the infamous case of the Golden Calf (see Exodus 32, especially vv. 5 and 21–25), Phinehas demonstrates unflinching loyalty to God. He thus restores the stature of priests as deserving mediators between Israel and God.
Although God had ordered death for all the ringleaders (25:4), Phinehas satisfies God’s demand for punishment by the single act of slaying two leaders. He thereby causes less rather than more bloodshed.

Verse 11



Verse 12

<b><i>My pact of friendship.</i></b> Literally, “covenant of peace.” In Numbers 6, God requires that the priests transmit blessings of peace. (See “And grant you peace” in the conclusion of the Priestly Benediction, 6:22–26.)

Verse 13

<b><i>for him and his descendants after him a pact of priesthood.</i></b> According to later narratives, Israel’s chief priests descended from Phinehas rather than from Aaron’s other descendants.

Verse 14

THE CULPRITS AND THEIR CRIME (25:14–18) For the first time, the narrator discloses the name and rank of Phinehas’s victims: Zimri the Israelite man and Cozbi the Midianite woman. Their story articulates a theme that recurs in several biblical books: the potentially dangerous influence of foreign women.
In some cases, foreign women play a positive role, helping to ensure survival. The daughter of Pharaoh saves Moses (Exodus 2:5–10). Zipporah, Moses’ Midianite wife, averts God’s wrath by circumcising their son (Exodus 4:24–26). Rahab the harlot helps Israelite spies (Joshua 2). Jael saves the nation by killing its arch-enemy Sisera (Judges 4). Ruth the Moabite sustains Naomi and becomes an ancestress of King David (Ruth 4:17–22).
Elsewhere, however, women are blamed for leading Israelite men to idolatry. Thus the warning in Exodus 34:16: “And when you take wives from among their daughters for your sons, their daughters will lust after their gods and will cause your sons to lust after their gods.” (See also Deuteronomy 7:4, which adds that God’s anger will blaze, “promptly wiping you out.”) In addition, I Kings 11:1–13 blames Solomon’s fall from grace on his foreign wives, and I Kings 18 portrays Queen Jezebel, a Phoenician princess married to an Israelite king, as a major proponent of idolatry. Recognizing women’s powerful influence on cultural and religious life, the Bible at certain junctures expresses anxiety over foreign women. The standard charge is idolatry, often cast in sexual terms. Women who keep their own religious traditions instead of Israel’s seem to threaten the entire fabric of the nation. They possess the potential to lure their husbands and future generations away from fidelity to Israelite traditions. The danger is deemed acute in times of transition, when Israel’s boundaries—social as well as political—are not clearly established, as here, when entering the land.
<b><i>14–15. Zimri…Cozbi daughter of Zur…tribal head.</i></b> Cozbi’s name derives from a Hebrew root <i>k-z-b,</i> meaning “a lie” or “falsehood.” Both Cozbi and Zimri come from leading families. In the previous Torah portion, responsibility for initiating this crisis had already been placed on women: “they,” specifically the women (the verb is in feminine plural form), invited the people to offer sacrifices to “their” (again, feminine form) god (for details, see at 25:1–2). Here Cozbi receives the greater share of the blame. She is mentioned twice (see below); Zimri is mentioned only once.

Verse 15



Verse 16



Verse 17



Verse 18

<b><i>because of the affair of…Cozbi.</i></b> She alone now represents the entire episode. This scandal becomes known as “the affair of Cozbi,” not “the affair of Zimri,” the Israelite man. The repetition of her name here, this time with no reference to Zimri, singles her out as the dominant symbol of this sinful event that will mar Israel’s relations with the Midianites (see also 31:1–54).
<i><b>Peor.</b></i> The site in Moab where these events took place, identified as Shittim in 25:1.
<i><b>their kinswoman.</b></i> Literally, “their sister.” In the census that follows, Miriam will be identified by the same Hebrew phrase (26:59; see there). The foreign woman as sister appears here as a source of death, whereas the Israelite sister remains a preserver of life.
<i><b>daughter of the Midianite chieftain.</b></i> For Rashi, her pedigree teaches “the extent of the Midianites’ hatred, who went so far as to prostitute a king’s daughter in order to bring Israel into sin.” His interpretation thus shifts some blame away from Cozbi to her family.

Verse 19

<i>Legacy of Land</i>
CENSUS OF A NEW GENERATION (25:19–26:65)
The list of the men reared in the wilderness and those destined to inherit the Promised Land links the past with the future to establish continuity. The census identifies those who survived the journey (and the recent debacle at Peor), as well as the men whose households will receive land. The order follows the earlier list of those who began the journey in Numbers 1. One generation is passing; its children now stand ready to carry on. If Numbers 1 is an “exit poll,” this census is an “entrance poll.”
THE CENSUS OF THE ISRAELITES (25:19–26:51)
The tribes bear the names of Jacob’s twelve sons by different mothers, though none of the matriarchs is mentioned. Most of the individual heads of households named here are otherwise unknown. The significance of the order of the list is not self-evident beyond its parallel to Numbers 1. About the names of the tribes as given by Leah and Rachel to their sons, see at Genesis 29–30.
The list of men is interrupted only rarely. The mention of Serah, daughter of Asher (26:46) and of Jochebed and Miriam (26:59) are two such occasions.

THE CENSUS OF THE LEVITES (26:57–62) Since Levites do not inherit land (26:62) but instead live in the midst of the other tribes (see at 3:1–46), their list is separate and forms the conclusion of the census. The family of Moses—though not Moses himself—receives special attention, highlighting Jochebed and Miriam.

Verse 58



Verse 59

 In this verse, emphasis falls on the women’s family positions: Jochebed as wife and mother, and Miriam as a daughter as well as “their sister.” In this census, the constellation of birth references is unique. The text records Jochebed’s own birth, itself an unusual detail. Obviously all the persons named in the census list have mothers, but the reference here emphasizes that these particular family events are not merely personal but of national consequence. The brief references suggest, in telegraphic fashion, that it is precisely their actions as mother and sister that matter for the life of Israel. One thereby remembers the wife, Jochebed, who not only bore a child but took exceptional risks to protect him, and Miriam the sister who supervised his rescue and reconnected him with his mother (Exodus 2).
<i><b>their sister Miriam.</b></i> For the first time Miriam is explicitly named as Moses’ sister. Exodus 2 referred only to an unnamed sister of Moses; but the genealogy of Moses and Aaron in Exodus 6 did not include her. While Exodus 15:20 identified her as “Miriam the prophet, Aaron’s sister,” her relation to either man is not noted in Numbers 12—where she and Aaron challenge Moses—nor in her death notice in Numbers 20:1. Only here, perhaps as a way of tying up loose ends, is she specifically identified as the sister of both men. Indeed, the list departs from standard form to provide this information. In contrast to Cozbi (see at 25:18), who appears as an agent of danger and death, Miriam is an instrument of life. (See further at Numbers 20:1.)

Chapter 27



Verse 1

<i>Legacy and Land</i>
MAHLAH, NOAH, HOGLAH, MILCAH, AND TIRZAH (27:1–11)
The story of Zelophehad’s daughters appears in three different places in the Bible (Numbers 27 and 36; Joshua 17) and concerns itself with providing land for five remarkable daughters who, as sisters, always appear together. So important are they that their names are repeated in full in each episode. The fact that they receive so much “press” in the Bible is itself proof of their significance. But it takes attention to details to appreciate fully their accomplishments.
In the Torah, the story of Zelophehad’s daughters depicts a two-part reformulation of a law, enabling daughters to inherit land (Numbers 27 and 36). In the first part, the daughters receive a promise of land; in the second, the law concerning the land is amended (see at Numbers 36). Finally, Joshua and other leaders then implement the law (at the sisters’ request) in Joshua 17, and the women take possession of their land.
One notes two striking features of the story. First, disenfranchised women successfully confront an unjust system and propose a more equitable law. Second, God approves of their proposal and formulates it as a new law, one that enables other women as well to inherit land in certain circumstances. As unmarried women whose father had died, the five daughters represent the least powerful members of the community. Yet they dare challenge the tradition and call for change when the tradition is unjust. In the end, their proposal becomes God’s Torah. Rashi notes this dramatic development when he explicitly attributes this new Torah to the women. Their law, he says, “deserved to have been written by Moses”; but the women were worthy and hence “it was written by them.”
The story matters for other weighty reasons as well: it offers crucial information about land rights and kinship structures, as well as about the roles and status of women; it provides a rare opportunity for seeing how the legal process was perceived in biblical Israel. Thus the implications of the story extend beyond concern with the women in question. But the fact that the women in the Torah initiate this particular process and even the law itself, makes their story extraordinary.
Only three other cases in the entire Torah describe a legislative process in action: the cases of (1) the blasphemer (Leviticus 24:10–22); (2) those impure for the passover sacrifice (Numbers 9:6–14); and (3) the Shabbat violator (15:32–36). These three narratives describe procedural debates about applying already existing laws. But only the case of the five sisters shows a law actually being created, not merely applied. Moreover, this law is first proposed by people and only then confirmed, approved and extended by God as Torah. What perhaps makes this story most extraordinary and crucially important is that the people who create this Torah teaching are five women: Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.
THE SETTING (27:1–2)
The event takes place at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting, Israel’s holy shrine. The sisters confront a full house: Moses, the chief priest, the leaders and the entire congregation. Their demand is as public as possible.
<b><i>The names of the daughters.</i></b> Each one’s name appears in every episode about them.
<i><b>Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.</b></i> The sisters are introduced by name, not merely as Zelophehad’s daughters. Their names recur in each episode (though the order varies for no apparent reason). The meanings of their names remain uncertain but the impact of their actions in the Bible is clear. In addition, archeologists have discovered two of these names, Noah and Hoglah, listed as town names on clay fragments from the 8th century <small>B.C.E.</small>, known as the Samaria Ostraca (see at 27:5–11). Similarly, Tirzah, Milcah, and Mahlah appear as names of towns or regions in Israelite territory in various biblical texts (see below at 27:5–11).
<i><b>Mahlah.</b></i> A version of this name also appears as a place name in I Kings 19:16.
<i><b>Noah.</b></i> This name appears on three different fragments (ostraca 50, 52, and 64) as “of Noah.” The fragments appear to record delivery of wine or oil.
<i><b>Hoglah.</b></i> This name also appears on three different fragments (ostraca 45, 47 and 66).
<i><b>Milcah.</b></i> Scholars maintain that the name also refers to the region between Noah and Hoglah. The name appears in Genesis as well, as the name of Rebekah’s grandmother (see at Genesis 24:24).
<i><b>Tirzah.</b></i> This name refers also to the well known royal city of the northern kingdom (see, for example, I Kings 14:17). The man in Song of Songs describes the woman as “beautiful…as Tirzah” (6:4).

Verse 2



Verse 3

THE SISTERS’ REQUEST: TO INHERIT THEIR FATHER’S LAND (27:3–4) The women first challenge an unfair system but then immediately propose a solution. Their choice of words is astute. They use the language of loyalty to family, making a claim on behalf of their dead father. By emphasizing the desire to perpetuate their father’s name, they speak to a timely communal and familial concern in an era of transition.
<b><i>“Our father died in the wilderness.”</i></b> As such, he is unable to claim the land to which he is entitled.
<i><b>“not one of…Korah’s faction.”</b></i> By distancing their father from Korah, who had rebelled against Aaron (see Numbers 16), the daughters legitimate themselves in at least two ways. First, they explain that their father did not forfeit his inheritance (see 26:11 above). Second, they distance themselves from suspicion of illegitimate challenge to authority.

Verse 4

<b><i>“Let not our father’s name be lost.”</i></b> Preserving a man’s name—that is, his property and legacy—stands out as a venerable obligation in the Bible (see the levirate laws of Deuteronomy 25:5–10). The women thus cleverly frame their request in the shared language of communal, especially male, concern.
<i><b>“Give us a holding.”</b></i> The language is bold. Note the absence of any polite petitionary language equivalent to “please.” Instead, the women use the commanding imperative “give.” <i><b>“among our father’s kinsmen.”</b></i> As some rabbinic sages note, the women make clear their desire to remain connected to community and family. This statement adds moral force to their request.

Verse 5

THE RESULTS: THE SISTERS RECEIVE THE PROMISE OF LAND (27:5–11) The women’s request launches a process that leads to a new law. Furthermore, this episode may reflect the historical reality that some women were inheritors of territory. A significant discovery early in the 20th century brought to light dozens of ostraca dating to the mid-8th century <small>B.C.E.</small> These ostraca come from Samaria, the capital of the Northern Kingdom. (Ostraca are shards of pottery inscribed with ink; they were often used for short notes or for administrative records.) Some sixty-six ostraca record the delivery of fine oil and wine, perhaps as taxes, from the surrounding towns in the territory of Manasseh to the capital. The names of two of the five daughters of Zelophehad appear in these fragments, each in three different inscriptions: Hoglah and Noah. The appearance of those names on the ostraca, together with the fact that Joshua 17:3–6 lists all five daughters as receivers of land in the northern region of Manasseh, suggests that these women were significant figures in early Israel. It is conceivable that the five sisters are among the ancestors whose names became toponyms (place names). This conclusion is strengthened by the fact that many of the other fragments from Samaria also mention other names from Joshua 17, referring to individuals who appear elsewhere as clan names as well as territory names. [Carol Meyers contributed to the discussion of these ostraca in this commentary. <i>—Ed.</i>]
<b><i>Moses brought their case.</i></b> This translation (like most translations of this verse) does not adequately capture the force of this sentence. What is translated as “case” is the Hebrew word <i>mishpat,</i> a noun that is often rendered elsewhere as “law” or “rule”; see, for example, Exodus 21:1 when it categorizes the laws given at Sinai. What must be stressed, therefore, is that <i>their</i> (namely, the daughters’) rule or law now goes before God.

Verse 6



Verse 7

<b><i>“The plea of Zelophehad’s daughters is just.”</i></b> God responds with emphatic approval—literally, “Rightly the daughters of Zelophehad speak.” <i><b>“give them a hereditary holding among their father’s kinsmen.”</b></i> God issues two related demands. First, here God decrees that the leaders grant the women’s request. God’s language practically repeats that of the daughters, emphasizing that their petition be fulfilled in accordance with their request.
The one difference strengthens their claim: in an astonishing move, God adds that this land be given to them as “hereditary.” They not only get a holding (<i>achuzah</i>) but receive land that they can bestow as an inheritance on others (<i>nachalah</i>). The women who sought to ensure that their father’s name not be written out of history now enter history themselves by gaining a legacy of land and law.

Verse 8

<b><i>8–11.</i></b> Second, God extends this decree as a law for all generations. God issues a general law to accommodate the five daughters. What these daughters request will benefit other women in the same situation. Daughters now take precedence over other family members when there are no sons. (See further at 36:11.)

<i>Legacy of Mosaic Leadership and Authority</i>
JOSHUA APPOINTED AS SUCCESSOR (27:12–23)

GOD PREPARES MOSES FOR DEATH (27:12–14)
The problematic incident at Meribah (see at Numbers 20) led God to punish Moses and Aaron for disobedience. Now God invites Moses to view the land in preparation for his impending death.

Verse 13



Verse 14



Verse 15

MOSES ASKS GOD TO APPOINT A SUCCESSOR (27:15–17)

Verse 16



Verse 17



Verse 18

GOD SELECTS JOSHUA AS SUCCESSOR (27:18–21)
Joshua is one of the only two Israelites from the adult generation of the Exodus who may enter the land. Although Joshua will be expected to lead Israel in war, the only quality that God singles out in choosing him is spiritual.
<b><i>“lay your hand.”</i></b> The practice of ordaining someone by means of laying hands is modeled on this first investiture of authority by Moses. The word <i>s’michah</i> (as “rabbinic ordination”) comes from the term used here for “lay.”

Verse 19

 Although he emerges as Moses’ successor, Joshua nevertheless must work in partnership with the priest and consult him.

Verse 20

<b><i>“Invest him.”</i></b> Literally, “give of your glory to him.”

Verse 21

<b><i>“decision of the Urim.”</i></b> The Urim and Thummim are divination devices that priests use to consult with God (see at Exodus 28:30; Leviticus 8:8).
<i><b>“By such instruction.”</b></i> Literally, “by his mouth,” most likely that of Eleazar the priest.

Verse 22

CONCLUSION: MOSES COMMISSIONS JOSHUA (27:22–23) The text emphasizes through repetition that Moses’ investiture of Joshua takes place in accordance with God’s instructions.

Chapter 28



Verse 1

<i>Communal Legacy for Continuing Relations with God</i>
SACRIFICIAL OFFERINGS (28:1–30:1)
The sacrificial system entails sharing the benefits of the land with God as well as providing support for the landless priests. The prospect of the death of Moses the mediator leads to greater emphasis on laws that will bind God and Israel more closely together. The word “offerings,” also translated as “sacrifices,” comes from the root <i>k-r-b,</i> meaning “bring near.” Integral to the biblical notion of sacrifice is the understanding that offerings bring God and humanity closer. These offerings thus serve to ensure continuity of the relationship between God and Israel when Israel possesses the land. The feasts also bring Israelites together as a community.
Extensive regulations for holy occasions appear also in Leviticus 23, though some of the details vary. For this reason, the instructions in Numbers are interpreted as “additional” sacrifices or <i>musaf.</i> After the destruction of the Second Temple, the <i>musaf</i> as additional offerings was replaced by the <i>Musaf</i> as an additional service in the synagogue. (On sacrificial offerings, see also the introduction to <i>parashat Vayikra</i>, and at Leviticus 1–7.)
Most of the sacrifices follow a similar pattern: two bulls, one ram, seven lambs, and a goat for a purgation offering. The Shabbat requires only two lambs and no other animal offerings. The Feast of Booths (or Sukkot) differs considerably. The number of sacrificial animals is much larger: fourteen lambs and two rams daily. In addition, the number of bulls changes daily, decreasing from fourteen to seven, adding up to a total of seventy bulls. Because the number seventy represents the nations of the world (see Genesis 10), the rabbinic sages concluded that these offerings include an invocation for protection of the gentile nations (Rashi and BT <i>Sukkah</i> 55b). Presumably women were expected to bring offerings to the shrine and to participate in at least a number of communal religious practices. Deuteronomy 16:11 and 14 specify that women are to celebrate certain feasts with the rest of the household. Also, several biblical texts (see Leviticus 12:6 and I Samuel 1:25) as well as ancient Near Eastern depictions portray women as offering sacrifices (see at Leviticus 1:5). On women’s participation in Israelite celebrations, see also <i>R’eih,</i> Another View; “Women in Ancient Israel—An Overview.”

Verse 3

LIST OF OCCASIONS AND OFFERINGS (28:3b–29:38)
The list of special occasions follows from the most common (daily offering) to the annual cycle. The order largely resembles that of Leviticus 23 (see the commentary there for details). The sequence is as follows:

Verse 4



Verse 5

<b><i>eifah…hin.</i></b> Hebrew terms for dry and liquid measures, respectively.

Verse 6

<b><i>instituted at Mount Sinai.</i></b> This mention that daily offering was commanded at Sinai (Exodus 29:38–42) implies that these offerings represent a daily connection to that encounter between God and Israel.

Verse 7



Verse 8



Verse 9

<b><i>9–10.</i></b> The parallel in Leviticus 23:3 prohibits work on the Sabbath but makes no reference to sacrifices. Numbers adds a doubling of daily sacrifices for the Sabbath. In traditional liturgy, this passage is incorporated into the Sabbath Amidah prayer.

Verse 10



Verse 11

<b><i>new moons.</i></b> Heb. <i>rosh chodesh.</i> The beginning of the month was a sacred occasion in biblical Israel. The elaborate offerings in this passage of Numbers indicate that Rosh Chodesh constituted an important event. (According to rabbinic traditions, it should have been annulled after the Temple was destroyed in 70 <small>C.E</small>., but the persistence of women preserved it.) With the emergence of women’s movements in the 20th century, Rosh Chodesh has come to occupy a special place in women’s rituals.

<i>Internal Life of the Israelites</i>
INSTRUCTIONS REGARDING VOWS AND OATHS (30:2–17)
The instructions in this unit regarding vows focus primarily on women, unlike those that appear earlier, in Leviticus 27 and Numbers 6. Those biblical laws listed monetary valuation for the sanctuary in cases of vows (see at Leviticus 27) and delineated regulations for the vow of the nazirites, those women and men who dedicate themselves to God in specific ways (see at Numbers 6). Here the regulations pertain to the extent to which women are responsible for fulfilling their vows and oaths.
Scholars debate whether the legal scenarios depicted in this unit were ever applied before exile (587 <small>B.C.E.</small>), or whether they are the product of the later Persian period (539–330 <small>B.C.E</small>.). Either way, the parashah provides important information about the lives of women in ancient Israel, or at least on how women’s lives and practices were understood by the authors or editors of the text.
In the Bible, the noun <i>neder</i> (“vow”) denotes a promise to dedicate something to God only if and when the supplicant’s request is fulfilled. Such conditional pledges are attested also in other ancient Near Eastern cultures, including Egypt, Mesopotamia, and Ugarit (a kingdom situated on the coast of what is now Lebanon during the 14th-12th centuries <small>B.C.E.</small>). All vows and oaths are sworn or taken in God’s name.
INTRODUCTION (30:2)
Moses prepares the Israelites by instructing the leaders. The word <i>matot,</i> translated here as “tribes” also means “staffs” and stands for a person’s authority. In Genesis 38, when Judah negotiates with Tamar for her sexual favors, she demands—and receives—Judah’s staff as a guarantee (see Genesis 38:18).

The discussion of men’s vows is very brief, stressing that a male householder—or a man in general, according to most interpreters—is not to go back on his word when he utters a vow to God. The story about Jephthah in Judges 11 illustrates the seriousness with which vows were regarded. Judges tells of a warrior named Jephthah who vows to sacrifice whoever or whatever first comes out from his house should he win a battle (Judges 11:30–31). Tragically, his only child—a daughter—comes out to meet him and thus becomes the promised victim. The daughter, whose name is never revealed, willingly capitulates to her father’s obligation to fulfill his vow. She only requests two months with her women companions in order to lament the fact that she will die a virgin. Judges then reports that after her death, “it became a custom in Israel for the maidens of Israel to go every year, for four days in the year, and chant dirges for the daughter of Jephthah” (Judges 11:39–40). (See also Another View.)
<b><i>a vow to יהוה.</i></b> People typically make vows in times of great distress, as when ill or infertile. A vow can be made in private and does not need to be witnessed by a priest or a similar functionary, but apparently it is to be uttered aloud. Thus in I Samuel 1, when Hannah makes a vow in the presence of a priest, she does not need him to officiate or approve (I Samuel 1:9–14).
<i><b>an oath.</b></i> Two kinds of oaths exist in the Bible. First, an oath can establish innocence if a person has been charged with a crime. See, for example, the oath of the woman accused of adultery (in rabbinic parlance, a <i>sotah)</i> in Numbers 5:20–25. The second kind of oath, like the vow, is a binding promise to another party, as in the context of a covenant, with at least one member of the party invoking God (Baruch Levine, <i>Numbers 21–36,</i> 2000, p. 428).
<i><b>he shall not break his pledge.</b></i> Deuteronomy 23:22 specifies that a person sins if she or he does not make good on a promised pledge.

Verse 4

A WOMAN’S VOWS AND OATHS (30:4–17) Although we do not know how common it was for women to make vows or oaths, or what these typically entailed, the laws in this parashah establish, at the very least, that the biblical writers assumed that women were making vows and oaths, and that these situations required legal attention on the part of the writer. The discussion of vows in Numbers 29:39 already implicitly includes women. In this parashah, however, women’s vows constitute a major subject. The chief concern seems to be to regulate the impact that a woman’s vow might have upon the household (which is represented by the male head of the household: her father or husband). Vows and oaths grant women a sphere in which they can articulate certain needs and have them met (consider Hannah wishing for a son and promising that son to God, irrespective of her husband’s views on the matter, I Samuel 1). The laws perhaps indicate men’s concern that the vow of a woman in their household could lead to a destabilizing loss of property. As we will see, however, the power of some women to make vows or oaths is not cut off. Rather, male heads of households are given veto power in certain situations. Widows and divorcées are free from such constraints.
<i>A Woman’s Vow or Oath Uttered in Her Father’s House</i> (30:4–6) The first discussion of women and vows or oaths establishes the parameters of authority for women still in their father’s household. The woman is not described as a child. Nonetheless, under certain conditions, her father can annul her vows and oaths. The text does not indicate the kinds of vows and oaths that women might have made or the kinds of materials they might have promised. In this passage, the lawmakers seem to accommodate both benevolent and anxious fathers, so a father is allowed to annul his daughter’s vow or oath under certain conditions.
<b><i>If a woman makes a vow.</i></b> The Bible does not limit the kind of property that can be vowed, and it mentions several women who make vows. We deduce from such sources that vows included a wide variety of promised offerings. For example, Hannah vows to dedicate to the sanctuary the son whom she hopes to bear (I Samuel 1:11). Women can dedicate themselves as nazirites (Numbers 6:2). And in Proverbs 7:10–21, a married woman reports that she has fulfilled her vow by making a payment (7:14). The nature of Proverbs as wisdom literature makes it difficult to assess its value as reflecting ancient practices. Jacques Berlinerblau argues that the polemical purpose of the story in Proverbs is to warn men against seductive women, which makes the text an unreliable source for the lives of real women (<i>The Vow and the “Popular Religious Groups” of Ancient Israel: A Philological and Sociological Inquiry</i>, 1996, pp. 141–3). Nevertheless, the story suggests that readers are expected to find it credible that a married woman could make independent vows.
<i><b>assumes an obligation.</b></i> [The Hebrew actually refers to prohibiting something to oneself, that is abstaining from something. This expression, like “vow,” appears in every single verse from vv. 3–15. Together, the terms treat obligations that are positive (to do something) and negative (to not do something), both types operating under the same rules. Unlike the vows that pledge to give something to God (or the sanctuary) should one’s request be fulfilled, the prohibition means denying something to oneself (possibly only for a stated period of time), like nazirite vows, which are largely about abstaining from certain foods. In her book <i>Holy Feast and Holy Fast: The Religious Significance of Food to Medieval Women</i> (1988), Carolyn Bynum illustrates how women, under the rubrics of piety, used food not merely for self-control but for control of circumstances. She also argues that through self-imposed food practices women managed to develop their own practices and social roles. It is conceivable that such considerations are at work with the preoccupation with women’s vows and self-denials here. Other areas where self-denial may operate might concern specific household responsibilities, privileges, and marital relationships. In all these arenas, women who undertake an oath to forego certain things have an impact on the household in general and the authority of men in particular. This may account for the lengthy discussion of women’s vows. —<i>Ed.</i>] <i><b>while still in her father’s household.</b></i> That is, she is unmarried and most likely does not own property. By implication, anything she offers as a pledge belongs to the household, not to her, including a measure of control of her sexuality. A father typically sets the terms of his daughter’s marriage, including the required bridal gift, and he may subject her to debt-slavery (see at Exodus 21:7–11). This verse shows that a vow is not contingent on a person’s legal right to own property. A woman, even one who is young and unmarried, can still utter binding vows and oaths; she does not require her father’s consent. However, he has the option of annulling the vow under certain conditions. This law affirms a woman’s practice. In addition, there may be a practical, economic consideration: the priestly authors of this text, or their descendants, most likely would benefit from additional sanctuary dedications collected from women’s vows.
<i><b>by reason of her youth.</b></i> We are not privy to the woman’s exact age. She could be on the cusp of eligibility for marriage or of marriageable age. We might expect that this woman is either a little younger or a little older than 12. The use of the term “woman” rather than “girl” or “daughter” suggests that the vows of children are not valid. The law does not explicitly account for an unmarried woman who is neither “youthful,” widowed, nor divorced.

Verse 5

<b><i>self-imposed.</i></b> Literally, “imposed upon her <i>nefesh,”</i> that is, her life or being. <i>Nefesh,</i> sometimes (mis)translated as “soul,” is a feminine noun that often means “a person.” See also at v. 4, above.
<i><b>offers no objection.</b></i> Thus he tacitly agrees.

Verse 6

<b><i>But if her father restrains her.</i></b> Since the woman is a member of her father’s household and any property she vows to dedicate to God’s sanctuary will come from the household’s belongings, the Torah gives the man who is considered the head of the household the right to annul her vow.
<i><b>on the day he finds out.</b></i> That is, only on that same day. He cannot change his mind the next day and annul the vow without penalty (see v. 16 and Deuteronomy 23:22).
<b><i>יהוה</i></b> <i><b>will forgive her.</b></i> Although her father may be angry that she vowed the household’s property or her time to the sanctuary, there is no penalty imposed upon the woman for simply making the vow. Jacob Milgrom suggests that the woman ought not feel guilty on account of the canceled vow (<i>Numbers,</i> 1990, p. 252).

Verse 7

<i>A Married Woman’s Vow or Oath</i> (30:7–9) According to certain passages of the Bible, married women live under the authority of their husbands; but, like the young woman living in her father’s house, they can dedicate their husband’s property (perhaps even their own) or some of their time to the sanctuary. When Hannah utters her vow in the Shiloh sanctuary (I Samuel 1), she dedicates her first-born son. According to this passage, her husband Elkanah could overturn Hannah’s vow when he learns of it (see v. 12, below), but he does not.
 The new husband is given the option to annul his bride’s vow even though he was not present when she first made it. However, if he does not annul it on the day he hears of it, the vow stands as is.

Verse 8



Verse 9



Verse 10

<i>A Widow’s or a Divorced Woman’s Vow or Oath</i> (30:10) A woman who falls into either of these two categories is not beholden to a man with regard to vows and oaths. She can act autonomously; she alone is responsible for fulfilling her vow or oath. Because the Hebrew Bible typically perceives the widow as one of the most vulnerable members of its society, it legally provides for the needs of widows with regard to food, clothing, and other protections. (See at Exodus 22:21 and at Deuteronomy 10:18; 14:29; see also <i>Eikev,</i> Another View.) However, the Bible also mentions apparently wealthy widows such as Abigail, widow of Nabal, who marries David (I Samuel 25:42).

Verse 11

<i>Further Discussion of a Married Woman’s Vow or Oath</i> (30:11–17) The text returns to cases of married women, to situations such as that of Hannah, who vows her (and her husband’s) hoped-for son before the child is conceived. We assume that Elkanah later acquiesces to the terms of his wife’s vow, since Hannah simply tells him that she will not part with her son until he is weaned. Elkanah agrees, saying, “As long as God’s word is fulfilled” (I Samuel 1:23). Young Samuel’s parents deliver him to the Shiloh sanctuary without a recorded discussion.
<b><i>if, while in her husband’s household.</i></b> The rules concerning a wife are identical to those concerning a daughter. The woman may make a vow, but her husband may annul it under certain circumstances.

Verse 12



Verse 13

<b><i>crossed her lips.</i></b> Although the vow or oath must be uttered, there is no rule as to how loudly it must be spoken. In I Samuel 1:11–13, the priest Eli thinks Hannah is drunk when she is offering her vow and prayers through tears.

Verse 14

<b><i>self-denial.</i></b> Heb. <i>l’anot nefesh,</i> more precisely, “to afflict the person.” The text does not spell out the kinds of activities from which the woman might elect to abstain, but they might include, though not be limited to, abstentions observed by the nazirite. These include abstention from wine and grapes and refraining from contact with the dead (see Numbers 6). [The language implies that the woman’s vow may include abstention from other activities as well, a behavior that might have repercussions for the husband, for example, if she takes a vow of celibacy. —<i>Ed.</i>]

Verse 15



Verse 16



Verse 17

<b><i>between a husband and his wife…between a father and his daughter.</i></b> The overarching purpose for these laws about vows is elucidated here. This passage is concerned with specifying the range of a woman’s power as it relates to her own religious life and with ensuring that her independence does not conflict with the needs or preferences of the male head of the household. The laws illustrate that a woman who is not divorced or widowed is considered under the authority of either her father or her husband with respect to vows or oaths, yet only under certain conditions can he limit her decisions as an individual making a vow.

Chapter 31



Verse 1

<i>External Relationships</i>
REVENGE AGAINST THE MIDIANITES (31:1–54)
Numbers 25 described an episode of Baal-peor, in which Israelite men were “prostituting themselves” with Moabite women (Number 25:1). Such an allegation seemed to involve sexual acts in combination with foreign worship, not merely sex outside the boundaries of marriage (see also at Deuteronomy 31:16, as well as, for example, Ezekiel 16 and 22). God at that point cast a plague upon the community, but Phinehas the priest placated God by driving a spear through the copulating bodies of an Israelite man and a Midianite woman in front of the Tent of Meeting (25:7–8). He thus brought an end to the plague. In our parashah, God now commands Moses to punish the Midianites for that earlier incident at Baal-peor.
THE WAR AGAINST THE MIDIANITES (31:1–12)
The following episode of vengeance is not unique to the Bible, but it is one of the few in which women are particularly targeted. Moses holds Midianite women responsible for enticing Israelite men into foreign worship and specifically demands their deaths. The vengeance against the Midianites raises questions. First, what is the position of Moses’ Midianite wife, Zipporah (Exodus 2:21), in this conflict? Second, Numbers 25 depicts Moabite, not Midianite, women as seducing Israelite men (25:12); why then is this a campaign against the Midianites? Finally, why is Balaam punished when in Numbers 24 he blesses, not curses, Israel? Contemporary scholars attribute the inconsistencies to the editors’ choice to weave together different sources or traditions.

Verse 2

<b><i>“then you shall be gathered to your kin.”</i></b> The idiom throughout the Bible indicates death, presuming the usual practice of interment in the family tomb. Thus Jacob buries Leah in the tomb of his ancestors where he too expects to be buried (see Genesis 49:29–32 and at 25:8). King David’s aged supporter Barzillai the Gileadite expresses his preference to die “in my own town, near the graves of my father and mother” (II Samuel 19:38). In Moses’ case the idiom is a metaphor. This will be Moses’ final battle before he dies.

Verse 3

<b><i>“let them fall upon Midian.”</i></b> Numbers 25 mentions Moabite women who entice Israelite men (v. 1) but then focuses on one Midianite woman, Cozbi, who has sex with Zimri the Israelite (25:6–15). Why is revenge now directed only at Midian and not Moab? Many modern biblical scholars see the stories of the Moabites and the Midianites as distinct sagas that a later editor combined in order to honor both renditions of Israel’s history.

Verse 4



Verse 5



Verse 6

<b><i>Phinehas son of Eleazar.</i></b> Phinehas is the zealous grandson of Moses’ brother, Aaron; he kills an Israelite man and a Midianite woman copulating at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting (see at 25:8).

Verse 7



Verse 8

<b><i>Balaam son of Beor.</i></b> Why does the Israelite army kill Balaam, who blessed the Israelites even at considerable cost to himself (Numbers 22–24)? After all, he is responsible for the famous verse “How fair are your tents O Jacob, / Your dwellings, O Israel!” (24:5) and other poetic oracles. One explanation claims that since the text juxtaposes the story of apostasy in Numbers 25 with the mention of Balaam’s return home, he must have been involved in that apostasy (so Rashi, who follows the Talmud). Contemporary scholars explain the incongruence as a result of the combination of two versions of the story (see at v. 3, above).

Verse 9



Verse 10



Verse 11



Verse 12



Verse 13

SPECIFIC REVENGE AGAINST MIDIANITE WOMEN (31:13–18) Moses becomes enraged when his troops do not kill the Midianite women since, in his opinion, they were the ones who caused the Israelite men to go astray from God. In effect he commands them to kill all but the young, virgin girls.

Verse 14



Verse 15

<b><i>“You have spared every female!”</i></b> Not only did God refrain from mentioning this command to Moses in v. 2, but Moses does not inform his troops of his wishes until after they return from the battle. No mention is made of Zipporah, Moses’ Midianite wife, but it should be assumed that the battle targeted only people outside of the camp.
<i><b>“female.”</b></i> Note the use of biological description rather than the more common term, woman, elsewhere in this account.

Verse 16

<b><i>“they are the very ones.”</i></b> The use of feminine pronouns makes it clear that the women are considered responsible for initiating what happened earlier at Baal-peor.
<i><b>“who, at the bidding of Balaam.”</b></i> Thus far there has been nothing in the biblical text about Balaam’s involvement in the apostasy at Baal-peor. Numbers 24:25 merely reports that Balaam returned to his home after he finished relating the oracles. (See above at v. 8.)

Verse 17

<b><i>“slay every male among the dependents.”</i></b> This command includes young male children. There may be a fear that the young boys will grow up and take revenge on those who attacked their families. Ironically, Moses himself is an escaped victim of a similar decree by Pharaoh (Exodus 1) in which infant girls were saved while infant boys were to be thrown into the river.
<i><b>“known a man carnally.”</b></i> [Moses’ demand that all such women be killed is based on the women’s presumed culpability in the incident at Baal-peor. However, such regulations that make a woman’s sexual history essential to her destiny also imply that the intended role of women captured in war is sexual. This symbol of conquest may also help with the demographic problem, namely a shortage of women because of higher female mortality, usually from childbirth and ensuing complications. —<i>Ed.</i>]

Verse 18

<b><i>“spare.”</i></b> Literally, “keep alive for yourselves,” that is, the surviving captives are to be saved for the Israelite warriors.
<i><b>“has not had carnal relations with a man.”</b></i> There is no way a virgin could have participated in the events at Baal-peor since the apostasy involved sexual relations.

Verse 19

AFTERMATH: PURIFICATION RITUALS AND DISTRIBUTION OF SPOILS (31:19–54) Since taking of human life renders persons impure by putting them in contact with dead bodies, those responsible for the killing must undergo the purification ritual prescribed in detail in Numbers 19. This entails being sprinkled with a special mixture called “water of lustration” (“water of <i>niddah”</i>; see at 19:9), a combination of ashes of the red heifer mixed with water. The demand for a cleansing ritual underscores the power the ancients attributed to coming into physical contact with the finality of human life. The biblical writers understood that the “life…is in the blood” (Leviticus 17:11). The red heifer is one of the very few female animals to be used in Israelite ritual sacrifice. Therefore, some scholars suggest a connection between the femaleness of the animal and the expression “water of <i>niddah” (niddah</i> usually means menstruation or menstruant), translated as “water of lustration” (see at v. 23).
 As Numbers 19 indicates, a person impure by virtue of contact with death contaminates the sanctuary of God. This is a violation with severe consequences.

Verse 20



Verse 21



Verse 22



Verse 23

<b><i>“water of lustration.”</i></b> Heb. <i>mei niddah.</i> The word <i>niddah</i> elsewhere refers to menstruation or a menstruating woman (see Leviticus 15). Many scholars argue that no real connection exists between the water and the woman, other than that both refer to matters in the purity system. However, Hyam Maccoby asserts that the term should be translated literally as “waters of menstruation.” He claims that in a time predating the biblical period, menstrual blood was not only defiling but also maintained healing and purifying properties. Biblical examples of blood as a cleansing agent include the case of the <i>chatat</i> (“purgation offering”), in which blood is sprinkled on the altar in a purifying manner (see Exodus 29:36; Leviticus 4:25); but there the blood is that of a male animal sacrificed to God. Maccoby maintains that the red heifer is different from other biblical sacrifices in part because the heifer is a female sacrificial animal and in part because of its distinct coloring. The red cow is not just symbolic of blood in general, but of menstrual blood in particular, which has the symbolic power of life, death, and fertility (<i>Ritual and Morality: The Ritual Purity System and its Place in Judaism,</i> 1999, pp. 105–17).
For additional discussion of <i>mei niddah</i> (“water of lustration”), see at Numbers 19:9.

Chapter 32



Verse 1

<i>Negotiating Settlements</i>
PROVISIONS FOR TRIBAL TERRITORY EAST OF THE JORDAN (32:1–42)
Earlier, in Numbers 21, the Israelites conquered the territory east of the Jordan River. Here, two and half tribes (Reuben, Gad, and half of Manasseh) request to settle there. As in prior incidents, Moses is portrayed as one who must help his people deal with difficult transitions. In this case, a sub-group of Israelites successfully makes the transition from wanderers to settlers; but they do so prematurely. Moses reminds them of their obligations to the Israelite people as a whole: he demands that even if they are given the dispensation to remain occupants of Transjordan, they must continue to help their brothers in battle.

Verse 2



Verse 3

<b><i>“Nebo.”</i></b> This is the location of the mountain on top of which a dying Moses will view the Promised Land (see Deuteronomy 34:1–5). Tradition identifies this location with a mountain in Jordan with an expansive vista overlooking the land of Israel.

Verse 39



Verse 40

<b><i>so Moses gave Gilead to Machir son of Manasseh.</i></b> This statement contradicts vv. 1–4 and 29, where Reuben and Gad petition for Gilead. Some scholars explain that vv. 39–42 come from a different source, for not only does Moses give permission to the Manassites to take what has already been given to the Gadites, but also a batle of occupation ensues. This is the only war mentioned in this literary unit.
<i><b>Gilead…Machir son of Manasseh.</b></i> This part of the verse evokes the family line of Zelophehad’s daughters—Mahlah, Tirzah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Noah—whose land was granted to them according to Numbers 27 and who are a subject of discussion again in Numbers 36.

Chapter 33



Verse 1

<i>Remembering the Journey</i> (33:1–56)
This unit reviews the Israelites’ journey from Egypt to their arrival in the plains of Moab. After listing the forty-two places that Israel stopped during their journey, the unit concludes with God’s instructions about the future: once they possess the Promised Land, the Israelites must destroy the objects associated with foreign worship and apportion the land according to the size of the individual tribes or clans.
THE JOURNEY FROM EGYPT (33:1–37)
This section contains the Torah’s longest continuous list of the places where the Israelites encamped. To this day, the location of many of these places eludes biblical scholars and archeologists; the list is in tension with other accounts of the journey and may include symbolic elements no longer detectable. The narratives of Exodus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy also mention many of the places recounted in this section, but sometimes in a different order. Many scholars think that the editors of the Torah used this ancient list in Numbers 33 as a guide by which to arrange the individual episodes of Exodus and Numbers. Certain places evoke incidents recounted in other biblical narratives, whereas some remain otherwise unknown.

Verse 2

<b><i>Moses recorded the starting points.</i></b> This is one of very few places where Moses is actually credited with writing parts of what becomes the Torah.

Verse 3

<b><i>They set out.</i></b> Heb. <i>vayis’u,</i> which is a verb form of <i>mas’ei,</i> the name of this parashah, and means “they traveled.” This verb punctuates the itinerary with its persistent repetition.
<i><b>in the first month, on the fifteenth day of the first month.</b></i> The day that they left Egypt, the 15th of Nisan, corresponds to the first day of Passover, when Jews commemorate that exodus (see also Exodus 12).

Verse 4



Verse 5

<b><i>Rameses.</i></b> Rameses is one of the cities that the Israelites are said to have built when they were slaves (Exodus 1:11) and also the place where they observed the passover sacrifice and experienced the deliverance that the annual Passover festival commemorates (see above, v. 3).

Verse 6

Verse 37



Verse 38

THE DEATH OF AARON (33:38–40) This account provides Aaron’s age as well as the day and month of his death. He died at age 123, which is less than Sarah’s age (127 years) but more than Moses’ (120 years). This is one of three death notices for Aaron (see also 20:24–26, which includes more details, and Deuteronomy 10:6, which reports that he died in Moserah and not on Mount Hor). According to a non-biblical tradition, Aaron’s tomb is located on an isolated peak in the southern Jordanian desert of Petra. Jewish pilgrims have ascended this mountain for centuries and left their names in inscriptions and registers at the tomb.

Verse 41

THE JOURNEY TO MOAB (33:41–49) The last stations mentioned in this list are those that lead to the steppes (plains) of Moab, the final stop for Moses. Some of these stopping places appear also in the description of the Israelites’ travels in Numbers 21. Jacob Milgrom suggests that the list in Numbers 21, describing the journey, was edited to conform to this list (<i>Numbers</i>, 1990, p. 175). The compilation in this parashah mentions neither the rebellious words of the Israelites in Numbers 21 nor the deadly snakes that God sent to punish the people.

Verse 49

<b><i>steppes of Moab.</i></b> This area east of the Jordan River, also sometimes known as the plains of Moab, marks the Israelites’ final stop before entering the land. According to Deuteronomy, Moses speaks his final words to the people in this location. He will die here, atop Mount Nebo.

Verse 50

DIRECTIVES FOR THE FUTURE (33:50–56) God instructs Moses to proclaim an entrance strategy, describing the protocol concerning the inhabitants of Canaan. The instructions are concise and severe, calling upon the Israelites to dispossess the inhabitants completely; to destroy figured objects, molten images, and all worship places; and then to settle in the land. They are instructed to divide the land in proportion to the size of the tribes (or perhaps of the clans) once they enter the land. They are warned that God would destroy them should they neglect to destroy all the inhabitants. The rationale for complete destruction of the inhabitants is the danger that their presence would pose for Israel’s future. According to Numbers’ ideology, as well as Deuteronomy’s, Israel cannot survive if it is subject to the influence and presence of Canaanites. The perspective of this disturbing mandate reflects an understanding of Israel as small, inhabiting a landscape surrounded by (and infiltrated by) a stronger and more numerous people, the Canaanites. Historically speaking, the Canaanites and the Israelites were closely related. For example, what we know of contemporaneous Canaanite languages is that (like Phoenician to the north, and Moabite to the east) they were very close to Hebrew. Indeed, historians argue that the separation of Israelites from other Canaanites was a slow process. Some scholars maintain that the Bible is most severe with regard to Canaanites because Canaanite culture is most easily confused with that of Israel, as it attempts to establish a distinct identity. (See also at Deuteronomy 7:1–5, 24; 12:29–31.)

Chapter 34



Verse 1

<i>Preparing for the Future</i> (34:1–35:34)
In this unit, composed entirely of God’s words to Moses, God marks the specific borders of Canaan, so that the people will learn the extent of the territory that they will inherit. Since Moses will not be accompanying the people across the Jordan, Joshua and Eleazar will lead the appointed tribal leaders in the division of lands. Discussion of external boundaries and tribal chiefs quickly moves to laws concerning the internal workings of the community. Numbers 35 addresses the practical and ritual issues of homicide that will unfortunately, yet inevitably, arise when the people establish new societies in Canaan.
SETTING THE BOUNDARIES OF THE PROMISED LAND (34:1–15)
The borders of Canaan that this section outlines correspond approximately to the borders listed in Joshua 15 and Ezekiel 47, although the Ezekiel description utilizes place names that were probably more familiar to a post-exilic audience.

After all, Joshua and Caleb had been partners previously, as when they brought back a favorable report after the scouting expedition; hence they are the only non-Levites in the Exodus generation who will live to enter the Promised Land (Numbers 14). Here, God chooses a priest, not another military leader, to help in the delicate process of dividing territory. As a priest, Eleazar will not inherit land; thus his leadership is both logical and invaluable.

Chapter 35



Verse 1

BUILDING A JUST INFRASTRUCTURE: CITIES OF REFUGE (35:1–34)
Having delineated the land’s boundaries, the Torah turns to guidelines for living within those boundaries. Any emerging social group must incorporate explicit directions for dealing with homicide, both intentional and unintentional. The Bible carefully predicts different situations with varying degrees of conflict in order to protect the rights of both the victim’s family and the one who is responsible for an accidental homicide. (See also at Deuteronomy 19:1–13.)
<b><i>1–15–15</i></b> According to Numbers 18:21–24, the tribe of the Levites is not to receive its own land like the other tribes but to serve as special personnel dedicated to God’s service, for which they are due to receive a share of tithes from Israelite produce. Now we learn that the Levites will receive, in addition, forty-two towns in which their families can live. The pastureland that they are to receive with their cities is not official farmland—what the Bible calls <i>nachalah.</i> Rather, the land is to serve as pasture areas for their respective cities. The difference between these levitical city pastures and the farmland inheritances of other tribes is in the size and in the nature of the inheritance. The Levites are also to receive six cities of refuge for those guilty of unintentional homicide.

Verse 11

<b><i>person.</i></b> Heb. <i>nefesh,</i> a gender-neutral term (compare Leviticus 2:1). The blood-avenger is expected to protect the clan’s women as well as its men.

Verse 12

<b><i>avenger.</i></b> Although the Hebrew wording is not gender-specific, the translation presumes that this role was a man’s job. In the ancient Near East, using weapons to defend the family honor was typically the responsibility of men. According to David Stein, women apparently were not expected to undertake an active hunt for the killer of their kin, but if an opportunity for vengeance presented itself to a woman in the victim’s family, she might choose to seize that opportunity <i>(The Torah: Documentation for the Revised Edition,</i> 2005, at this verse).
<i><b>so that the killer may not die.</b></i> The Torah offers those who kill accidentally a safe haven from angry and grief-stricken relatives, discouraging both those who may wish to take the law into their own hands and those who may otherwise feel obliged to avenge out of a sense of duty. In addition to the physical protection afforded by a walled city, this institution protects the killer by making the victim’s relatives liable for bloodguilt if they choose to disregard the law.

Verse 25

 The (presumably natural) death of the chief priest marks the end period of the killer’s culpability. Although the Hebrew Bible generally frowns on regarding a person’s death as atonement for another’s sin, the death of the chief priest seems to function that way symbolically. Although no one is killed, the priest’s death benefits the life of another. The killer can return home, thus ending the exile.

Verse 30

<b><i>evidence of witnesses.</i></b> A single witness cannot convict a suspected killer in cases of capital offense. It is not only the gravity of the situation for the suspect that demands verifiable testimony but also the risk to the community, lest it mistakenly condemn itself to death for permitting the shedding of more innocent blood. (See also at Deuteronomy 17:16; 19:15–16.)

Verse 31

<b><i>31–34.</i></b> The biblical principle of bloodguilt, in which the spilled blood of murder must be avenged by causing the murderer’s own blood to flow, was implicit in vv. 18–19, and is implicit again in vv. 31–32. Finally, vv. 33–34 explain the root of this principle: If a victim’s blood is not avenged, the land becomes polluted. Examples of this concept can be found throughout the Hebrew Bible. For example, in Genesis 4:10, God reproaches Cain saying, “What have you done? Your brother’s blood is shrieking to Me from the ground.” This passage of Numbers teaches that no bloodguilt is required from someone who kills unintentionally.

Chapter 36



Verse 1

<i>Securing Land and Limits for Zelophehad’s Daughters</i> (36:1–12)
The last episode in the book of Numbers is devoted entirely to the case of Mahlah, Tirzah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Noah. In one sense, their story seeks to resolve a potential crossing of boundaries in a book particularly concerned with setting boundaries (because the daughters’ land risks being transferred to another tribe). In another sense, the story of these five sisters forms a counterpoint to stories about the five women in Exodus 1 and 2 who rescued Israelite children: the midwives Shiphrah and Puah, Moses’ unnamed mother (later identified as Jochebed), Moses’ unnamed sister (later identified as Miriam), and Pharaoh’s unnamed daughter. Although there is no more than a literary connection between these two groups of women, the framing of Israel’s journey as a whole with stories of women creates a symbolic symmetry.
In Numbers 27, the five daughters were granted the right to inherit their dead father’s land, with no strings attached. In this parashah, at the urging of leaders of the clan and in order to protect it from losing the land permanently, Moses proclaims a new law that requires the women to marry only within their clan or tribe (v. 6; the instructions are not clear as to whether the husband must come from the clan or can be anyone in the larger tribe).
Whereas the legal resolution concludes the book of Numbers, it does not conclude the story of Mahlah, Tirzah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Noah (see below at v. 12).
THE PROBLEM: LAND MIGHT TRANSFER TO ANOTHER TRIBE (36:1–4)
The clan leaders of the five sisters point out a potential problem: granting land to the sisters might mean loss of land to the Manasseh tribe if the women marry men from other tribes and their shares become parts of their husbands’ tribes. The transfer of land from one tribe to another would then violate the divine command that prescribes that each tribe possesses its land permanently (Leviticus 25).
<b><i>Gilead.</i></b> According to the genealogies in Numbers 26:29–33, Gilead is the great-grandfather of the sisters.
<i><b>came forward.</b></i> As did the daughters of Zelophehad (27:1). Here the location is not stated—in contrast with 27:2, where the daughters approached the leaders and “the entire community” at “the entrance of the Tent of Meeting.”

Verse 2

<b><i>“יהוה commanded…was further commanded by יהוה.”</i></b> God has issued two commands that in some way conflict with each other.
<i><b>“assign the land…as shares.”</b></i> At the heart of the issue stand two related laws. First, the requirement that the land allotted to each tribe should belong to that group permanently. Second, that at the fifty-year jubilee, land that has been transferred or sold returns to the permanent owner (see at Leviticus 25:10–28).
<i><b>“assign the share…to his daughters.”</b></i> The relatives do not question the legitimacy of the daughters’ claim or the divine origin of the allotment of land to them.

Verse 3

<b><i>“if they marry…our ancestral portion…be added to…the tribe into which they marry.”</i></b> There are three ways to explain the concern about the loss of the clan’s land. Most likely the complaint anticipates that the inherited land will eventually belong to the women’s sons and thus (if the husband is from another tribe) no longer be part of the Gilead/Manasseh tribe. It is also possible that the complaint implies that the women belong to the clan of their husband when they marry and therefore their land also belongs to that tribe. A third, but least likely, possibility is that the complaint implies that, in marriage, the land will become the husband’s property.

Verse 4

 According to jubilee laws, sold or mortgaged ancestral land returns to its original owner every 50 years (see Leviticus 25). The land of the daughters would remain permanently with them and their heirs, and thus potentially a part of the clan into which they marry.

Verse 5

THE SOLUTION: HEIRESSES MUST MARRY WITHIN THE TRIBE (36:5–9) Moses resolves the conflict by limiting the women’s marriage options. This solution is only necessary should the women marry. The possibility that the women might not marry is not addressed.
<b><i>Moses, at יהוה’s bidding, instructed.</i></b> In the first episode of the three scenes about Zelophehad’s daughters, Moses had brought their case before God (27:5). There is no mention here that Moses sought divine guidance for this new complication. He does, however, speak in God’s name.

Verse 6

<b><i>“They may marry anyone they wish.”</i></b> The free choice of spouses granted to the five sisters is especially significant in the context of the ancient world, because it excludes any male relative who wishes to claim the more typical role of a guardian for the unmarried daughters. Contrast this with the status of the heiress in classical Athens who is subject to the automatic control by a male relative in regard to marriage, as the way of protecting and preserving family property.
<i><b>“provided they marry into a clan of their father’s tribe.”</b></i> From a modern perspective, this restriction might appear as a step back after the forward steps in Numbers 27, since God’s law granted the land to the sisters in Numbers 27 with no strings attached. Practically speaking, however, the freedom to choose a spouse from their clan is less constricting than it might seem, given the size of this tribe (one of the largest among the Israelites).

Verse 7

<b><i>“No inheritance of the Israelites may pass over from one tribe to another.”</i></b> An attempt to secure the greater good of protecting tribal ownership of the land, rather than a gender-specific goal, stands as the basis for restricting the marriage choices of the sisters. In other words, the issue of who inherits land is not depicted as an objection to women’s owning land but rather as a concern for preserving tribal ownership of allotted land.

Verse 8

<b><i>“Every daughter…who inherits.”</i></b> Like the ruling that allows all daughters to inherit land when there are no sons (27:8), this modification clause also applies to all comparable situations. All daughters who inherit land must marry members of their tribe.
<b><i>“in order that every Israelite [heir] may keep an ancestral share.”</i></b> The goal of the compromise is unambiguous.

Verse 9

 Moses once more reiterates the underlying principle of the law, an emphasis that is particularly significant coming at the last stop of the journey and at the end of the book.

Verse 10

THE RESOLUTION: THE DAUGHTERS MARRY WITHIN THEIR TRIBE (36:10–12) The narrator confirms that the daughters followed God’s and Moses’ command, albeit without naming the daughters’ mates.

Verse 11

<b><i>Mahlah, Tirzah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Noah.</i></b> The sister’s names appear for the first time in this parashah. Whereas the speakers thus far (the relatives and Moses) refer to the five sisters as “Zelophehad’s daughters” (vv. 2, 6), the narrator now calls them by their names. The sisters’ own names appear in all three episodes about them. The order here, however, differs from that of Numbers 27 and Joshua 17, and there is no obvious explanation for the sequence. On the names and their connection to places, see at 27:1–11.
<i><b>were married to sons of their uncles.</b></i> Although they can marry any man from the very large tribe of Manasseh, the sisters choose their cousins. There is no reason to suppose (as Jacob Milgrom does) that the land was transferred to the husbands once the women married (<i>Numbers</i>, 1990, p. 298). The Bible does not prohibit wives from owning property.
Furthermore, the earliest Jewish contracts that we have illustrate that women continued to own property after marriage and that parents bequeathed property to both sons and daughters. Documents from the Jewish community in Elephantine, Egypt, include several marriage contracts and sale contracts. In several documents (dated around 460–447 <small>B.C.E.</small>), the father of Mibtahiah transfers property to her even though he has sons. The property remains hers at marriage. In one case, her husband, who apparently improved one of the several properties in question, or is expected to, is assured that he will have power over half of that particular property “for the improvement which you made” (Cowley 9:11–12). He cannot sell that half, and it goes to their children after him (Cowley 9). In another contract dated 434 <small>B.C.E.</small>, a husband transfers ownership of half of a newly purchased property to his wife irreversibly and makes their children (a boy and a girl) equal heirs of his portion (Kraeling 4).
It is difficult to assess the relationships between practices of this particular Jewish community and those in the Bible and ancient Israel in earlier periods. But evidence that women retained their property after marriage and were also able to inherit should caution us against concluding otherwise in this case without evidence. Moreover, the appearance of some of the women’s names as place names on early clay fragments suggest that they were recognized as primary owners (see below at v. 12 and at 27:1–2).

Verse 12

 To underscore the perfect execution of divine command, the narrator adds that the women’s marriages indeed preserve the inherited land within their father’s tribe. The story of Mahlah, Tirzah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Noah will conclude in Joshua 17, in the report about apportioning the land among the tribes. There, we read that “Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah…appeared before the priest Eleazar, Joshua son of Nun, and the chieftains, saying: ‘יהוה commanded Moses to grant us a portion among our male kinsmen.’ So, in accordance with יהוה’s instructions, they were granted a portion among their father’s kinsmen” (17:3–4). This passage makes no mention of their husbands. Furthermore, “Manasseh’s daughters inherited a portion in these together with his sons, while the land of Gilead was assigned to the rest of Manasseh’s descendants” (17:6; note that in Joshua the women are also called “Manasseh’s daughters”!). Although the historical reliability of the material in Joshua is subject to debate, it is safe to say that the book of Joshua portrays the inheritance of Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah as a large one. The 8th-century-<small>B.C.E.</small> clay fragments that bear names of towns, including Noah and Hoglah, illustrate the persistence of these names in Israelite tradition (see the introduction to Numbers 27:1–2). Tirzah is also the name of the royal city in the Northern Kingdom in the 10th century (see I Kings 14). (For more on the daughters’ names, see at 27:1–11.)

Verse 13

<i>Conclusion</i> (36:13)
The conclusion to the book of Numbers marks the conclusion of the journey to the Promised Land. The plains (or steppes) of Moab will be the setting for the book of Deuteronomy, the place where Moses will pronounce his last teachings before he dies. The concluding statement specifies that God is the source of the last group of laws that Moses teaches.

Deuteronomy



Chapter 1



Verse 1

<i>Setting and Introduction to Moses’ Address</i> (1:1–5)
When read as straightforward itineraries or markers of time and place, these verses are perplexing. Some place names do not appear in the Torah’s primary accounts of Israel’s wandering in the wilderness. Plus, there is a contradiction between v. 1, which states that Moses delivered these words at various points during the course of Israel’s journey through the wilderness, and vv. 3–5, which state that he spoke them at the end of the journey, when the Israelites reached the plains of Moab. Despite such ambiguities, these verses possess a strong rhetorical logic, for they juxtapose sites of Israelite misbehavior and consequent circuitous wandering with sites of Israelite obedience and consequent success and progress toward the land of Canaan.
<b><i>on the other side of the Jordan.</i></b> While most of Deuteronomy is presented as Moses’ speech to the Israelites before entering the land, the phrase “other side” here indicates that the entire book is addressed to the second intended audience, contemporaneous with the authors of the book as a whole, who were already looking back on the wilderness wandering and the entrance into the land as past events.
<i><b>Suph.</b></i> Place names are arranged in a reverse order of the Israelites’ journey from Horeb (Sinai) to Moab. The Israelites first doubted God’s saving power near Suph, a reference to the Sea of Reeds (Exodus 14:10–12).
<i><b>Paran.</b></i> The Israelites complained about wanting meat in the wilderness of Paran (Numbers 11); the episode of the scouts also occurred there (Numbers 13–14).
<i><b>Hazeroth.</b></i> This is where Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses (Numbers 12:1–2).

Verse 2



Verse 3

<b><i>It was in the fortieth year.</i></b> This verse emphasizes that Moses delivered the following words at the end of the forty years of wandering. Forty represents a symbolic time span, signifying a generation.

Verse 4



Verse 5

<b><i>Teaching.</i></b> Heb. <i>torah.</i> This term most likely refers here to Moses’ speeches in Deuteronomy, not to the whole Pentateuch or so-called Five Books of Moses (see also at 31:9).

Verse 6

<i>Moses’ Review of the Journey from Horeb (Sinai)</i> (1:6–3:11)
Horeb (the name for Sinai used in Deuteronomy) and Kadesh-barnea represent the poles of Israelite behavior. These two sites become emblematic of the choice that confronts the Israelites: obey God and prosper in the Promised Land or disobey and be condemned to wandering circuitously outside the land. For Deuteronomy’s exilic audience, Moses’ speech argues for the ongoing importance of heeding God by obeying the laws that follow in Deuteronomy 12–26.
APPOINTMENT OF TRIBAL LEADERS (1:6–18)
Moses begins his address by recounting God’s charge to the Israelites to set out from Horeb and journey to the Promised Land (vv. 6–8). Then, Moses recalls how he created an administrative infrastructure by appointing additional leaders (vv. 9–18).
<b><i>Horeb.</i></b> Deuteronomy refers to Mount Sinai as Horeb (see at Exodus 18:5).

Verse 7

<b><i>the hill country of the Amorites…as far as…the river Euphrates.</i></b> The Torah includes different understandings of the exact parameters of the land that it says God promised to the patriarchs. Some passages envision it as including only the land of Canaan, with its northern border at Lebo-hamath (in the Bekaa Valley of modern-day Lebanon, north of Damascus; see Numbers 13:21; 34:8). In contrast, the present verse understands the divine land grant more expansively to include both sides of the Jordan River, as far north as the Euphrates River (in today’s Iraq; see also 11:24). The variations remind us that the idea of the Promised Land does not correlate with a single historical reality. Rather, the phrase reflects ongoing attempts by different generations of Israelite writers to understand their people’s geopolitical aspirations and realities.

Verse 8



Verse 9

<b><i>9–18.</i></b> Moses recalls how he announced that the responsibility of leading the people, and especially of mediating their disputes, was too big for him to bear alone. He thus directs the people to choose wise and respected representatives from each of the tribes to serve as their leaders and judges.
This account conflates two earlier versions. In Exodus 18:13–27, Moses’ Midianite father-in-law, Jethro, sees that Moses is exhausting himself in judging all the Israelites’ disputes and advises Moses to delegate routine legal matters to others. In Numbers 11:10–17, the exasperated Moses complains to God about the burden of carrying the people single-handedly. God then tells him to appoint seventy representative elders upon whom God will bestow God’s holy spirit so that they can share the burden of leadership. In Deuteronomy’s version, Moses complains of the burden, as he does in Numbers, but the solution is closer to that proffered by Jethro in Exodus.

Verse 10

<b><i>10–11. Your God יהוה has multiplied…stars in the sky.</i></b> This statement echoes and confirms the fulfillment of God’s promise to Abraham in Genesis 15:5 and 22:17; likewise, Genesis 24:60 predicts that Rebekah will “become thousands of myriads.”

Verse 11



Verse 12

<b><i>the trouble of you, and the burden, and the bickering!</i></b> In the previous verses, Moses declared that he cannot lead the people alone because of their divinely granted magnitude. Here, he claims that he needs help because of their negative behavior. The juxtaposition of these two reasons reinforces two paradoxical themes in this parashah: God’s loyalty to previous promises, and Israel’s chronic misbehavior.

Verse 13

<b><i>Pick from, each of your tribes.</i></b> This crucial moment of autonomy and self-determination for the people contrasts with the earlier versions (Exodus 18; Numbers 11) in which Moses picks the leaders himself. The criteria for leadership here also differ from those in the prior episodes. In Exodus 18, judges must fear God, be trustworthy, and lack greed. In Numbers 11, participation in the divine spirit qualifies the leaders. Here, the leaders’ authority stems from their wisdom and experience, and the righteousness of their ruling derives from their ability to follow Moses’ directives regarding fairness and justice. This contrast among the three criteria for leadership underscores Deuteronomy’s respect for human wisdom and experience, and its faith in the guiding power of law.

Verse 14



Verse 15



Verse 16

<b><i>stranger.</i></b> Heb. <i>ger</i> is more precisely translated as “resident alien,” for it refers to those who live within the Israelite community but cannot own land and therefore are vulnerable economically.

Verse 17



Verse 18



Verse 19

EPISODE OF THE SCOUTS (1:19–46) This section recounts the events described in Numbers 13–14. Both versions tell of a reconnaissance mission by twelve scouts that results in the Israelites’ terrified refusal to attempt the conquest of the land of Canaan. After God vows to punish them for their lack of faith, the Israelites invade the land without God’s support and are defeated. As a result of this incident, God condemns the Israelites to linger in the wilderness until the current generation of adults dies off.
While the versions concur on major contours of the plot, there are significant differences between them. In Numbers 13:1–2, God requests the reconnaissance mission; in Deuteronomy 1:22, the people do. In Numbers 13:27–29, the scouts offer a mixed report: the land is bounteous and fertile, but its current inhabitants are terrifying. In Deuteronomy 1:25, they offer only a positive report. In Numbers 14:7–9, Joshua and Caleb encourage the Israelites to have faith in God’s ability to grant them victory. In Deuteronomy 1:29–33, Moses plays this role. In Numbers 14:24, 30, God says that only Caleb and Joshua may enter the land of Canaan, with no mention of whether Moses is included with the people or exempted. In Deuteronomy 1:37, Moses is prohibited from entering the land as a consequence of the people’s behavior in this episode.
These discrepancies underscore Deuteronomy’s particular point of view. In Numbers 14:1–4, the people respond to the fearsome account of the land’s inhabitants. Deuteronomy makes the people appear more cowardly: in 1:26–28, the people are too afraid to enter even though they have heard only a positive report. In this parashah, Moses states that he cannot enter the Promised Land as a result of the people’s misdeeds, not his own (as Numbers 20:12 claims).
Retelling events with new—even conflicting—data and perspectives illustrates the ongoing nature of interpretation, already taking place in the Torah itself. Deuteronomy’s retelling of the episode of the scouts demonstrates the effect of the experience of exile on the authors’ self-perception. For the exilic authors of this text, Israel’s history is tragically marked by the people’s inability to sustain their faith in God. For these authors, a primary goal is to encourage their contemporary audience to resist this pattern and abide by the covenant.
<i>The Sending of Scouts</i> (1:19–33) In Numbers 13:2, God begins the campaign for the Promised Land by telling Moses to send scouts into the land of Canaan. Here, that episode opens with Moses’ charge to conquer the land and his assurance that God will guarantee the Israelites’ victory. The people respond by asking Moses to send out scouts. By having the people ask for the reconnaissance mission <i>after</i> Moses has told them that God has guaranteed victory, the authors suggest that the request itself is symptomatic of the people’s lack of faith.

Verse 20



Verse 21

<b><i>take possession.</i></b> The root <i>y-r-sh</i> has a wide range of meanings, including “to take possession by force” and “to inherit.” Those quite different nuances of the root point to the complicated status of the acquisition of the territories identified as the Promised Land. The Bible depicts the entry into the land both as a violent (dis)possession and as a legitimate inheritance of what rightfully belongs to Israel through divine grant (see Joshua 1–Judges 1; see also at Deuteronomy 7:1–5, 24; 12:29–31; 31:16).
<i><b>Fear not.</b></i> Confidence in God’s advocacy provides grounds for courage here and in other moments of military conquest and encounter.

Verse 22



Verse 23



Verse 24



Verse 25

<b><i>“It is a good land that our God יהוה is giving to us.”</i></b> This concise report about the positive nature of the land contrasts sharply with the report in Numbers 13:27–29, which emphasizes both the quality of the land and the challenges it presents to conquest.

Verse 26



Verse 27



Verse 28

<b><i>Anakites.</i></b> A people renowned for their mythic size (see at Numbers 13:28).

Verse 29

<b><i>29–33.</i></b> Moses tries to reassure the people by reminding them that they have been witnesses to God’s miraculous power on their behalf. This testimony serves to show how cowardly the earlier generation was and to remind the later generation of God’s past miraculous support of their ancestors.

Verse 30



Verse 31

<b><i>householder…son.</i></b> [Heb. <i>ish…ben.</i> This translation understands the noun <i>ish</i> (traditionally “a man”) as referring to one who represents a group; here, the group is by default a household, the basic social and economic unit in the ancient Near East; and the head of a household, in turn, was presumably male. Responsible for his corporate household’s continuity, a householder was expected to invest time and attention on raising his heir <i>(The Contemporary Torah,</i> 2006, pp. 385, 402). Certain biblical texts formally ascribe to the father the parental role as a child’s protector and guide, as in Psalm 103:13 and Job 29:16.
Alternatively, one can translate this verse’s simile in a gender-neutral sense: “as a parent carries a child.” In ancient Israel, both women and men cared for children. A notable example of a mother physically carrying her child is when Abraham places Ishmael on Hagar’s shoulder as he sends them away (Genesis 21:14).
Since this simile aims to describe God’s actions on Israel’s behalf, it is worthwhile to keep in mind that while a number of passages depict God metaphorically as a father (see at Deuteronomy 32:6), others avoid gender specification for parents. For instance, the metaphoric parent who gently nurtures Israel in Hosea 11 could be read either as mother or father. However, a few verses in the Bible clearly depict God in a maternal role. For example, the maternal imagery in the prophecies of consolation in Isaiah 40–66 describe both God’s power (Isaiah 42–14) and God’s unending devotion to Israel (Isaiah 49:14; 66:13). Likewise, Numbers 11:12 alludes to God as the one who gave birth to and cares for Israel (see also at Deuteronomy 32:13, 18). At its core, the imagery here conveys God’s solicitous care for Israel, without necessarily reflecting on God’s perceived gender. —<i>Ed.</i>]

Verse 32



Verse 33



Verse 34

<i>The Consequences</i> (1:34–46) In Numbers, God responds angrily to the Israelites’ fear and resistance and decides that none of the adult generation will live to enter the Promised Land except for Caleb and Joshua (see further at Numbers 14:10–38, especially at v. 21). In Moses’ retelling here, even Moses will be prohibited from entering the land on account of the people’s actions. When the Israelites hear God’s decree, they repent of their fearfulness and prepare themselves to obey God’s command to conquer the land. God, however, warns Moses that God will not support this mission and it will fail.

Verse 35



Verse 36

<b><i>Caleb.</i></b> A chieftain from the tribe of Judah (Numbers 13:6). According to Numbers 14:6–9, Caleb and Joshua were the two scouts who assured the people that with God’s help they could conquer the land of Canaan. According to Judges 1:12–15, Caleb and his tribe will lead the Israelites’ campaign when entering the land. He will then offer his daughter Achsah as a prize to the warrior who captures the town of Kiriath-sepher.

Verse 37

<b><i>Because of you.</i></b> Deuteronomy conforms to the tradition that Moses was not allowed to enter the Promised Land but blames God’s prohibition on the people’s actions. In contrast, Numbers 20:12 implies that Moses himself is responsible for this punishment.

Verse 38

<b><i>Joshua.</i></b> See at 1:36.

Chapter 2



Verse 1

ENCOUNTERS WITH FOREIGN NATIONS (2:1–3:11) This section recounts Israel’s encounters with five nations in the area nowadays known as Trans-jordan. In the first three episodes, God commands Israel not to militarily confront Edom (2:2–7), Moab (2:8–12), and Ammon (2:16–23) because they are Israel’s kin. Rather, the Israelites are instructed to ask permission to pass peaceably through these foreign lands and to purchase food and water. In the latter two episodes, God commands Israel to wage war against Heshbon (2:24–37) and Bashan (3:1–7) and to conquer their lands. In contrast to the rebelliousness seen in the prior section, Israel here follows God’s commands exactly and emerges unscathed from the first three encounters and victorious in the last two.
<i>Peaceful Encounters with Edom, Moab, and Ammon</i> (2:1–23) The parashah offers two reasons for God’s command to behave peaceably toward these nations, all three of which are located in modern-day Jordan. First, they are described as Israel’s kin: the Edomites are the descendants of Esau; Moab and Ammon are the descendants of Lot. (On the origin of Moab and Ammon from the sexual union between Lot and his unnamed daughters, see at Genesis 19:30–38.) Secondly, as members of the Abrahamic family tree, these nations also are recipients of divinely granted territory (2:5, 9, 19), which they gained by dispossessing earlier residents of the land (just as Israel is about to dispossess the Canaanites). This assertion communicates several cultural and theological messages: it emphasizes that the Israelites have a privileged relationship with nations that are considered their “kin”; and it argues that God controls the history and territory of all the nations in Israel’s purview, not just Israel itself.
The events recounted in this passage are found elsewhere in the Torah (Numbers 20–22 and Deuteronomy 23). Each of these traditions agrees that Israel never had a military conflict with Ammon, Moab, or Edom during their journey from Egypt to Canaan. However, they differ in their explanations why. In Numbers 20–22 the Edomites do not grant permission to pass through the land; Israel then turns away and takes another route. Numbers 21:24, which is difficult to decipher, suggests that Israel did not cross over into Ammonite territory because the Ammonites were strong. Deuteronomy 23:4–5 states that the Ammonites and Moabites are to be forever excluded from membership in Israel because “they did not meet you with food and water on your journey after you left Egypt,” which then becomes a rationale for the exclusion of foreign wives (see at 2:13). In this section of Deuteronomy, Israel is portrayed not as weak, but rather as obedient to God’s command and respectful of both kinship relationships and God’s geopolitical plans and decisions (compare 7:7).

Verse 2



Verse 3



Verse 4

<b><i>your kin, the descendants of Esau.</i></b> “Kin” is a key concept in the laws of Deuteronomy, where it signifies those toward whom each individual Israelite has a heightened relationship of responsibility. By identifying the Edomites as “kin,” this text suggests that they too, have a privileged relationship with the Israelites and that their rights, especially their property rights, are to be respected. (See 23:8–9, which permits their inclusion with Israel in the third generation.)

Verse 8



Verse 9

<b><i>9–13–13</i></b>. These comments about Moab closely parallel the previous section about Edom, with the addition of a digression regarding the occupation history of the lands of Moab and Edom. Both territories were formerly inhabited by strong peoples who were dispossessed as part of God’s plan of conquest and land distribution. The territory of Moab carries the name given by Lot’s eldest daughter to her son born of the incestuous relations with her father (see Genesis 19:30–38). This myth of origin reveals the Israelites’ complicated attitude toward the Moabites: while they are kin, they are also the product of a deeply transgressive sexual union. The book of Ruth, about a Moabite woman who becomes the wife of a Judahite man and great-grandmother of King David, illustrates another facet of the complicated attitude.

Verse 10

<b><i>as tall as the Anakites.</i></b> See at 1:28.

Verse 11



Verse 12

<b><i>just as Israel did in the land they were to possess.</i></b> The use of the past tense is anachronistic in the context of Moses’ speech since the conquest has not yet occurred. This discrepancy reminds readers that Deuteronomy as a whole is addressed to a later, post-conquest audience.

Verse 13

 The peaceful crossing that is recounted here contrasts somewhat with descriptions in Nehemiah 13:1–3, which imply some hostility from Moab. This hostility justifies the later exclusion of the Moabites, along with the Ammonites, from the Israelite community (23:4–7). Marriage with Ammonite and Moabite women is presented as a problem in Ezra 9–10 and Nehemiah 13, books dealing with the postexilic restructuring of Jewish life in Judah in the 5th century <small>B.C.E.</small>; but the book of Ruth offers a different perspective.

Verse 14

<b><i>14–15.</i></b> These verses mark the transition between the generation of the exodus and the generation of the conquest, as well as the transition between the wandering in the wilderness and the beginning of the acquisition of the Promised Land.

Verse 15

<b><i>Indeed, the hand of יהוה.</i></b> This verse emphasizes that the deaths of the warriors were ordained and executed by God—and were not a natural part of the cycle of generations.

Verse 16

<b><i>16–23.</i></b> This passage describes encounters with Ammon in a way that parallels the two previous passages (vv. 2–7, 8–12); and like the one concerning Moab, it includes a digression about the occupation history of the land in question. The territory of Ammon, north of Moab, bears the name given by Lot’s younger daughter to her son from the incestuous relations with her father (see at 2:9–13 and Genesis 19:37).

Verse 24

<i>Battles against Amorite Kings</i> (2:24–3:11) This passage tells of the first of Israel’s conquests east of the Jordan and marks a transition from the peaceful encounters with Israel’s kin to the military conquest of the Promised Land. The text justifies the occupation of the Amorites’ land in three ways. First, in contrast to the prior sections dealing with Edom, Moab, and Ammon, this section omits any reference to a divine land grant to the Amorites, which suggests that the Amorites’ sovereignty is not expressly authorized by God and thus is invalid. Second, the text offers a belated moral justification for the conquest, for vv. 26–31 recall how Moses asks Sihon, the Amorite king, to allow the Israelites to pass freely through his land; but God hardens Sihon’s heart, and the king refuses to grant them passage. Third, the conquest of the Amorites serves as evidence for the idea that if the Israelites obey God’s commands, they will be rewarded with military victory.
This passage raises questions for contemporary readers, as it reveals the Bible’s own ambivalence about what qualifies as proper justification for conquest. Does one people’s moral transgressions justify military aggression by another people? Is any land not explicitly granted by God fair game for God’s chosen people? What is, or should be, the role of moral and theological considerations in political and military action?
<b><i>Up! Set out across the wadi Arnon.</i></b> This verse echoes God’s initial charge to the Israelites in 1:7, thus impressing upon the reader that this moment is a fresh beginning. It is a chance to correct the earlier mistakes that tragically derailed Israel’s initial approach to the Promised Land.

Verse 25



Verse 26

<b><i>26–29.</i></b> King Sihon’s refusal of the offer of peace justifies the Israelite conquest of his lands.

Verse 27



Verse 28



Verse 29



Verse 30

<b><i>because יהוה had…hardened his heart.</i></b> This verse recalls God’s hardening of Pharaoh’s heart (see Exodus 9:12; 10:20, 27; 11:10). In both stories, God causes a foreign leader to oppose Israel so that God will have the opportunity to demonstrate God’s power and allegiance to Israel in response.

Verse 31

<b><i>31–37. See, I begin by placing Sihon…just as our God יהוה had commanded.</i></b> This is an example of a case in which God commands the Israelites to fight a war whose outcome God has already guaranteed.

Verse 32



Verse 33



Verse 34

<b><i>we doomed every town—men, women, and children.</i></b> The high degree of destruction depicted in this passage demonstrates that the Israelites are not fighting for mercenary reasons. Here, they take no prisoners but do retain booty. Other stories of wars describe how they destroy all property in order to demonstrate the purity of their motives (see 1 Samuel 15:3).

Verse 35



Verse 36



Verse 37

<b><i>our God יהוה had commanded.</i></b> Along with the prior verse, this one emphasizes the convergence of God’s will and Israel’s obedience to both God’s active and restrictive commands. They fought their designated enemy but did not encroach on the neighboring lands that were forbidden to them.

Verse 11

<b><i>His bedstead…nine cubits long.</i></b> Og’s bed would have been about 13½ feet (more than 4 meters) long, demonstrating that he was a giant.

Verse 12

<i>Moses’ Allotment of Land East of the Jordan</i> (3:12–20)
In Numbers 32, the cattle-rearing tribes of Reuben and Gad ask Moses to take possession of these territories because they provide good grazing land. The half-tribe of Manasseh is also granted part of this East Jordanian territory. In the present text, the high concentration of the words “land,” “take possession,” and “I am giving to you” underscores a central concern: to show that the occupation of the land of Canaan and the lands across the Jordan are the results of God’s “giving” of the territory to Israel as a possession or inheritance.

Verse 13

<b><i>Manasseh.</i></b> Numbers 27 and 36 mention the five daughters of Zelophehad (Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Tirzah, and Milcah) among the heirs of the Manasseh clans. Joshua 17 describes how these women receive their land.

Verse 21

<i>Moses’ Charge to Joshua</i> (3:21–22)

Verse 22



Verse 23

<i>Moses’ Plea to Enter the Land</i> (3:23–29)
This unit continues Moses’ review of the Israelites’ journey to the plains of Moab, in the lower Jordan valley. In preparing the people to enter the land, Moses explains why he cannot go forth with them. Earlier he blamed the people for his not being allowed to enter the land (1:37); here he discloses how he unsuccessfully beseeched God to reconsider.

Verse 24



Verse 25



Verse 26

<b><i>was wrathful.</i></b> Heb. <i>vayitaber.</i> There is a word play between this word and <i>eb’rah-na,</i> “let me cross over” in the previous verse. The root <i>e-b-r</i> is repeated numerous times in the previous parashah (for example, 2:14; 3:21), highlighting the theme of “crossing over” at the beginning of Deuteronomy.
<i><b>on your account.</b></i> Moses again blames the Israelites for his punishment, as in 1:37. In contrast, Numbers 20 (where Moses strikes the rock to produce water) depicts the punishment as Moses’ fault. This inconsistency exemplifies one of several contradictions between Deuteronomy’s account of the wilderness journey and that of Exodus and Numbers (see at 1:9–18, 1:19–46). While Moses interprets God’s response and behavior as anger (see also 4:21), one might also see a nurturing hand in God’s allowing Moses to see the land and assuring him of an integral role in passing on leadership to Joshua.

Chapter 4



Verse 1

<i>Exhortations to Keep God’s Commandments</i>
WHY FOLLOW THE LAWS (4:1–40)
Moses’ speeches at the start of Deuteronomy retell—and reinterpret—the formative events in Israel’s journey as a way of exhorting his audience to obey the instructions. He argues that God’s teachings must be followed strictly since there are dire consequences for disobeying them. At the same time, he emphasizes that these precepts should be obeyed because they provide Israel wisdom and discernment that will make this nation honored by other nations. Moses uses a combination of threats and promises to stress the need to follow these teachings even when he is no longer present as an intermediary and interpreter.
Here, as elsewhere, Deuteronomy speaks to multiple audiences: those who are described in the text as standing in Moab listening to Moses’ words; the contemporaries of the exilic writers who composed the literary framework of the book (1:1–4:40; 31:1–34:12); and subsequent generations of readers. (See also the introduction to <i>parashat D’varim</i>.)
EXHORTATIONS TO KEEP GOD’S COMMANDMENTS AS COMMUNICATED (4:1–8)
One way that Moses teaches the importance of obeying God’s commandments is by emphasizing the lessons learned from personal experience. Here, he calls attention to what the people saw with their “own eyes” (v. 3) at Baal-peor.

Verse 2



Verse 3

<b><i>Baal-peor.</i></b> This refers to the incident in which some Israelite men lusted after foreign women who lured them into worship of their deity, Baal-peor (Numbers 25). In Numbers 31:14–18, Moses blames God’s anger on the women, who are presented as seductive and dangerous; here, he makes no mention of the women.

Verse 4



Verse 5

<b><i>5–8.</i></b> One reason for observing the laws is that other nations will admire the Israelites for being wise enough to follow a responsive God who has established good and right precepts.

Verse 6



Verse 7



Verse 8

<b><i>Teaching.</i></b> Heb. <i>torah.</i> This term refers to the written teachings contained in the book of Deuteronomy. Later tradition enlarges the notion of <i>torah</i> to include Genesis through Deuteronomy. (See also at 31:9.)

Verse 9

EXHORTATIONS TO REMEMBER THE REVELATION AT HOREB (SINAl) (4:9–14) Moses calls upon the people to remember something that they supposedly witnessed with their “own eyes” (v. 9; also vv. 3, 34). Here the memory of a past event—the revelation at Horeb—is intended to motivate future observance of the covenant. Note, however, that almost none of the presumed audience would have been physically present at that historic moment, except perhaps as children (see at Numbers 14:10–38).

Verse 10

 The text places a tremendous emphasis on memory and the need to pass information to the next generation. Shared memories of the past also shape and contribute to a community’s identity as a people.
<i><b>Horeb.</b></i> The book of Deuteronomy refers to Mount Sinai as Horeb (see at Exodus 18:5).

Verse 11



Verse 12



Verse 13



Verse 14



Verse 15

EXHORTATIONS REGARDING GOD’S UNIQUE NATURE (4:15–40) Israel’s absolute loyalty to their one God is a key concern in this parashah and elsewhere in Deuteronomy.

Verse 16

 One lesson to be learned from God’s formless revelation at Horeb (Sinai) is that Israel must not make any sculptured images of God.
<i><b>form of a man or a woman.</b></i> Literally, “…a male or a female.” The wording of this verse’s prohibition suggests that some Israelites conceived of their God in both female and male terms.

Verse 17



Verse 18



Verse 19

<b><i>19–20.</i></b> As part of his warning against idolatry, Moses forbids the worship of the celestial bodies. The passage states that God divided the heavenly beings among the other nations but selected Israel as God’s own possession. In other words, God sanctioned the non-Israelites to worship lesser divine entities but restricted the Israelites to worship God alone. Verse 19 plays a central role in debates about the development of monotheism; for more on this subject, see at 4:35; 6:4; 32:8; Exodus 15:11; and Another View.

Verse 20



Verse 21



Verse 22



Verse 23



Verse 24

<b><i>God is a consuming fire.</i></b> It is significant that as Moses delivers his farewell address, he refers to God as a consuming fire; he first met God in a fire that did not consume the bush (Exodus 3:2).
<i><b>impassioned God.</b></i> See at 5:9.

Verse 25

<b><i>25–31.</i></b> Demanding absolute loyalty to the one God, Moses warns the Israelites that if they make idols they will be exiled from the land they currently wait to enter. According to some who date much of Deuteronomy to the 7th century <small>B.C.E</small>., this passage addresses an audience in Judah that fears imminent exile, having witnessed the exile of the Northern Kingdom of Israel in 722 <small>B.C.E.</small> Others who date Deuteronomy 4 even later, to the Babylonian exile, see this warning as an explanation after the fact, indicating why exile happened and offering comfort that restoration is possible.

Verse 26

<b><i>I call…to witness.</i></b> See at 32:1.

Verse 27



Verse 28



Verse 29



Verse 30



Verse 31

<b><i>[God] will not forget the covenant.</i></b> Moses gives the Israelites this assurance as he admonishes them not to forget the events of the past (v. 9) and the lessons imparted from those experiences.
<i><b>fathers.</b></i> Heb. <i>avot.</i> According to translator David Stein, this term can have either a male-only or an inclusive sense, depending on context. He argues that here the term refers specifically to the patriarchs (Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob), those with whom God formed a covenant in their capacity as (male) heads of their corporate households. It goes without saying that each patriarch represents the entire household, and that God’s covenant applies to all its members—women and men alike (“Methodology,” <i>The Torah: Documentation for the Revised Edition</i>, 2005, p. 6).

Verse 32

<b><i>32–40.</i></b> Starting with a series of rhetorical questions, this passage illustrates the uniqueness of God’s relationship with Israel—perhaps the most important reason for observing God’s laws—by retelling a sequence of spectacular and seemingly impossible events, including the redemption from Egypt and revelation of God’s words.

Verse 33



Verse 34



Verse 35

<b><i>יהוה alone is God; there is none else.</i></b> This verse and v. 39 clearly and directly affirm the monotheistic belief in a single deity. In contrast, other passages in Deuteronomy reflect an acceptance that other gods existed, even though Israel was commanded to worship the one God exclusively; scholars refer to this belief as monolatry (see 5:7 in the Decalogue, as well as at 4:19–20; 6:4; 32:8; Exodus 15:11; and Another View).

<i>Interlucde</i>
CITIES OF REFUGE (4:41–43)
Moses sets aside three cities of refuge on the eastern side of the Jordan for people who kill inadvertently, in addition to the three cities already set aside elsewhere in the country (see at Numbers 35:1–34). Perhaps this way of dealing with sins committed by accident can be seen as a comfort to the Israelites who feared Moses’ description of God’s passionate, demanding nature (see at 5:9).
On the gender of the killer, of the victim, and of the blood-avenger, see at Numbers 35:6, 11, and 12, respectively.

Verse 42



Verse 43



Verse 44

<i>Review of Horeb (Sinai)</i>
WHAT LAWS TO FOLLOW (4:44–5:30)
The Decalogue (“Ten Commandments”) first appears in Exodus 20. Here Moses restates these precepts, framing them with a recollection of how the people stood at the mountain in awe and fear and asked him to be their intermediary. This retelling aims to connect the new generation with its past.
INTRODUCTION AND SETTING THE SCENE (4:44–5:5)
In line with Deuteronomy’s emphasis on transmitting tradition, this section addresses the audience as if these events are part of its remembered experience. In so doing, the text makes the past a present experience as well.
<b><i>This is the Teaching that Moses set before the Israelites.</i></b> In many if not most synagogues, this verse <i>(v’zot hatorah</i>…) is recited liturgically when the Torah is lifted for reading in public.

Verse 45

<b><i>45–49.</i></b> This passage tracks the Israelites from the exodus from Egypt through wilderness wanderings and military victories (see also 1:1–5).

Chapter 5



Verse 1

<b><i>1–5.</i></b> As Moses expresses the importance of studying and observing the terms of God’s teaching (see also 4:1), he emphasizes the inclusiveness of all Israelites in the covenant.

Verse 2



Verse 3



Verse 4

<b><i>Face to face.</i></b> Even though Moses is the only one who speaks with God “face to face” (Exodus 33:11; compare “mouth to mouth” in Numbers 12:8), he now claims that at Horeb all the people were privy to this same intimate relationship with God. This “revision” presents Moses as one who avoids claiming a privileged relationship with God and instead transfers it to the people as a whole.

Verse 5



Verse 6

THE DECALOGUE (“TEN COMMANDMENTS”) (5:6–18) The Decalogue emphasizes the family unit, including men, women, and children. Three separate commandments in vv. 16–18 deal solely with issues protecting the family. The commandments refer to women repeatedly, making it clear that these laws are considered an obligation for all Israel. For more on the (non) gendered language in the Decalogue and details concerning the structure of these commandments and their ancient Near East context, see at Exodus 20:2–14.
<b><i>who brought you out.</i></b> This verse, which is a statement and not a command per se, establishes the reason why the Israelites should observe God’s laws. While some consider the historical prologue in this verse to be the first “commandment,” others interpret both vv. 6–7 as the first precept (see also at Exodus 20:2); in Torah scrolls, vv. 6–10 are grouped together as one “command.”

Verse 7

<b><i>You shall have no other gods.</i></b> Verses 7–10 establish the preeminent place of God in the world. (See also at Exodus 20:3–5.)

Verse 8



Verse 9

<b><i>impassioned</i></b> Jeffrey Tigay explains that in the Bible the root <i>k-n-a,</i> meaning “to become dark red,” is often associated with fire (as in 4:24) and is used to describe “fiery passions” like love, anger, and jealousy. He writes: “The term reflects the emotional tie between God and Israel that was described metaphorically by the prophets as a marital bond in which [God] is like the husband and Israel a wife” (<i>Deuteronomy</i>, 1996, p. 65). This metaphor captures the expected exclusive nature of the relationship between God and Israel, as well as the jealousy and anger sparked when Israel unfaithfully turns to other gods (see also at 31:16).

Verse 10



Verse 11

<b><i>You shall not swear falsely.</i></b> See at Exodus 20:7.

Verse 12

<b><i>12–15.</i></b> This commandment is explained differently here than in Exodus 20:8–11. Exodus exhorts the Israelites to “remember” the Sabbath, while Deuteronomy commands the Israelites to “observe” the Sabbath. Exodus focuses on God’s resting on the seventh day of creation as the reason for the observance, whereas Deuteronomy connects it to God’s saving of the Israelites from Egypt. Exodus explains how the Sabbath came to be: it portrays God and Moses as proclaiming to newly liberated Israelites that they, like God, must rest on the Sabbath. Deuteronomy, addressed ostensibly to a generation of wilderness-born Israelites who have not experienced slavery, commands them to observe the Sabbath for the sake of their own slaves, lest they forget the historical experiences of their ancestors. [These differences have ramifications for how one understands the Torah as a continuous tradition. The revision reflected in Deuteronomy underscores the fluidity of even the Decalogue, as precepts are revised or reapplied for the circumstances of a new generation. (See further <i>D’varim,</i> Another View.) —<i>Ed.</i>]

Verse 13



Verse 14



Verse 15



Verse 16

<b><i>Honor your father and your mother.</i></b> The commandment to honor one’s parents comes at the center of the Decalogue, and it is one of the few that promises a reward (see also v. 10). This commandment reflects the need to preserve the family structure across generations in order to have a viable community; it helps to maintain parental authority and to ensure for the care of elderly parents. (See also at Exodus 20:12.)
<i><b>mother.</b></i> This is one of several biblical texts that emphasize the mother’s importance (see also at Leviticus 19:3 and at Numbers 11:12). For instance, Genesis emphasizes a mother’s role in the family structure (see Rebekah in Genesis 27–28); Proverbs 1:8 and 6:20 exhort children to be faithful to their mother’s teachings.

Verse 17

<b><i>You shall not commit adultery.</i></b> In the Bible, adultery is defined as sex between a man and a married woman who is not his wife (see also at 22:22 and Exodus 20:13). Thus two commandments preserving the family unit frame the commandment against murder.
<i><b>You shall not bear false witness.</b></i> While this verse has been applied to lying in general, it refers here only to the act of lying as a witness in a legal situation. This prohibition does not apply to many cases in which biblical characters, including women, use deception to subvert those in power and to achieve what, from the biblical perspective, can be considered legitimate ends (as does Rebekah in Genesis 27; see also Abraham at Genesis 12:10–20).

Verse 18

<b><i>You [men] shall not covet your neighbor’s wife.</i></b> The Decalogue ends with another directive to protect the family. The term “covet” implies a more inward emotion. While many have questioned how an emotion can be legislated, others point out that some thoughts can be harmful; thus it is in a person’s best interest to attempt to control ideas in their seedling states. This is one of the places where a commandment implicitly applies only to men; the reverse, a woman coveting her neighbor’s husband, may also be implicit but unacknowledged. (For a different interpretation, see at Exodus 20:14 and <i>Mishpatim,</i> Another View.)
<i><b>house.</b></i> In Exodus 20:14, the order of the words in this commandment is different; there, the mention of a neighbor’s house precedes the mention of his wife. Each version of the Decalogue thus evokes a different meaning of Heb. <i>bayit</i> (“household, house”). In effect, Exodus counts a wife as an element of the household, while Deuteronomy treats her apart from the household’s assets.

Verse 19

THE PEOPLE’S FEARFUL RESPONSE AND CALL FOR MOSES’ INTERCESSION (5:19–24) Moses reminds the people that it was their fear of encountering God directly that placed him in the role of intermediary. In this case, experiencing God did not lead the Israelites to desire a closer, more direct relationship with the Divine. This section may aim to remind the people, in anticipation of Moses’ death, that his role was temporary.

Verse 20



Verse 21



Verse 22



Verse 23



Verse 24



Verse 25

GOD’S RESPONSE TO THE PEOPLE’S REQUEST (5:25–30) Moses adds that God was pleased with the Israelites’ response to the revelation, appreciating the people’s awe and need for an intermediary. Moses promises that if the people and their offspring revere God and obey the commandments, they will flourish in the land, a repeated message in Deuteronomy (see, for example, 7:12–15).

Chapter 6



Verse 1

<i>Additional Teachings</i>
HOW TO FOLLOW THE LAWS (6:1–7:5)
As Moses’ speech turns more to the future, he explains how one must carry out God’s laws. Transmission of the teachings across generations remains a high priority; therefore the emphasis falls on remembering, teaching, and learning, with the love of God as an underlying attitude.
THE CALL TO LOVE THE ONE AND ONLY GOD (6:1–9)
This section includes two central passages in Jewish liturgy: the <i>Sh’ma</i> (6:4) and <i>V’ahavta</i> (6:4–9). The <i>Sh’ma</i> (“Hear”) reminds the Israelites of God’s essence and their relationship with the One God. The <i>V’ahavta</i> (“You shall love”) describes how the people are to internalize the teachings and impart them to future generations.
The <i>Sh’ma</i> and <i>V’ahavta</i> hold special meaning when understood as directives to the Israelites about to cross the Jordan into Israel. At a time so central to the formation of the people, they are told about love and the importance of preserving family, educating one’s children, and maintaining one’s relationship to the Divine. These ideas have helped to sustain the people Israel throughout many years of waiting to “cross the Jordan.”

Verse 2



Verse 3

<b><i>Obey, O Israel, willingly.</i></b> This charge refers to both listening and obeying, with alliteration linking the two words (<i>v’shamata</i> and <i>v’shamarta).</i>

Verse 4

 Given the centrality of the <i>Sh’ma</i> as the “watchword of the Jewish faith,” its meaning is surprisingly uncertain. Because of its grammatical construction and the various nuances of the word <i>echad</i> (translated here as “alone”), this declaration can be construed in different ways. Some translations have rendered it as: “The L<small>ORD</small> our God, the L<small>ORD</small> is one” (see the 1917 Jewish Publication Society translation, which is similar to the 1611 King James Version). Such a translation implies that the <i>Sh’ma</i> is a statement about God’s essence, a reflection of the monotheistic belief in the existence of only one God.
Other translations resemble the one incorporated in this book. This version makes a claim about God’s unique relationship to Israel, without necessarily denying the existence of other divine beings. Bernard Levinson points out: “The verse makes not a quantitative argument (about the number of deities) but a qualitative one about the nature of the relationship between God and Israel” (“Deuteronomy,<i>” Jewish Study Bible,</i> 2004, p. 380). This understanding reflects what many scholars have concluded is a pre-monotheistic Israelite belief called monolatry: the allegiance to one god, while recognizing the existence of other deities. (See also at 4:19–20; 4:35; 32:8; Exodus 15:11; and Another View.)

Verse 5

 <i><b>You shall love</b></i> <b>יהוה</b>. This language is rooted in ancient Near Eastern political treaties, where “love” implies a sense of loyalty to a greater power. The verb conveys not just an emotion, but a statement with implications for one’s actions. God demands intellectual, emotional, and physical commitment. (See also at 7:13.)

Verse 6



Verse 7



Verse 8

<b><i>8–9.</i></b> This passage provides the basis for the laws of <i>t’fillin</i> (phylacteries) and of mezuzah. The idea is that at any time or place, engaged in any activity, one should remain ever mindful of these teachings.
<b><i>sign.</i></b> While this language was probably originally understood figuratively, the practice developed of Jews’ interpreting this verse literally as referring to the physical strapping of specified texts in small boxes called <i>t’fillin</i> onto the arm and head (see at Exodus 13:9).
<i><b>symbol.</b></i> See at Exodus 13:16.

Verse 9

<b><i>inscribe them on the doorposts.</i></b> In the ancient Near East, sacred words were literally written on doorposts and on plaques placed near entranceways; this practice had an apotropaic function, meaning that it was believed to help ward off evil. This evolved into the Jewish practice of writing selections from the Torah on a piece of parchment and affixing it to the doorpost, usually encased in a slender box (called a mezuzah).

Verse 10

THE CALL TO ABSOLUTE LOYALTY TO ISRAEL’S GOD (6:10–19) Moses now discloses the ramifications for how Israel must live in the land. He reminds the Israelites of what God has done in taking them out of Egypt and what this means in terms of God’s relationship to them. Again, he emphasizes the need to transmit the teachings to future generations.
<b><i>10–15.</i></b> Remembering what God has done in the past is a starting point and guide to the future. Memory plays a crucial role in Deuteronomy as a whole and in this parashah in particular. It serves as a basis for gratitude to God and a precondition for keeping the commandments appropriately; it also functions to create and maintain community identity.
<b><i>sworn to your fathers.</i></b> Moses makes connections to the covenant with the patriarchs as a reminder that the relationship between God and Israel did not start at Horeb (Sinai). (On the translation “fathers,” see at 4:31.)

Verse 11



Verse 12

<b><i>12–13. bondage…worship.</i></b> Heb. <i>avadim…taavod.</i> The repetition of the root <i>e-v-d</i> creates a word play that emphasizes the connection between Israel’s obligations to serve (“worship”) God and one of the reasons that they have this obligation.

THE DEMAND TO TEACH FUTURE GENERATIONS ABOUT THE LAWS (6:20–25) Moses emphasizes that education is central to Israel’s survival. Proverbs 1:8 and 6:20 recognize the role of women in teaching future generations, exhorting the child to focus on the father’s instruction and the mother’s teaching (<i>torah</i>).
<b><i>“What mean the decrees?”</i></b> This verse has been incorporated into the Four Children of the Passover Haggadah as the question of the wise child.

Chapter 7



Verse 1

PROHIBITIONS REGARDING THE INHABITANTS OF THE LAND (7:1–5) The call to absolute loyalty to God and the memory of the past become the basis for the demand for complete separation from Israel’s neighbors. Many later readers have struggled with the problematic concept that God charges the Israelites to destroy all the inhabitants when they enter the land. We must confront the fact that this is what the Torah says and be willing to disapprove of it. While we may attempt to understand this rhetoric in its historical context, we can still reject it as something we would not endorse today. In this parashah, the demand to destroy all the Canaanites is presented within a specific understanding of who Israel is at this point in its history: because the Israelites are weak and have demonstrated their inability to resist foreign worship in the past, they are instructed to isolate themselves in order to maintain their identity and remain loyal to their God. (See also at 7:24; 12:29–31; 31:16.) [Some scholars make the point that such calls for destruction most likely reflect the retrojected rhetoric of victory, a claim by later generations that the previous inhabitants were annihilated completely. However, had all the seven nations listed in v. 1 been destroyed, then the command not to intermarry (v. 3) would be irrelevant (see also Exodus 23:32–33 and 34:15–16, which imply the existence of other inhabitants of the land). While conquest certainly involves killing, Deuteronomy’s representation of the wholesale slaughter of every living person (the proclamation of <i>cherem</i>) is unlikely to have been a historical actuality. —<i>Ed.</i>]
 The forbidden nations are only those in the land; the Torah does not advocate hostility to other nations as a general principle.

Verse 2



Verse 3

 The Israelites are directed not to intermarry with the offspring of the neighboring nations. Other biblical texts do not reflect an opposition to unions with non-Israelites (see <i>Mikeitz,</i> Another Contemporary Reflection).

Verse 4



Verse 5



Verse 6

<i>Conclusion</i>
GOD’S LOVE AS REASON FOR THE LAWS (7:6–11)
This is one of the Bible’s strongest statements of God’s special relationship with Israel. God has actively chosen this people and separated them from all others to be God’s people. Therefore, they have the responsibility to maintain a separate identity, to keep themselves holy, and to live up to their side of the covenant with God.
<b><i>a people consecrated.</i></b> Heb. <i>am kadosh,</i> which Jeffrey Tigay connects to its cognate in talmudic Hebrew, <i>m’kudeshet</i> (“betrothed”). He claims that the term invokes a marital metaphor, as in 5:9, implying that the bride Israel commits to an exclusive relationship with her groom, God (<i>Deuteronomy,</i> 1996, p. 68). In contrast to Leviticus 19, which speaks of individual Israelites becoming holy, here Moses declares that the people already are holy.

Verse 7

<b><i>It is not because you are the most numerous.</i></b> In the Bible, God often chooses unlikely heroes (such as Jacob in Genesis 25) and works through the weaker party. This provides reassurance that Israel will not fail because of its small size and signals that success is achievable because of God’s help, not through the work of powerful individuals alone. Women are among those who achieve success, as seen in their successful resistance to Pharaoh’s rule in Exodus 1–2.

Verse 8

<b><i>favored.</i></b> Heb. <i>ahav,</i> literally “loved.” Love serves as a basis for the covenantal relationship between God and Israel (see also at 6:5 and 7:13).

Verse 9

<b><i>9–11.</i></b> The parashah ends by reminding the people that their fulfillment of God’s commandments will determine their destiny. They have the possibility of a long and successful life in their new land, depending upon their actions.

Verse 10



Verse 11



Verse 12

<i>Faithfulness to the Covenant by God and Israel</i> (7:12–8:20)
The first speech in this parashah binds together two distinct passages. The first (7:12–26) concentrates on God’s loyalty to the covenant and blessings for Israel. The second (8:1–20) calls Israel to bless God and accentuates the importance of recognition, remembrance, and obedience to God. These two sections are linked through the repetition of the word <i>eikev</i> and of the verb <i>sh-m-a</i> (“obey” or “heed,” literally “hear”) in the unit’s first and last verses, which also frames this unit within a literary structure known as an inclusio. In 7:12, <i>eikev tishm’un</i> (“if you do obey”) introduces a list of blessings; in 8:20, <i>eikev lo tishm’un</i> (“because you did not heed”) closes the speech with an exhortation about disobedience. Note that these two verses (and the start of the second section, 8:1) speak to the people in the second-person plural, whereas the body of the speech addresses the people overwhelmingly in the singular, thus particularizing its message to each individual.
BLESSINGS AND POSSESSION OF THE LAND (7:12–26)
Verse 12 presents God’s faithfulness to the covenant as a conditional response to the people’s obedience. God’s kindness manifests itself in the blessings elaborated on in this section, which concern the fertility of people, agricultural products, and animals, as well as political dominance over other peoples (see also 15:6; 26:19; Genesis 12:2–3).
<b><i>faithfully.</i></b> Heb. <i>chesed.</i> In this verse, <i>chesed</i> and <i>b’rit</i> (covenant) form a hendiadys (a compound expression for one idea), thus demonstrating that God shows kindness through God’s faithfulness to the covenant with the ancestors and to the Sinai covenant. The word <i>chesed,</i> when used for human relationships, connotes an exceptional good deed done by one toward another, usually with the explicit expectation of an equivalent act in return (for example, Genesis 20:13; 21:23; I Samuel 20:8; II Samuel 2:5). God’s deeds of <i>chesed</i> include acts of strength, victory, salvation, justice, righteousness, and mercy. In all these ways, in fulfillment of the covenantal relationship, God intervenes on behalf of individuals and of the people Israel, showing God’s loyalty and loving-kindness. (See at 5:9 for a discussion of how Deuteronomy and other biblical passages use marriage as a metaphor for the covenantal relationship between God and Israel.)
<i><b>fathers.</b></i> Why is <i>avot</i> translated here as “fathers” (also 7:13; 8:1, 18; 9:5) but elsewhere as “ancestors” (8:3, 16; 10:15)? Translator David Stein explains that this term can have either a male-only or an inclusive meaning, depending on context. He argues that in a verse like this, the noun refers specifically to the patriarchs (Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob), those with whom God formed a covenant in their capacity as (male) heads of their corporate households. It goes without saying that each patriarch represents the entire household, and that God’s covenant applies to all its members—women and men alike (“Methodology,” <i>The Torah: Documentation for the Revised Edition,</i> 2005, p. 6). Elsewhere, as in 8:3, the surrounding context makes the gender-inclusive sense of the term clear.

Verse 13

<b><i>[God] will favor.</i></b> Heb. <i>ahav</i> (literally “love”). Usually, the people are commanded to “love” God (as in 6:5; 11:1); but here the verb designates God’s response to Israel (also 4:37; 10:15; 23:6). The composer(s) of Deuteronomy have borrowed this term from the ancient Near Eastern political sphere of suzerain-vassal relationships, applying it to the Israelite theological sphere of the relationship between God and the people. The people illustrate their love through their loyalty as subjects (vassals) to God; and God (like a suzerain or ruler) demonstrates love to the people through benevolent acts of <i>chesed</i> (see at v. 12).
<i><b>issue from the womb.</b></i> Heb. <i>pri beten</i> (literally “fruit of the belly”), an expression that uses agricultural production as a metaphor for children (so also in reference to animal offspring; see 28:4, 51; 30:9). The noun <i>beten</i> alone commonly refers to the womb, and thus to female fertility and motherhood (as in Genesis 25:23–24; 30:2). Yet here, in the context of a list of agricultural products and possessions that in the biblical world were understood to be the economic responsibility of the male head of the household, the phrase “your <i>pri beten”</i> most likely designates his descendants (so also 28:4, 11, 18, 53; 30:9; see Micah 6:7; Psalm 132:11).

Verse 14

<b><i>no sterile male or female.</i></b> This stands out as the only reference to male infertility in the Bible, in contrast to the usual focus—female sterility (compare Exodus 23:26). The Bible repeatedly emphasizes the importance of human fertility, as seen in the plights of Sarah (Genesis 11–21), Rachel (Genesis 30), and Hannah (I Samuel 1), all of whom suffer because they are infertile or “barren.” It appears that Ruth’s first husband may be infertile, for they are married for ten years before he dies without having children (Ruth 1:4–5); yet when Ruth marries Boaz, she conceives and bears a son (4:13). (For more on ancient approaches to infertility, see <i>Noach,</i> Another View.)

Verse 15



Verse 16



Verse 17

<b><i>17–26.</i></b> This passage elaborates on the three clauses of v. 16 (“You shall destroy…showing them no pity…you shall not worship”). First, vv. 17–21 depict the projected destruction of the Canaanite peoples as a miraculous action, analogous to God’s wondrous acts against the Egyptians. Second, vv. 22–24 assure the Israelites that the occupation will entail a series of military actions in which God will gradually enable the invaders to destroy the local peoples. Third, vv. 25–26 focus on the dangers of personal and cultural-religious connections between Israelites and Canaanites.

Verse 19



Verse 20



Verse 21



Verse 22



Verse 23



Verse 24

<b><i>you shall obliterate their name.</i></b> Elimination of the name serves as a repeated curse in the Bible and extra-biblical sources. Since a name constitutes a person’s identity, not having a name signals non-existence. In a national context, obliteration of the name signifies total extinction of the enemy, beyond their physical termination. (See <i>machah shem,</i> “to blot out a name,” in 9:14; 25:19; 29:19; and Psalm 83:5) <i><b>until you have wiped them out.</b></i> The various verbs used in vv. 20–24 (like “perish,” “dislodge,” “wiped out,” “obliterated”) represent Deuteronomy’s concept of the ban or <i>cherem</i> (see v. 26), signifying the total annihilation of the Canaanite population. This language may reflect rhetoric about Israel’s total possession of the land and not an actual policy or historical fact. Texts such as Judges 1:21–33 and I Kings 9:20–21, along with archeological evidence, indicate that such a ban was never in fact activated. (See also at 2:34; 7:1–5; 12:29–31; 31:16.)

Verse 25

<b><i>abhorrent to your God יהוה.</i></b> Heb. <i>to’evat YHVH,</i> a phrase that occurs repeatedly in Deuteronomy. It uses this expression, or the word <i>to’evah</i> alone, to denote activities that God detests, usually in the religious sphere: idolatry (as here; 13:15; 17:4); certain sacrifices (17:1; 23:19); ritually impure foods (14:3); putting on the apparel of the other sex (22:5); and certain marriages (24:4; compare at Leviticus 18:22). In one instance, Deuteronomy applies the term in the social-moral sphere (namely, falsification of weights and measures, 25:13–16).

Chapter 8



Verse 1

CALL TO OBSERVE AND REMEMBER, REMEMBER AND OBSERVE (8:1–20) This speech is built on two antonyms: remember (<i>z-ch-r</i>) and forget (<i>sh-ch-ch</i>). Verses 2–10 call upon the people to remember two of God’s major gifts: guiding the people through the hardships of the wilderness (vv. 2–5), and giving them the good land (vv. 7–10). Then, vv. 11–20 warn the people that once they settle in the land, human arrogance and idol worship—the results of forgetting God—will lead to annihilation (see also 6:10–15; 11:13–17; 32:13–18).

Verse 2

<b><i>2–3. in order to test you…in order to teach you.</i></b> This passage presents the hardships in the wilderness not as a punishment (compare Numbers 14:26–38) but as having two other purposes. The first reason was for God to gain definitive knowledge concerning Israel’s faith and behavior under stressful circumstances (see also Exodus 15:25; 16:4); this notion of a trial implies that God is not omniscient (see also Genesis 22:1–12; Deuteronomy 13:4; Judges 2:22; 3:4; Job 1:8–12). The second reason is didactic in nature: having completed the journey, only in retrospect will the people acknowledge that the hunger and the manna signify their dependence on God.
<i><b>ancestors.</b></i> See at 7:12.

Verse 3



Verse 4



Verse 5

<b><i>householder…son.</i></b> [Heb. <i>ish…ben.</i> This translation understands the noun <i>ish</i> (traditionally “a man”) as referring to one who represents a group. Here, the group is by default a household, the basic social and economic unit in the ancient Near East; and the head of a household, in turn, was presumably male. Responsible for his corporate household’s continuity, a householder characteristically groomed his heir—that is, his son—to take over his father’s position of responsibility <i>(The Contemporary Torah,</i> 2006, pp. 385, 402).
Alternatively, one can translate this verse’s simile in a gender-neutral sense: “as a parent disciplines a child.” The book of Proverbs provides support for a gender-inclusive interpretation of the language in this verse. The role of both parents in educating a child is apparent in Proverbs 1:8, which urges the reader both to obey the father’s <i>musar</i> (discipline) and not to forsake the mother’s <i>torah</i> (instruction). (See also Proverbs 6:20).
Regardless of whether or not the imagery is read gender inclusively, God’s perceived gender is not at issue. Drawing an analogy from parental discipline, this verse exalts divine chastisement coupled with care and affection (see Proverbs 19:18; 29:17). Compare at Deuteronomy 1:31. —<i>Ed.</i>]

Verse 6



Verse 7

<b><i>7–10.</i></b> In marked contrast to the wilderness (see Numbers 20:5), this passage depicts the Promised Land as a place of plenitude and prosperity—with water, abundant agricultural products, and natural resources. This description displays an elevated style: first, the phrase “good land” frames the passage (an inclusio), occurring at its beginning and end; and second, the symbolically complete number seven appears twice: the key word <i>eretz</i> (land) occurs seven times, and the list of agricultural species includes seven items (v. 8).

Verse 8

<b><i>wheat and barley, of vines, figs, and pomegranates…olive trees and honey.</i></b> Deuteronomy elsewhere (as in 7:13) categorizes the land’s produce via a triplet of agricultural staples: <i>dagan</i> (grain), <i>tirosh</i> (juice of the grapevine), and <i>yitzhar</i> (olive oil). The chain of trees in this verse suggests that the last item refers not to bee honey but rather a similar food made from mashed palm-dates (see also at Numbers 13:27).

Verse 17

<b><i>17–18.</i></b> Because material success can bring pride and boastfulness, Moses reminds the people that God is the provider of power and success (see also Zechariah 4:6).

Verse 18



Verse 19

 The Bible often connects human arrogance to idol worship, since idols are hand-made statues (as in 32:15–16; Isaiah 2:7–22; 44:9–20; Hosea 14:4).

Chapter 9



Verse 1

<i>Principles of Reverence</i>
WHAT DOES GOD DEMAND OF YOU? (9:1–10:22)
Focusing on theological and ideological implications of dispossessing the Canaanite peoples, Moses’ second speech repudiates thoughts of superiority—the idea that God gave Israel the land because of their righteousness. On the contrary, the Israelites have already proven their stubborn and rebellious behavior (9:6–24). Only because of Moses, who repeatedly prayed on the people’s behalf (vv. 18, 25), did God forgo their annihilation and allow the journey to resume (10:10–11). In reply to the question “What does your God יהוה demand of you?” (10:12), this speech answers with four principles: reverence, obedience, love, and worship.
POSSESSION OF THE LAND BY A STIFF-NECKED PEOPLE (9:1–6)
Moses emphasizes that while the Canaanites’ forthcoming defeat can be explained as retaliation for their wickedness (see Genesis 15:16), this does not mean that Israel’s victory is due to their own virtues, nor is it a reward for their merits (compare 6:25; 24:13). Instead, God’s loyalty to the oath to the ancestors is what maintains Israel’s title to the land.

Verse 2



Verse 3

<b><i>a devouring fire.</i></b> This phrase transforms the allusion to the pillar of fire that guides the people during the wilderness wanderings (Exodus 13:21–22; 40:38; compare at Deuteronomy 4:24). This verse depicts God as a Warrior who will lead the people in battle as they conquer the land. (On the warrior metaphor, see further at 32:23; Exodus 14:14, 15:3; and <i>Haazinu,</i> Another View.)

Verse 4



Verse 5



Verse 6



Verse 7

RETROSPECTIVE OF WILDERNESS SINS (9:7–24) The verbal roots <i>k-tz-f</i> (“to provoke anger”) and <i>m-r-h</i> (“to be defiant”) serve as key words in this section, which recalls five sins that occurred in the wilderness: the Golden Calf incident (Exodus 32) and the sins at Taberah (Numbers 11:1–3), at Massah (Exodus 17:1–7), at Kibroth-hattaavah (Numbers 11:4–34), and at Kadesh-barnea (Numbers 14). This retrospective follows the journey from the establishment of the covenant in Horeb (called Sinai in Deuteronomy) to Kadesh, which designates the arrival at the border of the land (1:2, 19).

Verse 8

 The accounts of the Golden Calf episode in Exodus 32 and Deuteronomy 9 both treat the “molten calf” as a case of idol worship rather than as an attempt to create a physical sign of God’s presence (on the nature of the sin, see at Exodus 32:1–6). However, the present retelling shows several differences in comparison to the Exodus version (see below).

Verse 18

<b><i>I threw myself down before יהוה.</i></b> Moses recalls three times in which he prayed on behalf of the people for forty days and nights (9:18, 25–29; 10:10–11). In contrast, Exodus mentions only one prayer (32:11–13) and connects the fasting only to the second tablets (34:28). In his prayers on the people’s behalf, Moses establishes a model of the prophet as intercessor between God and the people.

Verse 19



Verse 20

<b><i>יהוה was angry enough with Aaron to have destroyed him.</i></b> In Exodus 32, Aaron takes center stage as the major character as well as the major culprit. In contrast, this passage minimizes Aaron’s role to this one verse and focuses instead on God’s anger and Moses’ role as intercessor, this time for Aaron’s benefit.

Verse 21



Verse 22



Verse 23



Verse 24



Verse 25

REAFFIRMATION THAT ISRAEL IS GOD’S PEOPLE (9:25–10:11) In this section, Moses recounts the aftermath of the Golden Calf incident—how God refrained from the express intention to destroy Israel in the wilderness, restored the covenant through the second set of tablets, and continued to lead them to the Promised Land (10:6–11). In contrast to God’s previous destructive intentions (9:11–14), this section reaffirms God’s commitments to the people and recounts the deeds performed to fulfill those promises.

Verse 26

<b><i>26–29.</i></b> <i><b>I prayed to</b></i> <b>יהוה</b>. Moses presents three main reasons to refrain from destroying Israel: God’s own efforts (9:26, 29), God’s people (9:27), and God’s enemies—the Egyptians (9:28).

Verse 27

 In Exodus 32:13, Moses invokes the patriarchs in order to call to mind God’s loyalty to the earlier promises. Here, he likewise mentions Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, but for a different purpose: to set up a contrast with their sinful descendants.

Verse 4



Verse 5

<b><i>I deposited the tablets in the ark.</i></b> In Deuteronomy, the Ark serves as a container to protect the tablets, just as ancient Near Eastern officials deposited political treaties in their cities’ temples. In contrast, Exodus conceives of the Ark as God’s throne, a symbol of God’s presence, as well as a container for the Tablets of the Pact (see at Exodus 25:10–22).

Verse 6



Verse 7



Verse 8

 <b>יהוה</b> <b><i>set apart the tribe of Levi.</i></b> Choosing the Levites for certain religious responsibilities is presented as a further consequence of the Golden Calf incident, in recognition of when the men of Levi rallied to Moses’ call and killed 3,000 perpetrators (Exodus 32:26–29). In specifying the roles of the tribe of Levi, Deuteronomy presents an inclusive approach to “the priests, sons of Levi” (21:5; see at 18:1), in contrast to the distinction in priestly texts between the descendants of Aaron, who serve as priests (<i>kohanim</i>), and the other descendants of Levi, who are referred to simply as “Levites” (Numbers 3–4).

Verse 9



Verse 10



Verse 11

<b><i>“Up, resume.”</i></b> Heb. <i>kum lech,</i> which evokes God’s previous command to Moses following the construction of the calf—<i>kum red,</i> “Hurry, go down” (9:12)—and signals the reconciliation in the relationship between God and Israel.
<i><b>possess the land.</b></i> Moses concludes the retelling of the covenant’s restoration by returning to the main theme of this sermon: the possession of the Promised Land (9:1–6).

Verse 12

CALL FOR REVERENCE, OBEDIENCE, LOVE, AND WORSHIP (10:12–22) Based on this rebellious history, Moses outlines five principal demands for the people to follow in order to ensure that they thrive once they enter the land: to revere, to walk, to love, to serve, to keep (vv. 12–13). The force of these requirements lies in their inclusive, general character (compare the detailed commandments in Exodus 34:10–26).

Verse 13



Verse 14



Verse 15



Verse 16

<b><i>Cut away, therefore, the thickening about your hearts.</i></b> Literally, “circumcise the foreskin of your heart.” This expression refers to the metaphoric removal of the emotional blocks that prevent the people from following God’s teachings and that result in their rebellious behavior (see also at 30:6; Leviticus 26:41; Jeremiah 4:4).

Verse 17

<b><i>God supreme and Lord supreme.</i></b> Literally, “the god of gods, and the lord of lords.” Ancient Near Eastern texts employ these two epithets as royal attributes. Here and elsewhere, Deuteronomy refers to the existence of other deities, in relation to which God proves incomparable in majesty and powers (see also at 4:19–20; 6:4; 32:8). [Calling God the “lord of lords” takes for granted the ancient Near Eastern hierarchies of status and gender, while proclaiming that God’s authority transcends even male authority figures. —<i>Ed</i>] <i><b>who shows no favor and takes no bribe.</b></i> Verses 17–18 depict God metaphorically as the ideal ruler. The first part of this verse reflects one of the king’s major roles: to be a mighty warrior. This second part refers to the king’s other key function: to be a judge who defends the poor and needy with justice and loving-kindness (as in Psalms 72; 146:5–10). [Recourse to male imagery does not necessarily mean that the composer(s) of Deuteronomy conceived of Israel’s God as a male being. See further at 33:5. <i>—Ed.</i>]

Verse 18

<b><i>the fatherless and the widow…the stranger.</i></b> Heb. <i>yatom v’almanah…ger.</i> These are the three disadvantaged members of the society for whom Deuteronomy repeatedly demands legal protection (24:17–18; 27:19) and economic support (14:28–29; 16:11, 14; 24:19–21; 26:12–13; note that the landless Levite is included among the needy).
Our verse is unique in presenting God in two roles, both as their legal defender (“upholds the cause of”) and as their provider (“providing food and clothing”); compare Exodus 22:20–23; Psalm 146:9. (See also Another View.)

Verse 19

<b><i>the stranger.</i></b> Heb. <i>ger</i> refers to those who are alien to their place of sojourn, like Abraham immigrating to Canaan (Genesis 23:4), Moses in Jethro’s house (Exodus 2:22), and most of all, Israel as strangers in Egypt (Genesis 15:13), a key part of Israel’s national consciousness. Based on the memory of this experience, all biblical legal collections empathetically demand the favorable treatment of strangers, including their legal and economic protection (see also Exodus 22:20; 23:9; Leviticus 19:34).

Chapter 11



Verse 1

<i>Occupation of the Land as Divine Reward or Punishment</i> (11:1–25)
The third speech of <i>Eikev</i> continues Deuteronomy’s characteristic attitude toward time: the notion that historical observations provide central lessons for the present, and critical signs for the future. This sermon concentrates on the future possession and inheritance of the land, promising prosperity as the major reward for obedience, while threatening total annihilation in retaliation for disobedience.
PAST LESSONS AS MOTIVATION FOR FUTURE ACTIONS (11:1–9)
In the middle of the demand to obey God’s commandments (v. 1) and the promised reward of possessing and enduring upon the land (vv. 8–9), a long and complicated sentence (vv. 2–7) sets the present wilderness generation apart from their descendants (compare the distinction between the present generation and their ancestors in 5:2–5). The verb <i>raah</i> (“to see” or “to witness”) recurs twice (vv. 2, 7), the first time in conjunction with the verb <i>yada</i> (“to know” or “to experience”), thus demonstrating that the major generational difference resides in the actual, first-hand witnessing of God’s deeds. This cardinal concept of a direct experience of God’s involvement in Israel’s history governs the historical consciousness of Israel, as exemplified by the repeated command to retell the story of the exodus to one’s children (Exodus 12:26–27; 13:14; Deuteronomy 6:20–21), as well as in the historical recitation at the first-fruit ceremony (26:5–10) and the ratification of the covenant on the Plains of Moab (28:69–30:20).

Verse 2



Verse 3



Verse 4



Verse 5

 <i><b>what</b></i> [<b><i>God</i></b>] <b><i>did for you.</i></b> Rather, “what [God] did <i>to</i> you.” In the Hebrew, Moses employs the expression “<i>asah l–</i>” four times in this passage; in v. 3, it is translated as “performed…against,” and as “did to” in vv. 4 and 6. Although the Hebrew preposition can have either meaning, here it should be understood in line with the rest of this passage, in which the enumerated divine deeds are all punitive, aimed at the Egyptians (vv. 3–4) and Israelites alike (vv. 5–6).

Verse 6



Verse 7



Verse 8



Verse 9



Verse 10

SPECIAL QUALITIES OF THE LAND AND INCENTIVES TO OBEY GOD (11:10–21) In this part of his speech, Moses draws attention to geographical and climatic qualities of the Promised Land, resulting in the marked differences between agriculture in Israel and Egypt. The ability to enjoy the special features of the land will depend on the people’s conduct.
<b><i>watered by your own labors.</i></b> Literally, “watered by your foot.” With the Nile as its main, year-round water source, Egypt’s agriculture is based on an irrigation system of ditches, canals, and reservoirs constructed to lead the water from the river to the fields. Farmers control the water flow to each field by using the heels of their feet to easily open a channel in the simple dirt ridges of the irrigation system.

Verse 11

 Since Israel depends on seasonal rains, its agriculture differs dramatically from that of Egypt. The water resources are never assured, for the number of rainy days and amount of rain from year to year change rapidly due to fluctuation in the winds and other climate conditions.

Verse 12

 <i><b>a land which your God</b></i> <b>יהוה <i>looks after.</i></b> The instability of the water resources obliges God’s careful attention. What may seem like the land’s disadvantage turns out to be a measure of Israel’s dependence on—and confidence in—God.

Verse 13

<b><i>If, then, you obey.</i></b> This passage links the distinctive qualities of the land and its agricultural fertility to the concept of divine reward and retribution. God rewards obedience via timely rain that will assure plenitude of crops and success; God retaliates against disobedience with a lack of rain—and thus with a lack of produce that will result in famine and annihilation.
Having given these geographical and climatic conditions such theological importance, vv. 13–21 were incorporated by the Rabbis into the daily liturgy as the second paragraph of the <i>Sh’ma,</i> following the <i>V’ahavta</i> (6:5–9). The Rabbis further secured the prominence of this passage by having it placed in the mezuzah and in the <i>t’fillin,</i> along with other passages from the Torah.

Verse 22

VICTORY AND TERRITORY AS REWARDS FOR OBEDIENCE (11:22–25) Obedience and love reoccur at the close of this speech, though in reverse order (v. 22 in comparison to v. 1). This section contains yet another conditional statement, promising that obedience will result in military success, victory, and possession of the land within wide borders (vv. 23–25). The wording underscores the claimed linkage between the demand and its reward through a symmetrical repetition of four phrases designating an entirety (<i>kol</i>): “all this Instruction” and “all God’s ways” in the clause that expresses the condition (v. 22); “all these nations” and “every spot” in the clause that expresses the consequence (vv. 23–24).

Verse 23



Verse 24

<b><i>Every spot on which your foot treads shall be yours.</i></b> This promise here and in v. 25 reflects an ancient Near Eastern legal practice of establishing ownership of a land by walking through it. This notion gains a theological-ideological content in the biblical concept of the land (see Genesis 13:17; Joshua 1:3–4).
<i><b>from the wilderness to the Lebanon and from the River…to the Western Sea.</b></i> The present description is unique in its four poles. It starts with the earthly regions from south (the Sinai wilderness) to north (Lebanon, as in 1:7; Joshua 1:4), and then proceeds to the water resources from the northeast (the Euphrates) to the southwest extremes (the Mediterranean Sea). This language seems not to designate actual borders of the land, but instead to demonstrate divine promises of political sovereignty (see also at 1:7).

Verse 25

<b><i>as promised.</i></b> This phrase evokes the promises with which the first and the second speeches of <i>parashat Eikev</i> open (see 7:17–24 and 9:1).
Although filled with chastisement and threats, along with promises, the Torah portion ends as it began, with an assurance. The prospect of blessings and success thus frames the entire parashah.
<i>—Dalit Rom-Shiloni</i>  

Verse 26

<i>The Choice between Blessing and Curse</i> (11:26–32)
The legal material in Deuteronomy is framed by two sets of blessings and curses (here and 28:1–68). Similarly, ancient Near Eastern political treaties and the Laws of Hammurabi contain curses warning of the calamities that will transpire if the treaty’s stipulations or the laws are violated (see also at 28:1–68).

Verse 27



Verse 28



Verse 29

<b><i>blessing at Mount Gerizim…curse at Mount Ebal.</i></b> Two mountains west of the Jordan are the sites for the covenant affirmation ritual (see also at 27:11–13).

Chapter 12



Verse 1

<i>Commencement of Deuteronomy’s Legal Collection</i> (12:1–16:17)
The rules in <i>parashat R’eih</i> begin the extensive legal collection that continues through Deuteronomy 26. Most scholars agree that even though Deuteronomy presents this material as Moses’ teachings, these precepts were compiled hundreds of years later. Evidence indicates that the compilers of the laws in Deuteronomy were an eclectic group—including scribes, priests, prophets, and other intellectuals—who formulated a notion of Israel as a nation guided by God. What makes their work unique is the powerful, unified vision that serves as the basis for their editorial work. Their distinctive perspective includes the idea that all Israel—kings and commoners alike—are to be judged by the degree to which they adhere to the laws of Deuteronomy. In particular, the laws considerably limit the roles of the king and priests and redistribute power to broader segments of the Israelite community (see at 17:14–20 and 18:1–8).
INTRODUCTION (12:1)
This verse specifies that the laws that follow must be observed in the Promised Land.

Verse 2

DEMAND FOR CENTRALIZATION OF SACRIFICE IN GOD’S CHOSEN PLACE (12:2–14)
The commands to destroy places where foreign gods are worshipped (vv. 2–3) and to worship by offering sacrifices to God only in one select location (vv. 4–14) express one of Deuteronomy’s distinctive features: establishing the legitimacy of only one central shrine (which scholars often refer to as Deuteronomy’s “centralization of the cult”). Although Deuteronomy does not name the location of the shrine, other books in the Bible make clear that the Chosen Place is Jerusalem.
<b><i>2–3.</i></b> The Israelites are charged to destroy places of worship and ritual objects that are sacred to the non-Israelite inhabitants of the land of Canaan, in order to prevent Israel from straying from God. Many modem scholars have concluded that in reality, this regulation targeted village sanctuaries where Israel’s own deity was worshipped. Such sacred sites had been legitimate places of Israelite and Judean worship in the centuries before the centralization mandated in Deuteronomy. (Note, for example, Hannah’s visits to the shrine in Shiloh in I Samuel 1.) Conducting sacrifices only in Jerusalem would have been a boon for that city’s economy, strengthening the crown as it faced Assyrian imperialism, especially in the 7th century <small>B.C.E.</small>

Verse 3

<b><i>altars…pillars…sacred posts…images.</i></b> Archeologists have discovered these objects at sacred sites throughout the land of Israel. Ritual objects like these were earlier used by Canaanites and then adopted by the Israelites, thus indicating the debt they owed to their predecessors in the Promised Land.
<i><b>sacred posts.</b></i> Heb. <i>asherim</i> (plural of <i>asherah),</i> ritual objects probably related to the worship of the goddess Asherah. According to II Kings 23, King Josiah removed the <i>asherah</i> from numerous sites, including the Temple itself and the place where “the women wove coverings for <i>asherah”</i> (II Kings 23:7). (See further at 16:21 and at Exodus 34:13.)

Verse 4



Verse 5

<b><i>the site that your God יהוה will choose.</i></b> Deuteronomy does not mention either Jerusalem or the Temple by name, since Jerusalem was not Israelite and the Temple not yet built during the time of Moses in which Deuteronomy is set.

Verse 6



Verse 7

<b><i>households.</i></b> Heb. <i>bayit</i> (literally “house”; plural, <i>batim)</i> here refers to the occupants of the household compound—the extended family, including slaves and other dependents. The inclusion of the household in feasting at the sanctuary suggests a venue in which women would play a role. Families would join together to experience the joy of partaking in a sacral meal in a sacred setting.

Verse 8



Verse 9



Verse 10



Verse 11



Verse 12

<b><i>sons and daughters…male and female slaves.</i></b> The specific mention of those with least access to resources is an important component of the laws in Deuteronomy. Free Israelite women are conspicuous by their absence from the list, which suggests that they were already included in the masculine plural command to rejoice before God (see also at 16:11 and Another View). The verse does not specify whether “slaves” refers to indentured servants, chattel slaves, or both; see further at 15:12–18; Exodus 21:2–11; Leviticus 25:35–54.
<i><b>Levite.</b></i> According to Numbers 8, men from the tribe of Levi were not to receive land, but they were dedicated uniquely to God’s service. A distinctive feature of Deuteronomy is that it adds Levites—and implicitly their families—to the list of those who need special consideration or protection (see at v. 19, below), a likely result of closing the local sanctuaries that were a major source of livelihood for Levites.

Verse 13



Verse 14



Verse 15

RULES ABOUT THE CONSUMPTION OF MEAT AND TITHES (12:15–28) For Israelites as for others in the ancient world, meat-eating was not part of the daily diet, since they valued animals most for what they could produce while they were alive, including milk, wool, dung (used for fuel and construction), and offspring. Also, meat from an entire animal would have to be consumed at once, given the lack of refrigeration. Thus, eating the meat not otherwise utilized for sacrifice in festive meals provided one way for people to partake of meat. Exodus 20:21 implies that sacrifices could take place anywhere; however, if centralization of sacrifice meant that there were no longer any local sanctuaries at which to sacrifice animals, then how would those who lived far from Jerusalem be able to eat meat? In order to ensure that the consumption of meat did not cease with the cessation of village sacrifice, Deuteronomy allows Israelites to slaughter and eat meat in their own settlements, as long as they follow these detailed regulations. Deuteronomy’s laws in this case conflict with Leviticus 17:2–7, which permits eating meat only at a sanctuary.
<b><i>The impure and the pure alike may partake of it.</i></b> When animals for human consumption are no longer dedicated to God, everyone can partake of them, not only those who are ritually pure. This regulation makes it easier for women to consume meat because ritual impurity on account of menstruation and childbirth (see Leviticus 12; 15:19–30) no longer bars their participation.

Verse 16

<b><i>you must not partake of the blood.</i></b> Eating blood is prohibited because blood symbolizes life—and life belongs to God (see Genesis 9:4; Leviticus 17:11)

Verse 17

<b><i>17–18.</i></b> Common among other peoples in the ancient Near East, tithes were a kind of assessment that could be fulfilled by designating agricultural products or livestock, which would be consumed in sacred ceremonies (see also at 14:22–29). This passage establishes that tithes are no longer to be consumed within the towns or villages of Israel; rather, they are to be joyfully shared by all members of the community, female and male alike, at God’s Chosen Place.

Verse 18

<b><i>you.</i></b> In the singular; on who is being addressed, see at v. 12.

Verse 19

 The centralization of sacrifice means that the landless Levites (see Numbers 8) who served local sanctuaries would have lost their means of livelihood. In an agrarian culture such as ancient Israel, those who did not own land were at risk of chronic starvation and even death. Therefore, the Levites would have become part of Israel’s underclass, unable to provide for themselves and their families.

WARNINGS AGAINST WORSHIPPING AS OTHER NATIONS DO (12:29–31) The crucial injunction condemning the worship of any deity other than Israel’s God is predicated upon the settlement of the land, after God will “cut down” the existing inhabitants. Certain biblical depictions of the conquest of the land (found especially in Joshua and Judges) claim that such destruction happened, whereas other passages portray a long period of Israelite coexistence with Canaanite and other ethnic communities in the very heartland of what would later become the Israel of the Monarchy. The results of decades of archeological research indicate that the latter version is the historically accurate one (see also at 2:34; 7:1–5, 24; 31:16).

Verse 30



Verse 31

<b><i>offer up their sons and daughters in fire.</i></b> While child sacrifice is condemned here as an abhorrent religious ritual, other passages reveal that at times even Israelites sacrificed their children (as implied by Genesis 22:1–19). According to II Kings 3:27, the Moabite king sacrifices his first-born son as a last resort. The Israelite child most renowned for having been sacrificed is Jephthah’s daughter (Judges 11:29–40).

Chapter 13



Verse 1

WARNINGS AGAINST FALSE PROPHETS OR DIVINERS (13:1–19) This section warns against three capital offenses that might lead Israelites astray from absolute and exclusive allegiance to Israel’s God.

Verse 2

<b><i>prophet.</i></b> The first situation involves what we might call “religious professionals,” beginning with prophets. The problem of false prophecy was important because people needed to know which individuals truly spoke for God (see at 18:9–22). The <i>Tanach</i> includes stories about four female prophets: Miriam (Exodus 15), Deborah (Judges 4–5), Huldah (II Kings 22:14–20), and Noadiah (Nehemiah 6:14), as well as several unnamed female prophets (Isaiah 8:3; Ezekiel 13:17; Joel 3:1). Nehemiah, the governor of Judah in the 5th century <small>B.C.E.</small>, implies that Noadiah is a false prophet. (On women prophets, see at 18:15 and <i>V’zot Hab’rachah,</i> Another View.)
<i><b>dream-diviner.</b></i> Ancient peoples believed that their deities sometimes communicated through signs and dreams if properly interpreted by skilled practitioners. Deuteronomy considers any such practices illegitimate and dangerous; but compare Genesis 40–41, where Joseph interprets dreams without condemnation.

Verse 3



Verse 4



Verse 5



Verse 6



Verse 7

<b><i>7–12.</i></b> The second case underscores the danger of false worship by prescribing the death penalty for all those—even family members and close friends—who entice someone to secretly worship deities other than Israel’s God. Wives and daughters are mentioned alongside brothers and sons as people who might entice one to false worship.
<b><i>wife of your bosom.</i></b> This phrase suggests the physical and emotional intimacy of the marital relationship. As it does so, it highlights the grievousness of the transgression and the mandated punishment. Even a loving wife who attempts to lead her husband astray must be stoned to death, with her husband the first person to throw the stone.

Verse 8



Verse 9



Verse 10



Verse 11



Verse 12



Verse 13

<b><i>13–19.</i></b> The third example moves from the personal to the general, as disloyalty to God condemns an entire town to death.

Chapter 14



Verse 1

WARNINGS AGAINST ILLICIT MOURNING PRACTICES (14:1–2) Gashing the skin until it bleeds and shaving were mourning customs practiced by Israelites and some of their neighbors. The other biblical passages that mention gashing or shaving have the connotation of foreignness, even when done by Israelites. For instance, I Kings 18:28 portrays Baal’s prophets mourning their god’s absence in their time of need by gashing themselves (see also Jeremiah 16:6–7; 41:4–5; 47:5). The textual evidence is ambiguous as to whether women as well as men engaged in these public mourning rituals; yet we do know that certain women were trained to chant dirges that accompanied burial ceremonies (see Jeremiah 9:16–17 and <i>Chayei Sarah,</i> Contemporary Reflection). Furthermore, iconographic evidence recovered by archeologists depicts women tearing their hair and beating their breasts as signs of mourning.

Verse 2



Verse 3

DIETARY LAWS (14:3–21) The dietary laws provide another venue in which Israel must demonstrate its allegiance to God. The regulations found here and in Leviticus 11 are straightforward: Israelites may consume only certain specified animals in order to remain within God’s holy community. However, the rationale behind these rules is less transparent. Rabbis, biblical scholars, archeologists, and anthropologists have tried to go beyond the arcane lists of permitted and prohibited animals to understand the purpose for these regulations. While explanations vary, most agree that dietary laws, whatever their origins, were eventually meant to distinguish Israel from other nations and to allow them to demonstrate their loyalty to God. Whether all Israelites were aware of and adhered to the dietary laws is uncertain. However, the absence of pig bones at Israelite sites suggests obedience to at least that rule.
The degree to which dietary rules had an impact on women’s lives is unclear. Both women and men worked in the fields, orchards, and gardens—the source of most Israelite food; and both genders tended livestock, while hunting was done mostly by men. [Food preparation was most often a woman’s task, but the dietary laws do not directly concern that issue. Rather, they concern which animals are permitted and which are forbidden, and they also ban the consumption of blood. The responsibility for draining blood likely fell to those individuals, female or male, who slaughtered animals. Some scholars believe that slaughtering and butchering were men’s tasks; but the narrative of the medium at En-dor reports that she slaughters a calf (I Samuel 28:24), perhaps indicating that both genders would have had responsibility for adhering to the dietary stipulations.—<i>Ed.</i>] (For more on the dietary laws and women’s role in food preparation, see at Leviticus 11:1–46.)
<b><i>3–8.</i></b> These verses allow for the consumption of ruminants with cleft hooves. Such mammals include domestic livestock (sheep, goats, and cattle), those animals most accessible to the average Israelite.

Verse 4



Verse 5



Verse 6



Verse 7

<b><i>they are impure for you.</i></b> The use of the word “impure” (repeated in vv. 8, 10, 19) suggests that dietary laws have a spiritual component and should not be understood as deriving from concerns for health, taste, or aesthetics. (For a different perspective, see at Leviticus 11:1–46.)

Verse 8



Verse 9

<b><i>9–10.</i></b> For more on the restriction of consuming seafood only with scales and fins, see at Leviticus 11:9.

Verse 10



Verse 11

<b><i>11–18.</i></b> The list of forbidden birds focuses upon birds of prey. Since the carrion they eat contains blood, eating birds of prey would place Israelites in danger of consuming this prohibited substance.

Verse 12

Verse 17



Verse 18



Verse 19

<b><i>19–20.</i></b> In general, winged insects that swarm are forbidden as food; but some (a particular type of locust, as well as crickets and grasshoppers) are permitted (Leviticus 11:20–23).

Verse 20



Verse 21

 This verse adds two other food regulations.
<i><b>anything that has died a natural death.</b></i> Presumably such animals are prohibited as food for Israelites because they were not slaughtered and then drained of all their blood. In addition, contact with dead animals was a source of ritual contamination that removed people from God’s holy community.
<i><b>you are a people consecrated</b></i> According to Deuteronomy, Israelites are God’s holy people (see also at Leviticus 19:2); consequently, they must preserve that holiness in their daily lives.
<i><b>You shall not boil a kid in its mother’s milk.</b></i> The implications and reasons for the injunction against boiling a baby goat in its mother’s milk are obscure. Scholars have not found parallels in other ancient Near Eastern legal material. While some see this as a polemic against a pagan rite, most likely this rule attests to biblical respect for the relationship between a mother and her offspring (see 22:6–7), as well as revulsion at the idea that mothers’ milk could contribute to death rather than life. [Some contemporary scholars offer a different explanation, arguing that the consonants in the noun <i>chalav</i> (milk) can be read as <i>chelev</i> (fat); in that case, the verse would forbid cooking a young animal in “its mother’s fat.” This prohibition would avoid the economic loss involved in slaughtering two animals, one of whom could still bear more young. (See Carol Meyers’ discussion of Jack Sasson’s research in <i>Exodus,</i> 2005, p. 203.)—<i>Ed.</i>]

Verse 22

TITHING REGULATIONS (14:22–29) Like the dietary laws, obedience to the laws of tithing is considered another requisite for inclusion in God’s holy community. Tithing is a type of taxation system, whereby a tenth of what one produced in the fields, vines, and orchards, together with the firstlings of one’s herds, is to be consecrated to God. In Deuteronomy the injunction applies to the entire household, women and men alike, who are to rejoice together in God’s presence as they consume these tithes at the central sanctuary. (See also Leviticus 27:30–33 and Numbers 18:21–32.)

Verse 23



Verse 24

<b><i>24–26.</i></b> The stipulation allowing for money to be substituted for agricultural products or animals acknowledges the logistic difficulties encountered when traveling long distances burdened by heavy loads. As seen here and in rules regarding the consumption of meat (12:15–28), Deuteronomy seeks to address the hardships created by centralization of sacrifice, particularly for those living far from Jerusalem. This legislation strives to institute practices that will make it feasible for everyone to participate in the sacred life of the community.

Verse 25

<b><i>money.</i></b> Literally, “silver.” Ancient Israel had no official currency system; rather, farmers exchanged standard quantities of grains, produce, and the like for fixed weights of silver. This silver might be in the form of jewelry, cast into ingots, or cut into pieces. Such currency would be easy to carry and could be exchanged for the requisite food and drink in the Chosen Place.

Verse 26



Verse 27

<b><i>27–29.</i></b> In the third and sixth years of the seven year sabbatical cycle, Israelites are to give the tithe of their harvest to the needy in their own community, rather than consume it in the Chosen Place of worship.

Verse 28



Verse 29

<b><i>the [family of the] Levite.</i></b> See at 12:19.
<i><b>the fatherless, and the widow.</b></i> These two individuals lacked the protection of an adult male. Note that the Torah does not offer a systematic way to integrate them into alternate family settings so that they could be cared for and protected by clan elders; neither are they given resources that would enable them to fend for themselves. Rather, like the Levites and like strangers living within Israel’s borders, they are placed at the mercy of others who are charged with the responsibility to provide for them. (See also at 10:18 and <i>Eikev,</i> Another View.)

Chapter 15



Verse 1

LAWS OF RELEASE IN THE SEVENTH YEAR (15:1–18) Similar to the Jubilee laws in Leviticus 25, Deuteronomy seeks to redress certain economic inequities at regular intervals. However, whereas Leviticus 25 prescribes release regulations for a fifty-year cycle, Deuteronomy requires a seven-year adjustment.
<i>Remission of Debt</i> (15:1–11) This passage articulates the ideal that there will be no needy requiring loans or other forms of assistance, since obeying God’s teachings will bring blessing and avert poverty. Nevertheless, it acknowledges that needy individuals will always exist.

Verse 2



Verse 3



Verse 4

<b><i>4–5.</i></b> Deuteronomy repeatedly makes the point that plenty and well-being come not from hard work or good fortune but rather from God, who blesses those who follow God’s instruction.
<b><i>hereditary portion.</i></b> In the Bible, the land is Israel’s inheritance, promised by God to Israel’s ancestors. Although women share in the blessing of its bounty, they generally do not seem to inherit land—the basis for survival. The Bible mentions several cases of women able to inherit land, such as Zelophehad’s daughters (see at Numbers 27:1–11 and 36:1–12), the woman of Shunem (II Kings 4), and Job’s daughters (Job 42:13–15); but these appear to be exceptions. See further at Numbers 36:11.

Verse 5



Verse 6



Verse 7

<b><i>7–11.</i></b> This passage enjoins Israelites to lend to their kin with a generous spirit even if they risk losing what they loaned in the seventh-year remission of debt.

Verse 8

Verse 10



Verse 11



Verse 12

<i>Release of Debt-Servants</i> (15:12–18) This passage concerns the Israelite woman or man who becomes a servant as a consequence of financial problems or to fulfill a court judgment. The institution of indentured servitude was common throughout the ancient Near East.
Israelites risked becoming debt-servants when they could not repay loans, pay taxes, or meet other financial obligations. They might be forced to sell themselves or their children into debt-servitude in order to forestall financial ruin or starvation. Children could also become debt-servants after having been pledged as security on a loan that the parents were unable to repay. Because of the six-year limit on the term of servitude, the Hebrew debt-servant is in a position different from that of the foreigner taken as a prisoner of war or purchased from a foreign owner and kept as a slave for life. The Torah regulates the treatment of slaves and forbids the worst of abuses. (See also at Exodus 21:2—11 and Leviticus 25:39–54.)
<b><i>Hebrew man—or woman.</i></b> Women were more likely to be sold into servitude on account of the debts of their fathers or husbands, rather than because of debts they themselves incurred. Exodus 21:7–11 provides special rules for the daughter sold into servitude by her parents. In that case, the woman would have been treated as a wife for one of the men in the household; therefore, marital law applied to her, and she would not be expected to leave the household.

Verse 17

<b><i>Do the same with your female slave.</i></b> Here, in contrast to Exodus 21:7–11, male and female servants are treated equally.

Verse 18

<b><i>do not feel aggrieved.</i></b> As in vv. 9–10, the text anticipates the understandable reluctance by some individuals to follow these laws and offers reassurance.

Verse 19

LAWS ABOUT THE DEDICATION OF FIRST-BORN MALE LIVESTOCK (15:19–23) This section establishes that a family must sacrifice and consume unblemished firstlings annually in the Chosen Place (see also 12:17–18; 14:22–29). Similar legislation in Exodus 13:11–15, Leviticus 27:26–27, and Numbers 18:15 designates the firstlings instead for the priests.

Chapter 16



Verse 1

LAWS ABOUT THE PILGRIMAGE FESTIVALS (16:1–17) These rules for the observance of the three major festivals account for the fact that Israelites are now to celebrate in the Chosen Place, rather than in their own local communities.
<b><i>1–8.</i></b> The Passover (Pesach) celebration commemorates God’s freeing Israel from Egypt. The highlight of the pilgrimage to God’s Chosen Place is the sacrifice and consumption of a domesticated animal, with unleavened bread eaten for the duration of the weeklong festival; a solemn gathering is to be held on the last day. Whereas other Passover regulations envision Israelites eating the sacrifice in their homes (see Exodus 12:46), Deuteronomy permits it only in the central sanctuary, a stipulation that creates additional problems that the laws try to resolve. The language of the regulations uses male singular pronouns; but as 12:12 makes clear, women are expected to share in sacral meals. The problem for most women and many men would have been the distance to the Chosen Place.

Verse 9

<b><i>9–12.</i></b> The Feast of Weeks (that is, Shavuot) comes seven weeks after the beginning of the spring harvest. It, too, requires pilgrimage to the Chosen Place and is highlighted by a freewill offering that reflects the extent of God’s blessing. As is typical of Deuteronomy, the joyous celebration is to be shared by a broad section of society.

Verse 10



Verse 11

 The entire household, including the stranger, fatherless, and widow, is included in the injunction to rejoice before God. Although the Israelite wife is not specifically mentioned, the inclusion of daughters, female slaves, and widows suggests that wives were included as well as a matter of fact. (See further at 12:12 and Another View.)

Verse 12



Verse 13

<b><i>13–15.</i></b> The Feast of Booths (Sukkot) also is to be celebrated with the entire community, including all female and male family members and the marginalized elements of society. Blessing and joy are the primary characteristics of this seven-day festival celebrated in the Chosen Place.

Verse 14

 See at v. 11.

Verse 15



Verse 16

<b><i>16–17.</i></b> The final command, to celebrate the three major feasts in the Chosen Place, underscores gender inequality in Israelite community festivals. Each feast requires the offering of a gift, which reflects the blessing that God has bestowed upon the individual making the offering. Who is required to appear before God and bring a gift reflecting God’s blessing? “All your males” (v. 16) are the ones who must see God’s “face.” [What this rule is meant to convey about females is not clear, especially given that 12:12 and other passages expect women to be present during festival celebrations as well. Assessing the relationship between obligations and exemptions is difficult. (See also Another View.)<i>—Ed.</i>] <i>—Beth Alpert Nakhai</i>  

Verse 17



Verse 18

<i>The Judicial System and Public Officials</i> (16:18–18:22)
For Deuteronomy, the so-called “civil” and “religious” authorities all fall under the constraints of the justice system. According to Bernard Levinson, this unit provides what appears to be “the first blueprint for a constitutional government” in which “no single branch of government and no single religious institution should have sole power” (“Deuteronomy,” <i>Jewish Study Bible,</i> 2004, p. 403).
THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM (16:18–17:13)
This section commands the community (not God) to appoint lay people (not priests or prophets) to serve as professional judges and judicial administrators. Such individuals appear to be selected from among the existing chiefs, military officers, or other types of officials (see 1:15). They are charged with the vital task of executing justice impartially. According to Nili Fox, in the monarchic period the king probably appointed these government officials, who often worked in conjunction with the elders in administering justice <i>(In the Service of the King,</i> 2000, pp. 165, 172). The text does not mention any qualifications or training for these “magistrates and officials,” nor is their gender specified, for the language is couched in the default grammatical masculine. One may assume that in most cases they would be men, but the possibility of a woman serving as a judge (like Deborah) should not be excluded (see Judges 4–5).
<b><i>in all the settlements.</i></b> Although Deuteronomy centralizes sacrifice (see at 12:2–14), it makes no attempt to centralize the court system; people must be able to obtain justice locally. The Hebrew term translated here as “settlements” is literally “gates,” the area at the entrance to a walled settlement where people would come together to conduct their commercial and legal affairs. For example, in Ruth 4:1, Boaz and the unnamed redeemer engage in the transfer of real estate and marriage rights at the gate, in the presence of ten representative elders. In Proverbs 31 (the “Woman of Valor” passage), the husband’s position “in the gates” shows him to be a prominent citizen (v. 23); and the woman’s works are publicly recognized “in the gates” (v. 31).

Verse 19

<b><i>you shall not take bribes.</i></b> Giving bribes or gifts was common in the ancient world and is often mentioned in the Bible (as in Exodus 23:8; I Samuel 8:3). A bribe may have been offered in order to secure a favorable decision or perhaps just to have the case heard in court.

Verse 20

<b><i>Justice, justice.</i></b> The repetition of the word <i>tzedek</i> emphasizes that the pursuit of justice is vital to Israelite society. This verse expresses a recurrent theme in Deuteronomy, that the failure to follow God’s instructions will result in the loss of the Promised Land.

Verse 21

<b><i>21–17–17:1.</i></b> This passage condemns as affronts to God both Canaanite religious practices and wrongly performed Israelite religious practices. The juxtaposition of religious and civil laws here may emphasize that improprieties of civil justice are no less offensive to God than improper religious performance.
<b><i>sacred post.</i></b> Heb. <i>asherah,</i> also the name of a Canaanite goddess. Some contemporary scholars think that this goddess may have been popular among Israelites, who perhaps conceived of her as the consort of Israel’s (male) God. The <i>asherah</i> here may refer to the symbol (a tree or wooden post), not to the goddess herself. (See also at 12:3 and Exodus 34:13.) Nevertheless, Deuteronomy is fiercely monotheistic and tolerates no hint of what it considers syncretism (the combination of Israelite and non-Israelite religious practices) or idolatry.

Chapter 17



Verse 1



Verse 2

<b><i>2–7.</i></b> This passage applies to apostates the procedure for capital punishment. The case involves “a man or woman” (a phrase repeated three times in vv. 2, 5) who has transgressed the covenant by engaging in idolatrous practices, a severe transgression with a clear penalty (see 13:13–17). Notice that the text here considers women autonomous persons, responsible for their own actions (not under the control of fathers or husbands) and therefore potentially guilty of a capital offense. In contrast, the passage on prophets (18:15–22) is phrased solely in the masculine, although women prophets existed in the Bible and ancient Near East. (See <i>V’zot Hab’rachah,</i> Another View.)

Verse 3



Verse 4

<b><i>thorough inquiry.</i></b> The court establishes an apostate’s guilt through physical evidence or, more likely, the testimony of at least two witnesses (v. 6).

Verse 5



Verse 6

<b><i>two or more witnesses.</i></b> The principle of a minimum of two witnesses is articulated again in 19:15 and Numbers 35:30. The Bible does not specify whether women could serve as witnesses. [In the Dead Sea Scrolls (2nd century <small>B.C.E.</small>), women are encouraged to testify as a witness against their husband in certain matters (see Tal Ilan, “Women,” <i>Encyclopaedia Judaica,</i> 2nd edn., 2007, 21:164). This evidence suggests that women were able to serve as witnesses at certain early periods, perhaps also in the time of the Bible. —<i>Ed.</i>] A witness has a crucial role to play in the verdict, so giving false testimony constitutes a serious crime (19:15–21). In the story of Susanna (in the Apocrypha), two corrupt elders falsely accuse Susanna, a young and virtuous wife, of having an encounter with a young man other than her husband. They do so in an attempt to get even with Susanna for refusing their own advances; but when the wise Daniel interrogates the witnesses separately to see if their reports agree, he discovers the ruse.

Verse 7

<b><i>the hands of the rest of the people.</i></b> While public executions are not tasteful to many in contemporary Western societies, the participation of the entire community shows that everyone has a stake in “sweeping out evil” from the community. This practice does not delegate the “dirty work” to professional executioners, but instead holds all the people—or at least a body of their representatives—responsible for carrying out the sentence. (It remains unclear as to whether or not this includes women.)

Verse 8

<b><i>8–13.</i></b> This passage establishes that the priest or lay magistrate at the central sanctuary adjudicates cases that cannot be solved at the local level, a system similar to that described in Exodus 18:17–23.
<b><i>If a case is too baffling.</i></b> The baffling case involves a situation that lacks two witnesses or any other evidence upon which the local judges can ascertain the truth of the matter. When human beings cannot adjudicate, the case goes to the divine authority, so that God, through God’s representatives, can determine the verdict (see 19:17; I Kings 8:31–32); ancient Near Eastern law collections have similar procedures. Before the centralization of sacrifice (the hallmark of Deuteronomy), people would have brought such a case to the local sanctuary. Now, with the absence of local sanctuaries, divine judgment can be rendered only at the central sanctuary (Bernard Levinson, “Deuteronomy,” <i>Jewish Study Bible,</i> 2004, pp. 404–05).

Verse 9

<b><i>levitical priests.</i></b> This verse seems to refer to the Levites serving as priests at the central sanctuary (see at 18:1).
<i><b>or the magistrate.</b></i> Some interpreters think that the levitical priests rendered decisions on ritual matters, while the lay judges decided non-ritual cases. While this seems to be the view of II Chronicles 19:8, Deuteronomy 17:8 lists only non-ritual crimes.

Verse 10

<b><i>10–13.</i></b> The text emphasizes the need to adhere to the judgment rendered and to carry it out as prescribed. The fact that disregarding the verdict itself becomes a capital offense stresses the seriousness of the justice system and the safeguards Deuteronomy imposes to preserve it. At the same time, Deuteronomy limits the authority of human officials (see below).

Verse 11



Verse 12



Verse 13



Verse 14

KINGS (17:14–20) The Bible considers a king to be subordinate to God and the legal system; hence, in a remarkable move, it puts limitations on royal power. Unlike in the Laws of Hammurabi and other ancient Near Eastern texts, the king does not promulgate law but instead is subject to it. In Deuteronomy, the king does not explicitly figure in the local or central courts. Elsewhere in the Bible, kings function as the overall guardians of justice. Yet they serve as judges in only a few cases, as when Solomon decides the case of the prostitutes’ two babies (I Kings 3:16–28) or when David deals with the “wise woman” of Tekoa, who presents a fabricated case calculated to make David bring his son Absalom back home (II Samuel 14). Perhaps even more surprising, he must continually read and obey the Teaching (<i>torah</i>). This section presents a picture here of a “constitutional monarchy” in which the king “will not act haughtily toward his fellows” (v. 20).
<b><i>after you have entered the land.</i></b> Although modern scholars date some parts of Deuteronomy to the time of Josiah (late 7th century <small>B.C.E.</small>) and other parts to the Babylonian exile (6th century <small>B.C.E.</small>), the book presents itself as reporting what took place just before the Israelites would cross the Jordan and enter Canaan.
<i><b>“as do all the nations about me.”</b></i> This statement, put into the mouths of the Israelites, anticipates the reason found in I Samuel 8:5 for requesting a king: because the other nations have kings. Such a request presumes that Israel must have this form of centralized government, rather than the decentralized tribal system, in order to be competitive with its neighbors, especially when it comes to military campaigns.

Verse 15



Verse 16

<b><i>he shall not keep many horses.</i></b> This and the following verse use the portrait of Solomon to criticize the dangers of excessive royal power. According to I Kings 5:6 and 10:26, Solomon had 40,000 stalls of horses, 12,000 horsemen, 1,400 chariots, and 12,000 horses, which he imported from Egypt and Kue. These large numbers function as a way to show Solomon’s wealth and grandeur—precisely what Deuteronomy seeks to limit.

Verse 17

<b><i>he shall not have many wives.</i></b> This criticism also is built on the portrait of Solomon, who reportedly had a thousand wives (I Kings 11:1–5), many of them foreigners with whom he made political marriages. Such marriages were common in the ancient world for their diplomatic benefits, for they worked to assure peaceful relations between the royal families and thus their countries. The fact that Israelite kings had foreign wives of royal lineage shows they were players on the international scene. The Bible is concerned with the importation of foreign wives, because it believed these wives introduced their own forms of foreign worship into the royal court, thereby “leading the people astray” with idolatrous practices. Jezebel stands out as a prime example, for this Phoenician princess and wife of King Ahab worshipped Baal—and led her husband to do so as well (I Kings 16:31–33; 21:25–26).
<i><b>nor shall he amass silver and gold.</b></i> The text also condemns accumulating large wealth, a danger in most monarchies. This, too, reflects the portrait of Solomon in I Kings 10.

Verse 18

<b><i>a copy of this Teaching.</i></b> Levitical priests will write a copy of the Teaching for the king, who must read it regularly. The word for “Teaching,” <i>torah,</i> does not refer to the so-called Five Books of Moses, nor probably even to the book of Deuteronomy, but rather to this section pertaining to the king, or to other legal portions of Deuteronomy. This law aims to emphasize and remind the king constantly that he is subject to God’s law. In Hebrew, the term <i>mishneh torah</i> (“copy of this Teaching,” literally “a second <i>torah”)</i> becomes one of the names for Deuteronomy in rabbinic literature, since the book reviews large parts of the earlier books of the Torah (<i>Sifrei D’varim</i> 160). The Greek translation of this term is “Deuteronomion,” hence the English name of the book.

Chapter 18



Verse 1

LEVITICAL PRIESTS (18:1–8) Unlike the laws concerning the king, this section expresses no interest in limiting the power of the levitical priests, but rather in ensuring that they, as a disadvantaged class, obtain their due. Their disadvantage lies in the fact that they have no land holdings, the main source of income for non-levitical Israelites in an agricultural society (see at 12:19). Levites therefore depend for their livelihood on a “tax” levied on sacrifices and tithes. The Israelites, to whom these instructions are addressed, must see to it that the levitical priests receive their proper income.
<b><i>The levitical priests, the whole tribe of Levi.</i></b> Leviticus and Numbers typically distinguish between priests (<i>kohanim</i>, a special subset of Levites defined as the descendants of Aaron) and Levites; only the <i>kohanim</i> can officiate in the presentation of offerings to God and can eat certain portions of sacrificial foodstuffs (see Numbers 16 and 18). Deuteronomy uses the anomalous term “levitical priests” (literally “the priests the Levites”), suggesting that it does not see two distinct classes but rather one group of potential priests. Deuteronomy gives all Levites the same right to eat portions from the sacrifices (a privilege limited to the priests in the other sources), and permits all of them to serve at the central sanctuary if they choose.

Verse 2

 <b>יהוה</b> <i><b>is their portion.</b></i> The Hebrew has a singular suffix, “his (or its) portion”; the translation understands the antecedent to be the tribe of Levi (as in 10:8–9). Any allotted portion would include the women in the families, hence the frequent insertion in our translation of the phrase “[family of the] Levite” (as in 12:12). This phrase occurs in <i>Yizkor,</i> the memorial prayers for the dead, who no longer have a stake in this world but are in God’s care.

Verse 3



Verse 4



Verse 5



Verse 6

<b><i>6–8.</i></b> Since Deuteronomy outlaws local sanctuaries, the Levites formerly serving at these sanctuaries can no longer earn a livelihood except at the central sanctuary. Those who do not serve there must depend on communal charity, along with the widow, the fatherless, and the stranger (see 14:27–29; 16:11, 14; 26:12). Our passage seems to try to avoid that situation by providing the option for the unemployed Levite to find employment and allotment from sacrifices at the central sanctuary.

Verse 7



Verse 8

<b><i>equal shares.</i></b> The displaced Levites will share equally in the sacrificial portions enumerated in 18:3–4. In practice, the Jerusalem priesthood may have objected to this arrangement (see II Kings 23:9).

Verse 9

PROPHETS (18:9–22) After banning various types of foreign divination (18:9–14), Deuteronomy addresses the type of divine intermediary most common in the Bible, the prophet (18:15–22).
<b><i>When you enter the land.</i></b> Like most of the laws in Deuteronomy, this one pertains to the settlement in the Promised Land. In this case, the danger concerns the negative religious influence of the Canaanites. Modern scholars note that by the time Deuteronomy was composed, the Canaanites were long gone. Thus, the Bible uses the term “Canaanite” anachronistically as a symbol for “the other,” often defining what is Israelite in opposition to what it calls Canaanite. Our passage uses “those nations” to refer to the various nations living in Canaan (Canaanites, Perizzites, and so forth). The practices listed as abhorrent are attested widely throughout the ancient Near East.

Verse 10

<b><i>10–11.</i></b> Deuteronomy takes for granted that either females or males might perform the types of divination listed here (compare Leviticus 20:27). These practices are abhorrent to God not because they are ineffective, but because they call upon powers other than God, thereby undermining monotheistic belief.
<b><i>consigns a son or daughter to the fire.</i></b> The nature of this practice remains unclear. Its link here with other types of divination suggests that it is not child sacrifice, but a form of divination no longer known to us.

Verse 11

<b><i>consults ghosts.</i></b> The story of the medium of En-dor (I Samuel 28) and Isaiah 29:4 both confirm that communicating with the dead, or necromancy, was practiced in Israel. King Saul consults the medium of En-dor, a female necromancer, when all other forms of communication with the Divine have failed; and she successfully enables Saul to communicate with the dead prophet Samuel. Many Israelites, like other peoples of the time and later, showed an abiding concern for the dead, especially dead ancestors (see also at 26:14).

Verse 12

<b><i>dispossessing them.</i></b> Genesis 15:16, Leviticus 18:24–30, and Deuteronomy 9:4 all note that Israel will be entitled to dispossess the indigenous nations of Canaan as a result of the abhorrent practices detailed there. Deuteronomy repeatedly reminds the people that Israel risks being dispossessed from the land for similar reasons.

Verse 13



Verse 14



Verse 15

<b><i>15–22.</i></b> Having banned various divinatory practices, Deuteronomy now explains the legitimate way for Israel to access God’s will: through a prophet. The type of prophecy envisioned derives from the people’s desire for professional intermediaries to whom they could pose questions and receive information that would help them make decisions. In addition, as part of the narrative of the revelation at Sinai, the people request an intermediary in order to avoid the dangers inherent when one has direct contact with God (see 5:19–24; Exodus 20:15–18).
<b><i>like myself.</i></b> Moses serves as the model for all later prophets, even though no prophet has as close contact with God as he did (see Deuteronomy 34:10). The Hebrew speaks of the prophet in the masculine, as this is the linguistic default; but that does not exclude female prophets. The Bible refers to four female prophets by name: Miriam (Exodus 15:20), Deborah (Judges 4:4), Huldah (II Kings 22:14–20), and Noadiah (Nehemiah 6:14); other passages mention unnamed female prophets (Isaiah 8:3; Ezekiel 13:17; Joel 3:1).

Verse 16

<b><i>Horeb.</i></b> This is Deuteronomy’s term for Sinai (see at Exodus 18:5). Moses explains that the people requested an intermediary lest direct contact with the Divine prove fatal.

Verse 17



Verse 18

<b><i>18–22.</i></b> The most crucial attribute of the true prophet is that he or she speaks in God’s name. Since the prophet serves as the vehicle through whom God communicates, the true prophet must be taken seriously and heeded. Clearly, a prophet speaking in the name of a foreign god is false, but what about a prophet who claims to be speaking in God’s name—how is the audience to know if the prophet truly speaks God’s words? This passage establishes the criterion of whether or not those words come to pass, which means that the audience must wait for the outcome of the prophecy. Jeremiah offers a slightly different test, suggesting that one need wait for the outcome only in prophecies of weal, whereas prophecies of doom should always be believed (Jeremiah 28:7–9).

Chapter 19



Verse 1

<i>Safeguarding the Judicial System</i> (19:1–21)
The three topics in this unit all involve guarding justice. The first two concern space or location pertaining to public officials; the third elaborates on the stipulations regarding witnesses introduced in 17:6.
CITIES OF REFUGE (19:1–13)
This section mandates that the people should set aside three cities initially, with the addition of three more as needed, to provide refuge for persons guilty of unintentional homicide (see also 4:41–42; Exodus 21:13–14; Numbers 35:9–34). This law reflects an old practice that runs parallel to, and counter to, Deuteronomy’s principle that the courts have jurisdiction over the sentencing of a person to capital punishment and the carrying out of that punishment if warranted; in this case, a relative avenges a killing. A person who commits manslaughter could, according to other texts, find refuge at an altar (see I Kings 2:28–34); but since Deuteronomy bans local sanctuaries, it must find a substitute site of refuge, which it does by establishing “secular” cities of refuge (not the same as the levitical cities mentioned in Numbers 35). The principle inherent in this law fits with the Deuteronomic principles that innocent blood should not be spilled and that the guilty should receive just punishment.

Verse 2



Verse 3

 [<b><i>male</i></b>] <b><i>killer.</i></b> Could women avail themselves of a city of refuge? This translation understands the person who commits manslaughter as being male. While certainly women were capable of committing murder or manslaughter, it seems reasonable to assume that the person fleeing to a city of refuge would more often be a male. One reason for this conclusion is that since women did not normally live independently, it would be problematic for a woman who commits manslaughter to leave her family and live in a city of refuge. (See also at 4:42, Exodus 21:13, and Numbers 35:6.)

Verse 4



Verse 5



Verse 6

<b><i>blood-avenger.</i></b> On the gender of this role, see at Numbers 35:12.

Verse 12



Verse 13



Verse 14

BOUNDARY MARKERS (19:14) An important biblical principle holds that land should remain in the family to which it was originally allotted. Hence, moving a boundary marker is considered stealing property. The reason for the mention of this law here remains uncertain. This ancient law is known also from elsewhere in the Bible (see Hosea 5:10; Proverbs 22:28; 23:10–11; Job 24:2) and the ancient Near East.

Verse 15

WITNESSES (19:15–21) This section reiterates the principle of a minimum of two witnesses (see Deuteronomy 17:6). The Bible severely punishes false witnesses since they corrupt the legal system. The idea that a false witness deserves the punishment that would have been declared against the accused also appears in the Laws of Hammurabi (¶¶ 2–3).

Verse 16



Verse 17



Verse 18



Verse 19

<b><i>sweep out evil from your midst.</i></b> This phrase recurs often in Deuteronomy (13:6; 17:7, 12; 21:21; 22:21, 22, 24; 24:7), as this book aims to create a just and moral society.

Verse 20



Verse 21

<b><i>life for life, eye for eye.</i></b> This verse invokes the law of talion, or precise retribution, in order to emphasize that justice must be meted out as required, “nor must you show pity.” (See also at Exodus 21:24 and Leviticus 24:17–22.) A false witness must not get away with the crime, lest the justice system be undermined.

Chapter 20



Verse 1

<i>Rules for War</i> (20:1–20)
According to the narrative setting of Deuteronomy, Israel is on the brink of entering the Promised Land and will have to conduct a war of conquest. However, vv. 14–15 contain stipulations applying to foreign wars, not the conquest in Canaan. These rules aim to keep up morale by assuring the soldiers that God is with them.

Verse 2



Verse 3



Verse 4



Verse 5

<b><i>5–7.</i></b> These deferments or exemptions are designed to permit a young conscript to complete the establishment of his home, agricultural livelihood, and family—the major anchors of society. The law is less concerned with the feelings of the individual soldier than with the formation of crucial social institutions. Establishing a house, farm, and family is the greater good, even in time of war; for without these there is no community (see also 24:5; 28:30; Jeremiah 29:5–6).

Verse 6



Verse 7

<b><i>bride-price.</i></b> Better, “betrothal gift.” See further at Genesis 29:18, Exodus 22:15–16, and <i>Chayei Sarah,</i> Another View. The marriage has been legally contracted but not consummated; the woman is considered married and cannot marry another man.

Verse 8

 Because of the contagious nature of cowardliness, this verse instructs the officials to remove fearful soldiers lest they demoralize the rest of the troops.

Verse 9



Verse 10

<b><i>10–14.</i></b> These procedures are typical of ancient Near Eastern warfare. If a city capitulated by accepting the peace terms, it was spared a siege, which generally resulted in starvation and disease before capitulation. Peace terms would specify the payment of tribute, which included forced labor by the captives. The killing of the adult males and the taking of women, children, and livestock as booty are also typical (as seen in the case of the foreign woman taken in warfare in 21:10–14) and have the effect of further weakening—or even decimating—the losing side as well as providing human capital for the victors. In I Samuel 30, David’s wives and the “wives and sons and daughters” of his six hundred men (30:3) are taken captive by a band of Amalekite raiders.

Verse 11



Verse 12



Verse 13



Verse 14



Verse 15

<b><i>15–16.</i></b> These verses distinguish wars outside Canaan, to which the stipulations listed above apply, from wars within Canaan, which demand the complete eradication of all life, lest any survivors lead the Israelites into foreign worship practices.

Verse 16



Verse 17



Verse 18



Verse 19

<b><i>19–20.</i></b> This passage prohibits a “scorched earth” policy. Only trees that do not provide food may be cut down, if necessary, to be used for constructing ramps and scaffolding to scale the city walls. To the contemporary reader this may sound like an ecologically minded policy; but the reason for it is unclear. Perhaps it was meant to ensure a food supply for the soldiers.
<i><b>Are trees of the field human.</b></i> The Hebrew phrase is obscure; it may mean that trees are not the enemy, or that they cannot defend themselves and therefore should not be harmed, or both.

Chapter 21



Verse 1

<i>Unsolved Murder</i> (21:1–9)
Deuteronomy exhibits a concern not only with punishing the guilty, but also with ensuring that the community bears no responsibility for bloodshed, for the shedding of innocent blood makes the land impure (see also 19:10, 13). In this case, there is no suspect to accuse of the killing, so the community is responsible. A ritual and a prayer will remove the bloodguilt from the town.

Verse 2



Verse 3



Verse 4



Verse 5



Verse 6



Verse 7

 If no witnesses are found, the local elders must swear an oath declaring innocence of the action and lack of knowledge about the action.

Verse 8

 A prayer that God will absolve the guilt follows the oath. Notice that it is no longer a matter of one town, but of “your people,” that is, Israel as a whole. Even in the somewhat “secularized” laws of Deuteronomy, justice in human affairs is part of Israel’s religious view.

Verse 10

<i>Laws Regarding Family Relations</i> (21:10–21)
This unit addresses three irregular family situations involving women and children.
MARRIAGE TO A PRISONER OF WAR (21:10–14)
This section on the captive wife continues the discussion of war in the preceding parashah (20:1–20). If an Israelite warrior wishes to marry a female captive, he is obligated to enable the woman to transition to her new status. The seeming conflict between this law and others that prohibit marrying women from the surrounding cultures (see especially 7:2–4) highlights the fact that the Torah does not unconditionally prohibit marrying foreign women. Rather, the prohibition pertains to those specific local Canaanite nations whose practices threaten Israel’s identity and unconditional commitment to God. [The main purpose of this law is to protect the vulnerable (as is true of other laws in Deuteronomy) and to preserve the woman’s position and dignity. That men legally had sexual access to women captured in war is evident in numerous texts from the ancient world; see, for example, the comments by the women who comfort the mother of Israel’s enemy leader, Sisera, in the Song of Deborah (Judges 5:29–30).—<i>Ed</i>]

Verse 11

<b><i>beautiful woman.</i></b> The Bible characterizes several women as beautiful, including Sarah, Rebekah, and Rachel (Genesis 12:11; 24:16; 29:17). Here, the woman’s beauty is the source of the attraction. (For more on this topic, see <i>Emor,</i> Contemporary Reflection.)

Verse 12

<b><i>12–13.</i></b> The captive woman enters the household, but only after she is given a month to mourn the loss of her parents can the Israelite marry her. The change in her status is signaled by trimming her hair and paring her nails (which may be signs of mourning or of the end of the mourning period), as well as by discarding her captive’s clothing.

Verse 13



Verse 14

 If the Israelite later rejects this foreign wife, he must free her outright. Her status as the wife of an Israelite forever protects her from becoming, or reverting to, the status of a foreign slave (compare Exodus 21:7–8).
<i><b>had your will of her.</b></i> Heb. <i>innah;</i> this inflection of the verbal root <i>e-n-h</i> can mean to debase a woman by having sex with her outside of a regularly contracted marriage. (For more on this verb, see at Genesis 34:2.) This raises the possibility that the man had sex with the woman while she was still a captive, which would not have been unusual. Alternatively, this verb may indicate that the marriage, while recognized as legal, was not considered typical.

Verse 15

HEIR WHOSE MOTHER IS AN UNLOVED WIFE (21:15–17) The law concerns a man with two wives, although he presumably could have more. Indeed, several biblical narratives point to the two-wife family (plus concubines): Rachel and Leah (Genesis 29), Hannah and Peninnah (I Samuel 1), and the lesser-known wives of Lamech, Adah and Zillah (Genesis 4:19). The tension here over whose son has the rights of inheritance also informs the story of Sarah and Hagar (Genesis 16–21). This law is not intended to protect the unloved wife, rather, to protect the legal heir. As the husband’s first-born son, the child must be designated as his heir and receive a double portion regardless of the man’s feelings about the mother. Inheritance, which involved land, is extremely important in the Bible; thus, great pains are taken to identify the proper heirs and preserve the transmission of land holdings to them (see 25:5–10).
<b><i>loved and the unloved</i></b> The same Hebrew words describe the situation of Leah and Rachel (see at Genesis 29:30–31), although there the subject of inheritance does not surface in the conflict.

Verse 16



Verse 17



Verse 18

THE INCORRIGIBLE SON (21:18–21) The law now moves to another type of child, the incorrigible son. This law probably does not apply to daughters, for the characteristics of being a glutton and a drunkard seem to be stereotypically male, whereas 22:20–21 does concern a rebellious daughter (see below). The text states explicitly that both mother and father are equally involved in multiple attempts to discipline the son. If they are unable to control him, it becomes the larger society’s responsibility to deal with him. Insubordination to parents, a violation of “Honor your father and mother” (5:16; Exodus 20:12; also Leviticus 19:3), is considered a capital offense. Such behavior undermines the parents’ authority and the function of families, which are the center of Israelite society.

Verse 19



Verse 20

<b><i>“disloyal and defiant.”</i></b> Here, disobedience is the crime; elsewhere, cursing and striking a parent are capital offenses (Exodus 21:15, 17; Leviticus 20:9; Deuteronomy 27:16).

Verse 21



Verse 22

<i>Laws Regarding Neighbors, Nature, and Clothing</i> (21:22–22:12)
Generally speaking, the laws in this unit promote good citizenship by legislating areas of responsibility for what takes place outside of one’s own household.
<b><i>22–23.</i></b> This law limits the desecration of the corpse of an executed criminal by requiring relatively quick burial.

Chapter 22



Verse 1

<b><i>1–4.</i></b> By returning lost objects (vv. 1–3) and helping to raise a fallen animal (v. 4), individuals cooperate to form a stronger community. Compare Exodus 23:4–5, which demands the return of, or aid to, the animal of an enemy—not of a neighbor.

Verse 2



Verse 3



Verse 4



Verse 5

 The prohibition on cross-dressing is not explained, except to note that it is abhorrent to God. This rule perhaps was intended to prevent unacceptable sexual practices or pagan cultic practices. More likely, it aims to maintain gender boundaries, analogous to the laws against forbidden mixtures in 22:9–11, thus preventing confusion about the public presentation of a person’s gender identity.

Verse 6

<b><i>6–7.</i></b> This law deals with the humane treatment of a mother bird and her fledglings. Interpreters often compare it to the prohibition of cooking a kid (baby goat) in its mother’s milk (see at 14:21; Exodus 23:19; 34:26), as well as with the prohibition against slaughtering an animal and its mother on the same day (Leviticus 22:28).

Verse 7



Verse 8

 Since roofs were flat and rooftops were used as a living or work space, they needed a wall or fence around them so people would not fall off.

Verse 9

<b><i>9–11.</i></b> The list of forbidden mixtures covers plants, animals, and clothing. No reason for these prohibitions is provided. (See also at Leviticus 19:19.)

Verse 10



Verse 11



Verse 12

This verse does not explain why tassels (<i>g’dilim</i>) should be put on one’s everyday clothes. However, Numbers 15:37–41 mandates <i>tzitzit</i> (there translated as “fringes”) as reminders to obey God’s commandments. The law appears to be gender neutral, in that women are not excluded from wearing tassels. (For more on tasseled garments, see at Numbers 15:37–41.)

Verse 13

<i>Laws Regarding Sexual Misconduct</i> (22:13–29)
In the Bible, women are expected to be chaste before marriage. This unit inquires into cases in which a woman’s premarital chastity is either in doubt or known to have been violated. (For further discussion, see Tikva Frymer-Kensky, “Law and Philosophy: The Case of Sex in the Bible,” reprinted in <i>Studies in Bible and Feminist Criticism,</i> 2006, pp. 239–54.)
FALSE AND TRUE ACCUSATIONS OF UNCHASTITY (22:13–21)
This section focuses on false accusations of unchastity, which the law is intended to discourage, as well as the procedure if the accusation turns out to be true.
<b><i>13–19.</i></b> This passage presents the case of a husband who falsely accuses his bride of having been unchaste before the marriage. Motivating this accusation is the husband’s desire to get out of the marriage without incurring any financial costs. Under normal circumstances, if a man divorces his wife he must pay the support-money required by the marriage contract. However, if his accusation of unchastity succeeds, the husband will be able to rid himself of his wife without payment; and he might even benefit financially, for he is in essence accusing the bride’s father of breach of contract. The husband claims that he contracted and gave the betrothal gift for a virgin but received a wife whose betrothal gift should have been less. If so, the contract would be declared invalid; as a result, the husband would recoup the betrothal gift he had paid and the father might have to pay additional money as damages to the husband.

Verse 14

<b><i>14–15.</i></b> In this legal scenario, the husband makes public statements defaming the bride. Her parents sue the husband for defamation of character, of both the bride and her parents. According to this reading, the parents are the plaintiffs and the husband is the defendant. Alternatively, the husband is the plaintiff, bringing the legal claim of unchastity; and the parents are the defendants. Both mother and father bring evidence to the elders; but only the father utters the legal declaration, perhaps because the claim of breach of contract is directed at him. (Compare 21:20, where both parents make a legal declaration.)
<b><i>“party.”</i></b> [Heb. <i>ishah</i> (traditionally, “woman”). The present translation understands that the word <i>ishah</i> (and its corresponding male term, <i>ish)</i> has as its primary sense “a representative member of a group”; in legal settings, this sense translates to “a party (to the case at hand).” See <i>The Contemporary Torah,</i> 2006, pp. 394–5.—<i>Ed.</i>]

Verse 15



Verse 16



Verse 17

<b><i>‘I did not find your daughter a virgin.’</i></b> The public statement by the husband in v. 14 did not say “your daughter” but rather “she.” The father construes the case as an accusation against himself more than his daughter, for he is responsible for his daughter’s chastity.
<i><b>the cloth.</b></i> Typically, readers assume this to be a blood-stained sheet from the wedding night. Many commentators, medieval and modern, have noted the flimsiness of this evidence and the impossibility of proving whether the bloodstain was faked or not, even assuming that the custom of saving the wedding sheet for such an occasion was indeed practiced in ancient Israel. On the other hand, it would have been difficult to prove that the evidence was faked. If the parents bring the lawsuit, with evidence that is hard to refute, then clearly the accusation is false. This action and the penalty that the elders impose upon the man aim at deterring such false accusations. Without such deterrence, husbands might all too easily accuse their unloved wives of premarital unchastity, to the detriment of a society in which marriage and family were the keystones.

Verse 18



Verse 19

<b><i>fine him a hundred [shekels].</i></b> This is double the betrothal gift (v. 29) that the father would have returned had the accusation been true. Thus, the would-be “thief” pays double what he wishes to steal. The fine is paid to the father, not the wife, for he is considered the injured party in the lawsuit.
<i><b>he shall never have the right to divorce her.</b></i> The husband’s aim from the start seems to have been to divorce his wife, and this option now is forever denied him. To a modern reader, this seems to be a punishment for the bride as well as for the husband. In ancient society, however, a woman was more secure economically when married than when divorced. (An individual could scarcely survive economically or socially unless she or he was a part of a family or similar group. This was especially true of women, who had few means of independent support and little chance for social standing or power outside the group. See at 22:29.) This law was probably intended to deter false accusations of unchastity, or perhaps to deter easy and baseless divorces.

Verse 20

<b><i>20–21.</i></b> If the accusation is true, the sentence is carried out at the entrance to the father’s house, not at the town gate; the father is held responsible and thus is publicly dishonored. The penalty for the wife is death. Premarital sex in itself is not the problem (although it was certainly discouraged; see vv. 28–29); the problem here, from the husband’s view, is misrepresentation—providing the husband with a wife whose due betrothal gift would have been lower than that of the virgin that he contracted for. Many scholars think that this section was added later for the sake of symmetry; clearly, the main emphasis is on the case of false, not true, accusation.
Modem scholars have understood this case as the female parallel to the incorrigible son. In both cases, the offspring fails to uphold the family standards and goes against parental authority. In both cases, the parents’ testimony decides the outcome; and the penalty for disobeying parental authority is death by stoning. This parallel strongly suggests that in both cases, the issue is repeated, uncontrolled behavior—not a one-time occurrence. The “unchaste bride” is actually being accused of promiscuity and deception, not merely a pre-marital fling. These laws attempt to promote proper behavior by adolescent women and men who are at precisely the age when rebellion against parental authority is most likely. (See Adele Berlin, “Sex and the Single Girl in Deuteronomy 22,” in Nili Fox et al., eds., <i>Mishneh Todah: Studies in Deuteronomy.</i>.., 2008.)
<b><i>if the charge proves true.</i></b> This refers to the husband’s accusation (v. 14).
<i><b>the girl was found not to have been a virgin.</b></i> Better, “no signs of virginity belonging to the girl were found.” In other words, the parents could not or did not bring the cloth to the elders, so there was no way to disprove the husband’s accusation.

Verse 21



Verse 22

THE PENALTY FOR ADULTERY (22:22) In the Bible, adultery is defined as sex between a married or betrothed woman and a man other than her husband or fiancé (see also Exodus 20:13). This verse is placed here to make clear that adultery is a capital offense and that both parties receive the death penalty. In the story of the adulterous encounter between King David and Bathsheba (II Samuel 11–12), God commutes David’s death sentence; Bathsheba’s guilt is not mentioned. While in that story it is David who initiates the sexual act, Proverbs 7 tells of a married woman who lures a young man into committing adultery.

Verse 23

FORCED AND CONSENSUAL SEX WITH A BETROTHED WOMAN (22:23–27) While Deuteronomy takes a dim view of premarital sex by a woman (see below), it recognizes that in some cases women are victims of nonconsensual sex and therefore seeks to protect them from culpability in those cases. (A betrothed woman, meaning one whose marriage has been contracted, is for legal reasons considered like a married woman. If she engages in consensual sex with a man other than the one betrothed to her, both are committing adultery.) How does one determine if the sex was consensual or not? This section establishes that if the encounter took place in the town (vv. 23–24), where she could call for help if she needed it, then the sex is judged to be consensual and both are culpable. The supposition is that had she called for help, she would have been heard and rescued. However, in the country (vv. 25–27), where presumably no help is available, the sex is assumed to have been forced and the woman is not culpable. We may assume that the woman went on to marry her fiancé with no legal repercussions.

Verse 24



Verse 25



Verse 26



Verse 27



Verse 28

FORCED SEX WITH AN UNBETROTHED WOMAN (22:28–29) This case concerns a woman who is not married or betrothed, so engaging in sex with her does not constitute adultery. The law assumes that the man initiated the act and that there was some degree of coercion, as reflected in the statement, “he seizes her and lies with her” (v. 28; compare v. 23). The man is obligated to marry the woman and to pay the betrothal gift for virgins; he may never divorce her. (Compare Exodus 22:15–16, which does not include the no-divorce stipulation and provides for the father’s refusal of the marriage.)
Some modern commentators wonder if this was a form of elopement, or a way for the woman to force her father to agree to her choice of a marriage partner. Others view the law as hard on the woman, who would have to remain married to her “rapist” (although this was not necessarily a rape). As in most cases, however, the law is not focused on the interests of women individually, but instead on families and society. The law assumes some initiative or even force on the man’s part (on such language, see at Exodus 19:15); after all, voluntary sex on the woman’s part that did not result in marriage to the sexual partner would leave her vulnerable to the true claim of unchastity by a subsequent husband (see vv. 20–21). This law seeks to prevent that situation. Sex by an unmarried or unbetrothed woman is, as it were, covered up by making it sound less-than-consensual and by quickly marrying off the woman to her sexual partner (who would hardly be in a position to later accuse her of unchastity). The man is obligated to remain married to her for much the same reason as the false accuser is (see at v. 19).
Permanent marriage without the possibility of divorce protects the woman (see at v. 19), who would find it difficult to contract another marriage if her past marital or sexual history were known. The law also protects the father’s interest in that he receives the fullest betrothal gift. A never-married non-virgin daughter would not be easy to marry off. Given that there must have been women of this description, Deuteronomy is at pains to protect them while still adhering to a high ideal standard for women’s premarital sexual behavior.

Verse 1

<i>Laws Regarding Forbidden Relationships</i> (23:1–9)
Following the prohibition of marrying one’s father’s former wife, this unit restricts membership in the community by sexual and ethnic characteristics.
PROHIBITION ON MARRYING A FATHER’S FORMER WIFE (23:1)
This law appears in Leviticus 18:8 and 20:11 as part of a long list of prohibited incestuous relationships. The reference applies to a person’s stepmother, not simply to his biological mother.
<b><i>to remove his father’s garment.</i></b> That is, to lay claim to his father’s wife (Leviticus 18:8, 20:11; Ezekiel 16:8; Ruth 3:9), whom it would be inappropriate to marry.

Verse 2

RESTRICTION ON WHO MAY ENTER GOD’S CONGREGATION (23:2–9) This section limits those included in the “congregation,” which may mean the official members, or full citizens, of the Israelite community. (See also at Leviticus 21:16–24.)
 Eunuchs are mentioned first. In the ancient world, young men captured in war were sometimes castrated and designated to serve in the court, a military unit, or a household.

Verse 3

<b><i>misbegotten.</i></b> Heb. <i>mamzer,</i> a status term whose precise meaning is uncertain because it appears only once more in the Bible, in an equally vague setting (Zechariah 9:6). (The Rabbis understood this term to refer to children of prohibited marriages.)

Verse 4

<b><i>4–7.</i></b> These verses exclude Ammonites and Moabites because they treated Israel poorly after the Exodus. According to Genesis 19:36–38, Ammon and Moab are the offspring of the incestuous unions between Lot and his daughters, which may explain why they are included just after the mention of the <i>mamzer.</i> Traditional commentators interpret this exclusion as applying only to male Ammonites and Moabites. This helps eliminate the contradiction between this verse and the book of Ruth, in which a Moabite woman (Ruth) is accepted into the Israelite community. The present translation understands the grammatically masculine language in this prohibition to refer to women as well, based on an allusion in I Kings 11:1–2 (<i>The Torah: A Modern Commentary,</i> revised edition, 2005, p. 1328). However the exclusion of Ammonites and Moabites is defined, its historical origin is not known, nor is it clear if Deuteronomy’s denial of citizenship also included a ban on marrying them (although that may have been the result).

<i>Miscellaneous Laws</i> (23:10–24:9)
This unit contains a series of laws about purity in wartime, escaped slaves, prostitution, financial responsibilities, divorce, skin disease, and other assorted matters.
LAWS REGARDING SOLDIERS, SLAVES, AND PROSTITUTES (23:10–19)
This passage concerns three seemingly unrelated groups of people: soldiers, slaves, and prostitutes.
<b><i>10–15.</i></b> Ritual purity is required in the military camp, for God is thought to be present in it. Certain bodily functions render a man impure (see at Leviticus 15:1–18), but this should not be confused with uncleanliness.

Verse 11



Verse 12



Verse 13



Verse 14



Verse 15



Verse 16

<b><i>16–17.</i></b> Most commentators understand this asylum law to apply to foreign slaves, not Israelites. In contrast, ancient Near Eastern practice required the extradition of runaway slaves.

Verse 17



Verse 18

<b><i>18–19.</i></b> These verses seem to prohibit prostitution by females and males, though the meaning of v. 19 is obscure.
<b><i>prostitute.</i></b> Heb. <i>k’deishah</i> and <i>kadeish.</i> In the past, scholars understood these terms as a reference to male and female cult prostitution, which was associated with Canaanite and Mesopotamian fertility rites where ritual sexual union was believed to ensure agricultural fertility. The reason for this interpretation is that the term <i>k’deishah</i> derives from <i>k-d-sh</i> (meaning “holy” or “set apart”) and the etymologically related Akkadian term <i>kadishtu</i> refers to a type of priestess. Recent scholarship, however, has questioned the existence of cult prostitution in the ancient Near East, although there may have been prostitutes in the vicinity of temples, and temples may have received funds from their activities. Many scholars now believe that <i>k’deishah</i> means a common prostitute (<i>zonah</i>), not a cult prostitute (see Genesis 38:15, 21, where both terms are used). [Others suggest different interpretations. Tikva Frymer-Kensky writes that <i>k’deishah</i> refers to “a public woman, who might be found along the roadway (as virgins or married women should not be). She could engage in sex, but might also be sought out for lactation, midwifery, and other female concerns” (<i>Women In Scripture,</i> 2000, p. 162). Phyllis A. Bird, who translates <i>k’deishah</i> as “hierodule” (from Greek, meaning “a sacred/holy servant”) considers the term to refer to a variety of cult-related women (<i>Missing Persons and Mistaken Identities,</i> 1997, p. 199).—<i>Ed.</i>] While the Bible certainly does not encourage prostitution, it acknowledges and accepts it as part of the social reality. Indeed, since prostitutes are among the socially inferior in that they do not belong to male-headed households, the Bible occasionally treats them with sympathy (see the depiction of Rahab in Joshua 2 and the two women who plead before Solomon in I Kings 3:16–27). Deuteronomy’s strong stance against prostitution fits with the book’s idealized picture of society.

Verse 19



Verse 20

LAWS REGARDING COMMITMENTS TO GOD AND NEIGHBORS (23:20–26) Deuteronomy repeatedly expresses a concern with economic issues under the umbrella of divine law.
<b><i>20–21.</i></b> For more on laws protecting poor Israelites who depend on loans, see at Leviticus 25:36.

<b><i>22–24.</i></b> For more on vows, see at Numbers 6 and 30.

Verse 25

<b><i>25–26.</i></b> This law about eating unharvested crops applies to everyone, not only the poor. (See also Leviticus 19:9–10.)

Chapter 24



Verse 1

MORE LAWS REGARDING MARRIAGE (24:1–5) The two laws in this section supplement material regarding marriage, first by setting conditions under which remarriage may be possible; and second, by prolonging a couple’s “honeymoon,” as it were.
<b><i>1–4.</i></b> This law about forbidden remarriage considers it indecent (akin to adultery) for a husband to remarry a woman he divorced who subsequently married another man. This may have been intended to deter quick divorce or to prevent promiscuity; concerns about paternity could also be an issue. Note that David’s wife Michal was given to another man, Paltiel, by her father King Saul, but David subsequently demanded her back as his wife (I Samuel 18:27; 25:44; II Samuel 3:13–16). (See also at Leviticus 21:7 and Another View.)
<b><i>something obnoxious about her.</i></b> The same idiom appears in 23:15, where the translation reads “anything unseemly.” The verse does not specify the valid conditions for divorce.
<i><b>bill of divorcement.</b></i> This refers to some sort of legal divorce document.
<i><b>sends her away.</b></i> This technical language for divorce—the opposite of “takes her as a wife”— means that the woman is no longer part of the man’s household. [This ruling was not always interpreted to mean that only husbands could initiate divorce. The oldest surviving Jewish marriage contracts (from a Jewish community in Elephantine, Egypt) show that in the 5th century <small>B.C.E.</small>, wives could initiate a divorce.—<i>Ed.</i>]

Verse 2



Verse 3



Verse 4



Verse 5

 This law concerning military deferments resembles 20:7, but here only the marital deferment is singled out, and the time of the deferment set at a year. To “give happiness” to his new wife presumably refers to conjugal pleasure. See also at 25:5–10.

Verse 6

MISCELLANY: OBJECTS TAKEN IN PAWN, KIDNAPPING, SKIN AFFLICTION (24:6–9) This section contains more laws tying everyday situations with divine law.
 This law mandates that certain tools are not to be taken as pawns. If the millstones used to grind flour were accepted in pledge for a loan, the family would lack the tools needed to sustain itself. (On women’s role in bread-making, see at Exodus 16:3 and 25:30, as well as at Leviticus 26:26.)

Verse 7

 Kidnapping a fellow Israelite (female or male) for profit, either to get free labor or to sell the victim into slavery for money, is a capital offense.

Verse 8

<b><i>8–9.</i></b> For more on such skin conditions, see at Leviticus 13:1–59.

Verse 9

<b><i>Miriam.</i></b> This verse—the only verse in the Torah that mentions Miriam in words directly attributed to Moses—alludes to Numbers 12:10–15, where Miriam is stricken with skin disease for challenging Moses’ authority. Here Moses holds her up as an example of the seriousness of skin disease and the need to heed God’s instructions for dealing with it. (For more on Miriam, see at Numbers 20:1.)

Verse 10

<i>Laws Protecting the Vulnerable</i> (24:10–25:16)
This unit provides laws to protect various categories of economically disadvantaged persons, safeguarding, in particular, the welfare of the stranger, the orphan, and the widow.
OBTAINING PLEDGES AND PAYING WAGES (24:10–15)
These rules aim to preserve a borrower’s dignity and treat a worker justly.
<b><i>10–11.</i></b> The lender may not enter the borrower’s home to obtain the pledge (an object taken to guarantee the repayment of a loan), for this might embarrass a borrower by showing her or his poverty.

Verse 11



Verse 12

<b><i>12–13.</i></b> A cloak or blanket given in pledge must be returned at night so that the borrower can use it as a covering at night (see also Exodus 22:25–26).

Verse 13



Verse 14



Verse 15

 Since day-workers (not household servants) depend on their daily wages, they must be paid in a timely manner.

Verse 16

PROHIBITION ON TRANSGENERATIONAL PUNISHMENT (24:16) Other ancient Near Eastern law collections consider children to be extensions of their parents; according to the principle of talion (exact retribution), if a person has caused the death of another person’s son, the perpetrator’s own son can be put to death (see, for example, Laws of Hammurabi ¶ 230). Deuteronomy forbids Israelites to inflict such punishment.

Verse 17

PROTECTING THE STRANGER, FATHERLESS, AND WIDOW (24:17–20) These three classes of people do not have a male head-of-household to protect them, support them, and look after their interests in public; therefore, society as a whole must watch out for and not take advantage of them.
<b><i>a widow’s garment.</i></b> Special protection is granted to a widow, whose garment, unlike that of a day laborer, may not serve as a pledge for a loan. A sense of modesty also may inform this law.

Verse 18



Verse 19

 The book of Ruth shows how reapers are expected to leave some produce for the needy to glean after the harvest (see also at Leviticus 19:9–10; 23:22).

Chapter 25



Verse 1

LIMITS ON FLOGGING (25:1–3) Although flogging is a legal penalty, care must be taken to avoid beating the individual excessively in order to avoid dehumanizing the person.

Verse 2



Verse 3



Verse 4

PROHIBITION ON MUZZLING AN OX WHEN IT IS THRESHING (25:4) This is another law that mandates kindness to animals (see also at 22:6–7), ensuring that the animal may eat some of the stalks being threshed.

Verse 5

LEVIRATE MARRIAGE (25:5–10) Levirate marriage is intended to secure the continuation of a deceased married man’s lineage and land-inheritance if he has no children. This principle is operative in the story of Judah and Tamar (Genesis 38) and hinted at, although not in its normal form, in the book of Ruth. Deuteronomy provides a process for opting out of the levirate marriage, later called <i>chalitzah,</i> although in biblical times it seems that levirate marriage was preferred. The number of such marriages must have been relatively small, since most married couples would have produced a child within a few years of marriage, before the husband died. Military deferment for new husbands (24:5) helps to avoid the situation whereby a man is killed in war before he has sired a child.
<b><i>When brothers dwell together.</i></b> This means they live on their father’s estate, which has not yet been legally subdivided among them.

Verse 6



Verse 7

<b><i>if the [family] representative does not want to marry his brother’s widow.</i></b> There may be many reasons for his refusal, including that he would incur additional responsibilities for a family that is legally his brother’s, not his. [An heir to the deceased brother would also prevent the living brother from gaining the dead brother’s land.—<i>Ed.</i>] <i><b>his brother’s widow shall appear before the elders in the gate.</b></i> The widow initiates the public proceedings after her brother-in-law denies her the protection and status that she would have as a wife and mother, and as the beneficiary of her husband’s inheritance. The woman here clearly has legal standing and is entitled to bring a case to the court. Her words and actions, formalized by the law, are a performative way of publicly shaming the brother-in-law who refuses the levirate marriage.
The law does not envision a woman being able or desiring to reject a levirate marriage. After all, to become an unattached childless widow is a position most ancient women would have wished to avoid. Indeed, in the story of Judah and Tamar, Tamar resorts to extreme measures to avoid remaining a childless widow (see at Genesis 38).

Verse 8



Verse 9



Verse 10



Verse 11

PUNISHMENT OF A WOMAN WHO INTERVENES IN HER HUSBAND’S FIGHT (25:11–12) This law, which appears harsh and puzzling by modern standards, involves sexually shaming a man in public. While other ancient Near Eastern laws contain similar stipulations (see Middle Assyrian Laws A ¶ 8), the biblical law is relatively mild.

Verse 12



Verse 13

HONEST WEIGHTS AND MEASURES (25:13–16) The cheating of customers may have been a recurrent problem since it is mentioned often in ancient Near Eastern laws. Here, Deuteronomy presents proper business ethics as a religious principle that is crucial for the preservation of Israelite society.

Verse 14



Verse 15



Verse 16



Verse 17

<i>Charge to Remember Amalek</i> (25:17–19)
The parashah concludes with an injunction to remember the incident recounted in Exodus 17:8–16. Amalek is singled out for strong condemnation. The command to blot out the name of this enemy is emphasized by its being framed by “remember…do not forget.” (There is an irony to the command to remember to blot out Amalek’s name.) In synagogues, this passage is traditionally read aloud from the Torah on Shabbat Zachor, the sabbath before Purim. By calling Haman an Agagite, the book of Esther makes him an Amalekite, whose king in the time of Saul was Agag. Amalek became a symbol of later Jewish enemies as well.

Chapter 26



Verse 1

<i>Ceremonies for First Fruits and Tithes</i> (26:1–15)
Both first fruits and tithes assume an agricultural society, which is to begin with the settlement in Canaan. (For information on women in agrarian society, see “Women in Ancient Israel—An Overview.”.)
FIRST FRUITS (26:1–11)
Generally, the Israelites are to dedicate first fruits to God in thanks for the fertility that yielded the produce—and with the hope that this fertility will continue (see at 15:19–23; Exodus 34:19; Leviticus 27:26–27). In this case, however, people are instructed to show gratitude for the possession of the land (mentioned three times in vv. 1–3) through a ceremony that celebrates the fulfillment of God’s promise of land to the ancestors. After all, the offering of the first fruits is a direct outcome of, and a performative act in recognition of, God’s giving the Promised Land to Israel. In keeping with Deuteronomy’s principle of centralization of sacrificial worship, the first fruits are to be brought to God’s Chosen Place (meaning the Temple in Jerusalem) on Shavuot, the late spring pilgrimage festival that celebrates the grain harvest (see at 16:9–12). The occasion includes a festive meal, to be shared with the Levites and resident aliens who would not have their own first fruits. Although there is no mention here of other family members participating in the ritual, 16:11 explicitly includes women in the Shavuot celebration.

Verse 2

<b><i>you.</i></b> Although the language in 26:1–15 is grammatically masculine singular, Moses addresses both the male head of the household and his wife or principal wife (see <i>R’eih,</i> Another View; <i>Mishpatim,</i> Another View).

Verse 3

<b><i>“our fathers.”</i></b> In this translation, the term <i>avot</i> is understood to refer specifically to the patriarchs when they serve as representatives of their households (here and v. 15); elsewhere, it is rendered in a more inclusive sense as “ancestors” (as in v. 7). Although the forefathers alone are invoked in this verse, the covenantal promises are inclusive (see at Genesis 17).

Verse 4



Verse 5

<b><i>5–11.</i></b> The liturgy to be recited during this ceremony reviews Israel’s history from the end of the descent to Egypt in the time of Jacob, through the Exodus, to the coming to the land; it omits the wilderness period and the revelation at Sinai. Instead, the text emphasizes the deeds that God performed for Israel. This passage, along with its midrashic explanation, has become a central part of the Passover Haggadah.
<b><i>“My father was a fugitive Aramean.”</i></b> Or, “wandering Aramean.” “My father” probably refers to Jacob, father of the twelve tribes. The patriarchs and matriarchs came from Aram Naharaim, which is where Jacob flees to and starts a family with Leah, Rachel, Zilpah, and Bilhah (Genesis 30).

Verse 11



Verse 12

TITHES (26:12–15) The tithe of the third year is not to be taken to the central sanctuary like the tithes of the first and second years (14:22–29); instead, it is distributed locally to those who are dependent on public assistance, including widows and Levites (see at 12:19).

Verse 13



Verse 14

<b><i>deposited any of it with the dead.</i></b> In ancient Israel, people believed that they could assist the spirits of the dead by providing food and drink for them to consume in Sheol, the place where all the dead resided. This verse does not prohibit this practice, though it does exclude the use of tithed foodstuff for this purpose. Contact with the dead is considered a source of ritual impurity (Jeffrey Tigay, <i>Deuteronomy,</i> 1996, p. 244).

Verse 15

<b><i>from Your holy abode, from heaven.</i></b> Elsewhere in the Bible, God’s abode is conceived of as an earthly sacred space (as in Exodus 25:8); but in Deuteronomy, God is considered transcendent and not located in any place on earth. The book speaks of God’s “name” dwelling in the Chosen Place (as in 12:5) to counter the impression that God literally dwells there. This verse shows how Deuteronomy uses a traditional idiom but modifies it to fit its distinctive theology.

Verse 16

<i>Conclusion to the Laws</i>
OBLIGATIONS FOR ISRAEL AND GOD (26:16–19)
The laws in Deuteronomy 12–26 now end with an exhortation calling upon Israel to obey the covenant between God and Israel. Both parties affirm their obligations: Israel is to follow the laws, while God is to maintain a special relationship with Israel.

Verse 17



Verse 18

<b><i>God’s treasured people.</i></b> As in 7:6, this phrase means that God chooses Israel to be holy and set aside for God. This idea stems from the view that Israel’s God assigned other gods to different nations (see at 4:19–20) while establishing a special relationship with the people of Israel. This does not mean that Israel views itself as innately superior to other peoples, although the God of Israel is considered more powerful than all other gods (see also at Exodus 19:5).

Chapter 27



Verse 1

<i>Ceremonies upon Entering the Land</i> (27:1–26)
The laws in Deuteronomy 12–26 are framed by ceremonies to be performed once the people cross over into the Promised Land (see 11:29–32). Deuteronomy links the entrance into the land with obedience to the laws and repeatedly emphasizes that Israelite success and survival in the land depend upon their adherence to these laws. (One can best explain the several discontinuities or digressions in this unit as the result of later editorial activity.)
ERECTION OF INSCRIBED STONES AND A STONE ALTAR AT MOUNT EBAL (27:1–8)
This section instructs the Israelites to set up plaster-coated stones at Mount Ebal on which “this Teaching” will be written after they cross the Jordan. At the same location, they are to erect an altar of unhewn stone for offering sacrifices. Mount Ebal is located near the town of Shechem (modem day Nablus), about thirty miles from the site of the crossing of the Jordan and hence too far to reach on the same day. (Compare Joshua 4:19, which offers a different version of these events.)

<b><i>inscribe upon them.</i></b> Similarly, the law collection of the Babylonian king Hammurabi, including its prologue and epilogue, was inscribed on a stele and erected in a temple.
<i><b>this Teaching.</b></i> Heb. <i>ha-torah ha-zot,</i> which does not mean the entire Torah as we now have it, but instead the book of Deuteronomy, or perhaps only its legal portions (see also at 31:9).

Verse 9

CALL TO OBEY THE COVENANT AT MOAB (27:9–10) These verses declare that Israel is God’s people and therefore obligated to obey God’s laws. This section fits better with 26:17–18, the conclusion of the covenant at Moab.

Verse 10



Verse 11

PROCLAMATION OF BLESSINGS AND CURSES AT MT. GERIZIM AND MT. EBAL (27:11–26) Deuteronomy 11:26–30 first mentions a public ceremony to announce the consequences of keeping or neglecting the terms of the covenant (enacted in Joshua 8:33–35). Deuteronomy 28 contains the actual blessings and curses to be recited during the ceremony.
<b><i>11–13.</i></b> This passage adheres to 11:26–30, according to which the blessing for those who obey the commandments is to be proclaimed at Mount Gerizim and the curse for those who disobey at Mount Ebal. (Compare vv. 14–26, below.)

Verse 12

 Six of the tribes, the descendants of Leah and Rachel, will utter the blessings on Mount Gerizim (north of Shechem); six others, the descendants of the handmaids Bilhah and Zilpah plus Reuben and Zebulun, will utter the curses on Mount Ebal (south of Shechem).

Verse 13



Verse 14

<b><i>14–26.</i></b> This passage seems to be an alternate version of the ceremony of vv. 11–13; here, the people all stand together and the Levites make the proclamation. And it is not a list of curses for disobeying the commandments, as in Deuteronomy 28; instead, this passage lists twelve sinful actions for which a person is declared deserving of being cursed, meaning that they warrant divine punishment. The list summarizes the larger body of Deuteronomic law, showing a concern for a just society, sexual mores, and protection of the vulnerable.

Verse 15

 Deuteronomy is adamantly opposed to graven images or idols, be they of Israel’s God (as in the episode of the molten calf in Exodus 32; Deuteronomy 9:12) or of foreign deities.
<i><b>Amen.</b></i> To ratify their acceptance of each statement, people respond with “Amen,” which means “true” or “I affirm the foregoing.”

Verse 16

<b><i>insults father or mother.</i></b> This verse refers to one who treats a parent with disrespect (<i>m’kaleh</i>), as exemplified by the incorrigible son in 21:18–21. This statement is similar to, but broader than, Exodus 21:17 and Leviticus 20:9, which forbid “cursing” (<i>k-l-l)</i> one’s parents. Our verse uses a similar sounding term, from the root <i>k-l-h,</i> meaning “to treat lightly.” This is the opposite of honoring a parent (<i>k-b-d</i>, which derives from the root meaning “to be heavy”). Children are to treat both mothers and fathers with respect (see also at 5:16; Exodus 20:12).

Verse 17

 See at 19:14.

Verse 18



Verse 19

<b><i>widow.</i></b> See <i>Eikev,</i> Another View.

Verse 20

<b><i>father’s wife.</i></b> This refers to any wife of one’s father, not just the mother of the man addressed by the law; the father’s sexual rights are not to be impinged upon by “removing his garment.” To “spread a garment” over a woman is to claim responsibility for her in marriage (Ezekiel 16:8; Ruth 3:9). (See also at Deuteronomy 23:1 and Leviticus 18:8.)

Verse 21



Verse 22

<b><i>his sister.</i></b> This verse forbids intercourse with one’s sister or half-sister (see also at Leviticus 18:9). The book of Samuel tells of King David’s son Amnon, who rapes his half-sister Tamar (II Samuel 13). In that story, the concern is more with forced sex outside of marriage that victimizes the woman than with the impropriety of sibling sex. Although the text remains ambiguous, it seems that Amnon could have married Tamar had he so wished, which would conflict with the law here.

Verse 23

 One’s mother-in-law is like one’s father’s wife in regard to impermissible sexual relations (compare Leviticus 18:17).

Verse 24



Verse 25

<b><i>accepts a bribe.</i></b> This statement probably condemns the acceptance of bribes by judges in a case that results in the death sentence for an innocent defendant. However, it may be directed to witnesses bribed to give false testimony.

Chapter 28



Verse 1

<i>Consequences of Obeying or Disobeying the Covenant</i> (28:1–68)
Unlike the proclamations in 27:11–26, the blessings and curses in this unit constitute promises or punishments that will befall Israel depending on whether the people obey or disobey God’s commandments. Although the blessings and curses are formulated in second-person masculine singular language, they are addressed to the entire community and apply to the community as a whole, not to individuals. Similar examples of blessings and curses are found in Exodus 23:20–33 and Leviticus 26:3–45.
The Bible models the covenant between God and Israel on the model of a treaty between two human parties, one of whom is superior to the other: the superior promises protection, and the inferior promises loyalty. Ancient Near Eastern international treaties generally contain, near the end, warnings about the consequences of a breach of the treaty; such dire threats aim to motivate the inferior party to uphold the treaty and not rebel against the overlord. Deuteronomy 28 closely resembles one ancient treaty in particular, the Vassal Treaty of Esarhaddon, a Neo-Assyrian treaty dating from 672 <small>B.C.E.</small>, the time when much of Deuteronomy is thought to have originated. The tradition of curses is also attested in legal texts going back at least as far as the Laws of Hammurabi (1792–1750 <small>B.C.E.</small>). The curses may reflect the actual experience of the Babylonian exile, assuming that this unit was one of those parts of Deuteronomy added or edited after the exile (586 <small>B.C.E.</small>).
THE BLESSINGS (28:1–14)
The blessings are contingent on the people’s obeying the divine laws (Deuteronomy 12–26). The totality of the blessings will lead to a strong, secure, and prosperous country, superior to its enemies and loyal to God.

Verse 2



Verse 3



Verse 4

<b><i>your issue from the womb.</i></b> Literally, “your fruit of the belly”; see at 7:13. The verse promises fertility for humans, soil, and domestic animals (see also vv. 11 and 18, below). Human fertility is often thought of as a woman’s domain, but here it is clearly part of the community’s blessing and of major concern to the men as well. Indeed, fertility—of humans, of the soil, and of domestic animals—is crucial to the existence of Israel (see also <i>Noach,</i> Another View).

Verse 5

<b><i>your basket and your kneading bowl.</i></b> Women would have used these vessels for gathering grain and making bread (see at Exodus 16:3 and 25:30 for more on women’s role in bread production). As in the previous verse, women’s work is credited to the community as a whole.

Verse 6



Verse 7

<b><i>7–14.</i></b> These verses spell out applications of the foregoing verses, which were stated in general terms. They also express a common theme in Deuteronomy, emphasizing that the blessings depend on obedience to God.

Verse 8



Verse 9



Verse 10

<b><i>יהוה’s name is proclaimed over you.</i></b> This expression means that God is the authority over Israel and that Israel is God’s people.

Verse 11



Verse 12

 This verse promises that God will provide the fertility by bringing the rain to water the crops. The importance of rain in Israel cannot be exaggerated (see also at 11:10–11). Human and animal fertility is dependent on agricultural fertility.
<i><b>that bounteous store.</b></i> Literally, “[God’s] bounteous store,” which reflects the belief that rain was stored in the heavens and belonged to God. (See also at 33:13.)
<i><b>rain…in season.</b></i> The proper timing of the rain is crucial. Rain must come in the right part of the growing season; rain during the harvest can ruin the crops.
<i><b>You will be creditor.</b></i> As a result of the bounty described above, Israel will have a surplus to lend to other nations.

Verse 13



Verse 14



Verse 15

THE CURSES (28:15–68) The section on the curses is longer and more graphic than the depiction of the blessings, although they parallel each other in part. The curses warn that God will call upon nature and foreign enemies to bring ruin to Israel, which means that Israel will lose the land that God promised. Deuteronomy makes the continued settlement in the Promised Land contingent on obeying God (whereas the promise of the land to Abraham in Genesis was unconditional). The theology of Deuteronomy, which may be largely postexilic (after 586 <small>B.C.E.</small>), paves the way to explain the destruction of the Temple and the exile as resulting from Israel’s sins and disobedience. This passage closely corresponds to the curses in Leviticus 26; both texts are considered so terrifying that the custom later arose to recite them in an undertone when reading the Torah aloud in the synagogue.
<b><i>15–19.</i></b> These verses parallel the opening of the section of blessings in vv. 1–6.

Verse 16



Verse 17



Verse 18



Verse 19



Verse 20

<b><i>20–44.</i></b> This passage elaborates on the general curses of vv. 16–19, in horrific detail.

Verse 21

<b><i>21–24.</i></b> These verses present a picture of a country wracked with heat, drought, pestilence, disease, and finally starvation and death, which is what will happen if God does not open the heavens and provide rain (v. 24). The description also correlates with conditions of a city under siege, as Jerusalem experienced before its destruction in 586 <small>B.C.E.</small>, in which case disease and starvation would result not from lack of rain, but from the population’s inability to obtain food.

Verse 22



Verse 23

<b><i>copper…iron.</i></b> “Copper” probably refers to bronze (the same Hebrew word denotes both); along with iron, these were the hardest metals known in ancient times. No rain can break through the bronzed (from the heat) sky, and no vegetation can break through the iron-hard soil.

Verse 24

<b><i>dust.</i></b> Dust and sand represent the antithesis of rain.

Verse 25

<b><i>25–26.</i></b> Instead of celebrating a victory over attacking enemies, as in vv. 7 and 10, Israel will be powerless to defend itself and will become a disgusting sight to the other nations. Most dishonorably, the war-dead will lie unburied, with no one to care for them.

Verse 26



Verse 27

<b><i>27–29.</i></b> These verses describe various physical ailments and mental disabilities, subsumed under skin diseases and blindness, which were common ailments in the ancient world. The precise identification of these diseases is not known.

Verse 28



Verse 29



Verse 30

<b><i>30–35–35</i></b>. This passage warns that people will not benefit from their labors or enjoy their possessions.
 This verse denies a man the benefits of the military deferment given in 20:5–7. Building a house, planting a vineyard, and taking a wife signify establishing a household.
<i><b>bride-price.</b></i> Better, “betrothal gift.” (See at Exodus 22:15–16; <i>Chayei Sarah,</i> Another View; and “Women in Ancient Israel—An Overview.”.)
<i><b>wife.</b></i> The payment of the betrothal gift by the groom to the bride’s father constituted a legal marriage contract. Although the bride and groom thus were bound in marriage, the marriage was not consummated immediately.
<i><b>enjoy her.</b></i> The idiom means to have illegitimate sex with the woman, causing her to lose her virginity before the marriage has been consummated. The Hebrew term written unvocalized in the text (called the <i>k’tiv)</i> is vulgar, as seen in Isaiah 13:16 and Zechariah 14:2, where the same verb is used for the rape of women during war. Therefore, the tradition for public recitation (called the <i>k’rei)</i> has replaced the root <i>sh-g-l</i> with a euphemism that comes from the root <i>sh-k-b,</i> meaning “to lie with her.”

Verse 31



Verse 32

<b><i>32–33.</i></b> The threats that a person’s children will be sold as slaves in a foreign land (see also 28:41) and that foreigners will eat someone’s produce imply conquest by another country. Lamentations 5:2 speaks of the confiscation of land by foreigners in connection with the Babylonian exile, an experience perhaps in the author’s mind.
<b><i>sons and daughters.</i></b> Four times this passage stresses that both female and male children will be affected by the threat (see also vv. 41, 53, 56).

Verse 33



Verse 34



Verse 35



Verse 36

<b><i>36–37.</i></b> These verses present an even stronger allusion to defeat and exile.
<i><b>a proverb, and a byword.</b></i> The foreign nations will taunt Israel by making up sayings about its defeat.

Verse 37



Verse 38

<b><i>38–40.</i></b> This passage refers to the non-fertility of the land, namely frustrating cases in which produce that has already grown will then be destroyed through natural causes.

Verse 39



Verse 40



Verse 41

 As in vv. 4, 11, and 18, children are included among the agricultural items. Just as people will not enjoy the agricultural products that they plant and tend (vv. 38–40, 42), so they will not maintain possession of the children they raised. Isaiah 49:14–23 depicts Israel in exile as a bereaved woman who soon will watch her children return home to her.

Verse 42



Verse 43

<b><i>43–44.</i></b> These verses threaten a reversal of the economic superiority promised in vv. 12–13.

Verse 44



Verse 45

<b><i>45–57.</i></b> After having suffered the losses and degradation mentioned so far, the people’s ultimate end will be their annihilation. This moving description pictures the enemy’s invasion and destruction of the agriculture of the land (partially, at least, to feed the invading army). Then come siege and starvation, which eventually lead to cannibalism. The unusually detailed descriptions of the selfish, secretive actions of the man and woman vividly convey the desperate and inhumane nature of the situation.

Verse 50



Verse 51



Verse 52



Verse 53



Verse 54

<b><i>householder.</i></b> Heb. <i>ish</i> (traditionally, “man”), which this translation understands here as the head of the household. The person normally responsible for the care and protection of its members now looks after only his own needs.
<i><b>wife of his bosom.</b></i> The corresponding expression is used for the husband in v. 56 (see also at 13:7). In both cases, the phrase refers to one with whom someone has an intimate relationship, a person held dear and protected.

Verse 55

<b><i>the children that he eats.</i></b> As gruesome as this may seem, cannibalism is a common trope in descriptions of sieges (Leviticus 26:29; Lamentations 2:20; 4:10; II Kings 6:24–30; Jeremiah 19:9; Ezekiel 5:10; and in Assyria, the Vassal Treaties of Esarhaddon ¶¶ 47, 69, 71, 75). The verse refers not to killing the children, but to the eating of bodies that had already died from starvation.

Verse 56

<b><i>most tender and dainty.</i></b> This verse uses the same Hebrew terms to describe the woman as those found in v. 54 to characterize the man (translated there as “most tender and fastidious”). The attributes of softness and fastidiousness ascribed to both sexes, stemming from the high standard of living they previously enjoyed, will be undermined by the dire straits in which they find themselves. Then they will lose all traces of civilized behavior, even a sense of humanity.
<i><b>never venture to set a foot on the ground.</b></i> The verse describes a woman who formerly lived in luxury, someone accustomed to riding in a sedan chair or carriage so that her feet did not come in contact with the ground. A modern equivalent would be “she never got her hands dirty.” <i><b>husband of her bosom.</b></i> See above under “wife of his bosom” (v. 54).

Verse 57

 Most difficult to read is the description of the mother eating her dead babies and even the afterbirth. Lamentations 2:20 and 4:10 also depict women as cannibals (see at v. 55 for additional references). The reversal of the woman’s normal role nurturing children aims to illustrate just how gruesome the conditions might become. Likewise, in the account of a famine in Samaria (II Kings 6:24–30), what may look to some readers like the callous eating of children by the women illustrates the severity of the famine, not any fault in the women. Maternal cannibalism is considered the “end of the rope”; it convinces the king that all is lost. (See also Another View.)

Verse 58

<b><i>58–68.</i></b> After a warning about diseases that God will bring on Israel, this passage looks beyond the siege to the captivity and survival in a foreign land. Although a scattered remnant will remain, they will live in anguish and dread. Even worse, Israel’s history will be reversed: the plagues that the Egyptians suffered will be visited upon Israel (v. 60); and the once numerous people will be reduced to a scant few (v. 62) as the exodus from Egypt is undone (v. 68).

<i>Concluding Statement to the Covenant</i> (28:69)
Deuteronomy here ties the covenant at Moab to the covenant at Horeb (Sinai). Up until this point, the laws of Deuteronomy 12–26 stood independently. According to 4:13 (and compare 10:4), only the Decalogue was revealed by God at Horeb; according to 4:14, Moses was commissioned at Horeb to provide the additional laws, which he does at Moab, just before the people enter the promised land where these laws will go into effect (Moshe Weinfeld, <i>Deuteronomy 1–11,</i> 1964, p. 205). The Deuteronomic view is that the laws delivered in Moab are now depicted as a supplement to the earlier Sinai covenant.

Chapter 29



Verse 1

<i>Commencement of Moses’ Last Speech.</i> (29:1–8)
According to Deuteronomy, Moses addresses the generation of Israelites who have experienced the exodus and wandering as they near the end of their journey. He reminds them of all that God did for them during the time of the exodus and wandering, which they are now in a better position to appreciate. These divine deeds form the reason why the people should obey the covenant.

Verse 2



Verse 3

<b><i>Yet to this day.</i></b> Moses announces that although the Israelites experienced these events, they were not able to understand their significance until they now prepare to enter the land, the culmination of and reason for all they have been through. Note, however, that the presumed audience may not have been physically present at those earlier historic moments, except perhaps as children.

Verse 4

<b><i>clothes…sandals.</i></b> [Whereas most of the past events that Moses has recalled thus far in Deuteronomy occurred some 40 years earlier, here Moses uses the pristine condition of the sojourners’ clothing to demonstrate God’s care in terms visible to the current generation. The rhetorical purpose here and throughout this parashah has been to impress upon the contemporary and future audiences just how generous and faithful God has been, and how and why the Israelites owe allegiance to their God. —<i>Ed.</i>]

Verse 5

<b><i>bread…wine or other intoxicant.</i></b> These staples of an agricultural society were not available in the wilderness, where the people survived on manna, quail, and water—unnatural foodstuffs divinely provided.

Verse 6



Verse 7



Verse 8

<b><i>terms of this covenant.</i></b> [Or “the words (<i>divrei</i>) of this covenant.” The parashah concludes as it began, in the sense that it demands gratitude from the Israelites in light of all that God has done for them. It casts the people’s obligation in terms of loyalty to the words of this covenant, that is, the comprehensive program for a just society that cares for all its members and is loyal to its one God. —<i>Ed.</i>] <i>—Adele Berlin</i>  

Verse 9

<i>The Covenant Ceremony</i> (29:9–28)
This unit emphasizes the full participation of all the people—women and men from all segments of the community—in the ceremony that establishes the covenant between God and Israel.
PARTICIPATION IN THE CEREMONY AND COMMITMENT TO THE COVENANT (29:9–14)
The two phrases <i>avar bi-vrit</i> (entered into a covenant; v. 11) and <i>karat b’rit</i> (made a covenant; v. 13) designate ratifying a covenant by accepting its terms. In covenant rituals, <i>k-r-t</i> (whose basic meaning is “to cut”) refers to the cutting of animals, and <i>e-b-r</i> (whose basic meaning is “to cross over”) signifies the passing between the parts of the animal (see at Genesis 15:10; Jeremiah 34:18–19). Although this part of the parashah does not describe the covenant celebration, other biblical texts and ancient Near Eastern evidence indicate that sacrificial offerings were part of the acceptance of a covenant (see Genesis 31:44–54; Exodus 24:1–8; Deuteronomy 27:1–8). Furthermore, this section accentuates three conceptual angles of the covenant: its clear hierarchy of the parties, in that it is the people who “cross over” into God’s covenant (v. 11); its content (v. 12); and the people’s commitment to it, whether present in the ceremony or even absent from it (v. 14).
<b><i>9–10.</i></b> The inclusiveness described here is a unique feature of the Moab covenant. Compare the general term “the people” used to characterize the participation in the Sinai covenant (Exodus 19:9–13; 24:3, 7). Whereas the text in Exodus raises the question of whether or not women stood at Sinai (see <i>parashat Yitro</i>), here there is no doubt that both women and men are the recipients of God’s teachings. The detailed list in this passage mentions various groups according to their social status. Verse 9 opens with leaders and concludes with “all the men of Israel”; v. 10 adds those dependent on the aforementioned men as heads of the household: children, women, and foreign workers. [While in some senses householders’ senior wives were dependent, in other senses their status was complementary to that of their spouses and higher than that of other male members of the household. See further “Women in Ancient Israel—An Overview.” —<i>Ed.</i>]
<b><i>You stand…before יהוה.</i></b> This phrase designates one’s presence in front of an authority (as in Exodus 7:15; 34:2).
<i><b>this day.</b></i> The first part of Moses’ speech (29:18, at the end of <i>parashat Ki Tavo)</i> looked back on key events in the past and the lessons to learn from them; now the focus shifts to the present moment and even to the future. The leitmotif “this day” (here and in v. 14) functions as a message to the double audience of Deuteronomy, namely, the implicit audience at the time of Moses and the audience contemporary with the author(s) of the book of Deuteronomy, centuries later. The ceremony validates the covenant’s power to obligate the descendants to the treaty and to abide by its stipulations.
<i><b>you tribal heads.</b></i> [The text identifies five of the subgroups listed in vv. 9–10 (tribal heads, elders, officials, children, women) via a second-person plural masculine suffix. In order to convey the understanding that each of these subgroups is part of the larger collective whom Moses addresses in this passage, the present translation has rendered the suffix “your” as “you.” —<i>Ed</i>.]

Verse 10

<b><i>you children, you women.</i></b> Within the groups enumerated in this verse, “children” appear prior to “women” (as in Numbers 32:26; but compare the opposite order in Deuteronomy 3:19; 20:14; 31:12). Women are likewise mentioned last in the common triplet of socially marginal people: stranger, fatherless, widow (see 14:29; 27:19).
<i><b>stranger.</b></i> See at 10:19.
<i><b>from woodchopper to water drawer.</b></i> These two types of laborers exemplify specific tasks performed by resident non-Israelites (the “stranger” included in the covenant) (see Joshua 9:21, 23, 27).

Verse 11



Verse 12

<b><i>as promised you and as sworn to your fathers.</i></b> Verse 12 alludes to two separate covenant traditions. The first recalls the promise originally made to the Israelites in Egypt (Exodus 6:7; also Leviticus 26:12; the second refers to the covenant with Abraham (Genesis 17:7–8). The two traditions coalesce here as they each emphasize the institution of a mutual relationship between God and Israel. (On <i>avot</i> translated here as “fathers” instead of “ancestors” as in 30:9, see at 4:31.)

Verse 13



Verse 14

<b><i>those who are not with us here this day.</i></b> That is, future generations. Binding the descendants to the covenant exemplifies its dynamic force, as it expects an everlasting renewal of this fundamental covenant.

Verse 15

CONCEALED OFFENSE AND OVERT JUDGMENT (29:15–20) Addressing the people in general, Moses raises another possible transgression of the covenant. He cautions the Israelites that individuals (“some man or woman”) or larger groups (“clan or tribe”) might be tempted to worship other gods. While the offense is concealed, the divine wrath that follows as punishment is apparent and known.
In contrast to Deuteronomy 13 and 17:2–7, which concern cases where the community’s fortune may be determined by the misconduct of but a few individuals, the present section focuses on a different aspect of the situation: singling out the persons who sin and threatening them with total annihilation. Deuteronomy’s notion of communal responsibility and retribution still governs this passage; but this section also emphasizes the notion that the community is formed from its many individuals, each of whom is personally accountable for her or his own actions.
<b><i>15–16.</i></b> Idolatry is usually connected to Canaan and Canaanite influences. Yet this passage mentions worshipping other gods as a temptation to which the people were exposed earlier, in Egypt and on the journey to the Land (mostly by the nations of Transjordan, such as the Moabite women in Numbers 25:1–5). Nevertheless, these verses do not suggest that Israel as a nation was actually carried away to perform idolatrous practices prior to the settlement in the Land (compare the explicit accusations in Ezekiel 20:5–9; Joshua 24:14; Numbers 25:1–3).

Verse 16



Verse 17

<b><i>man or woman.</i></b> As in 17:2, 5, the text acknowledges the possibility that either women or men might lead the people astray. Cozbi and the Moabites in Numbers 25:1–18 illustrate this threat with regard to women.
<b><i>whose heart is even now turning away from our God</i> יהוה.</b> In contrast to Deuteronomy 13 and 17:2–7, which emphasize visible transgressions, our parashah focuses on the hidden thought and intention and on following the willful or the stiffened heart (<i>bishrirut lev).</i> The heart, which in Deuteronomy is often the innermost organ of intellectual acknowledgment and piety, serves frequently in the Bible as the secret place for self-reflection (as in Ecclesiastes 2:1, 15), personal or political evil-intent (as in Genesis 27:41; I Kings 12:26), or even for theologically illegitimate thoughts (as in 8:17; 9:4; Isaiah 14:13; 47:10). This last context seems to be the background of our passage’s repeated usage of the heart as the organ where secret offense against God is concealed.
<i><b>poison weed and wormwood.</b></i> These two plants appear together elsewhere in the Bible, where the poisonous nature of the one and the sharp bitterness of the other serve as metaphors to illustrate various points: social injustice (Hosea 10:4; Amos 5:7; 6:12); punishment for disobedience, particularly in worshipping other gods (Jeremiah 8:14; 9:14); and memories of distress and misery (Lamentations 3:19). Hence, this context is unique, as the plants express the danger that the sinner may cause to those around them.

Verse 18

<b><i>to the utter ruin of moist and dry alike.</i></b> This idiom is puzzling. It seems to express the inevitable destructive consequences to the righteous as well as to the sinner.

Verse 19

<b><i>19–20.</i></b> This passage describes the divine wrath and judgment on the transgressor as an implementation of the covenant’s sanctions written in the book of Teaching (<i>torah</i>) (see 28:58). The language is in the third-person singular, thus suggesting the possibility of individual retribution (see at vv. 15–20 above), a concept that existed alongside the notion of collective retribution. While the entire community suffers as a result of the sins of the few, individual offenders still pay for their misdeeds, for they receive special punishments.

Verse 20



Verse 21

LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE DESTRUCTION (29:21–27) In a sharp change, the text moves from the individual judgment for a concealed sin (29:15–20) to the apparent destruction of both the land and people. In contrast to vv. 19–20, vv. 21–27 present a different concept of retribution: collective judgment and punishment for disobedience that affects even the land’s ecological systems. The devastation becomes a lesson for later Israelite generations and foreigners who ask why God decimated the land (vv. 23–27). Destruction and exile are considered justifiable actions that God executes in reaction to Israel’s sins. This perspective may reflect Israel and Judah’s historical experience, like that of the entire region west of the Euphrates River, when they faced the aggressive Neo-Assyrian Empire (in the 9th–7th centuries, resulting in the destruction of the northern kingdom of Israel in 722 <small>B.C.E.</small>) and then the Neo-Babylonian regime (in the late 7th–6th centuries, resulting in the destruction of Jerusalem in 586 <small>B.C.E.</small>).

Verse 22

<b><i>sulfur and salt…just like the upheaval of Sodom and Gomorrah.</i></b> God rained sulfurous fire over Sodom and Gomorrah (Genesis 19:24). The well-remembered tradition of the fate of Sodom and Gomorrah (Genesis 18–19) is adapted here to describe the ecological consequences of destruction. The text posits no human enemy or human warfare; instead God, as divine Warrior, acts with great might against God’s own people and land. This sort of ecological disaster stands in contrast to the divine oath after the deluge: “Never again will I bring doom upon the world on account of what people do” (Genesis 8:21).

Verse 23



Verse 24



Verse 25

<b><i>gods whom they had not experienced.</i></b> In contrast to relying on gods the people had not experienced, Deuteronomy repeatedly calls attention to the fact that the Israelites witnessed with their own eyes the many marvelous deeds that God performed on their behalf (for instance, 7:19; 11:7).
<i><b>and whom [God] had not allotted to them.</b></i> The concept that God allocated other gods for the foreign nations to worship implies that Israel was not fully monotheistic at this stage. The statement reflects a belief called monolatry, which involves the allegiance to one god, but the recognition of the existence of other deities (see also at 4:19–20). Deuteronomy repeatedly makes the point that because Israel was chosen as God’s people, they are forbidden from worshiping any other gods (as in 4:15–20; 5:7–9).

Verse 26



Verse 27

<b><i>יהוה uprooted them from their soil in anger.</i></b> This verse applies agricultural language to the concept of exile, which is treated as another divine action resulting from God’s wrath.
<i><b>and cast them.</b></i> Heb. <i>vayashlicheim.</i> Torah scribes write this verb with an enlarged letter <i>lamed</i> in the middle. While later interpreters have sought to derive meaning from this practice, the reason for this custom is unknown. (A midrashic explanation is that the large <i>lamed</i> designates the beginning of a new word, which leads one to read these letters with a different punctuation: <i>v’yesh lachem,</i> meaning, “But you [will] have [God in another land]” [David Zvi Hoffman, <i>Deuteronomy,</i> 1961, p. 516]. This midrashic reading provides a significant ideological comment for those in exile, reassuring them of God’s presence among the people in a foreign land; compare Ezekiel 11:16.)
<i><b>“as is still the case.”</b></i> This phrase reveals the possible time of authorship of this section. Since the people presently experience exile (as in 4:29–31; 30:1–10), this suggests the text was written during the Babylonian exile. Another explanation is that these words were secondarily introduced into an earlier original pre-exilic passage that was later updated.

Verse 28

CONCEALED AND OVERT ACTS (29:28) While this one enigmatic verse has accrued various interpretations over time, its possible plain meaning derives from context: the continuing opposition between the concealed and the overt in this parashah. One reading is that these are Moses’ concluding words of assurance to the people. “Concealed acts” refer to sins committed by the individual in secret, thus only God can reveal and judge (following vv. 15–20), whereas “overt acts” refer to public sins of a group or of the whole collective, which human judges must punish according to “this Teaching” <i>(hatorah hazot).</i> Hence, the threat of destruction (vv. 21–27) stands as a punishment only if the people neglect their communal responsibility to punish individual sinners in order to save the innocent majority (so the medieval commentators Rashi and Nachmanides).
Another way to interpret this verse is to understand the concealed and the overt as time references. Hence, “concealed acts” are future events about which only God knows, such as the threatened destruction and exile (29:21–27) or the promised consolation and restoration (30:1–10). “Overt acts” are what God had revealed to the people concerning past divine deeds and the practical duties in God’s Teaching (so Samuel R. Driver, <i>Deuteronomy,</i> 1902, p. 328, and others).
<b><i>it is for us and our children.</i></b> Traditionally these two Hebrew words <i>(lanu ulvaneinu</i>) and the first letter following are written with extraordinary dots (<i>n’kudot</i>) over the letters, a scribal phenomenon that occurs in fifteen places throughout the Bible. In ancient manuscripts, such as the Qumran scrolls as well as Greek and Roman texts, dotted letters or words signify that they should be erased and clearly not pronounced. However, these biblical instances were exegetically reconsidered and the dots gained diverse symbolic values.

Chapter 30



Verse 1

<i>Repentance and Restoration from Exile</i> (30:1–10)
Following the blessings and curses in Deuteronomy 28, as well as the description of destruction and exile in 29:21–27, 30:1–10 functions to transition from judgment to salvation. Moses instructs the people on these future circumstances of national existence in exile, when reinstitution of the relationship with God will be a major issue. The theme of repentance stands out as a central topic, reflected in the fact that the verbal root <i>shuv</i> (“to turn or return”) repeats as a key word in these verses. The sequence is clear: the initiative to repent should come from the people in exile, as individuals, and it will result in God’s restoration of the people (vv. 2–3).
The root <i>shuv</i> holds several different meanings in its eight occurrences in this unit, all of which exemplify an internal process of change and transformation: return from the bad ways, regret, leaving the evil deeds behind, changing the way of life, and finally approaching God in a close relationship. The intertwining occurrences of the root <i>shuv</i> emphasize the reciprocal nature of the God-human relationship. First, those in exile will “take to heart” (<i>vahasheivota</i>; literally, “your heart shall turn back”) what has happened (v. 1), return (<i>v’shavta</i>) to God (v. 2), and obey God’s teachings. In response, God will restore the people’s fortune (<i>v’shav…et sh’vutcha</i>; literally, “return a return”) and turn back (<i>v’shav</i>) to gather them to their land (v. 3). The people will again heed (<i>tashuv v’shamata</i>; literally, “turn back and heed”) and be obedient to God (v. 8). As a result, God will again delight (<i>yashuv…lasus</i>; literally, “turn back and delight”) in the people’s well-being (v. 9), once they return (<i>tashuv</i>) to God with all their hearts and souls (v. 10).

Verse 2



Verse 3



Verse 4



Verse 5



Verse 6

<b><i>open up your heart.</i></b> Literally, “circumcise your heart.” The metaphor of the circumcised heart exemplifies the profound internal transformation of each and every person. God needs to act upon the heart, where recognition of the sin develops (v. 2) and where full obedience and devotion reside (vv. 3, 10), in a circumcision-like procedure to ensure the permanency of this change. Deuteronomy previously mentioned circumcision of the heart (“cut away, therefore, the thickening about your hearts,” 10:16) in its demand that the people not close their hearts and stiffen their necks. In contrast, the present circumcision of the heart is a divine action of grace (so Nachmanides), or maybe of compulsion (so according to the prophet Ezekiel, 11:19–20; 36:26–28).

Verse 9

<b><i>your issue from the womb.</i></b> See at 7:13; 28:4.

Verse 10



Verse 11

<i>The Choice</i>
LIFE OR DEATH, BLESSING OR CURSE (30:11–20)
Moses’ closing remarks in this unit resemble the concluding words of the book of Deuteronomy’s prologue (the part that precedes the legal material): compare “See, this day I set before you…” (11:26) to “See, I set before you this day…” (30:15). Whereas in the earlier passage “blessing” and “curse” represent opposite alternatives, here Moses presents the people with a more detailed and radical choice, governed by the alternatives of life and death.
ENCOURAGEMENT THAT THIS INSTRUCTION IS NOT BEYOND REACH (30:11–14)
This passage emphasizes that God’s teaching (“the Instruction”) is not unintelligible, but is within the realm of human comprehension. This is a polemic against the notion of wisdom as “hidden from the eyes of all living” (Job 28:21; also 42:2–3) or “elusive and deep” (Ecclesiastes 7:24; see also Proverbs 30:2–4, 18–20).
<b><i>Instruction.</i></b> Heb. <i>mitzvah,</i> a close parallel to <i>torah</i> (“Teaching,” as in 29:28). Whereas the plural <i>mitzvot</i> is regularly translated as “commandments” (for instance, 4:2; 6:17), in the singular, <i>mitzvah</i> designates the legal corpus as a whole, the instruction which the people should follow in its entirety and by which they exemplify their devotion to God (as in 6:25; 8:1; 11:22; 15:5; 19:9). The noun holds this generic meaning also when it opens the tripartite cluster of <i>mitzvah, chukim,</i> and <i>mishpatim,</i> translated as “the Instruction—the laws and rules” (as in 6:1; 7:11).

Verse 12

<b><i>It is not in the heavens.</i></b> This verse accords with the general biblical perspective that emphasizes the human inability to reach heaven, the abode of God (Genesis 11; Proverbs 30:4), a theme profoundly anchored in Mesopotamian literature as well. The point is that this teaching is within reach, such that grasping it requires no supernatural help.

Verse 13



Verse 14



Verse 15

CHARGE: CHOOSE LIFE AND PROSPERITY VERSUS DEATH AND ADVERSITY (30:15–20) Concluding his words on the covenant, obedience, the land, and blessing and curse, Moses offers a basic choice between two stark alternatives: life and death. He establishes a clear, logical connection between obedience to God and God’s covenant on the one hand and the reward of life on the other, which entails prosperity and thriving upon the land (vv. 15–16). In contrast, disobedience will inevitably bring calamity in the land, adversity, and death (vv. 17–18). The passage moves from life to death to life, closing with a hopeful, positive perspective.

Verse 16



Verse 17



Verse 18



Verse 19

<b><i>19–20. Choose life…For thereby you shall have life.</i></b> Moses’ last command to the people is not redundant. The two consecutive phrases present a close connection between an action and its reward. The verb “to live” and the noun “life” serve as key words in this final passage, occurring interchangeably six times. In Deuteronomy, “life” refers to the reward for obeying specific laws (as in 16:20) or for obeying the Instruction (<i>torah</i>) in general (see 4:1; 30:6). In this passage, this language signifies the “path of life,” the way that people choose to live their lives.

Verse 20

<b><i>by loving יהוה.</i></b> As is characteristic of Deuteronomy, love constitutes both the motive and the way to be in relation with God (see also at 7:13).
<i><b>holding fast.</b></i> The verbal root <i>d-b-k</i> first appears in Genesis 2:24, describing the close bond between the first man and woman. As this parashah comes to an end, Moses envisions the relationship between Israel and God as an equally intimate connection. (On marriage as a metaphor for the covenantal relationship between God and Israel, see at 5:9.)
<i>—Dalit Rom-Shiloni</i>  

Chapter 31



Verse 1

<i>Moses Assures Israel of Success</i> (31:1–13)
Moses reminds the people of God’s plans to take them across the Jordan into the Promised Land, accompanied by Joshua. Once there, the people are to gather and read the <i>torah</i> aloud every seventh year during the festival of Sukkot.
MOSES PREPARES THE PEOPLE FOR GOD AND JOSHUA TO TAKE OVER (31:1–5)
Unable to enter the Promised Land, Moses reassures the people of success and appoints Joshua to take the lead.
<b><i>Moses went.</i></b> The verse suggests that Moses seeks out the people in order to deliver his message; time is of the essence since he knows that he is about to die.
<i><b>spoke…things.</b></i> Heb. <i>va-ydaber…d’varim,</i> where both the verb and its object derive from the same root (<i>d-b-r</i>). This language echoes the opening verse of Deuteronomy, where the two forms of this root also appear together: “These are the words (<i>d’varim</i>) that Moses addressed (<i>dibber</i>) to all Israel” (1:1). Soon, at the end of his long series of speeches, Moses will write down these precious words as his legacy to Israel (v. 9). At Deuteronomy’s end, the oral and the written become inextricably linked.

Verse 2

<b><i>I can no longer be active.</i></b> The Hebrew idiom for a lack of physical motion in an aged Moses is more suggestive—literally “I am no longer able to go out or come in.” The image of movement is reinforced by God’s next words, reminding Moses that he cannot cross over the Jordan and enter the land.

Verse 3

<b><i>your God יהוה who will cross over before you.</i></b> Moses turns from his own fate to the people’s, who shortly will leave him behind. Poignantly he speaks of “your God,” not including himself in the address. Since Moses will not cross the Jordan (v. 2), God and Joshua will cross before the Israelites (v. 3) to ensure victory as they settle the land.
<b><i>Joshua is the one who shall cross before you, as</i> יהוה <i>has spoken.</i></b> The syntax of this phrase is odd, forcing the English translation to add dashes to make sense of the sentence. The prior sentence states that God’s destruction of the nations will end with Israel’s dispossessing them. Then, almost as an afterthought, Joshua is introduced. This clearly tacked-on phrase suggests an editorial insertion to draw attention to the role that Joshua will assume. The verse reflects a tension between God’s actions on our behalf and the human means by which those actions are accomplished.

Verse 4

 About to die, Moses retells what happened in the past. As in <i>parashat D’varim,</i> he shapes Israel’s memories of the wilderness journey in order to teach lessons pertinent to the present moment. (For speculation on how a female narrator might have reshaped the story, see the introduction to this parashah.)

Verse 5



Verse 6

MOSES ENCOURAGES THE PEOPLE AND JOSHUA: “BE STRONG AND RESOLUTE” (31:6–8) These three verses present the reader with an identifiable section that shows signs of careful editing through the use of repetition and inversion to make a highly political point to the Israelite audience. Verse 6 contains four clauses that claim a cause-and-effect relationship, stressing that the people Israel can be strong and free of fear because God is with them and will not let them down. Verses 7–8 include language nearly identical to that of Moses when he commissions Joshua. One noteworthy difference between vv. 7–8 and v. 6 is the insertion of Joshua’s name as the one who will lead the people along with God. Because he assumes this role, Israel should accept his equally important function as the one who divides the land among the tribes. The politics of succession as well as the necessary persuasion to secure Joshua’s legitimacy are in play here. The deft weaving together of similar language in each passage signals that God approves the arrangement.
<b><i>Be strong and resolute.</i></b> This expression of encouragement, particularly used in the context of war, appears three times in this parashah (also vv. 7 and 23) and four times in Joshua 1 as the people prepare to enter the land (vv. 6, 7, 9, 18).
<i><b>forsake you.</b></i> Here and in v. 8, Moses assures the people and Joshua that God will not forsake or abandon them. The same verbal root <i>(e-z-b)</i> is used later when God foreshadows that Israel will forsake God (v. 16), which in turn will result in God forsaking them (v. 17). In Isaiah 49:14–15, the identical verb is used when the people in exile express their anxiety that God has deserted them. In response, the prophet reassures them by means of a rhetorical question that compares God to a mother: “Can a mother forget her babe, or stop loving the child of her womb? Even these could forget, but I could not forget you.”

Verse 7

<b><i>Then Moses called Joshua.</i></b> Just as Joshua prepares to take the lead after Moses’ death, his brother Aaron also has a successor, Eleazar (Numbers 20:26). While no one is designated to succeed their sister Miriam, Deborah would be a fitting choice. Deborah, like Miriam (Exodus 15:20), is called a prophet (Judges 4:4); and she is praised as “Mother in Israel” (Judges 5:7), a title that most likely indicates her role as a leader during the period of the Judges. Also, just as Miriam sings a song of victory and praise after crossing the Sea of Reeds (Exodus 15:20–21), so too does Deborah sing a song of praise after the defeat of Sisera (Judges 5). It is intriguing that both of these two poems, which are thought to be among the oldest compositions in the Bible, are associated with women. (On women as singers of victory songs and other poetic compositions, see at Exodus 15:1–19 and Deuteronomy 32:1–43.)
<i><b>in the sight of all Israel.</b></i> That is, Joshua must be seen and accepted as the legitimate successor to Moses.

Verse 8



Verse 9

MOSES GIVES INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE PUBLIC READING OF THE TORAH (31:9–13) The text now shifts to a description of how Moses wrote down the Teaching and ensured its annual public reading.
<b><i>Moses wrote down this Teaching.</i></b> Here and in v. 24, we have explicit mention of Moses writing the Teaching (<i>torah</i>). Elsewhere in Deuteronomy, the written <i>torah</i> is discussed without attributing its writing to Moses (see 17:18; 27:8). Thus the later tradition that Moses wrote the entire Torah may begin with this parashah.
In certain passages in Exodus, the word <i>torah</i> refers to divine precepts authoritative for the community (for instance, see <i>torat YHVH</i> in Exodus 13:9). In Leviticus and Numbers, the term typically refers to priestly instructions, either oral or written on separate scrolls that priests keep to themselves; in such cases, the word often is translated as “ritual” (see at Leviticus 6:2). In Deuteronomy, <i>torah</i> generally refers to “this Teaching,” meaning the book of Deuteronomy or perhaps its legal parts (see at 1:5; 17:18; 27:3); it designates a written text that becomes central to Israel’s life as a community, for it contains God’s rules for all of Israel. As many scholars note, Deuteronomy lays the foundation for Judaism’s becoming a religion of the book.
Later biblical books speak of the <i>torah</i> of Moses (for instance, Joshua 8:31; 23:6; I Kings 2:3; II Kings 14:6; 23:25; Ezra 7:6; Nehemiah 8:1). These references to the Teaching of Moses appear in times of instability or crisis, including a transition in rule, a moment of religious or political reform, or the return of the exiles from Babylon. Thus the Teaching <i>(torah)</i> of Moses provides guidance and an anchor for Israel.
No such explicit association exists between a woman and a work of the Hebrew Bible. One possible comparison is Song of Songs. Although attributed to Solomon, this biblical book reproduces the voice of a woman as its chief speaker or singer. In addition, the book of Ruth could have been written by a woman, given the central relationship of the daughter-in-law to her mother-in-law and the dominance of female economic concerns.
<i><b>and gave it to the priests, sons of Levi.</b></i> According to Deuteronomy, levitical priests are in charge of teaching the <i>torah</i> to the people.

Verse 10

<b><i>at the Feast of Booths.</i></b> Jeffrey Tigay suggests a practical reason for reading the Teaching at this time. Since Sukkot marks the end of the agricultural cycle, the people have some leisure and, depending on the harvest’s success, a sense of security and gratitude. As a consequence, Sukkot in Jerusalem would have been the best-attended of the festivals, giving the Jerusalem priests both a large audience and ample time to read the Teaching publicly. He estimates that all of Deuteronomy could be read in three or four hours (<i>Deuteronomy</i>, 1996, pp. 291–92). Note the specific mention of women in 16:13–14 among those instructed to celebrate Sukkot.

Verse 11

<b><i>in the place that [God] will choose.</i></b> Deuteronomy is a book of religious vision and reform. An unnamed central site (presumably the Temple in Jerusalem) is to replace the many high places and cultic sites found in Judah at that time (see at 12:2–14). The public reading of the scroll would reinforce the centrality of the Temple in Jerusalem as God’s Chosen Place.
<i><b>read this Teaching aloud.</b></i> The <i>torah</i> is preserved and written down, but it is read aloud to the many who either do not have a copy or would not be able to read it. In narratives about the later periods in Israel’s history, such a public reading is said to have occurred during the period of intense religious reform under Josiah (II Kings 23) and after the return from exile, when Ezra reads the Torah aloud (Nehemiah 8). Nehemiah 8:2 emphasizes that the audience is composed of “men and women and all who could listen with understanding” (also v. 3).

Verse 12

<b><i>men, women, children, and the strangers.</i></b> The list suggests as inclusive a group as possible; knowledge of God’s teachings is open to everyone and expected of everyone.

Verse 13



Verse 14

<i>God Rebukes Israel</i> (31:14–23)
In comparison to the foreboding message we are about to read, Deuteronomy 30 (in the prior parashah) exhibited a more compassionate tone and a more forgiving God. The contrast suggests the purposeful preservation of two different traditions concerning Moses’ last speeches, the first offering a vision of God in harmony with Israel and the second presenting a warning of estrangement and disaster caused by the people’s behavior.
MOSES AND JOSHUA MEET GOD IN THE TENT OF MEETING (31:14–15)
God repeats what Moses announced to the people in v. 2, the fact of his impending death. In preparation for the change of leadership, God summons Moses and Joshua to the Tent of Meeting.
<b><i>Tent of Meeting.</i></b> Heb. <i>ohel mo’ed,</i> which refers to the tent located outside of the camp where God earlier appeared as a pillar of cloud in order to speak to Moses “face to face” and to Joshua as his attendant (see at Exodus 33:7–11). This is the same tent where God spoke directly to Miriam and to her brother Aaron (Numbers 12:4–9).
<i><b>that I may instruct him.</b></i> God now speaks directly to Joshua; Moses is not included.

Verse 15

<b><i>in a pillar of cloud.</i></b> God often appears to Moses, and at times to the people, behind a veil of some kind, shielding the observer from a direct view of God’s manifestation. (See also at Exodus 13:21.)

Verse 16

GOD WARNS OF ISRAEL’S FUTURE MISBEHAVIOR AND ITS CONSEQUENCES (31:16–21) God’s warning about the people’s misbehavior that will follow Moses’ death introduces an angry, melancholy note into the parashah. Just as earlier repentance and reconciliation are depicted as reciprocal (see at 30:1–10), so here are rebellion and rejection. The core message of this section is that since the people will abandon God, God will abandon the people (vv. 16–17; see at v. 6).
<b><i>go astray after.</i></b> Literally, “go whoring after.” Here and in several prophetic books (see Hosea 2; Jeremiah 3:1; Ezekiel 16, 23), prostitution is used as a metaphor for adultery and apostasy. The betrayal involved in adultery forms the basis of an analogy to vividly express God’s sense of betrayal when Israel worships other gods. This comparison fits with the broader conception of the relationship between God and Israel as a marriage, a metaphor that conveys both the love that binds the metaphoric husband and wife, as well as God’s deep disappointment when Israel turns to “alien gods” (see also at 5:9).
<i><b>alien gods.</b></i> This expression refers to Canaanite gods. Yet in v. 3, Moses announces that God will destroy the nations (and presumably their idols) once they cross into the land of Canaan. This contradiction anticipates the tension found in the books of Joshua and Judges between the claim to have wiped out the local inhabitants and the fact that Israel repeatedly interacts with those already in the land. The contradiction seems to suggest that a widespread destruction of other peoples did not in fact occur (see also at 2:34; 7:1–5; 7:24; 12:29–31). Rather, Israel came into being in the midst of other cultures and widely and creatively adapted some of their practices and ideas into Israelite religious life.

Verse 17

<b><i>hide My countenance from them.</i></b> Here and in v. 18, this common biblical image (see, for instance, Isaiah 54:8; Psalm 30:8) depicts the remoteness of God’s presence (literally “face”). The expression here suggests profound divine alienation from the people.
<i><b>“Surely it is because our God is not in our midst.”</b></i> The people will blame their troubles on God’s absence, equated here with the denial of divine protection and sustenance.

Verse 18



Verse 19

<b><i>Therefore, write down this poem.</i></b> God’s response to Moses’ impending absence is to demand a written text. Some interpreters understand the poem to serve as an accusation against the people in the generations to come, preventing them from misconstruing the past. In other words, the poem will testify to the fact that God abandoned them for just cause (Jeffrey Tigay, <i>Deuteronomy,</i> 1996, p. 295). Others have reinterpreted this verse to understand the poem not as a witness <i>against</i> Israel, but as a witness <i>on behalf of</i> Israel, reminding God “not to judge the people Israel harshly in the future, for God was aware of their nature (v. 27) and chose them nonetheless” (attributed to Rabbi Meir “Malbim” in David Lieber, ed., <i>Etz Hayim,</i> 2001, p. 1177).

Verse 20

<b><i>20–21.</i></b> These verses reiterate God’s charge in vv. 16–19, but with an added accusation against Israel. After God fulfills the promise made to the ancestors—to settle their descendants in a land flowing with milk and honey—the people will partake of the land’s abundance; but they will fail to connect their prosperity to the God who brought them there.

Verse 21

<b><i>it will never be lost from the mouth of their offspring.</i></b> God now refers to the descendants who presumably will memorize the poem or talk about it.

Verse 22

MOSES WRITES DOWN AND TEACHES THE POEM (31:22) This parashah centers on the writing and recitation of two texts: the Teaching (<i>torah</i>) (see at v. 9) and the poem (<i>shirah</i>), the text of which follows in Deuteronomy 32.

Verse 23

GOD ENCOURAGES JOSHUA: “BE STRONG AND RESOLUTE” (31:23) Completing the preparations for the transition in leadership, God appoints Joshua, echoing the words Moses uttered in vv. 6–8.

Verse 24

<i>Moses Completes the Teaching (torah) and Recites the Poem</i> (31:24–30)
Deuteronomy vacillates between the visionary rhetoric of promise-and-fulfillment and of its opposite, reproach-and-despair. So, too, does Moses. After his death, the people will remember him through his words and the written text.
MOSES INSTRUCTS THE LEVITES TO PLACE THE TEACHING IN THE ARK (31:24–27)
In v. 19, God instructs Moses to write down the poem, a task completed in v. 22. Now the focus reverts to the writing of the Teaching <i>(torah).</i> Verses 24–25 appear to be a resumption and repetition of v. 9, which describes how Moses finished writing the <i>torah</i> and gave it to the Levites. This section mentions only the Teaching—not the poem—which strongly suggests that vv. 16–22 (God’s angry speech and the anticipation of the poem as a witness against Israel) were inserted into the account of Moses’ completion of the writing of the Teaching. What links the two episodes is the importance and use of the written text. What separates them are their respective tones: optimistically hopeful versus starkly pessimistic.

Verse 25



Verse 26

<b><i>Take this book of Teaching and place it beside the Ark of the Covenant.</i></b> In contrast to the priestly description of the magnificent ark overlaid with gold found in Exodus and Leviticus (see at Exodus 25:10–22), Deuteronomy 31 values something else: an ark next to which is placed the written Teaching. Ancient Near Eastern political treaties were stored in containers and deposited in temples (see also at 10:5).
<i><b>let it remain there as a witness against you.</b></i> This clause forms another linkage between the two disparate passages of Deuteronomy 31. Just as the poem serves as a witness, so too does the Teaching.

Verse 27

<b><i>Well I know how defiant and stiffnecked you are…you have been defiant.</i></b> Moses now joins his wrathful voice to God’s, seemingly on the point of despair. Could the repeated use of the verbal root <i>m-r-h</i> (“defiant”) allude to the scene in Numbers 20:10 when a frustrated Moses calls the people by the same term after Miriam’s death and just before his own punishment?

Verse 28

MOSES RECITES THE POEM AS A WARNING (31:28–30) The last verses of the parashah appear to return to the subject of the poem (Deuteronomy 32), not the Teaching. In v. 28, Moses gathers together the elders of the tribes and the officials; but v. 30 stresses that all of Israel must hear the words of the poem. While the writing down of texts is central to this parashah, it begins and ends with Moses speaking. Only after his death will the written word speak on his behalf.

Chapter 32



Verse 1

<i>The Song of Moses</i>
SHIRAT HAAZINU (32:1–43)
S<i>hirat Haazinu</i> exhibits the defining features of biblical poetry, such as poetic parallelism, terseness, elevated diction, and various forms of repetition and patterning. Biblical poetry typically contains two, sometimes three, lines (called a “bicolon” or “tricolon” in the singular, and “bicola” and “tricola” in the plural) that relate to one another in a variety of ways. Parallel lines often appear to mirror one another, with one colon seeming to echo the general sentiment of the other, as in v. 2: “Like showers on young growth, / Like droplets on the grass.”
In other cases, while the lines as a whole may seem to be fairly synonymous, the individual word pairs within the parallel lines differ grammatically or semantically. For example, the two cola in v. 1 seem to be rather equivalent in terms of their overall meaning: “Give ear, O heavens, let me speak; / Let the earth hear the words I utter.” However, “heaven” and “earth” represent two distinct and complementary entities asked to listen the poet’s words. Plus, the end of the lines display a marked grammatical variance, for “let me speak” is a verbal phrase, whereas “the words I utter” (literally “the sayings of my mouth”) is a nominal (noun) phrase.
Elsewhere, the lines may not echo one another with any degree of grammatical or semantic equivalence or variation, but together may express a continuous idea, as in v. 8: “[God] fixed the boundaries of peoples / In relation to Israel’s numbers.” Being attentive to the dynamics of poetic parallelism can help the reader better understand this challenging text.
INTRODUCTORY INVOCATION (32:1–13)
Previously in Deuteronomy, Moses summoned heaven and earth as witnesses to the terms of the covenant (4:26; 30:19; 31:28), similar to the convention found in ancient Near Eastern political treaties. Here, the poet invites heaven and earth to listen to the words that follow. These two terms form a merism, which is an expression that uses two extremes to indicate a totality (see also at Exodus 10:9 and 11:5). By invoking these two contrasting realms, the poet may also seek to call upon everything in between them, namely, the entire world. Four similes in v. 2 compare Moses’ words to water. Just as water is essential for sustaining life, so Moses hopes that the recitation of this message will enable Israel to “long endure on the land” that they prepare to enter (32:47).

The first part of this section (vv. 4–6) establishes a stark contrast between God and Israel: God is “upright” (v. 4), but Israel is “crooked” (v. 5); God’s deeds are “perfect” (v. 4), but Israel is “blemished” (rendered here as “unworthy,” v. 5); God is Israel’s “Father” (v. 6), but Israel is God’s “nonchildren” (see at v. 5 below). The second part of the section (vv. 7–14) utilizes various metaphors to recount the beneficent acts God performed on Israel’s behalf.
<b><i>The Rock!</i></b> The word “rock” <i>(tzur)</i> stands out as a key word in the Song, recurring eight times: once to designate a literal stone (v. 13), twice as an ironic reference to foreign gods (vv. 31, 37), and five times to depict the God of Israel (vv. 4, 15, 18, 30, 31).
The Bible portrays God metaphorically more than thirty times using the term <i>tzur,</i> which in such contexts conveys the image of a large rock formation or mountain. In the Psalms, <i>tzur</i> appears frequently as a divine name or epithet, as when a psalmist cries out to “my rock and my redeemer” (Psalm 19:15) or praises “my strength…my fortress, my rescuer, my God, my rock in whom I seek refuge” (Psalm 18:23). In the present verse, however, “the Rock” appears in conjunction with other words that highlight God’s steadfast loyalty and righteousness.

Verse 5

 Various proposals have been suggested for reconstructing this obscure verse, which literally reads: “He has dealt corruptly with him not his children their blemish.” (For proposed solutions, see Jeffrey Tigay, <i>Deuteronomy,</i> 1996, p. 301.) The language in this verse reviles Israel by describing the people as having the opposite qualities as their God.
<i><b>children.</b></i> The reference to Israel as God’s children anticipates the subsequent metaphors of God as Father (see below at v. 6) and Mother (see at vv. 13, 18). Elsewhere in the Song, the people are envisioned as young eagles (v. 11), unruly animals (v. 15), and servants (v. 43).

Verse 6

<b><i>Father.</i></b> Far fewer biblical passages (about twelve) refer to God as a father <i>(av)</i> than speak of God metaphorically as a rock (see at v. 4). Here the paternal analogy focuses on God’s role as creator (see also Malachi 2:10). Other passages speak of God as a father in order to portray God’s love and compassion (Psalm 103:13; Isaiah 63:16) or God’s disciplinary role (Proverbs 3:12). Elsewhere, the metaphor highlights the special bond between God and Israel, a relationship that brings with it often unmet expectations (see Jeremiah 3:4, 19; 31:9).
A number of texts speak of Israel metaphorically as God’s child without identifying the gender of the parent (see Exodus 4:22; Deuteronomy 1:31; Isaiah 1:2; Jeremiah 31:20; Hosea 11:1–4). Tikva Frymer-Kensky observes that in contrast to metaphors of God as shepherd, king, or master that “emphasize the great gulf in power and wisdom between humans and [the] divine,” the metaphor of God as parent in such passages “emphasizes the emotional aspect of the commitment between the partners.” She notes that metaphors of God as both father and mother (see at vv. 13, 18) express God’s “dependable love” and compassion, as well as the way God nurtures, teaches, punishes, and redeems Israel. Reflecting on how the parental analogy functions in the Song, Frymer-Kensky writes: “It offers hope for the people of Israel in the time of their greatest suffering, for it carries with it a sense of anticipatory forgiveness and the end of suffering, the promises of an eternal bond that remains unbroken even through difficult times” <i>(In the Wake of the Goddesses,</i> 1992, pp. 162–63).
<i><b>created you.</b></i> This verb (from the root <i>k-n-h)</i> introduces a string of three verbs used to describe the way the divine Father begot Israel. Elsewhere, this verb is associated with the mother’s reproductive capacity. After Eve gives birth to Cain (<i>kayin</i>), she explains the significance of his name: “Both I and יהוה have made (<i>kaniti</i>) a man” (Genesis 4:1). In Psalm 139:13, the speaker describes being created (<i>kanita</i>) by God “in my mother’s womb.”

Verse 7

<b><i>your parent.</i></b> Heb. <i>av</i> is used literally here, referring to biological parents, but figuratively in v. 6.

Verse 8

<b><i>8–9.</i></b> Tracing the relationship between God and Israel back to the “days of old,” the poem refers to when God separated the human races into distinct nations (Genesis 10, 11:1–9) and selected Israel as God’s “treasured people” (Deuteronomy 7:6).
<b><i>In relation to Israel’s numbers.</i></b> As it stands, this verse implies that God divided all of humanity into a certain number of nations according to the number of Israelites. Many interpreters assume this means that God established 70 nations (Genesis 10) to match Jacob’s 70 offspring (Exodus 1:5). However, variant readings preserved in the Qumran (Dead Sea) Scrolls and the ancient Jewish translation into Greek (Septuagint) suggest that this phrase originally read: “in relation to the number of divine beings” (<i>b’nei elim</i> instead of <i>b’nei Yisrael).</i> In that case, the verse asserts that God allotted lesser deities (such as those mentioned in Psalm 82) to the other nations to worship but set aside Israel as God’s own people. As in Deuteronomy 4:19–20, such a reading would reflect a notion called monolatry, which refers to the allegiance to one God without denying the existence of other deities. Scholars assume that later scribes “corrected” the text (see also at v. 43) so that these words would conform to what became the monotheist standard: “I, I am the One; / There is no god beside Me” (v. 39).

Verse 9



Verse 10

<b><i>[God] found them.</i></b> By using this verb, the poet hints at several possible metaphors for the people Israel. What did God find in the wilderness? Hosea 9:10 employs the same verb when God reminisces: “Like grapes, in the wilderness I found Israel; like the first fig to ripen on a fig tree, I saw your ancestors.” Ezekiel imagines God finding something different when he narrates how God discovered Israel as an abandoned baby girl. According to Ezekiel 16:3–6, Israel was rejected on the day of her birth and left to die in an open field. God passed by, saw Israel wallowing in her blood, and resolved to save the baby girl: “In your blood, live!” Thus, perhaps the language in this passage evokes images of Israel as an abandoned girl or succulent fruit.
<i><b>desert region.</b></i> As in this verse, several prophetic passages look back nostalgically at the journey through the wilderness following the exodus from Egypt. For example, Jeremiah speaks of the time when Israel followed God in the wilderness with the devotion of a young bride (Jeremiah 2:2–3; see also 31:2–3; Hosea 2:16–17). Such depictions differ drastically from the way other parts of the Torah depict this time period (compare, for instance, 9:7 or Numbers 16–17).
<i><b>as the pupil of God’s eye.</b></i> This simile aims to illustrate how God guarded Israel in the wilderness like the blinking of the eyelid protects the vulnerable pupil. (Other translations employ an English idiom to render this expression as “the apple of His eye,” but the Hebrew text does not literally mention an apple.) Psalm 17:8 pairs this simile with an image of protection found in the following verse of the Song: “Guard me like the pupil of your eye; hide me in the shadow of Your wings.”

Verse 11

<b><i>Like an eagle who rouses its nestlings.</i></b> Many interpreters explain that this simile compares the way God cared for Israel in the wilderness to the way eagles train their young to fly. They assume the verb translated here as “rouse” implies that the mother or father eagle pushes the baby bird out of the nest and then hovers near by as the young bird tries to fly, ready to catch it should the need arise. Some scholars have questioned this interpretation, pointing out that observations by ornithologists do not confirm this type of behavior and that the verb in question might mean “protects.” In that case, the simile would supplement the depiction of God’s watchful care in the prior verse.
<i><b>spread wings.</b></i> Similarly, Exodus 19:4 envisions God carrying Israel “on eagles’ wings” (compare 1:31, which speaks of God carrying Israel through the wilderness as a parent). Several psalms speak of “the shadow of God’s wing” as a place of protection (see Psalms 17:8; 36:8; 57:2). Boaz blesses Ruth with the acknowledgment that she has sought to come under God’s sheltering wings (Ruth 2:12).

Verse 12



Verse 13

<b><i>set them.</i></b> Or “caused them to ride,” which would continue the eagle imagery of v. 11.
<i><b>To feast.</b></i> The poet introduces a new metaphor to enhance the argument that God showered Israel with the utmost kindness and generosity, which makes Israel’s subsequent defiance all the more astonishing. Carol Meyers argues that the general notion of God providing Israel with food likewise involves female divine imagery, for women prepared most of the food in ancient Israel (see the introduction to Exodus 15:22–17:16).
<i><b>Nursing them.</b></i> In applying to God the Hebrew verb <i>y-n-k</i> (which can be also translated as “suckling”), the poet adds an analogy to a mother with her newborn baby, an unmistakable maternal image. Thus, in describing how God nourished and sustained Israel, the poet juxtaposes the earlier image of God as father (v. 6) with a metaphor of God as mother. Although such specific female imagery for God is not common in the Bible, we do find other examples in which maternal metaphors depict God’s love, devotion, and care for the people to whom God gave birth. For example, in Isaiah 49:15, best translated as “Can a woman forget her nursing child, or show no compassion for the child of her womb?” the prophet’s rhetorical question reassures the people that God has not forgotten them (see also Isaiah 46:3–4 and at Numbers 11:12).
As Jeffrey Tigay observes, the verb <i>y-n-k</i> in this verse implies that “God fed Israel with virtually no effort on its part” by producing abundant food from unexpected sources: “honeycombs, found in the land’s countless caves and fissures, and oil-producing olive trees that flourish in its rocky lime-stone soils” (<i>Deuteronomy</i>, 1996, p. 305). Whereas other texts tell about God providing water from rocks (Exodus 17:6; Numbers 20:8–11), here the provisions are more lavish, thus emphasizing how God, like a mother, lovingly indulged Israel.

Verse 14

<b><i>Curd…milk.</i></b> The foods listed in this verse represent the type of generous hospitality one would offer a special guest, as Sarah and Abraham do in Genesis 18:6–8. Jael uses these two dairy products to lure the enemy king Sisera to sleep before she kills him (Judges 5:25).

Verse 15

ACCUSATION OF INSUBORDINATION AND IDOLATRY (32:15–18) The tone of the poem changes sharply as God’s graciousness gives way to Israel’s ingratitude and worship of foreign deities.
<b><i>grew fat.</i></b> Four verbs in the first half of this verse emphasize how Israel became bloated and gorged in response to God’s sumptuous provisions. Moses repeatedly expresses the concern that once the people have settled in the land and “eaten their fill,” they foolishly will attribute their success to their own actions and not acknowledge God’s role in their success, which then will led them to forsake God and turn to other deities (6:10–13; 8:11–18; 11:15–16; 31:20). This sequence of events unfolds in the verses that follow.
<i><b>kicked.</b></i> This verb seems to introduce a new metaphor for Israel, who is envisioned as a fat, willful animal.
<i><b>who made them.</b></i> See at v. 18.
<i><b>Rock of their support.</b></i> This phrase invokes the more familiar characteristics associated with the rock analogy, namely, security and salvation (see at v. 4). However, the poet uses the metaphor ironically: the people have rejected God and sought support from alien gods.

Verse 16

<b><i>incensed…Vexed</i></b> See at v. 21.

Verse 17

<b><i>demons.</i></b> Heb. <i>sheidim,</i> referring to protective spirits. Similar language appears in Psalm 106:37, which tells how the Israelites adopted the ways of their Canaanite neighbors and “sacrificed their sons and their daughters to the demons.”

Verse 18

<b><i>the Rock.</i></b> See at vv. 4, 15. This time, the metaphor calls attention to God as Israel’s creator.
<i><b>begot you.</b></i> Heb. <i>y’lad’cha.</i> This verb can signal a comparison between God and either a mother or father (as in Proverbs 23:22). However, nearly ten times as often, this root describes the mother’s role in giving birth (as when Leah, Rachel, and their handmaids Bilhah and Zilpah give birth in Genesis 29–30). Given the ambiguity of the biological sex referred to by this verb, one also could translate this verb with a more gender-neutral locution like “gave birth to you.” <i><b>labored to bring you forth.</b></i> Whereas the previous verb in this verse (“begot”) can be used with men or, more often, with women, the parallel verb (from the root <i>h-y-l)</i> specifically applies to women. Unambiguously, the poet casts God in the role of the Mother who labored to give birth to Israel. The identical verb appears in Isaiah 51:2 when the prophet charges the people: “Look back to Abraham your father, and to Sarah who labored to bring you forth <i>(h-y-l).”</i> (This is the only reference to Sarah outside of Genesis.) Several biblical passages use this root when they compare the trembling of people facing some desperate, dire situation to the writhing of a woman in labor (Isaiah 13:8; Jeremiah 4:31; 6:24; 22:23; Micah 4:9–10; Psalm 48:7; see also Jeremiah 30:6; 49:24). Isaiah 42:14, best translated as “Like a woman in labor I will scream, I will pant and I will gasp,” dramatically transforms this simile when using it to describe the powerful way that God will bring about redemption. Reflecting on how this verb functions in <i>Shirat Haazinu</i>, Bernard Levinson observes: “That God had to suffer labor pains to bear Israel only increases the injustice of Israel’s forgetting the divine parent.” He adds that the maternal metaphors for God “provide an important alternative to the normal masculine imagery associated with God” (“Deuteronomy,” <i>Jewish Study Bible,</i> 2004, p. 442).

Verse 19

PUNISHMENT PROPOSED (32:19–25) After indicting the Israelites with forsaking their God and worshipping beings whose divinity is denied, God announces the consequences: decimation of the population, famine, and other deadly scourges. The One whose “ways are just” (v. 4) ensures that the punishment fits the crime (see at v. 21).
<b><i>sons and daughters.</i></b> Several prior passages in Deuteronomy recognize the possibility that either women or men might lure the people to worship what the Bible presents as foreign gods (17:2; 29:17); others emphasize the role of women in such acts (7:3–4; see also Numbers 25:1–18 and Jeremiah 7:18).

Verse 20

<b><i>hide My countenance.</i></b> See at 31:17.
<i><b>Children.</b></i> See at v. 5.

Verse 21

<b><i>incensed…Vexed</i></b> The repetition of these two verbs in both halves of the verse emphasizes that God intends to respond to Israel’s apostasy with measure-for-measure punishment. (See at 5:9 for how the verb translated here as “incensed” relates to the metaphor of God as a jealous husband and Israel as an adulterous wife.)
<i><b>no-gods…no-folk.</b></i> Expressions with the word “no” recur throughout the poem (see at vv. 6, 17, 20); the linguistic repetition emphasizes the link between Israel’s actions and God’s reaction.

Verse 22

<b><i>Sheol.</i></b> This is the netherworld to which all the dead are believed to descend (see also at Genesis 42:38; I Samuel 2:6).

Verse 23

<b><i>My arrows.</i></b> Mention of weapons here and in vv. 25, 41–42 evokes the metaphor of God as a (male) warrior. This image figures prominently in the Song at the Sea, the victory song that the Israelites recite after fleeing from Egypt (Exodus 15). Carol Meyers emphasizes that depicting God in masculine imagery “does not mean that the Torah’s composer(s) believed God to be a male being” (see at Exodus 14:14; 15:3); this observation also applies to the female divine imagery prominent in <i>Shirat Haazinu.</i> (For more on the warrior metaphor, see Another View.)

Verse 24



Verse 25

 The poet employs a double merism (see at vv. 1–3), setting up an opposition between female and male, and young and old, to indicate that no one will escape God’s punishing wrath. Commenting on the mention of women and men here and in v. 19, Marc Brettler writes: “The poem thus explicitly includes women within its intended audience; this fits the gender-inclusive tendency present elsewhere in Deuteronomy (for example, 31:12)” <i>(Women in Scripture,</i> 2000, p. 236).

Verse 26

PUNISHMENT RECONSIDERED (32:26–42) Having asserted that God would be justified in penalizing the people for their transgressions, the Song now takes an unexpected turn. Expressing concern that the foreign nations whom God wielded to punish Israel will attribute their victory to their own power, not to God’s might, God resolves to defeat the enemies and deliver Israel.

Verse 27



Verse 28



Verse 29



Verse 30

<b><i>thousand…ten thousand.</i></b> This word pair illustrates the type of intensification often involved in poetic parallelism, with the second line heightening the language of the first. For example, much to King Saul’s chagrin, the women who come out singing and dancing to greet the victorious troops utter this same word pair, but they associate the higher number with the man who will soon become Saul’s rival: “Saul has slain his thousands; David, his tens of thousands!” (I Samuel 18:7).

Verse 31

<b><i>their rock…our Rock.</i></b> Here and in v. 37, the poet returns to the rock metaphor, but this time as a way to ridicule those who rely on false deities. The so-called gods of the foreign nations do not exhibit the strength nor provide the refuge typically associated with the rock metaphor (see at v. 4). The meaning of the second half of the verse is uncertain.

Verse 32

<b><i>32–33.</i></b> Whereas God nursed Israel on fine wine (v. 14), her enemies will drink poisonous wine and thus die like the people of Sodom and Gomorrah.

Verse 33



Verse 34



Verse 35



Verse 36



Verse 37



Verse 38



Verse 39

<b><i>no god beside Me.</i></b> See at 4:35.
<i><b>deal death and give life.</b></i> This verse encapsulates the seemingly contrasting facets of God’s nature, a point communicated by the Song’s diverse imagery. (See further, Another View.)
<i><b>wounded and…heal.</b></i> Carol Meyers asserts that the depiction of God as healer may compare God to women as well as men, for both practiced folk medicine in ancient Israel (see at Exodus 15:26).

Verse 40



Verse 41

<b><i>41–42.</i></b> On the warrior imagery in these verses, see at v. 23.

Verse 42



Verse 43

CONCLUDING INVOCATION (32:43) As it stands now, the Song ends by calling upon the foreign nations, those whose bloody demise has just been foretold, to praise Israel. Given various problems with the logic and structure of the current text, as well as alternative readings preserved in the Qumran (Dead Sea) Scrolls and the ancient Jewish translation into Greek (Septuagint), many scholars have concluded that the original version of this verse was markedly different. The first colon likely summoned the heavens, not the nations, to rejoice with God, which would mirror the poem’s introduction (v. 1). The current reference to God’s servants likely spoke of God’s children, which would recall v. 5 and the depictions of God as Father and Mother. More significantly, the first colon likely contained a parallel line that read: “Bow to [God] all divinities” (<i>elohim</i>), which would resemble the reconstructed reading of “divine beings” in v. 8. Later scribes then removed this line so that it would not conflict with what became the monotheistic norm. (For further details, see Jeffrey Tigay, <i>Deuteronomy,</i> 1996, pp. 516–18; see also at v. 8 and 6:4.)

Verse 44

<i>Final Instructions</i> (32:44–52)
The prior parashah (<i>Vayeilech</i>) concerned the writing and teaching of both the <i>torah</i> (the “Teaching,” meaning most of Deuteronomy) and the <i>shirah</i> (the poem in 32:1–43), as well as the transfer of leadership in light of Moses’ imminent death. This prose unit touches upon these same topics.
MOSES’ CHARGE TO THE PEOPLE (32:44–47)
This section contains two parts. The first (v. 44) reiterates that Moses indeed taught the Song to the people, as God had instructed (31:19) and as reported earlier (31:22). The second (vv. 45–47) implores Israel to diligently follow the <i>torah</i> (see at 31:9), for their very existence in the land that they prepare to enter is said to hinge on their adherence to the laws and precepts preserved in the book of Deuteronomy.
<b><i>Hosea.</i></b> A variant of the name Joshua; see Numbers 13:8, 16.
<i><b>the people.</b></i> This verse and 31:30 form a prose frame around the poem.

Verse 45



Verse 46



Verse 47



Verse 48

GOD’S INSTRUCTIONS ABOUT MOSES’ IMMINENT DEATH (32:48–52) According to 3:23–28, Moses had unsuccessfully pleaded with God to allow him to enter the Promised Land. As a concession, God instructed him to climb to the summit of Pisgah and survey the territory across the Jordan. This passage repeats those general instructions, but here God commands Moses to ascend “these heights of Abarim to Mount Nebo.” Shortly, 34:1 will harmonize these two traditions by stating that Moses went up “to Mount Nebo, to the summit of Pisgah.”

Verse 49



Verse 50

<b><i>You shall die…and shall be gathered to your kin.</i></b> These two verbs are imperatives, as in the prior verse (literally, “Die…and be gathered”).
<i><b>as your brother Aaron.</b></i> This passage makes no mention of Miriam, the sister whose death and burial are briefly recorded shortly before Aaron’s death (both in Numbers 20).

Verse 51

 Here God blames Moses’ (and Aaron’s) inability to lead the people into the Promised Land on the incident at Kadesh when Moses aggressively strikes the rock to make it produce water (Numbers 20:1–13). In contrast, prior passages in Deuteronomy assert that Moses was punished as a result of the incident of the scouts (see at 1:35; also 3:26; 4:21). These inconsistencies probably reflect a merging of sources and a desire to preserve multiple perspectives on this most poignant moment.

Verse 52

 With the very last words in the parashah, God offers Moses the small comfort of seeing the destination of his life’s work from afar, while also reminding him that he will not be able to savor its rewards.
<i>—Andrea L. Weiss</i>  

Chapter 33



Verse 1

<i>The Blessing of Moses</i> (33:1–29)
Moses delivers his final words to the entire assembly of Israel—men, women, and children, everyone from the leaders of the tribes to those who chop wood and draw water (29:9–10)—just before the “Source of the breath of all flesh” (Numbers 27:16) takes his life. Like Jacob, who blessed his sons while he lay on his deathbed (Genesis 49), Moses blesses the tribes of Israel. But, whereas Jacob’s words are often disparaging, Moses’ message is decidedly positive: he looks ahead to a time when the tribes will enjoy prosperity and security. Here, the criticism voiced in Deuteronomy 32 gives way to assurances and praise.
Many scholars maintain that the Blessing of Moses, like the Song of Moses that precedes it (in <i>parashat Haazinu),</i> was originally a separate composition that later was inserted into the concluding section of the book. A number of words and even complete verses continue to baffle scholars, and opinions vary about the likely dating of this text. Some assert that the verses before and after the tribal blessings (vv. 2–5 and 26–29) at one time constituted a separate hymn or might have been written as a framework for the preexisting blessings. Although vv. 2–29 are not laid out in poetic form in Torah scrolls, they exhibit the typical features of biblical poetry (see the introduction to 32:1–43).
PROSE INTRODUCTION (33:1)
This verse labels the poetic composition that follows as a “blessing.” While it has the overall appearance of a father’s last words to his offspring (as in Genesis 27:28–29, 39–40; 49:2–27), parts of the text display affinities to other genres, such as the hymn known as the Song of Deborah (Judges 5), and Balaam’s blessings of Israel (Numbers 23–24).
<i><b>God’s envoy.</b></i> Heb. <i>ish ha-elohim,</i> often translated as “man of God.” Although this is the only time that this phrase appears in the Torah, it occurs frequently in the rest of the Bible to designate Moses, certain other prophets, and King David. (For instance, see how the widow uses the expression to refer to Elijah in I Kings 17:18, 24 and the Shunammite woman as a label for Elisha in II Kings 4:9, 16). The present translation takes <i>ish</i> as referring here to the role of representing another party on a mission (as in, for example, Genesis 24:21; Leviticus 16:21; Numbers 13:2; 22:9; Deuteronomy 1:22); in that sense, the expression <i>ish ha-elohim</i> neatly encapsulates Moses’ forty-year career as God’s agent, which began at the Burning Bush (Exodus 3:10; see also at v. 16, below). (See David Stein, “What Does It Mean to Be a ‘Man’?” 2006–7, §§ 11. B.1; 111. B. 8.)
<b><i>bade…farewell.</i></b> Literally, “blessed.” See Genesis 27:10.

Verse 2

PROLOGUE: GOD AS WARRIOR AND KING (33:2–5) This section (particularly v. 3) has baffled interpreters, ancient and modem, with its many difficulties. Nevertheless, the general message is that God came from the south to aid Israel (as in Judges 5:4; Habakkuk 3:3) and subsequently was considered Israel’s king.
<b><i>Sinai.</i></b> This is the only time that this word appears in Deuteronomy; throughout the book, Horeb designates this mountain (see at Exodus 18:5).
<i><b>Lightning flashing at them.</b></i> Although the Hebrew here remains uncertain, the phrase seems to fit with the verse’s underlying image of God as a (male) warrior who comes to Israel’s salvation. (For more on the warrior metaphor, see at Exodus 14:14; 15:3; Deuteronomy 32:23; see also <i>Haazinu,</i> Another View.)

Verse 3



Verse 4

<b><i>Moses charged us.</i></b> Commentators have puzzled over the third-person reference to Moses in a text that he recites, as well as the relationship between this verse and its surrounding context. Some explain that God must have been the original subject; others view this as an acclamation of the people. Deuteronomy 31:12 emphasizes that the Levites are to teach the <i>torah</i> to all Israel—women and men, children and strangers.
<i><b>Teaching.</b></i> Heb. <i>torah;</i> see at 31:9.

Verse 5

<b><i>[God] became King.</i></b> Given the prominence of the image of God as king in Jewish liturgy, where most blessings contain the phrase <i>melech haolam</i> (“King of the universe”), it is surprising that the metaphor appears only three times in the Torah: here, Exodus 15:18, and Numbers 23:21. All three are poetic passages, which is where the king metaphor nearly always appears. It is found far more frequently elsewhere in the Bible (as in Isaiah 33:22; Psalm 24:7–10) and in ancient Near Eastern texts, where the notion of the divine king connotes not only power and authority, but also the execution of justice, compassion for the needy, and the maintenance of social order and prosperity (see Psalm 72).
Carol Meyers observes that the frequency and variety of andromorphic (male-shaped) images of God, such as divine king and warrior, “can produce the impression of God as exclusively male—the so-called patriarchal God of the Hebrew Bible.” She adds that since Hebrew is a gendered language and the words for God generally are masculine, this further contributes to the sense of a male deity (<i>Women in Scripture,</i> 2000, p. 526). Yet as she and other scholars explain, one must look more closely in order to get an accurate picture. The male images actually convey things about God other than gender (see at 10:17). Apart from such imagery and from the linguistic necessity of using masculine wording, the Torah is conspicuously silent about God’s gender, especially compared to ancient Near Eastern descriptions of other deities (see Tikva Frymer-Kensky, <i>In the Wake of the Goddesses,</i> 1992, pp. 83–99, 187–189). Meanwhile, female divine imagery, although less frequent, can in fact be found in the Bible (see at Exodus 15:22–17:16; 15:26; Numbers 11:12; Deuteronomy 32:13, 18). Biblical writers incorporated a range of female, male, and non-gendered metaphors for God as they attempted to articulate their understanding of who God is and how God operates in the world.
<b><i>Jeshurun.</i></b> See at v. 26.

Verse 6

BLESSING OF THE TRIBES (33:6–25) Although Moses and his wife Zipporah have two sons, Gershom (Exodus 2:22; 18:3) and Eliezer (Exodus 18:4), as he approaches his death, Moses blesses not his biological heirs but the tribes, one by one. Usually, the tribes are listed in the birth order of their eponymous ancestors, grouped according to their mothers (see at Genesis 46:8–27 and at 49:1–27). Here, however, Moses addresses the tribes in geographical order, starting with Reuben, in whose territory the Israelites stand, and then moving across the River Jordan from Judah in the south to Asher in the north. Nevertheless, a maternal arrangement can be discerned, a likely reflection of existing geopolitical patterns: three of Leah’s first four sons (Simeon is not mentioned; see at v. 7 below), followed by Rachel’s two sons, then Leah’s fifth and sixth sons, and then the four sons of the handmaids, Zilpah and Bilhah.
 The blessing for Reuben constitutes a plea that the tribe not perish. Situated in the Transjordan (see Numbers 32), this tribe was cut off geographically from most of the other tribes by the Jordan river and likely would have been vulnerable to attacks by neighbors to the east and south.

Verse 7

 The blessing for Judah calls upon God to rescue Judah from an unidentified enemy. The depiction of Judah’s being in a precarious situation contrasts sharply with the characterization of Judah in Genesis 49:8–12. There, he is compared to a ferocious lion and described as being in a position of power and wealth. Some scholars posit that this verse originally may have contained a blessing for Simeon.

Verse 8

<b><i>8–11.</i></b> The blessing for Levi emphasizes the tribe’s loyalty to God. As a reward, they have merited the privilege of serving as priests, teaching God’s precepts, and officiating at the sacrificial altar.
<b><i>Thummim and Urim.</i></b> These divinatory devices (usually listed in the reverse order) apparently consisted of some sort of lots kept in a pouch attached to the priest’s breastplate (see at Exodus 28:30).
<b><i>Massah…Meribah.</i></b> The mention of these two place names seems to refer to the incident in Exodus 17:1–7, but there the thirsty Israelites test God and the Levites play no role in the episode. However, the Torah records two other incidents in which the Levites display their faithfulness to God at the expense of their fellow Israelites. In Exodus 32:26–29, following the construction of the Golden Calf, the Levites rally to Moses’ call and kill 3,000 of their “kin.” In Numbers 25, the priest (hence also Levite) Phinehas zealously stabs the Simeonite chieftain and the Midianite woman who are engaging in illicit activities at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting.

Verse 9

<b><i>father and mother.</i></b> This verse refers to an episode in which the Levites disregarded family ties in executing God’s laws, possibly meaning the Golden Calf incident (Exodus 32:26–29). By implication, an Israelite man normally does—or at least should—consider the opinions of both his father and his mother. A number of biblical passage mention the mother alongside the father, most famously the command to honor one’s father and mother (for example, see at Exodus 20:12 and at Leviticus 19:3, where the order is “mother and father”). In particular, Deuteronomy 13:7 warns against being lured into idolatrous practices by female or male relatives.

Verse 10

<b><i>They shall offer You incense…And whole offerings.</i></b> While the priest officiates over the sacrificial system, those who bring the offerings—women and men alike—are to participate to some extent in the sacrificial ritual. (For details, see the Introduction to <i>parashat Vayikra</i>.)

Verse 11



Verse 12

 The blessing for Benjamin expresses a hope for security for this relatively small tribe. The last line is ambiguous; alternatively, it could mean that Benjamin is carried on God’s shoulders (see 1:31), or that God dwells amid Benjamin’s “slopes.”
<b><i>the bounty.</i></b> Heb. <i>meged.</i> This key word repeats five times in vv. 13–16 as Moses elaborates on the fecundity of the land. In her book <i>In the Wake of the Goddesses</i> (1992), Tikva Frymer-Kensky argues that “the biblical understanding of fertility is radically different from that of ancient Near Eastern polytheism” (p. 92). She explains that in ancient Near Eastern polytheism “agricultural fertility is thought to result from the collective activity of male and female deities acting in concert (or consort)” (p. 89); yet in the Bible, God alone is responsible for the fertility of the land. Frymer-Kensky claims that a remarkable aspect of the creation account in Genesis 1 is that God makes the earth fertile, with seed-bearing plants able to reproduce if given the proper conditions. She writes: “To the Bible, God’s fertility-bringing power lies in God’s power over the rain. The natural state of the earth is fertile: it needs only the rain to activate this natural potential” (pp. 92–93).
<i><b>the deep.</b></i> Heb. <i>t’hom,</i> a noun that hints at a mythological link between the subterranean waters and the Mesopotamian goddess Tiamat (see at Genesis 1:2 and 7:11).

Verse 13

<b><i>13–17.</i></b> Joseph receives the longest blessing, which covers the two tribes named after his sons, Ephraim and Manasseh. The blessing emphasizes the fertility of their territory and their prominence.

Verse 14



Verse 15



Verse 16

<b><i>Presence in the Bush.</i></b> Or “the One who Dwells in the Bush” <i>(shochni s’neh);</i> the later concept of God’s Presence as the <i>Shechinah</i> comes from the same root as <i>shochni</i> (see <i>T’rumah,</i> Post-biblical Interpretations). This unique epithet alludes to Moses’ first encounter with God at the Burning Bush (Exodus 3:1–6).

Verse 17

<b><i>firstling.</i></b> Although Joseph was Jacob’s eleventh son, not his first, he was Rachel’s long-awaited first-born. According to I Chronicles 5:1–2, Reuben lost his status as first-born because he “defiled his father’s bed” by sleeping with his father’s concubine, Bilhah (Genesis 35:22); as a result, Joseph received the birthright, even though Judah became the most prominent.
<b><i>bull…wild-ox.</i></b> These animals were common symbols of virility in the Bible and ancient Near Eastern texts.

Verse 18

<b><i>18–19.</i></b> This blessing speaks to the future fortune of both Zebulun and Issachar. It implies that the two tribes occupied the area from the Sea of Chinnereth (also called Lake Kinneret, or Sea of Galilee) as far as the Mediterranean, which allowed them to prosper due to their maritime ventures.

Verse 19

<b><i>they draw from the riches of the sea.</i></b> Literally, “they suckle,” from the same root (<i>y-n-k</i>) used in the description of God nursing Israel with honey and oil (see at 32:13).
<b><i>riches of the sea…hoards of the sand.</i></b> These phrases could refer to various goods, not only fish and shells, but also glass and murex snails—the treasured source of purple dye. (For more on the manufacture of dyed cloths and women’s roles in these activities, see at Exodus 35:4 and <i>T’rumah,</i> Another View.)

Verse 20

<b><i>20–21.</i></b> The blessing of Gad alludes to this tribe’s military might and their request to settle in the choice pastureland east of the Jordan (Numbers 32).

Verse 21



Verse 22

 The blessing of Dan uses a metaphor of a lion to depict their power and prowess (see also v. 20 and Genesis 49:9, where the image applies to Judah).
<i><b>leaps forth.</b></i> Heb. <i>y’zanek,</i> from the rare root <i>z-n-k.</i> Jeffrey Tigay notes that some scholars suggest emending this verb to <i>yonek</i> (<i>y-n-k</i>), “to suckle,” as in v. 19 (see also at 32:13). This would mean “that Dan is nourished effortlessly by the cattle and products of the fertile Bashan” (<i>Deuteronomy</i>, 1996, p. 411).

Verse 23

 The benevolent blessing of Naphtali reflects the tribe’s location in the lush upper Galilee.

Verse 24

<b><i>24–25.</i></b> The blessing for Asher revolves around the themes of agricultural fertility (see at v. 13) and security. The blessing seems fitting for the tribe’s namesake, whom Leah named to capture her joy at giving birth to another son, through her handmaid Zilpah (Genesis 30:13).
<b><i>May he dip his foot in oil.</i></b> This expression seems to reflect the abundance of olive trees in Asher’s territory, in the highlands of the Galilee.

Verse 25



Verse 26

EPILOGUE: GOD AS REFUGE AND WARRIOR (33:26–29) In this concluding section, Moses turns his attention from the individual tribes to the people as a whole. As he extols God as Israel’s source of security and prosperity, he makes it clear that the key blessings he hopes for the tribes—fertility of the land, military success, and tranquility—depend on God’s unparalleled beneficence and power. These are Moses’ last words in the Torah.
<b><i>Jeshurun.</i></b> This fairly uncommon name for Israel also appeared in v. 5, thus forming a frame around the tribal blessings.
<i><b>there is none like God.</b></i> A hallmark of Deuteronomy is its insistence on God’s unrivaled divinity. Certain passages express a clearly monotheistic perspective (see at 4:35); others herald God’s uniqueness while allowing for the existence of other, minor deities—a notion referred to as monolatry (see at 4:19–20; 32:8, 43).
<i><b>Riding through the heavens.</b></i> In the Bible, God frequently appears as a (male) warrior riding through the skies in order to rescue Israel from her enemies. Various passages depict God descending to earth on a chariot (such as Habakkuk 3:8), clouds (such as Psalm 104:3), or cherub (such as Psalm 18:11). The image is also found in other ancient Near Eastern texts, particularly Ugaritic poems describing the storm god Baal.

Verse 27

<b><i>arms everlasting.</i></b> This expression of God’s support for Israel seems to portray God embracing or carrying Israel. Similarly, Deuteronomy 1:31 compares God’s treatment of Israel in the wilderness to a parent carrying a child. Isaiah 40:11 promises that when God redeems the Babylonian exiles, God will be like a shepherd who gently gathers and carries the flock in his or her arms (for examples of female shepherds, see Genesis 29:9; Exodus 2:16). Isaiah 46:3–4 expresses a similar message using a maternal metaphor. God addresses the exiles—“who have been carried since birth, / Supported since leaving the womb”—and pledges to them: “Till you grow old, I will be the same; / When you turn gray, it is I who will carry; / I was the Maker, and I will be the Bearer; / And I will carry and rescue [you].” <i><b>drove out the enemy.</b></i> This looks ahead to the defeat of the Canaanites when Israel enters the Promised Land (see at 7:24).

Verse 28

<b><i>Under heavens dripping dew.</i></b> On the importance of rain or other forms of moisture for the fertility of the land, see at v. 13.

Verse 29

<b><i>Shield…Sword.</i></b> See at v. 2.
<i><b>you shall tread on their backs.</b></i> In the Bible and ancient Near Eastern documents, placing one’s foot on the enemy’s back or neck symbolizes victory (see Joshua 10:24).

Chapter 34



Verse 1

<i>The Death of Moses</i> (34:1–12)
The Torah preserves a number of narrative passages that record the deaths of select individuals: Sarah (Genesis 23:1–2), Abraham (Genesis 25:7–10), Ishmael (Genesis 25:17), Rebekah’s nurse Deborah (Genesis 35:8), Rachel (Genesis 35:18–20), Isaac (Genesis 35:28–29), Jacob (Genesis 49:29–33), Joseph (Genesis 50:22–26), Miriam (Numbers 20:1), Aaron (Numbers 20:24–29), and Moses. These death reports show certain common elements, not all of which are mentioned for every character. Typical features include the person’s age at the time of death, the location where the person died, the person’s physical condition, a pronouncement of the death, typically with formulaic, euphemistic language (for example, “Isaac then breathed his last and died; he was gathered to his people old and full of years,” Genesis 35:29), details about the burial, and a comment about the mourning that follows the death. Of all these reports, only Moses’ contains every one of these elements. The length of this unit and the way that it characterizes Moses testify to the unparalleled stature of the leader who shepherded the Israelites from the house of bondage to the gateway to the Promised Land.
SURVEY OF THE PROMISED LAND (34:1–4)
In 3:25, Moses recounted how he pleaded with God to reconsider his sentence: “Let me, I pray, cross over and see the good land on the other side of the Jordan.” Although God rejected the first part of Moses’ entreaty, God conceded to the second part and agreed to let Moses view the land someday from a mountaintop in Moab (3:27). Finally, that day has arrived.
Having spoken his last words, Moses now performs his two last acts: ascending Mount Nebo, and surveying the land. He first gazes northward along the eastern side of the Jordan and then north to south on the western side, all the way from Dan to the Negeb. It would not be humanly possible to see such a vast expanse of land from Moses’ vantage point, but such a claim seems only fitting given the extraordinary nature of Moses’ death and burial.
<b><i>Moses went up.</i></b> Two earlier verses record God’s command to Moses to ascend a mountain to view the land (Numbers 27:12; Deuteronomy 32:49). In both cases, God reminds Moses that his inability to enter the land comes as a consequence of the incident at the waters of Meribath-kadesh when Moses “disobeyed” and “broke faith with” God (Numbers 27:14; Deuteronomy 32:51; contrast the explanation given in 1:37). Here, as is fitting for the laudatory nature of Moses’ death report, neither God nor the narrator mentions anything about Moses’ death atop Mount Nebo being a punishment.
<b><i>Mount Nebo, to the summit of Pisgah.</i></b> This verse seems to combine two traditions about Moses’ death: one associated with Pisgah (3:27) and the other with Mount Nebo (32:49).

Verse 2



Verse 3



Verse 4

<b><i>“see it with your own eyes.”</i></b> Deuteronomy repeatedly uses this phrase to emphasize the importance of knowledge gained from firsthand experience (for instance, see 4:3, 9, 34).

Verse 5

MOSES’ DEATH (34:5–7) The report of Moses’ death emphasizes that he did not die of natural causes, but at God’s behest.

Verse 6



Verse 7

<b><i>hundred and twenty years old.</i></b> Genesis 6:3 appears to establish 120 years as the ideal human lifespan, although thereafter some biblical figures live longer; Sarah, for example, dies at age 127 (Genesis 23:1). This typological number can be accounted for as being three times forty (a key number in the Bible, as in the length of time of the wilderness journey) or two times sixty (important in the Mesopotamian sexagesimal system). As W. Gunther Plaut points out, 120 is the multiple of the first five whole numbers (1 × 2 × 3 × 4 × 5) <i>(The Torah: A Modern Commentary,</i> revised edition, 2005, p. 1387).
<i><b>his vigor unabated.</b></i> Literally, “his moisture had not departed [or: dried up].” Earlier, Moses told the people that he “can no longer be active” (31:2). Jeffrey Tigay therefore argues that this clause should be understood instead as meaning “he had not become wrinkled” (<i>Deuteronomy,</i> 1996, p. 338). (Compare Sarah’s description of herself as “withered” in Genesis 18:12.)

Verse 8

MOURNING FOR MOSES, WHO IS SUCCEEDED BY JOSHUA (34:8–9) As they did for Aaron (Numbers 20:29), the people mourn Moses for thirty days. Various sources of evidence indicate that throughout the ancient world, women typically were associated with mourning rituals, composing and performing laments in times of collective and personal grief (see <i>Chayei Sarah,</i> Contemporary Reflection). This section also confirms the successful transition of leadership to Joshua. Although he is a qualified successor, the subsequent section stresses that no one can rival Moses.

Verse 9



Verse 10

TRIBUTE TO MOSES’ UNRIVALED STATUS (34:10–12) These concluding verses function as a eulogy, acclaiming Moses’ incomparable stature as the sole prophet who merited unmediated contact with the Divine. (On women prophets, see Another View.) Following the reference to the covenant with the ancestors in v. 4, the text now highlights another pivotal biblical event: the wondrous acts that Moses performed on God’s behalf, resulting in Israel’s deliverance from Egypt. Just as the Exodus forms the foundation of the covenantal relationship between God and Israel—as reflected in the first verse of the Decalogue (Exodus 20:2; Deuteronomy 5:6)—so it is appropriate that the book of Deuteronomy, and hence the entire Torah, ends with the recollection of this event. As befits someone who assiduously sought to have Israel recognize and faithfully worship its God, the last words about Moses’ life reiterate his deep bond with, and loyal service to, the Divine. For Israel to thrive in the Promised Land, and beyond, they will need both God’s “mighty hand” (34:12, translated here as “great might”) and God’s comforting embrace, the support of God’s “arms everlasting” (33:27).
