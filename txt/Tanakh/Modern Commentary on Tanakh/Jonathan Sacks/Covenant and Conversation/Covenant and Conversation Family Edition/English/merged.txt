Covenant and Conversation Family Edition

Introduction

<span class="poetry indentAll"><i>The Israelites, slaves in Egypt for more than two hundred years, were about to go free…. On the brink of their release, Moshe, the leader of the Jews, gathered them together and prepared to address them. He might have spoken about freedom. He could have given a stirring address about the promised land to which they were travelling, the “land flowing with milk and honey.” Or he might have prepared them for the journey that lay ahead, the long march across the wilderness.</i><br><i>Instead, Moshe delivered a series of addresses that seemed to make no sense in the context of that particular moment. He presented a new idea, revolutionary in character, whose implications remain challenging even now. He spoke about children, and the distant future, and the duty to pass on memory to generations yet unborn…. <b>About to gain their freedom, the Israelites were told that they had to become a nation of educators.</b></i><br><i>Freedom, Moshe suggested, is won, not on the battlefield, nor in the political arena, but in the human imagination and will. To defend a land, you need an army. But to defend freedom, you need education. You need families and schools to ensure that your ideals are passed on to the next generation, and never lost, or despaired of, or obscured. The citadels of liberty are houses of study. Its heroes are teachers, its passion is education and the life of the mind. Moshe realised that a people achieves immortality not by building temples or mausoleums, but by engraving their values on the hearts of their children, and they on theirs, and so on until the end of time.</i><br><i>The Israelites built living monuments – monuments to life – and became a people dedicated to bringing new generations into being and handing on to them the heritage of the past. <b>Their great institutions were the family and education via the conversation between the generations</b>.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>A Letter in the Scroll</i>, 33–34.</i></span>
<b>A Nation of Educators</b>
Early on in <i>A Letter in the Scroll</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Published in the United Kingdom under the title <i>Radical Then, Radical Now.</i></i><i> </i>arguably the book in which Rabbi Sacks <i>zt”l</i> most clearly articulated his philosophy of Judaism, he wrote about the value of education in Judaism and Jewish civilisation. This theme permeated his work across the many mediums through which he impacted the world, from books to <i>parasha </i>commentary, from his frequent articles and broadcasts in the media to his speeches in the House of Lords. It was clear to him that “for Jews, education is not just what we know. It’s <i>who we are</i>.”<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Letter 4: Jewish Education<i>,</i> in <i>Letters to the Next Generation.</i></i>
But if you look closely, you will notice how he places this responsibility not solely on teachers and schools. He did not believe in the outsourcing of the responsibility for education to professionals. For Rabbi Sacks, the primary institution of education in the life of a Jewish child is the family, and the foremost educator with the deepest impact is the parent.
To launch the first annual <i>Communities in Conversation </i>initiative, marking Rabbi Sacks’s <i>yahrzeit</i>, his daughter, Gila Sacks, said of her father:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><i>Perhaps the most defining feature of my father’s life, one that I don’t think I fully appreciated until after he died, was that he learned and learned, and continued to learn every single day, until his last. He learned from books, from text, from laws. He learned from history and from world events. But, mainly, he learned from people. He would seek out people to learn from, from every possible path of life. And he would seek out what he could learn from everyone he met. And he would do this through conversation, through talking and listening. So for him, conversation was a defining and spiritual act, a way of opening ourselves up to something beyond ourselves, of being challenged, the only way we could really become more than we were before. A training, perhaps, for opening ourselves up to God.</i></span>
This captures the pedagogical vision behind the <i>Family Editions</i> – a resource for parents and families (as well as schools and teachers) to enhance the “conversation between the generations.”
<b>Overview</b>
In 2007 Rabbi Sacks embarked on an ambitious new project – to write an essay on the weekly <i>parasha</i> every week, to be disseminated around the world. He called this <i>Covenant &amp; Conversation</i>, and he continued the project through many more <i>parasha </i>cycles, until the end of his life. The brilliance of these essays was the way Rabbi Sacks found complex ideas of Jewish thought expressed in the week’s Torah reading, articulated them and made them relevant to our lives today, enriching our understanding of them through contemporary wisdom (what he would later come to term <i>ĥokhma</i> – science, including the social sciences, as well as popular culture). In writing these essays in beautiful and elegant language which was nevertheless accessible to all (including non-Jews), he elevated style to the level of substance. As an educator and a parent, for many years I believed that these simple yet sophisticated essays could be adapted for a younger audience, and on several occasions I used them in my own classroom with middle and high school students.
In 2016 Rabbi Sacks and his team intensified their investment in resources to help Jewish educators in their work. I was privileged to be part of this initiative, and one of the projects we worked on together was two cycles of <i>Covenant &amp; Conversation Family Edition</i>, and thereafter a cycle based on a similar approach focusing on the festivals, which we called <i>Ceremony &amp; Celebration Family Edition</i>. Rabbi Sacks passed away between the release of the Sukkot and Ĥanukka editions, on the twentieth of Marĥeshvan 5781. We completed the cycle, and the team at The Rabbi Sacks Legacy has been dedicated to bringing the Torah of Rabbi Sacks to as wide an audience as possible ever since.
<b>Educational Vision Behind the Family Editions</b>
In order to make the ideas contained in the main edition of the <i>Covenant &amp; Conversation</i> essay accessible for younger audiences and families of various ages sitting around the Shabbat table, we divided the ideas into manageable segments, each for a progressively older developmental age. The sections found in the <i>Covenant &amp; Conversation Family Edition</i> are as follows:
<b>IN A NUTSHELL</b> is a short summary of the <i>parasha</i> for all ages.
<b>THE CORE IDEA<i> </i></b>presents a key thought extracted from the main essay, with the language adapted to be more accessible to a younger audience (middle school age) as well as older teenagers and adults.
<b>IT ONCE HAPPENED</b> is a story<b> </b>that illustrates or complements the ideas found in <i>The Core Idea </i>and the <i>Thinking More Deeply </i>sections. These stories are appropriate for all ages.
<b>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</b> presents the remainder of the <i>Covenant &amp; Conversation </i>main essay (sometimes in edited form and with specific words replaced with language that teens will be more comfortable with) and would be appropriate for older teenagers and adults. This section does not stand alone, but should be read together with <i>The Core Idea</i>.
These sections are all followed by <b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER </b>which are designed to be used for reflection and conversation around the texts and ideas found in them. Suggested answers to these questions are found in an <b>EDUCATIONAL COMPANION TO THE QUESTIONS</b> at the end of each chapter.
<b>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</b> presents a short quote from somewhere in the canon of writings of Rabbi Sacks that connects to and enriches our understanding of the ideas contained in the Covenant &amp; Conversation Family Edition.
<b>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</b> provides three questions that families can discuss on the <i>parasha</i> together. They are normally based on Rabbi Sacks’s understanding of the <i>parasha</i> as presented in the <i>Covenant &amp; Conversation</i> essay. Whether those around the table have read the main essay, or the <i>Family Edition</i>, all will be able to use these questions as a basis for conversation about the ideas.
<b>In the Words of Rabbi Sacks</b>
When <i>Covenant &amp; Conversation</i> <i>Family Edition</i> was launched for 5779 (in October 2018), and again when the <i>Ceremony &amp; Celebration Family Edition</i> was launched for 5781 (September 2020), Rabbi Sacks made videos to explain the vision behind the projects. Here are excerpts from these transcripts:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><i>I have called these essays Covenant &amp; Conversation because this for me is the essence of what Torah learning is –</i> <i>throughout the ages and for us now. The text of the Torah is our covenant with God; the interpretation of this text has been the subject of an ongoing conversation that began at Sinai and has never ceased. Every age has added its commentaries, and so must ours. That is what I have tried to do each week through my Covenant &amp; Conversation essays.</i><br><i>That is why I am so excited by the new Family Edition of Covenant &amp; Conversation. The Family Edition is an accompanying resource which will take the core ideas from the main Covenant &amp; Conversation essay for each parasha, and present them in a simpler fashion, as a way of engaging older children and teenagers.</i><br><i>We hope you’ll find this a useful resource to deepen your understanding of the covenant of our Torah, but of equal importance to engage in a meaningful conversation about our Torah with our children and the next generation. Participating in that conversation, and encouraging your children to participate with you, is a major part of what it is to be a Jew, because we are the people who never stopped learning the Book of Life, our most precious gift from the God of Life. There is nothing more beautiful or life affirming than learning Torah with your children. Give them the space not only to be your students, but also to be your teachers, and they will grow tall. That’s how we can truly secure the Jewish future.</i><br><i>A framework for engaging with these ideas and enhancing discussion around the Shabbat table. That is what the Shabbat table is really all about.</i><br><i>The Ceremony &amp; Celebration Family Edition is a resource for families based around the ĥagim, which form such crucial aspects and key moments and educational opportunities throughout the year. This is a wonderful way of starting and sustaining a conversation with your children, and that is something through which you will grow and they will grow. Jewish education has always been based around three institutions: the school, the shul, and the home, and all three are important.</i></span>
<b>Acknowledgements</b>
We are pleased to acknowledge and thank Lillian and Moshe Tabacinic for their critical support for this series of books. Lillian and Moshe are renowned for their support for Jewish education both in Florida and beyond and we are honoured that they have partnered with us on this exciting project. On behalf of all at Koren, and the families across the Jewish world that will learn from and enjoy these volumes, thank you.
Working for both Koren Jerusalem and The Rabbi Sacks Legacy has been a privilege and an honour and has given me the opportunity to collaborate with so many talented and creative people. Thanks to Joanna Benarroch, Dan Sacker, Debby Ifield, and Jonny Lipczer at The Rabbi Sacks Legacy, who, together with Rabbi Sacks, believed in the vision and possibilities for creating these educational resources, and gave me the opportunity of a lifetime to develop exciting projects such as this one. I would also like to thank the Sacks family for their belief in and support of this and all the educational projects I have been involved in on behalf of The Rabbi Sacks Legacy. Thank you for entrusting to us the holy work of continuing the legacy of Rabbi Sacks and bringing his ideas to a younger audience.
Thank you to our team at Koren whose professionalism, creativity, and expertise can be found on every page. These include Aryeh Grossman for being my educational soundboard, Tani Bayer for the creative design, Tomi Mager for typesetting what became a very complex project, and finally to Caryn Meltz who brings everything together in a way that defies description, as well as our proofreaders, Nechama Unterman and Tali Simon. Of course, thanks must always go to our boss, the publisher Matthew Miller, for his support, leadership, and vision.
Finally, to my family, for their love, support, and inspiration. Our Shabbat table was the first of many around the world to explore the ideas of Rabbi Sacks on the <i>parasha</i> as a family using this medium, and your input and inspiration can be found throughout these volumes.
The last word goes to my teacher and Rav, Rabbi Lord Jonathan Sacks <i>zt”l</i>. Not a day goes past without a sense of feeling bereft without you to lead and inspire us. Your commitment and passion to bring your ideas to young people and your belief in my ability to help you to do it gives me the strength to continue with this endeavour. The <i>Covenant &amp; Conversation </i>essay that was sent around the world for the Shabbat that fell during the <i>shiva</i>, entitled <i>Beginning the Journey</i>, explored Avraham's faith in the covenant and the promises from God, despite only experiencing the very beginning of their fulfilment in his lifetime. The essay concludes with these words:
<i>Leaders see the destination, begin the journey, and leave behind them those who will continue it. That is enough to endow a life with immortality.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">“<i>Ĥayei Sara: </i>Beginning the Journey,”<i> </i>in<i> Lessons in Leadership, </i>23.</i>
It is my privilege to count myself among the many who are driven to continue your journey. It is my hope that these volumes will be a significant step in that journey.

Bereshit

In a Nutshell

<b><i>IN A NUTSHELL</i></b><br>In this <i>parasha</i> we learn about the story of how the world was created, including all the animals and humans who live in it. God creates the world in six days and gives the world Shabbat, a day of holiness and rest, on the seventh day.
One of God’s creations is Adam, the first human. God tells us that “it is not good for man to be alone,” and so He creates Ḥava. They live in the Garden of Eden and are allowed to eat from all the trees and plants, except the Tree of Knowledge. The snake convinces them to sin by eating from it, so God punishes them by making them leave the perfect world of the Garden of Eden.
The rest of the stories in our <i>parasha</i>, which continue into the next <i>parasha</i>, are tales of sadness and tragedy, and show how we can all make mistakes. For example, Kayin, Adam and Ḥava’s son, becomes the first person to kill another human being when he kills his brother, Hevel. By the end of the <i>parasha</i>, God sees how wicked man can become.
<b>QUESTION TO PONDER</b>
<i>Why do you think humans make so many mistakes? How can God help us to stop this from happening?</i>

I; The Genesis of Love

<big><strong>I. The Genesis of Love</strong></big><br><b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>There are two different versions of the story of creation. The first is in Bereshit 1, the second in Bereshit 2–3. There are many differences between the two accounts and I want to concentrate on one of these: the two different ways the first man gives a name to the first woman.
In the first, Adam calls woman <i>isha</i>, “for she was taken from man (<i>ish</i>).” In the second, Adam calls his wife Eve (<i>Ḥava</i>), “because she was the mother of all life.”
In the first version, the man names not a person, but a class, a category. He uses a noun, not a name. The other person is, for him, simply “woman,” a type, not an individual. In the second, he gives his wife a proper name. She has become, for him, a person in her own right.
Only <i>after</i> the man has given his wife a proper name do we find the Torah referring to God Himself by His proper name alone, namely <i>Hashem</i> (in Bereshit 4). Until then He has been described as either <i>Elokim</i> or <i>Hashem Elokim</i> – <i>Elokim</i> being the impersonal aspect of God: God as law, God as power, God as justice. In other words, <i>our relationship to God parallels our relationship to one another. Only when we respect and recognise the uniqueness of another person are we capable of respecting and recognising the uniqueness of God Himself</i>.
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. What is the difference between a noun and a proper name? Is it similar to being called by your first and last names?</i>
<i>2. When do we use the name</i> Elokim<i> for God and when do we use</i> Hashem<i>?</i>
<i>3. What can we learn about our relationship with God from our relationships with humans?</i>
<b><i>It Once Happened…</i></b><br><i>Hello. My name is Rafi. You can call me Rafi. That is what my friends and family call me. Sometimes. Sometimes I have other names though. Sometimes my sisters call me Ruffles or Rufus. Sometimes my brother calls me the Rafmeister. Sometimes friends just call me Levy. I don’t really like that too much. My name is Rafi. When I am called to the Torah, I am Raphael Eliyahu ben Aryeh Elisha. When I am ill, I am Raphael Eliyahu ben Miriam Tzofia.</i>
<i>My parents chose my names because my sister was ill when I was born, and Raphael means God who heals, and is the name of the angel who heals on behalf of God.</i>
<i>Eliyahu was my mother’s grandfather, who died before I was born. He survived the Holocaust and came to Israel and fought in the War of Independence. It feels like an honour to be named after him.</i>
<i>But my name is Rafi. You can call me Rafi.</i>
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. How many different names does Rafi have? Why so many?</i>
<i>2. Why doesn’t Rafi like to be called Levy? Why does he like to be called Rafi? What do you like to be called? Why?</i>
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>Let us return to the two creation accounts, looking at what they can tell us about creation. In Bereshit 1, God creates <i>things</i> – chemical elements, stars, planets, life forms, biological species. In Bereshit 2–3, He creates <i>people</i>. In the first chapter, He creates systems; in the second chapter He creates relationships. It is fundamental to the Torah’s view of reality that these things belong to different worlds, distinct narratives, separate stories, alternative ways of seeing reality.
There are differences in tone as well. In the first, creation involves no effort on the part of God. He simply speaks. He says, “Let there be,” and there was. In the second, He is actively engaged. When it comes to the creation of the first human, He does not merely say, “Let us make man in our image according to our likeness.” He performs the creation Himself, like a sculptor fashioning an image out of clay: “Then the Lord God formed the man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living being.”
In Bereshit 1, God effortlessly summons the universe into being. In Bereshit 2, He becomes a gardener: “Now the Lord God planted a garden….” We wonder why on earth God, who has just created the entire universe, should become a gardener. The Torah gives us the answer, and it is very moving: “The Lord God took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden to work it and take care of it.” God wanted to give man the dignity of work, of being a creator, not just a creation. And in case the man should view such labour as undignified, God became a gardener Himself to show that this work too is divine, and in performing it, man becomes God’s partner in the work of creation.
Then comes the extraordinarily poignant verse, “The Lord God said, ‘It is not good for the man to be alone. I will make a helper suitable for him.’” God feels for the existential isolation of the first man. There was no such moment in the previous chapter. There, God simply creates. Here, God empathises. He enters into the human mind. He feels what we feel. There is no such moment in any other ancient religious literature. What is radical about biblical monotheism is not just that there is only one God, not just that He is the source of all that exists, but that <i>God is closer to us than we are to ourselves</i>. God knew the loneliness of the first man before the first man knew it of himself.
That is what the second creation account is telling us. Creation of things is relatively easy; creation of relationships is hard. Look at the tender concern God shows for the first human beings in Bereshit 2–3. He wants man to have the dignity of work. He wants man to know that work itself is divine. He gives man the capacity to name the animals. He cares when He senses the onset of loneliness. He creates the first woman. He watches, in exasperation, as the first human couple commit the first sin. Finally, when the man gives his wife a proper name, recognising for the first time that she is different from him and that she can do something he will never do, He clothes them both so that they will not go naked into the world. That is the God, not of creation (<i>Elokim</i>) but of love (<i>Hashem</i>).
That is what makes the dual account of the naming of the first woman so significant a parallel to the dual account of God’s creation of the universe. We have to create relationships before we encounter the God of relationship. We have to make space for the otherness of the human other to be able to make space for the otherness of the divine other. We have to give love before we can receive love.
In Bereshit 1, God creates the universe. Nothing vaster can be imagined, and we keep discovering that the universe is bigger than we thought. In 2016, a study based on three-dimensional modelling of images produced by the Hubble space telescope concluded that there were between ten and twenty times as many galaxies as astronomers had previously thought. There are more than a hundred stars for every grain of sand on earth.
And yet, almost in the same breath as it speaks of the panoply of creation, the Torah tells us that God took time to breathe the breath of life into the first human, give him dignified work, enter his loneliness, make him a wife, and robe them both with garments of light when the time came for them to leave Eden and make their way in the world.
The Torah is telling us something very powerful. Never think of people as things. Never think of people as types: they are individuals. Never be content with creating systems: care also about relationships.
<b>I believe that relationships are where our humanity is born and grows, flowers and flourishes. It is by loving people that we learn to love God and feel the fullness of His love for us.</b>
<b>QUESTION TO PONDER</b>
<i>What can you learn from the relationships in your life to help develop your relationship with God?</i>
<b><i>From the Thought of Rabbi Sacks</i></b><br>God is not about power but relationships. Religion is not about control but about freedom. God is found less in nature than in human society, in the structures we make to honour His presence by honouring His image in other human beings.
<b><i>A Letter in the Scroll,</i> 76</b>
<b><i>Around the Shabbat Table</i></b><br>Why do you think there are two separate and contrasting descriptions of how God created humankind?
What is deeply problematic with the first name (<i>isha</i>) that Adam gave to his wife?
How can we learn to love God from loving the people in our life?
<b>EDUCATIONAL COMPANION TO THE QUESTIONS</b>
<b><i>IN A NUTSHELL</i></b><br>Humans are, by definition, imperfect, and God gave humanity free will, allowing us to make mistakes. Perhaps this is the message of these stories so early in the book of Bereshit. But this doesn’t mean that we shouldn’t strive to be better (even if we will never reach perfection). To help us do this, God gave us a code of laws and values to live by. He also created the idea of <i>teshuva</i> (repentance) to show us that our mistakes do not need to define us, and we will always be able to start again and become better people.
<b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>Nouns are the words we use to refer to things, places, or people, in a non-personal way. A noun describes a “type.” A proper name, on the other hand, is a way to refer to someone specific, in a personal way, and suggests some kind of relationship. (The Jewish philosopher Martin Buber spoke about I-It and I-Thou relationships. Nouns are used in I-It relationships, and proper names in I-Thou relationships, which are more personal and intimate.) When someone refers to you by your last name only, it suggests a lack of personal relationship and intimacy. Although a family name is part of your proper name, when you are called by your family name, it may feel like the person is demonstrating that they see you as part of a group or category (in this case, your wider family) rather than seeing you as an individual in your own right.
<i>Elokim</i> is a more generic name for God (and in fact is sometimes used to refer to other “gods” that were worshipped in biblical times). It is also often used to refer to God in the context of law and justice (i.e., less personal), rather than the four-letter name of God (the Tetragrammaton – the name we do not read out loud, but rather read as <i>Hashem</i> – “The Name”), which is a proper name for God and suggests a more personal and intimate relationship with Him.
Only when we respect and recognise the uniqueness of another person are we capable of respecting and recognising the uniqueness of God Himself. But we can also conclude that only when we see God as an “other” with whom we wish to form a relationship (represented by the use of proper names) will we be able to develop a relationship with Him. Just as with human relationships, a relationship with God takes thought and effort.
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br>There are six names mentioned in the story for Rafi. We all have many names used by different people in our lives at different times, each one appropriate for a specific aspect of our identity.
Rafi is the way he is called by those who love him the most, like his parents and close friends. Levy is his surname, and it is suggested that the person using it doesn’t feel close to Rafi and is not interested in a close relationship. (It should be noted that this is not always true – sometimes children use last names without meaning to send this message, and sometimes those childhood friends become lifelong friends who still sometimes refer to you by your last name out of habit or as a nickname.)
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>Relationships take work, whether they are with family, friends, or God, and we cannot take for granted any relationship, even one that seems guaranteed (like a parent-child relationship, or in fact our relationship with God). Building and developing relationships with other humans, who are also created in the image of God (see <i>From the Thought of Rabbi Sacks</i>), can help us understand how to do the same with God.
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>In describing the creation of Adam and Ḥava in two very different and contrasting ways in the first two chapters of Bereshit, the Torah is showing us two distinct aspects of what it means to be a human being. Rabbi Soloveitchik’s thesis in his work <i>The Lonely Man of Faith</i> is that both aspects of man (Majestic Man and Covenantal Man) exist within each of us, and both are sanctioned by God. The Torah is helping us to be aware of these aspects of our personalities and to maintain a healthy balance between them.
One of the contrasts between the two versions describing the creation of humanity is the way Adam named his wife. We can learn about these two aspects of humankind presented in Rabbi Soloveitchik’s <i>The Lonely Man of Faith</i> (Majestic Man and Covenantal Man), and therefore ourselves, from the way Adam chose to name his wife. In the first instance, he named her <i>isha</i>, the generic name for the female human. This is because he saw her merely as a “type,” a partner for developing and dominating the world. This is because Majestic Man’s priority is to create and build. But the danger is that if Adam fails to see the humanity in Ḥava and cannot even find a proper name to call her by, with which to build a relationship with her, then he risks devaluing her and mistreating her. Seeing other human beings as “things” can lead to devastatingly evil events, as we have seen throughout history.
When we realise that we must treat our fellow human beings with dignity, as people in their own right, people who are created in the image of God, we can form relationships with them and come to love them. When we learn this lesson, we are then ready to embark on developing a mutual and intimate relationship with God.

II; The Three Stages of Creation

<big><strong>II. The Three Stages of Creation</strong></big><br><b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>At the beginning of our <i>parasha</i>, we learn how God created mankind. He did this by creating man “in His image, after His likeness.” This is a difficult idea to understand because we believe that God <i>has no image</i>. “Image,” then, must refer to something quite different than physical form and likeness. The Torah here is telling us we can be like God in the way we act.
Our <i>parasha</i> is the first in the Torah, so we haven’t seen or learned much about God yet. What have we seen God do so far? The God we are reading about is the One who creates. The Torah here is telling us that we can be like God and imitate Him, by becoming creators. Just as God is creative, so we should try to be creative.
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. How does God act? How can we copy that in our lives?</i>
<i>2. What did you create this week? What did you achieve that you are proud of?</i>
<i>3. Why does God want us to become creators like Him? Why is creating things good for us and good for the world?</i>
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br><i>Rabbi Avraham Yitzhak HaKohen Kook was the first chief rabbi of British Mandatory Palestine. When World War I erupted he found himself stuck in London where he remained for the duration of the war until he could return to the land of Israel. Rabbi Kook spoke about how during his time in London he would often visit the National Gallery to admire the art there. His favourite artist was Rembrandt, whom he described as a tzaddik, a righteous person.</i>
<i>When he examined Rembrandt’s paintings it reminded him of the rabbinic statement about the light created on the first day of creation –</i> “When God created the light [on the first day], it was so strong and luminous that it was possible to see from one end of the world to the other. And God feared that the wicked would make use of it [for destructive purposes]. What did He do? He hid it for the righteous in the world to come. But from time to time there are great men whom God blesses with a vision of that hidden light.” <i>Rabbi Kook believed that Rembrandt was one of those great men who could perceive the or</i> ganuz<i> (hidden light), and he presented that light in his paintings.</i>
<i>What is equally puzzling and wonderful about Rembrandt’s paintings is that he makes no attempt to beautify or idealise his subjects. Yet the light radiates from the ordinary people in his paintings. Rembrandt’s brilliance is his ability to convey the beauty of ordinary people. The light that shines from them is, simply, their humanity. Their</i> tzelem Elokim<i> (image of God)</i>.
<b><i>Thinking More Deeply</i></b><br><i>Three Stages of Creation: “And God said, ‘Let there be....’ And there was…and God saw that it was good.”</i>
In the first chapter of Bereshit, God creates man “in His image, after His likeness.” We believe that God has no physical form, so being created in “His image” must refer to some other likeness between humanity and God. The Torah tells us we have the potential to be like God in our actions, and we do that by imitating Him. This could mean many things, but the primary role we see God playing in the first chapter of Bereshit is as Creator. Just as God is creative, so we should try to be creative.
Bereshit teaches us how to be creative – in three stages. The first stage is saying “<i>Let there be.</i>” The second is “<i>and there was</i>.” The third stage is seeing “<i>that it is good</i>.”
What makes humans unique among other animals is our ability to speak. <i>Targum Onkelos</i> translates the last phrase of Bereshit 2:7, “<i>God formed man out of dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and man became a living creature</i>,” as “and man became <i>ruaḥ memallela</i>, a <i>speaking</i> spirit.” Because we can speak, we can think, and therefore imagine a world different from the one that currently exists. Creation begins with the creative word, the idea, the vision, the dream. Language – and with it the ability to remember a distant past and think about a distant future – lies at the heart of our uniqueness as the image of God. Just as God makes the physical world by words (“<b><i>And God said, ‘Let there be...’”</i></b>) so we make our human world by words, which is why Judaism takes words so seriously: “<i>Life and death are in the power of the tongue</i>,” says the book of Mishlei (18:21). This is the first stage of creation.
The second stage of creation (“<i>And God said, ‘Let there be’…<b>and there was</b></i>”) is for us the most difficult to achieve. It is one thing to have an idea, another to make it happen. It is so often too easy to give up after failure, and to conclude that nothing ultimately can be achieved, that the world is as it is, and that all human efforts will end in failure.
If the first stage in creation is imagination, the second is will. The sanctity of the human will is one of the most distinctive features of the Torah. There have been many philosophies that believe that humans do not have free will. This is called determinism – that we are determined by other factors, like genetics, or economic or social forces. Judaism is a protest against these ideas. We are not pre-programmed machines; we are persons, who have free will. Just as God is free, so we are free, and the entire Torah is a call to humanity to exercise responsible freedom in creating a social world which honours the freedom of others. Free will is the bridge from “<i>Let there be</i>” to “<i>and there was</i>.”
The third stage (“<b><i>And God saw that it was good</i></b>”) is the hardest of the three stages to understand. What does it mean to say that “<i>God saw that it was good</i>”? What does God make that is not good? Here the challenge is to see the good that is sometimes hidden.
In the course of my work, I have visited prisons and centres for young offenders. Many of the people I met there were potentially good. They, like you and me, had dreams, hopes, ambitions, aspirations. They did not want to become criminals. Their tragedy was that often they came from difficult backgrounds. No one took the time to care for them, support them, teach them how to negotiate the world, how to achieve what they wanted through hard work rather than violence and lawbreaking. They lacked a basic self-respect, a sense of their own worth. No one ever told them that they were good. To see that someone is good and to say so is a creative act itself. To see the good in others and let them see themselves the way we see them is to help someone grow to become the best they can be. “<i>Greater</i>,” says the Talmud, “<i>is one who causes others to do good than one who does good himself</i>.” To help others become what they can be is to give birth to creativity in someone else’s soul.
“<i>And God saw that it was good</i>” – this too is part of the work of creation, the subtlest and most beautiful of all. When we recognise the goodness in someone, we do more than create it, we help it to become creative. This is what God does for us, and what He calls on us to do for others.
<b><i>From the Thought of Rabbi Sacks</i></b><br><i>Judaism is a critique of empire and the rule of the strong.</i> In the first chapter of Bereshit we are told that every human being is in the image and likeness of God. This is not an abstract metaphysical proposition. It is a political statement of potentially explosive force. The kings and pharaohs of the ancient world were seen as gods, the children of the gods, or the sole intermediary of the gods. They presided over hierarchical societies in which there was an absolute, ontological differences between rulers and ruled.
By stating that not just the king, but everyone, is in the image of God, the Bible was opposing the entire political universe of the ancient world. Every individual is sacrosanct. Every life is sacred. The human person as such has inalienable dignity. Here is the birth of the biblical revolution, which did not materialise in the West until the seventeenth century with the articulation of the concept of human rights, meaning the rights we bear simply because we are human. Bavel is the symbol of the sacrifice of the individual to the state. Avraham, by contrast, is to become the symbol of all individuals in search of worth as individuals. <b>The Hebrew Bible is a sustained protest against empire, hierarchy, ruling elites, and the enslavement of the masses.</b>

<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. What does it mean for society if we believe that everyone is created in the “</i>image of God<i>,” not just the king or the elite?</i>
<i>2. In this</i> Covenant &amp; Conversation <i>essay, Rabbi Sacks challenges us to see the good in creation (the third stage of creation). How does the belief in all people being created in the “</i>image of God<i>” help us to do that?</i>
<b><i>Around the Shabbat Table</i></b><br>If God is incorporeal (has no physical form) how can we be created in the “<i>image of God</i>”? What then do you think it means to be created “<i>in the image of God</i>”?
What does the power of speech allow us to do that God’s other creations cannot?
Rabbi Sacks’s third stage of creation (and creativity) is to see the good in all things and all people. Is there good in everything and everyone? How do we find it?
<b>EDUCATIONAL COMPANION TO THE QUESTIONS</b>
<b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>We believe that God is the ultimate source of goodness in the world and therefore He always acts with goodness. This can take the form of many of the characteristics we attribute to Him, such as compassion, mercy, kindness, and justice. We can and should copy these characteristics in the way we live our lives, and some believe that is the basis for the mitzvot, to help us to do this. However, the God that we encounter in the first chapter of Bereshit is primarily the Creator. So perhaps being created in God’s image here means we are created in order to become creators ourselves.
Children should be encouraged to understand that “being creative” does not just mean being physically creative with our hands. It can also mean lots of other ways in which we improve the world and society around us. Making a person smile or feel loved is also a creative act!
God has created a world for us to benefit from and asked us to help improve it. In fact, Rabbi Sacks believes our primary destiny in the world is to achieve <i>tikkun olam</i> – the perfecting of the world. The ultimate fulfilment of Judaism is to heal the fractures in the world and we do that by being creative, physically, spiritually, and emotionally.
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br>All humans are created in the image of God, which means they all have spiritual worth and spiritual beauty. This is not necessarily talking about physical beauty, although it can also be argued that all of God’s creations have physical beauty, if we only look for it carefully. The spiritual beauty of being created in the image of God can be found in all human beings, irrespective of gender, race, colour, creed, or culture.
According to this line of thought, there is spiritual beauty in all human beings, if we are just open to seeing it. Instead of judging a person’s beauty by superficial external factors, we have to delve into their souls, by getting to know them, to see their true beauty and spiritual worth.
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>In ancient times (and even more recently than that) society was more hierarchical. Only the elite, who had power because of their wealth or status, were seen as being divine and having inherent value. There are still some societies in the world that function like this. Judaism and the Torah brought a radical idea into the world that is the basis of Western liberal democratic societies today – that all people are created equal and should have the same rights because of that. This is because every human being is created in the image of God.
Once we see the image of God in each human being, we can see the goodness in them. This means we can also see the good and value in everything they do and create. There is so much good in creation. Some of it is from the Creator, and some of it is from His creations who have created in their own right.
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>Being created in the image of God does not mean humans have a physical likeness to God, but rather a spiritual likeness. This could mean many different things. On some level, it is whatever distinguishes us from the animal world. Animals are not created in the image of God. So what makes humans distinct from animals? Here are some suggestions: speech (communication); the power of abstract thought; free choice (and the power to be good and selfless); a divine soul (a higher soul as compared to the lower animal soul) and therefore the ability to connect to the Divine.
The power of speech allows humankind to organise themselves in larger societies, collaborating and working in unison for the greater good of the group and society as a whole. This allows us to develop as a species and build a better world for us all, fulfilling the divine command to be creative, and to do <i>tikkun olam</i> (perfecting the world).
Some people believe there is good, or potential good, in all people and all things. Others see evil in the world and believe that some people and some things can be all evil and unredeemable. Ask the people around your table what they believe. Most Jewish thinkers and sources seem to believe the former.

Noach

In a Nutshell

<b><i>IN A NUTSHELL</i></b><br>In this <i>parasha</i> God sees how wicked humankind has become and decides to bring a flood to destroy the whole world, and start again with Noaḥ and his family. God commands Noaḥ to build an ark and to bring his family, and some animals, into the ark so they will all survive.
After forty days of rain, the flooding finally ends and the water begins to disappear. When Noaḥ can finally leave the ark, he offers a sacrifice to God, and God makes a covenant (an agreement) with Noaḥ and all humans. In the covenant God tells humans how to be good, and promises never again to destroy the world with a flood. Soon, a new generation of humans try to build a city whose tower will reach heaven. This is called the Tower of Bavel. God prevents them from doing this by confusing their language, so that no one can understand anyone else.
The <i>parasha</i> ends with a list of the ten generations from Noaḥ’s son Shem to Avraham, who becomes the first-ever Jew in the next <i>parasha</i>.
<b>QUESTION TO PONDER</b>
<i>Why do you think God needs to tell us how to be good? Shouldn’t we just know?</i>

I; The Light In The Ark

<big><strong>I. The Light In The Ark</strong></big><br><b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>One of the many detailed ark-building instructions given to Noaḥ is particularly important: make a <i>tzohar</i> for the ark and terminate it within a cubit of the top (Bereshit 6:16).
There is a difficulty understanding what “<i>tzohar</i>” means, since the word does not appear anywhere else in Tanakh. All our commentators agree that it is a source of illumination. It is what will give light within the ark itself. But what exactly was it? Rashi quotes a midrash (Bereshit Rabba 31:11) in which two Rabbis disagree as to its meaning: Some say this was a window; others say that it was a precious stone that gave light to them.
It is fascinating to think about why the Rabbis of the Midrash, and Rashi himself, would spend time on a question that has no practical relevance. God promises us at the end of the <i>parasha</i> that there will be no further flood. We will never again need an ark floating on the water to save humankind. So why should it matter what source of light Noaḥ had in the ark during those stormy days? Why this discussion? What is the lesson here for the future generations?
I would like to offer a possible interpretation. The answer, I suggest, lies in the history of the Hebrew language. Throughout the biblical era, the word <i>teiva</i> is used to mean an ark – a large one in the case of Noaḥ and the Flood, and a very small one in the case of the basket that protected baby Moshe on the River Nile (Shemot 2:3). More generally, it means “box.” However, by the time of the Midrash, <i>teiva</i> had come also to mean “word.”
It seems to me that the Rabbis of the Midrash were not so much commenting on Noaḥ and the ark as reflecting on a fundamental question of Torah. Where and what is the <i>tzohar</i>, the brightness, the source of illumination for the Torah, the <i>teiva</i>, the Word? Does it come solely from within, or also from without? Does the Torah come with a window or with a precious stone? Can we find truth in ideas outside the Torah or only from within it?
<b><i>It Once Happened…</i></b><br><i>There once was a wealthy man who had three sons. He wanted to give all of his riches only to the cleverest of his sons, and so he set them a task to prove their intelligence. He showed them a barn on his estate, and challenged the sons to each take a turn trying to fill the barn to the very fullest. Whoever best succeeded in this task would win the entire inheritance.</i>
<i>The eldest son worked hard gathering rocks and pebbles of all shapes and sizes and he filled the barn from the floor to the roof. His father was impressed with his effort, but he noticed many cracks in between the rocks and stones. The second son used straw, and packed the barn from floor to ceiling with it. However, his father still found tiny spaces and pockets of air between the straw. When the turn of the younger son came, he took his father by the hand and led him into an empty barn. His father became upset that he had not taken the challenge seriously, but at that moment, the son took a small candle from his pocket and lit it.</i>
<i> Instantly, the barn became filled, from the floor to the roof, corner to corner, and in every nook and cranny, with light.</i>
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. What do you think the message of the story is? How is it connected to</i> The Core Idea<i>?</i>
<i>2. Why do you think knowledge (and the Torah) is likened to light?</i>
<b><i>Thinking More Deeply</i></b><br>There were always those who believed that Torah was self-sufficient. If something is difficult in Torah it is because “the words of Torah are sparse in one place but rich in another.” In other words, the answer to any question in Torah can be found elsewhere in Torah. “Turn it over and turn it over for everything is within it.” This was probably historically the majority view, that there is nothing to be learned outside. The Torah is illuminated by a precious stone that generates its own light. This is even hinted at in the title of the greatest work of Jewish mysticism, the Zohar.
There were, however, other views. Most famously, Rambam believed that a knowledge of science and philosophy – a window to the outside world – was essential to understanding God’s word. He made the radical suggestion, in the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, that it was precisely these forms of study that were the way to the love and fear of God. Through science – the knowledge of “He who spoke and called the universe into existence” – we gain a sense of the majesty and beauty, the almost infinite scope and intricate detail of creation and thus of the Creator. That is the source of love. Then, realising how small we are and how brief our lives in the total scheme of things: that is the source of fear.
The case Rambam made in the twelfth century, long before the rise of science, has been strengthened a thousand times with our accelerated knowledge of the nature of the universe. Every new discovery of the vastness of the cosmos and the wonders of the micro-cosmos fills the mind with awe. “Lift up your eyes and look to the heavens: Who created all these?” (Yeshaya 40:26).
Rambam did not think that science and philosophy were secular disciplines, totally irrelevant to Torah. He believed that they were ancient forms of Jewish wisdom that the Greeks had acquired from the Jews and sustained at a time when the Jewish people, through exile and dispersion, had forgotten them. So they were not foreign borrowings. Rambam was reclaiming a tradition that had been born in Israel itself. Nor were they the source of independent illumination. They were simply a window through which the light of God’s created universe could help us decode the Torah itself. <i>Understanding God’s world helps us understand God’s word.</i>
This made a significant difference to the way Rambam was able to convey the truth of Torah. So, for example, his knowledge of ancient religious practices – albeit based on sources that were not always reliable – afforded him the deep insight (in <i>The Guide for the Perplexed</i>) that many of the <i>ḥukim</i>, the statutes, the laws that seem to have no reason, were in fact directed against specific idolatrous practices.
His knowledge of Aristotelian philosophy enabled him to formulate an idea that exists throughout both Tanakh and the rabbinic literature, but that had not been articulated so clearly before, namely that Judaism has a <i>virtue ethic</i>. It is interested not just in what we do but in what we are, in the kind of people we become. That is the basis of his pathbreaking <i>Hilkhot Deot</i>, “Laws of Ethical Character.”
The more we understand the way the world is, the more we understand why the Torah is as it is. It is our roadmap through reality. It is as if secular and scientific knowledge were the map, and Torah the route.
This view, articulated by Rambam, was developed in the modern age in a variety of forms. Devotees of Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch called it <i>Torah</i> <i>im derekh eretz</i>, “Torah with general culture.” In Yeshiva University it came to be known as <i>Torah u-Madda</i>, “Torah and science.” Together with the late Rabbi Aharon Lichtenstein <i>zt”l</i>, I prefer the phrase <i>Torah veḥokhma</i>, “Torah and wisdom,” because wisdom is a biblical category.
Recently, the science writer David Epstein published a fascinating book called <i>Range</i>, subtitled <i>How Generalists Triumph in a Specialised World</i>. He makes the point that overconcentration on a single specialised topic is good for efficiency but bad for creativity. The real creatives (people like the Nobel Prize winners) are often those who had outside interests, who knew other disciplines, or had passions and hobbies outside their specialist subject. Even in a field like sport, for every Tiger Woods, who had a feel for golf even before he could speak, there is a Roger Federer, who exercised his skills in many sports before, quite late in youth, choosing to focus on tennis.
It was precisely Rambam’s breadth of knowledge of science, medicine, psychology, astronomy, philosophy, logic, and many other fields that allowed him to be so wise and creative in everything he wrote, from his letters, to his <i>Commentary to the Mishna</i>, to the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> itself, structured differently from any other code of Jewish law, all the way to <i>The Guide for the Perplexed</i>. Rambam said things that many may have sensed before, but no one had expressed so cogently and powerfully. He showed that it is possible to be utterly devoted to Jewish faith and law and yet be creative, curious about the whole world and how it works, showing people spiritual and intellectual depths they had not seen before. That was his way of making a <i>tzohar</i>, a window for the <i>teiva</i>, the divine word.
On the other hand, the Zohar conceives of Torah as a precious stone that generates its own light and needs none from the outside. Its world is a closed system, a very deep, passionate, moving, sustained search for intimacy with the Divine that dwells within the universe and within the human soul.
We are not forced to choose either the one explanation or the other. The Ḥizkuni said that Noaḥ had a precious stone for the dark days and a window for when the sun shone again. Something like that happened when it came to Torah also. During the dark days of persecution, Jewish mysticism flourished, and Torah was illuminated from within. During the benign days when the world was more open to Jews, they had a window to the outside, and so emerged figures like Rambam in the Middle Ages and Samson Raphael Hirsch in the nineteenth century.
<b>I believe that the challenge for our time is to open a series of windows so that the world can illuminate our understanding of Torah, and so that the Torah may guide us as we seek to make our way through the world.</b>
<b>QUESTION TO PONDER</b>
<i>Can you think of any times when the Torah has been illuminated to you from an “outside window”?</i>
<b><i>From the Thought of Rabbi Sacks</i></b><br>If science is about the world that is, and religion is about the world that ought to be, then religion needs science because we cannot apply God’s will to the world if we do not understand the world.
<b><i>The Great Partnership</i>, 214</b>
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>Why do you think the classic book of Jewish mysticism, the Zohar, took its name from the <i>parasha</i>?
What is the connection between “light” and the terms “illuminate” and “enlighten” when referring to knowledge and understanding?
What are the practical ramifications of the debate surrounding whether the Torah’s illumination comes with a precious stone (self-sufficiency) or a window (an external source)?
<b>EDUCATIONAL COMPANION TO THE QUESTIONS</b>
<b><i>IN A NUTSHELL</i></b><br>Judaism believes that every person is born with the free will to do good or bad, and we each have the inclination to do both right and wrong. We therefore all need to work hard to be good people and choose the right path. Sometimes that path is unclear and it can be hard to choose correctly between different values. Life in this world can be very complicated! That is why God helps us by giving us guidelines and showing us the right path.
<b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>Rabbi Sacks, using a second meaning for the word <i>teiva</i> (ark) – “the word” – suggests that the “light” from the <i>tzohar</i> stone/window is understanding or knowledge that comes either from the Torah itself, or from the outside world to illuminate the Torah and help us to understand it.
Rabbi Sacks gives space for both approaches – obviously the Torah has its own message for the world and light to spread, but he also believes that knowledge from outside of the Torah (such as the secular world) can help us better understand the Torah.
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br>Just as light has the power to permeate every inch of a room, so knowledge, often likened to light, can permeate every inch of our souls. Knowledge, like light, drives out the darkness in our society.
Knowledge and light are often used interchangeably. The English words “illuminate” and “enlighten” refer to knowledge and understanding, with light as the etymological root for the terms. The Torah is also compared to light. Someone who has the light can see through the darkness to see the world of truth.
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>Rabbi Sacks writing in his weekly <i>Covenant &amp; Conversation</i> is a great example of a thinker who regularly uses secular knowledge to help understand the values and themes contained in the Torah. This <i>Covenant &amp; Conversation</i> essay has one such example, when Rabbi Sacks quotes David Epstein’s book <i>Range</i> to help him explain the point he is making. This question encourages those participating to find personal instances when experiences, lessons learned from wider reading, media, education, news, and other times in our lives have shown us something that helped us to better understand the Torah and the world.
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>The Zohar explains the hidden mystical secrets of the universe. Someone who understands them has gained enlightenment. The author of the Zohar chose this name because of the meaning of the term <i>tzohar</i> in this <i>parasha</i> – the source of light in the ark.
One who is enlightened has understanding. One who is “in the dark” about a matter has no understanding. If you are in a dark room and cannot see anything, you do not have understanding or the truth. If you have a source of light (understanding), then you can see your environment and the truth, and you have become enlightened.
If the Torah is self-sufficient then there is never a reason to study anything outside of the Torah to gain an understanding of the world, or to help you understand the Torah itself. However, if secular non-Torah learning can help our understanding of the Torah and its application to the world, then we have a responsibility to educate ourselves outside of Torah knowledge, by learning other areas such as science and the humanities.

II; A Drama in Four Acts

<big><strong>II. A Drama in Four Acts</strong></big><br><b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>Between the story of creation and the call to Avraham in the next <i>parasha</i>, the Torah tells us four stories: Adam and Ḥava, Kayin and Hevel, Noaḥ and the Flood, and the Tower of Bavel. Are they there merely because they happened? Or is there a deeper connection between them?
The first story is of how Adam and Ḥava eat the forbidden fruit in the Garden of Eden. Adam then blames Ḥava, who blames the snake. Neither takes personal responsibility.
Then Kayin and Hevel bring offerings to God, but only Hevel’s is accepted. In anger, Kayin kills his brother, and when he is asked by God where his brother is, he answers, “Am I my brother’s keeper?” He denies he has any responsibility to his brother.
Next, the Torah tells us about Noaḥ and the Flood. Noaḥ is described as a pure and righteous man, and therefore God decided to save him and his family. Noaḥ was righteous but not a hero. He only saved himself, not humanity. Noaḥ did not see himself as responsible for their fate.
Finally, in the story of the Tower of Bavel, although we know it was a great sin, it isn’t clear what the sin was. By trying to build a tower that would “<i>reach heaven</i>,” the builders of Bavel wanted to take the place of God. They denied they had a responsibility to listen to and follow God.
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. Which word or theme connects these four stories?</i>
<i>2. How is this word applied differently in each story?</i>
<i>3. What does that word mean to you for your life?</i>
<b><i>It Once Happened…</i></b><br><i>This is a story about four people named Everybody, Somebody, Anybody, and Nobody.</i>
<i>There was an important job to be done and Everybody was sure that Somebody would do it. Anybody could have done it, but Nobody did it. Somebody got angry about that, because it was Everybody’s job. Everybody thought Anybody could do it, but Nobody realised that Everybody wouldn’t do it.</i>
<i>It ended up that Everybody blamed Somebody when Nobody did what Anybody could have done.</i>
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. What do you think is the message of this story?</i>
<i>2. Can you think of a way you can apply this message in your life in the coming week?</i>
<b><i>Thinking More Deeply</i></b><br>Let’s look at those four stories from the beginning of the book of Bereshit in more depth.
In the first story, once Adam and Ḥava have eaten the forbidden fruit, they discover shame, and God asks them what they have done. This is the conversation that follows:
<i>And He said, “Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten from the tree that I commanded you not to eat from?” The man said, “The woman you put here with me – she gave me some fruit from the tree, and I ate it.” Then the Lord God said to the woman, “What is this you have done?” The woman said, “The serpent deceived me, and I ate.”</i>
The man blames the woman; the woman blames the serpent. Both deny <b>personal responsibility</b>: it wasn’t me; it wasn’t my fault. This is the birth of what today is called the victim culture.
The second drama, following the first murder in history, has a similar dialogue but with one important difference:
<i>Then the Lord said to Kayin, “Where is your brother Hevel?” “I don’t know,” he replied. “Am I my brother’s keeper?” The Lord said, “What have you done? Listen! Your brother’s blood cries out to Me from the ground.”</i>
Once again, the theme is responsibility, but in a different sense. Kayin does not deny personal responsibility. He does not say, “It wasn’t me.” He denies <b>moral responsibility</b>. <i>“I am not my brother’s keeper.”</i> I am not responsible for his safety. Yes, I did it because I felt like it. Kayin has not yet learned the difference between “I can” and “I may.”
The third story, that of Noaḥ, also has responsibility at its core. Noaḥ is a righteous man but not a hero. He is born to great expectations. “He will comfort us,” says his father Lemekh, giving him his name. Yet Noaḥ does not save humanity. He only saves himself, his family, and the animals he takes with him in the ark. The Zohar contrasts him unfavourably with Moshe: Moshe prayed for his generation; Noaḥ did not. We have to do what we can to save others, not just ourselves. Noaḥ failed the test of <b>collective responsibility</b>.
The fourth is the story of the Tower of Bavel. What was the sin of its builders? The story of Bavel is a drama about the two key words of the first sentence of the Torah:<i> “In the beginning God created heaven and earth.”</i> Heaven is the domain of God; earth is the domain of man. By attempting to build a tower that would “<i>reach heaven</i>,” the builders of Bavel were men trying to be like gods. What does this have to do with responsibility?
Not accidentally does the word responsibility suggest response-ability. The Hebrew equivalent, <i>aḥrayut</i>, comes from the word <i>aḥer</i>, meaning “an other.” Responsibility is always a response to something or someone. In Judaism, it means response to the command of God. By attempting to reach heaven, the builders of Bavel were in effect saying: We are going to take the place of God. We are not going to respond to His law or respect His boundaries. We are going to create an environment where we rule, not God. Bavel is the failure of <b>ontological responsibility</b> – the idea that something beyond us makes a call on us (ontology is the study of the nature of being).
What we see in these stories is an exceptionally tightly constructed four-act drama on the theme of responsibility and moral development. The first thing we learn as a child is that our acts are under our control (<b>personal responsibility</b>). The next is that not everything we can do may we do (<b>moral responsibility</b>). The next stage is the realisation that we have a duty not just to ourselves but also to others around us (<b>collective responsibility</b>). Ultimately, we learn that morality is not something that humans invent, but it is part of the universe that has a creator. There is an Authority beyond mankind (<b>ontological responsibility</b>).
<b><i>From the Thought of Rabbi Sacks</i></b><br>This was perhaps the greatest contribution of Judaism – via the Judaic roots of Christianity – to the West. The idea that time is an arena of change, and that freedom and creativity are God’s gift to humanity, resulted in astonishing advances in science and our understanding of the world, technology and our ability to control the human environment, economics and our ability to lift people out of poverty and starvation, medicine and our ability to cure disease. It led to the abolition of slavery, the growth of a more egalitarian society, the enhanced position of women, and the emergence of democracy and liberalism….
To be a Jew is to be an agent of hope. Every ritual, every command, every syllable of the Jewish story is a protest against escapism, resignation, and the blind acceptance of fate. Judaism, the religion of the free God, is a religion of freedom. Jewish faith is written in the future tense. It is belief in a future that is not yet but could be, if we heed God’s call, obey His will, and act together as a covenantal community. The name of the Jewish future is hope….
Jews were and are still called on to be the voice of hope in the conversation of humankind.
<b><i>Future Tense</i>, 249–252</b>
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. Where in the Torah and in Judaism do we see the idea that Jewish time is linear (where the future can be different, and better, than the past)? What is the alternative way of looking at the world?</i>
<i>2. How does this text connect to the ideas about responsibility found in this</i> Covenant &amp; Conversation <i>essay?</i>
<b><i>Around the Shabbat Table</i></b><br>Where do you think morality comes from? If God did not give us a moral framework through the Torah, do you think humanity would be able to work it out for themselves?
Noaḥ is compared unfavourably to Avraham, who did try and save those condemned (Sedom and Amora), as opposed to Noaḥ, who just obeyed God’s command and saved himself and his family by building an ark. Do you think this is fair?
Why do you think the first eleven chapters of Bereshit tell us these four stories and explore these four kinds of responsibility?
<b>EDUCATIONAL COMPANION TO THE QUESTIONS</b>
<b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>Responsibility. Each of the four stories revolves around a different kind of responsibility.
Each story focuses on a different type of responsibility, which Rabbi Sacks suggests (in the main <i>Covenant &amp; Conversation</i> essay, “A Drama in Four Acts”) is similar to the four developmental stages of a child as they develop and mature. These are: (a) personal responsibility; (b) moral responsibility; (c) collective responsibility; and (d) ontological responsibility.
Encourage your child/student to reflect on what they think responsibility means, where it comes from (as in when and why they have to be responsible), and when in their lives it is an important concept. Encourage them to formulate concrete examples from their own everyday life.
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br>The message of this story is taking responsibility. It is a humorous take on what can happen when no one takes responsibility for something that needs doing in a group setting. We should be encouraging our children/students to be the person willing to do the task, even if they are surrounded by people who are refusing to step up and take responsibility.
Encourage your child/student to think of a time in the coming week when they will have the opportunity to step up and take responsibility.
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>The Torah itself (both the<i> Ḥumash</i> and the rest of Tanakh) tells a story, with many twists in the plot. Although some argue (Rabbi Sacks among them – see his book <i>Future Tense</i>) that the Torah is unique as a genre that does not come to closure and lacks a conclusion or the fulfilment of the narrative, it still progresses in the direction of a conclusion. This conclusion could be living as a nation safely and comfortably in our own land, worshipping God, or it could be a future Messianic age of world peace, or perhaps something else. But whatever our final destination is, the Torah as a philosophical text is built around the premise that the future will be different, and better, than the past. This concept exists in Jewish philosophy and theology as well. The Messianic concept, and the imperative of <i>tikkun olam</i> (mending the world), suggest that for Jews and Judaism, things can and will be better in the future, if we work hard enough to make it that way. The concept of <i>teshuva</i> (repentance) means we always have the possibility to make ourselves and the world better. Other systems of thought disagree with this and believe in fatalism. Destiny cannot be changed, and we are set to play out specific narratives, predetermined either by “the gods” (Greek mythology) or our genes (some evolutionary scientists) or our early childhood experiences (Freudian psychology). Judaism challenges this way of looking at the world.
This source introduces a fifth kind of responsibility – <b>national responsibility</b>. This is a central concept in the thought of Rabbi Sacks. The Jewish people have a national mission, to be agents of hope and light in the world, and to help bring the world to a better and redeemed state (<i>tikkun olam</i>).
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>This is a complex question with many answers and positions both within and from outside of Jewish thought. The question aims to generate a discussion around your Shabbat table where people can share their gut reaction to this complex question – is morality innate and intuitive, or does humanity need guidance from the outside (i.e., God)? Be sure to bring the stories from Bereshit (and other parts of Tanakh) to illustrate and develop the discussion.
Some thoughts to consider: Do we all have the responsibility for leadership or does this depend on the acquisition of a specific skill set and an innate nature? Maybe Noaḥ just did not have the leadership ability that Avraham had? If God had wanted Noaḥ to take on a leadership role, He could have called him to this responsibility, like He did with Moshe (who was reluctant to take the leadership mantle and left to his own devices it seems would not have stepped up). Having said that, God did command Avraham, and yet Avraham is celebrated for his initiative and leadership.
The first few chapters explore and present an ontology of the human – what it means to be a human. After chapter 11, the Torah then turns its attention to the story of the Jewish people, and the rest of the book explores what it means to be a Jew – the ontology of the Jew. So these four stories are critical in understanding the moral development of humanity, and should encourage us to be aware of these four stages of moral development.

In a Nutshell

<b><i>IN A NUTSHELL</i></b><br>God speaks to Avraham for the first time and tells him to leave his father’s house and the land of his birth and childhood. He and his wife Sara leave without hesitation and set off on their journey to a new land and a new kind of faith – and so begins the adventure of Jewish history, with the land of Israel as its central focus.
Avraham and Sara experience some setbacks on the way. There is a famine in Israel and they have to go to Egypt for a time. Then there is an argument between Avraham and his nephew Lot, and the two part ways.
When Lot is captured in a local war, Avraham fights a battle to free him.
God then makes a covenant (an agreement) with Avraham, promising him that he will have a child who will be the next link in the generations that will become the Jewish people. The sign of this covenant is <i>brit mila</i>.
<b>QUESTION TO PONDER</b>
<i>Can you think of any stories from Avraham’s life that show us why God chose Avraham to be the first Jew?</i>

I; A Palace In Flames

<big><strong>I. A Palace In Flames</strong></big><br><b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>Why Avraham? That is the first question we must ask. He is the key figure in the story of our faith, the father of our nation, the hero of monotheism, important not only to Jews but to Christians and Muslims also. Yet there seems to be nothing in the Torah’s description of his early life to give us a hint as to why he was singled out to be the founder of our faith.
This is very strange. The Torah leaves us in no doubt as to why God chose Noaḥ: “Noaḥ was a righteous man, blameless in his generations; Noaḥ walked with God.” It also gives us a clear indication as to why God chose Moshe. We see him as a young man, both in Egypt and Midyan, intervening whenever he saw injustice. These were obviously extraordinary people. There is no such suggestion in the case of Avraham. So the Sages, commentators, and philosophers through the ages were forced to speculate, to fill in the glaring gap in the narrative, offering their own suggestions as to what made Avraham different.
There are two primary explanations. The first is <i>Avraham the iconoclast, the breaker of idols</i>. Avraham’s father Teraḥ was an idol worshipper. According to the Midrash, he made and sold idols. One day Avraham smashed all the idols, leaving the stick he used in the hand of the biggest idol. When his father queried who had broken his gods, Avraham blamed the biggest idol. “Are you making fun of me?” demanded his father. “Idols cannot do anything.” “In that case,” asked the young Avraham, “why do you worship them?”
Avraham was the first person to challenge the idols of the age. Jews, believers or otherwise, have often been iconoclasts (willing to confront accepted beliefs). Some of the most revolutionary thinkers – certainly in the modern age – have been Jews. They had the courage to challenge the accepted wisdom, think new thoughts, and see the world in new ways. It is as if, deep in our cultural-intellectual DNA, we had internalised what the Sages said about Avraham <i>haIvri</i>, “the Hebrew,” that it meant he was on one side and all the rest of the world on the other.
The second view is set out by Rambam in the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>: <i>Avraham the philosopher</i>. In an age when people had lost their way and fallen into idolatry, one person stood against the trend, the young Avraham who, when still a child, asked: “How is it possible that this planet should continuously be in motion and have no mover?” Rambam notes that “he had no teacher, no one to instruct him…until he attained the way of truth and knew that there is One God…. When Avraham was forty years old, he recognised his Creator.” According to this, Avraham was the first person to think his way through to God as the force that moves the sun and all the stars.
What was unique about Avraham according to both these approaches is that he saw the world differently from everyone else and had the courage to ask the questions, find the truth, and live his life accordingly.
IT ONCE HAPPENED…
<i>In the late summer of 1999, I was in Pristina making a television programme about the aftermath of the Kosovo campaign. Outside every church was a NATO tank. At the start of the conflict it had been the Serbian Christians who had attacked mosques. Now they feared reprisals from the returning refugees. The mood was tense. Murders were taking place every night. Revenge was in the air. The most important task was to establish order and a return to civil peace.</i>
<i>I interviewed General Sir Michael Jackson, then head of the NATO forces. To my surprise, he thanked me for what “my people” had done. The Jewish community had taken charge of the city’s twenty-three primary schools. It was, he said, the most valuable contribution to the city’s welfare. When 800,000 people have become refugees and then return home, the most reassuring sign that life has returned to normal is that the schools open on time. This he credited to the Jewish people. Meeting the head of the Jewish community later that day, I asked him how many Jews were there currently living in Pristina. His answer? Eleven.</i>
<i>The story, as I later uncovered it, was fascinating. In the early days of the conflict, the State of Israel had, along with many international aid agencies, sent a field medical team to work with the Kosovan Albanian refugees. Immediately they noticed something others had missed. The aid agencies were concentrating, not unnaturally, on the adults. There was no one working with the children. Traumatised by the conflict and far from home, they were running around and feeling lost.</i>
<i>The team phoned back to Israel and asked for young volunteers. Virtually every youth group in Israel, from the most secular to the most religious, sent out teams of youth leaders at two-week intervals. They worked with the children, organising summer camps, sports competitions, drama and music events, and everything else they could think of to make their temporary exile feel like a summer holiday. At all levels, it was an extraordinary effort. The Kosovan Albanians were Muslims, and for many of the Israeli youth workers, it was their first contact and friendship with children of another faith. Their effort won high praise from UNICEF, the United Nations children’s organisation. It was in the wake of this that “the Jewish people” – Israel, the American-based “Joint,” and other Jewish agencies – were asked to supervise the return to normality of the school system in Pristina.</i>
<i>That episode taught me many things: the power of</i> ḥesed<i>, acts of kindness; the beauty and healing power of kindness extended across the borders of faith; and the way young people can rise to great moral achievements if we set them a challenge. The entire relief effort in Kosovo was a wonderful convergence of many people and agencies, from many faiths and nations.</i>
<b><i>Thinking More Deeply</i></b><br>There is a third explanation of why Avraham was chosen by God, and it is set out in a midrash on the opening verse of our <i>parasha</i>:
<i>“The Lord said to Avram: Leave your land, your birthplace and your father’s house</i>….<i>” To what may this be compared? To a man who was travelling from place to place when he saw a palace in flames. He wondered, “Is it possible that the palace lacks an owner?” The owner of the palace looked out and said, “I am the owner of the palace.” So Avraham our father said, “Is it possible that the world lacks a ruler?” The Holy One, blessed be He, looked out and said to him, “I am the Ruler, the Sovereign of the universe.”</i>
This is a mysterious midrash. It is far from obvious what it means. In my book <i>A Letter in the Scroll</i> (published in Britain as <i>Radical Then, Radical Now</i>) I argued that Avraham was struck by the contradiction between the order of the universe – the palace – and the disorder of humanity – the flames. How, in a world created by a good God, could there be so much evil? If someone takes the trouble to build a palace, do they leave it to the flames? If someone takes the trouble to create a universe, does He leave it to be disfigured by His own creations? On this reading, what moved Avraham was not philosophical harmony but moral discord. For Avraham, faith began in cognitive dissonance. There is only one way of resolving this dissonance: by protesting evil and fighting it.
That is the poignant meaning of the midrash when it says that the owner of the palace looked out and said, “I am the owner of the palace.” It is as if God were saying to Avraham: <i>I need you to help Me to put out the flames.</i>
How could that possibly be so? God is all-powerful. Human beings are all too powerless. How could God be saying to Avraham, “I need you to help Me put out the flames”?
The answer is that <i>evil exists because God gave humans the gift of freedom</i>. Without freedom, we would not disobey God’s laws. But at the same time, we would be no more than robots, programmed to do whatever our Creator designed us to do. Freedom and its misuse are the theme of Adam and Ḥava, Kayin and Hevel, and the generation of the Flood.
Why did God not intervene? Why did He not stop the first humans eating the forbidden fruit, or prevent Kayin from killing Hevel? Why did the owner of the palace not put out the flames?
Because, by giving us freedom, He bound Himself from intervening in the human situation. If He stopped us every time we were about to do wrong, we would have no freedom. We would never mature, never learn from our errors, never become God’s image. We exist as free agents only because of God’s <i>tzimtzum</i>, His self-limitation. That is why, within the terms with which He created humankind, He cannot put out the flames of human evil.
He needs our help. That is why He chose Avraham. <i>Avraham was the first person in recorded history to protest the injustice of the world in the name of God, rather than accept it in the name of God.</i> Avraham was the man who said, “Shall the Judge of all the earth not do justice?” Where Noaḥ accepted, Avraham did not. Avraham is the man of whom God said, “I have chosen him, so that he will direct his children and his household after him to keep the way of the Lord by doing what is right and just.” Avraham was the father of a nation, a faith, a civilisation, marked throughout the ages by what Albert Einstein called “an almost fanatical love of justice.”
<b>I believe that Avraham is the father of faith, not as acceptance but as protest – protest at the flames that threaten the palace, the evil that threatens God’s gracious world. We fight those flames by acts of justice and compassion that deny evil its victory and bring the world that <i>is</i> a little closer to the world that <i>ought to be</i>.</b>
<b>QUESTION TO PONDER</b>
<i>How does Judaism today continue the legacy of Avraham, demonstrating “faith as protest” and partnering with God to “put out the fire” of evil?</i>
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>Judaism begins not in wonder that the world is, but in protest that the world is not as it ought to be. It is in that cry, that sacred discontent, that Avraham’s journey begins…. The easy answer would be to deny the reality of either God or evil. Then the contradiction would disappear and we could live at peace with the world. But to be a Jew is to have the courage to refuse easy answers and to reject either consolation or despair. God exists; therefore life has a purpose. Evil exists; therefore we have not yet achieved that purpose. Until then we must travel, just as Avraham and Sara travelled, to begin the task of shaping a different kind of world.
<b><i>A Letter in the Scroll</i>, 57–58</b>
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>What are the three different approaches given to answer the question, “Why Avraham?” Which of the three do you find most inspiring?
What do the palace and the fire represent in the quoted midrash? Are they a contradiction to each other?
Who has to put out the fire? How?
<b>EDUCATIONAL COMPANION TO THE QUESTIONS</b>
<b><i>IN A NUTSHELL</i></b><br>Although the Torah does not give us any details about Avraham’s early life before he was chosen, we can answer this question retroactively by searching through the many stories about his life after he received the call from God. There are so many directions to be taken, but if we were to focus on just the themes explored in this <i>Covenant &amp; Conversation</i> essay, then the stories when Avraham challenged his father about idol worship (we see this in the midrash), and argued with God to save Sedom and Amora, and the <i>Akeida</i> (Binding of Yitzḥak) are good places to start. Avraham was also known for his <i>ḥesed</i> (kindness) and hospitality, as well as his commitment to education. These are all indicators of the qualities God saw in Avraham when He chose him.
<b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>We all experience peer pressure, children and adults alike. We also experience pressure from the norms of the society in which we live (which is also a form of peer pressure), and these are sometimes at odds with our religious or personal values. Finding real examples from our lives helps us to understand the courage and commitment that Avraham models for us.
Judaism’s values are often at odds with the norms of society. For example, our society is becoming more and more individualistic, and while Judaism does honour the rights of the individual (and in fact brought this idea to the world in an age when this was unheard of), Judaism also places great value on family, community, and peoplehood.
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br>The efforts made by these young Jews to help children in a terrible situation in a war-ravaged country is a great example of continuing the legacy of Avraham, who partnered God in fighting the evil in the world, making the world a more perfect place (see <i>Thinking More Deeply</i>).
The palace in flames in the midrash represents the evil and chaos created by humans in the world that God created. This story takes place against a backdrop that describes just that. When Avraham asks why no one is putting out the fire, God extends His hand and says, “Join Me in this task.” This story shows young Jews fighting the flames of war and disaster, helping the victims to rebuild their lives.
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>Jews have always been at the forefront of improving the world, making it a better place for humanity to live, through scientific and technological innovation, fighting for justice, and social activism. Such actions are all inspired by the core values of the Torah.
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>The three approaches are:
<i>Avraham the iconoclast, the breaker of idols</i>
<i>Avraham the philosopher</i>
<i>Avraham, God’s partner in the task of</i> tikkun olam<i> (fixing the world)</i>
The palace is the orderly and beautiful world God created. The fire is the chaos (and evil) humans create. Some (fundamental religious thinkers, for example) believe there is no contradiction because God creates the fire, for reasons we sometimes cannot understand, but normally to punish us. Some (for example, atheist scientists) believe there is no contradiction because there is no real order or plan to the universe, only random chance. Judaism refuses to say there is no injustice and evil (it is created by our exercising free will), while still believing that there is order to the universe (God as Creator, who acts in history).
It is humanity’s job to join God in partnership to put out the flames. The Torah is a manual on building a society based on the values that will help us to put out the flames and bring the world to a redeemed state (<i>tikkun olam</i>).

II; Four Dimensions of the Journey

<big><strong>II. Four Dimensions of the Journey</strong></big><br><b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>Our <i>parasha</i> begins with the puzzling words <i>lekh lekha</i> as God commands Avraham to leave his birthplace and settle in the land of Israel. The words literally mean “Go to yourself,” and as this is a confusing phrase, many of the commentators interpret it differently. Here are four possible interpretations:
1. Rashi has a tradition that the words mean “Journey for yourself.” According to him, God is saying, “Travel for your own benefit and good. There I will make you into a great nation.” Sometimes we have to let go of our past in order to embrace the future and trust in God’s plan. Avraham was about to say goodbye to the things that mean most to us – land, birthplace, and parental home, the places where we belong. He was about to make a journey from the familiar to the unfamiliar, a leap into the unknown. At the end of it, however, Avraham would discover that he had achieved something he could not have done otherwise. “Go for yourself ” – believe in what you can become.
2. The Midrash takes the phrase to mean “Go with yourself” – meaning, by travelling from place to place, you will extend your influence not over one land but many. Avraham was commanded to leave his place to show that God was not limited to one place (as many believed their ancient gods were). Avraham’s God was Creator and Sovereign of the entire universe. Avraham and Sara were to be like perfume, leaving a trace of their presence wherever they went. <i>Lekh lekha</i> according to the Midrash means “Go with yourself ” – your beliefs, your way of life, your faith.
3. A more mystical interpretation takes the phrase to mean “Go to yourself” – take a journey of self-discovery. Avraham was being asked to leave behind all the things that make us someone else – for it is only by taking a long and lonely journey that we discover who we truly are. “Go to yourself.”
4. There is, however, a fourth interpretation: “Go by yourself.” Only a person willing to stand alone, singular and unique, can worship the God who is alone, singular, and unique. Only one able to leave behind the things we are born into that influence who we become – home, family, culture, and society – can form a relationship with God, who stands above and beyond nature.
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. Do these four interpretations have anything in common with each other?</i>
<i>2. Which of the four interpretations of the words</i> Lekh lekha<i> do you like most?</i>
<i>3. What are the things that make you who you are? How much of this is nature (from within you) vs. nurture (outside factors influencing you)?</i>
<b><i>It Once Happened…</i></b><br><i>When Reb Zusha of Hanipol was lying on his deathbed, surrounded by his Hasidim, he began to softly weep. His students also began to cry and through their tears they called out: “Reb Zusha, Reb Zusha, why do you weep? You are about to meet your Creator and be welcomed home into</i> shamayim<i> (heaven) as a</i> tzaddik<i> (righteous man).”</i>
<i>The old and frail Rebbe slowly shook his head. “My Hasidim, I fear what the heavenly court will ask me,” he gently whispered. The men surrounding his bed rocked back and forth in puzzlement. “What could you possibly fear, our great and holy leader?” they questioned him. He replied, “I fear not that the court will ask me why I did not manage to become an Avraham, or a Yaakov, or a Moshe, for who could reach the level of our saintly forefathers? But I fear they will ask me a much harder question. What will I answer if they ask me: Reb Zusha, why did you not become a Zusha?!”</i>
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. What do you think is the message of this story?</i>
<i>2. How can we find out our true potential? What do you think your potential is?</i>
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br><i>Lekh lekha</i> means: Leave behind you all that makes human beings predictable and unfree. Leave behind the social forces, the familial pressures, the circumstances of your birth. Avraham’s children were summoned to be the people who defied the laws of nature because they refused to define themselves as the products of nature. That is not to say that economic or biological or psychological forces have no part to play in human behaviour. They do. But with sufficient imagination, determination, discipline, and courage we can rise above them. Avraham did. So, at most times, did his children.
Those who live within the laws of history are subject to the laws of history. Whatever is natural, said Rambam, is subject to disintegration and decline. That is what has happened to virtually every civilisation that has appeared on the world’s stage. Avraham, however, was to become the father of an <i>am olam</i>, an eternal people, that would neither decay nor decline, a people willing to stand outside the laws of nature. For other nations, land, home, and family are a given. They precede the nation. In Judaism, however, these are subjects of religious command. They have to be worked at. They involve a journey. They are not given at the outset, and must not be taken for granted. Avraham was to leave behind the things that make most people what they are, and lay the foundations for a land, a Jewish home, and a family structure.
<i>Lekh lekha</i> in this sense means being prepared to take an often lonely journey: “Go by yourself.” To be a child of Avraham is to have the courage to be different, to challenge the idols of the age, whatever the idols and whichever the age. In an era of polytheism when there are many gods, it meant believing in one Creator who is also the God of history – life is therefore not meaningless but meaningful. In an era of slavery it meant refusing to accept the status quo in the name of God, but instead challenging it in the name of God. When power was worshipped, it meant constructing a society that cared for the powerless, the widow, orphan, and stranger. During centuries in which the mass of mankind was sunk in ignorance, it meant honouring education as the key to human dignity and creating schools to provide universal literacy. When war was the test of manhood, it meant striving for peace. In ages of radical individualism like today, it means knowing that we are not what we own but what we share; not what we buy but what we give; that there is something higher than appetite and desire – namely the call that comes to us, as it came to Avraham, from outside ourselves, summoning us to make a contribution to the world.
To be a Jew is to have the courage to travel alone if necessary, to be different, to swim against the tide, to speak in an age of relativism of the absolutes of human dignity under the sovereignty of God that was born in the words <i>lekh lekha</i>. To be a Jew is to be willing to hear the still small voice of eternity urging us to travel, move, go on ahead, continuing Avraham’s journey towards that unknown destination at the far horizon of hope.
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>Avraham was not a king or a warrior, or a man of superhuman strength. For the most part he and Sara lived quietly, far from the arenas of power and fame. What was special about them was that they had the courage to be different. They did not worship the idols of their time, but instead pledged their loyalty to the one God, Creator of heaven and earth. When their neighbours were threatened, they prayed for them and fought for them. But they did not live like their neighbours. They had their own values. They kept to “the way of God, doing charity and justice.” This was the way they taught the members of their household and their son Yitzḥak. Unlike those around them, they did not worship nature or power, they did not believe that the world was simply the arena of blind and clashing forces, and they rejected the myths and pagan practices of their time. As later tradition put it, “The whole world was on one side, and they were on the other.” There were times when their faith was put to the test, but they persevered, staying true to the voice they had heard.
Jews were always a tiny people, yet our ancestors survived by believing that eternity is found in the simple lives of ordinary human beings. They found God in homes, families, and relationships. They worshipped God in synagogues, the first places ever to become holy because of the mere fact that people gathered there to pray. They discovered God in the human heart and in our capacity to make the world different by what we do. They encountered God, not in the wind or the thunder or the earthquake but in words, the words of Torah, the marriage contract between God and the people He took as His own. They studied those words endlessly and tried to put them into practice. They brought heaven down to earth, because they believed that God lives wherever we dedicate our lives to Him.
And somehow that small people did great things. They produced some of the greatest visionaries the world has ever known. They transformed the civilisation of the West, teaching it to abandon myth and magic and see human history as the long, slow journey to freedom and justice…. They held firm to the belief that God had a purpose for humanity and that the Jewish people had a unique role in bringing it about…. The Jewish people would be the bearers of God’s presence in a sometimes godless, often unjust and violent world. In eras that worshipped the collective – the nation, the state, the empire – they spoke about the dignity and sanctity of the individual. In cultures that celebrated the right of the individual to do his or her own thing, they spoke of law and duty and mutual responsibility…. The Jews, therefore, stand right at the centre of the perennial attempt to give human life the dignity of a purpose.
<b><i>A Letter in the Scroll, 51–54</i></b>
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>What are the things that make us who we are? Did God ask Avraham to move away from any of these? Why?
The journey Avraham took was from the most developed society at that time (Mesopotamia) to an underdeveloped obscure part of the world (Canaan). Having read this <i>Covenant &amp; Conversation</i> essay, can you suggest a message we can learn from this journey?
Do you think Judaism is counter-cultural today? Can you give examples of how?
<b>EDUCATIONAL COMPANION TO THE QUESTIONS</b>
<b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>Each of the four interpretations assumes there is some benefit in Avraham leaving his birthplace (the command is not just for its own sake but rather has some benefit to it). This could be of direct benefit to Avraham himself (interpretations 1 and 3) or to the world (interpretation 2). The final interpretation seems like it is to benefit both Avraham and God, who will have a stronger relationship through the result of the journey (interpretation 4), but in fact the final message of this <i>Covenant &amp; Conversation</i> essay is that Avraham going “by himself” will ultimately be for the benefit of the world.
Each one has something to teach us. The final interpretation is Rabbi Sacks’s own, and the message of this <i>Covenant &amp; Conversation</i> essay is based on it.
We are a mixture of our own genetic selves (which in itself is also influenced by who our parents are, but not fully determined by this) together with the influences from our upbringing and the society around us. This is the classic nature (genetics) vs. nurture (social influences) debate. Judaism believes firmly that we have free choice to be whoever we want to be, and we are not limited by either our nature (genetics) or our nurture (our social milieu and upbringing). This is one of the messages of Avraham’s journey – the journey meant that he would not be defined by who his family was or which country he lived in.
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br>The message of this classic hasidic story is that each and every one of us has our own potential and our own destiny. We are not expected to be someone we are not, but we are expected to live up to our full potential. God has a plan for each one of us and it is our life’s journey to discover this and become the best people we can be.
This is the hardest question, and from the story we can see that even at the end of our life we may not know the answer. But the journey is the story of our life and we are the only people who can make that journey and answer that question.
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>Judaism and Jews have always lived apart and walked a different path. Rabbi Sacks gives examples of Torah values by which Jews have lived throughout the centuries, as well as individual Jewish contributions to society throughout history that have been contrary to the accepted wisdom of the time. These are examples of how the Jewish people have inherited this approach to life from Avraham – not to follow the masses or the fads and trends of the time, but rather to live our lives and build a society based on the eternal values of the Torah, even when they are at odds with what is popular and the accepted norms of society at that time.
Judaism’s values have often been at odds with the norms of society and this has never been truer than in this generation. Today’s radical individualism and deep materialism can be viewed as antithetical to many of Judaism’s core values. We need to have the courage to take tough positions, even if these are unpopular and difficult messages for society to hear.
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>By the time we become adults, we have been influenced by many factors from our upbringing, including the way our parents and parent community have brought us up, as well as the societal influences that have influenced us. But as adults we blaze our own path and decide how we want to live our lives. Often this will include the values we were exposed to in our parents’ house, but not necessarily. Avraham heard the call of God and took a different path in life.
Journeys of migration in history normally follow the same pattern – an upwardly mobile economic direction. Avraham’s journey, however, was in the opposite direction. Mesopotamia was the most developed society in the world at that time, culturally and economically. Avraham’s migration pattern is not logical. However, the message inherent in it is that the values of the economic and cultural giant of Mesopotamia were at odds with the values by which God wanted Avraham and his descendants to live. This was the message in his journey. The other great migration in Tanakh, the Exodus from Egypt, has a similar message.
While many of the values that our Western liberal democracies are built on are not only compatible with, but in fact come from biblical Judaism, our societies have taken many of these values to an extreme. The radical individualism and materialism in the West today are, many would argue, antithetical to many of Judaism’s core values. Judaism is the national code of how to build a society based on the values of the dignity of each human being, with a particular focus on protecting the weak in society. These values are often in contrast with the direction society is taking today.

Vayera

In a Nutshell

<b><i>IN A NUTSHELL</i></b><br>In this <i>parasha,</i> three strangers pass by Avraham’s tent. What Avraham and Sara do not know is that they are in fact angels. Avraham offers them food and a place to rest. One of them tells Avraham that Sara will have a baby, and Sara, who is listening in, laughs because she believes she is far too old to have children.
Next, God tells Avraham about His plan to punish the people of Sedom because they are behaving so wickedly. Avraham is worried that innocent people in Sedom could suffer too, and argues with God that He must save the city if that is true. With real (and never-before-seen) chutzpah he argues that God must take justice into account! God agrees that if ten innocent men can be found, He will spare the city (but unfortunately, even this deal does not save Sedom). Two of the angels visit Avraham’s nephew, Lot, in Sedom to rescue him and his family before the city is destroyed.
The baby promised to Avraham and Sara is born and they name him Yitzḥak. At the end of the <i>parasha</i> the Torah tells the famous story of <i>Akeidat Yitzḥak</i>, the “Binding of Yitzḥak.”
<b>QUESTION TO PONDER</b>
<i>Where in this</i> parasha<i> can we see examples of Avraham’s faith in God?</i>

I; Negative Capability

<big><strong>I. Negative Capability</strong></big><br><b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>Why does God ask Avraham to sacrifice Yitzḥak? What does this test teach him, and us? Traditionally, we learn that this was a test of Avraham’s love for God, above even his love for his son. But the Torah believes that child sacrifice is one of the worst of evils. Had the point of the trial been Avraham’s willingness to sacrifice his son, then Avraham would have proven he was no better than the idolaters of his time, who often sacrificed children to the gods.
In fact, Avraham’s very essence was to be a model father. The name Avram means “mighty father.” God then changed his name to Avraham, signifying “father of many nations.” Avraham was chosen to be a role model of fatherhood. A model father does not sacrifice his child.
The classic interpretation that Avraham loved God more than he loved his own son, while powerful, contradicts all of this. This trial tested Avraham’s faith to the limit. But what was the true nature of the test?
Perhaps the true test was facing the contradiction between God’s promises and the reality. God had promised Avraham that through Yitzḥak he would have many descendants who would become a great nation. And then God demanded he sacrifice him as a youth.
The trial was therefore <i>not</i> to see whether Avraham had the courage to sacrifice his son. The trial was to see whether Avraham could live with what seemed to be a clear contradiction between God’s word now, and God’s previous promises. <i>Could Avraham live with uncertainty and maintain his faith?</i>
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. Why does Rabbi Sacks believe that God was not testing Avraham merely to see if he would sacrifice Yitzĥak?</i>
<i>2. What was God testing, and what was the message Avraham (and we) must learn from it?</i>
<b><i>It Once Happened…</i></b><br><i>This is the love story of a boy called Yisrael and a girl called Tziyona. Yisrael was new in town – he and his family came from far away. Tziyona was kind to the boy, helping him to settle in the new school, and they very quickly became close friends. As young children, they were inseparable. They played together all the time, looked out for each other, and as they grew up, they gradually fell in love.</i>
<i>But then the devastating news arrived. Yisrael and his family had to move again to a new place, far, far away. Yisrael and Tziyona would have to face life apart. They did not know if they would ever see each other again. As they parted with tears in their eyes, they promised that they would never forget their love.</i>
<i>Yisrael and Tziyona never stopped thinking about each other and dreaming of the day when they might see each other again. They continued to hope and pray for the day when their paths would cross once more and they could be reunited. Over the years, their love did not lessen or die. No matter where their lives took them, or what adventures they had while apart, they each continued to think of the other every day, and prayed to be together again.</i>
<i>This story has a happy ending! The prayers of Yisrael and Tziyona were answered and their hopes were realised. They found each other as adults, and fell in love all over again. Today Yisrael and Tziyona live happily together, once again united in their love.</i>
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. What do you think was the hardest aspect of their lives during the period when Yisrael and Tziyona were apart?</i>
<i>2. Who do Yisrael and Tziyona represent? What is the connection between this story and the message of this</i> Covenant &amp; Conversation<i> essay?</i>
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>One of the most perplexing features of the Avraham story is the disconnect between God’s promises and the reality. Seven times, God promised Avraham the land. Yet when Sara died, he owned not even a burial plot and had to buy one at an exorbitant price.
At the very opening of the story, God promised him, “I will make you into a great nation, and I will bless you.” Without protest or hesitation, Avraham left his home as instructed and began the journey to the land of Canaan. He came to Shekhem and built an altar there. He moved on to Beit El and built an altar there as well. Then almost immediately we read that “there was a famine in the land.”
Avraham and his household were forced to go to Egypt. There, he found that his life was at risk. He asked Sara to pretend to be his sister rather than his wife, thus putting her in a false position (conduct which Ramban intensely criticised). Where, at that moment, was the divine blessing? How was it that, leaving his land and following God’s call, Avraham found himself in a morally dangerous situation where he was forced to choose between asking his wife to live a lie and exposing himself to the probability, perhaps certainty, of his own death?
A pattern is beginning to emerge. <i>Avraham was learning that there is a long and winding road between promise and fulfilment</i>. Not because God does not keep His word, but because Avraham and his descendants were charged with bringing something new into the world. A sacred society. A nation formed by covenant. An abandonment of idolatry. A significant code of conduct. A more intimate relationship with God than any people has ever known. It would become a nation of pioneers. And God was teaching Avraham from the very beginning that this demands extraordinary strength of character, because nothing great and transformative happens overnight in the human world. You have to keep going, even if you are tired and lost, exhausted and despondent.
God will bring about everything He promised. But not immediately. And not directly. God seeks change in the real world of everyday lives. And He seeks those who have the tenacity of faith to keep going despite all the setbacks. That is what the life of Avraham was about.
Nowhere was this clearer than in relation to God’s promise of children. Four times, God spoke about this to Avraham:
1. “I will make you into a great nation, and I will bless you” (Bereshit 12:2).
2. “I will make your offspring like the dust of the earth, so that if anyone could count the dust, then your offspring could be counted” (Bereshit 13:16).
3. “Look up at the sky and count the stars – if indeed you can count them.” Then He said to him, “So shall your offspring be” (Bereshit 15:5).
4. “No longer will you be called Avram; your name will be Avraham, for I have made you a father of many nations. I will make you very fruitful; I will make nations of you, and kings will come from you” (Bereshit 17:5–6).
Four ascending promises: a great nation, as many as the dust of the earth, as the stars of the sky; not one nation but many nations. Avraham heard these promises and had faith in them: “Avram believed the Lord, and He reckoned it to him as righteousness” (Bereshit 15:6).
Then God gave Avraham some painful news. His son by Hagar, Yishmael, would not be his spiritual heir. God would bless him and make him a great nation, “but My covenant I will establish with Yitzḥak, whom Sara will bear to you by this time next year” (Bereshit 17:21).
It is against this background of four promises of countless children, and a further promise that Avraham’s covenant would be continued by Yitzḥak, that we must set the chilling words that open the trial: “Take your son, your only son, the son whom you love – Yitzḥak – and offer him up.”
The trial was <i>not</i> to see whether Avraham had the courage to sacrifice his son. This was completely abhorrent to Judaism.
The trial was <i>not</i> to see whether Avraham had the strength to give up something he loved. He had shown this time and time again. At the very beginning of his story he gave up his land, his birthplace, and his father’s house, everything that was familiar to him, everything that spoke of home. In the previous chapter, he gave up his firstborn son Yishmael whom, it is clear, he also loved. Was there even the slightest doubt that he would give up Yitzḥak, who was so clearly God’s miraculous gift, arriving when Sara was already postmenopausal?
<i>The trial was to see whether Avraham could live with what seemed to be a clear contradiction between God’s word now, and God’s word on five previous occasions, promising him children and a covenant that would be continued by Yitzḥak.</i>
He did just that. He prepared himself for the sacrifice. But he told no one else. When he and Yitzḥak set off on the third day on their own, he told the two servants who had accompanied them, “Stay here with the donkey while I and the boy go over there. We will worship and then we will come back to you.” When Yitzḥak asked, “Where is the lamb for the burnt offering?” Avraham replied, “God Himself will provide the lamb.”
These statements are usually taken as diplomatic evasions. I believe, however, that Avraham meant exactly what he said. He was living the contradiction. He knew God had told him to sacrifice his son, but he also knew that God had told him that He would establish an everlasting covenant with his son.
The trial of the binding of Yitzḥak was not about sacrifice but about uncertainty. Until it was over, Avraham did not know what to believe, or how it would end. He believed that the God who promised him a son would not allow him to sacrifice that son. But he did not know how the contradiction between God’s promise and His command would resolve itself.
The poet John Keats once wrote in a letter that Shakespeare’s greatness lay in his “negative capability” – that he was a person capable of sitting in uncertainties, mysteries, and doubts, without irritably reaching after fact and reason. Shakespeare, in other words, was open to life in all its multiplicity and complexity, its conflicts and contradictions, while other, lesser writers sought to reduce life to a single philosophical frame. Perhaps what Shakespeare was to literature, Avraham was to faith.
<b>I believe Avraham taught us that faith is not certainty; it is the courage to live with uncertainty. He had negative capability. Avraham knew that God’s promises would come true, so he could live with the uncertainty of not knowing how or when.</b>
<b>QUESTION TO PONDER</b>
<i>What uncertainty do you have in your life? How do you manage to maintain your faith despite this?</i>
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>Faith is the courage to live with uncertainty. It does not mean having the answers, it means having the courage to ask the questions and not let go of God, as He does not let go of us. It means realising that God creates divine justice but only we, acting in accord with His word, can create human justice – and our very existence means that this is what God wants us to do.
<b><i>To Heal a Fractured World</i>, 199</b>
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>Why do you think God had to test Avraham at all?
What do you think is the message of the story of <i>Akeidat Yitzḥak</i>, the “Binding of Yitzḥak”?
Who do you think has stronger faith, someone who believes without question, or someone who lives in uncertainty and doubt?
<b>EDUCATIONAL COMPANION TO THE QUESTIONS</b>
<b><i>IN A NUTSHELL</i></b><br>When considering this question with children, a good starting place is to ask what exactly faith is. This could refer to a general belief in God or a more specific belief that God will fulfil His promises. This latter approach fits with the message of this <i>Covenant &amp; Conversation</i> essay – that faith is the courage to live with uncertainty, and this frames the stories in the <i>parasha</i>. Examples of Avraham’s faith despite uncertainty are the tests that God gave to Avraham (there are ten), the ultimate of which is the <i>Akeida</i> (the Binding of Yitzḥak).
<b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>According to Rabbi Sacks, it makes little sense that God would test Avraham with a task that is in opposition to a core value of the Torah (i.e., the prohibition of child sacrifice), and this is especially true in light of Avraham’s destiny as a role model of fatherhood. He concludes that this must mean there is another message behind the test of the Binding of Yitzḥak.
The trial was to see whether Avraham could live with what seemed to be a clear contradiction between God’s previous promises and His command now. The trial was not about sacrifice but about uncertainty. Until it was over, Avraham did not know what to believe, or how it would end. He believed that the God who promised him a son would not allow him to sacrifice that son. But he did not know how the contradiction between God’s promise and His command would be resolved. The test was to see if Avraham would have the courage to live with uncertainty and maintain his faith.
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br>There are obviously many difficult aspects of living apart from a loved one. One of those, perhaps the hardest of them, is the uncertainty of never knowing if you will ever see them again, and have your “happily ever after.” Certainty can allow for closure, even if the ending is a sad one. Uncertainty requires hope and faith, and these take courage and emotional effort.
This love story is symbolic of the relationship between the people of Israel (Yisrael) and the land of Israel (Tziyona – the feminine version of the name Tziyon, another name for Jerusalem). The metaphor represents the long and winding road that led the Jewish people to the land of Israel, and then after their expulsion from it, the two thousand years of yearning to return during the exile. Finally, the people and the land were reunited in 1948 with the establishment of the modern State of Israel. For two thousand years, the Jewish people lived in a state of uncertainty, not knowing if they would ever be able to return as a people to their land. It took hope and faith that one day we would return.
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>Encourage deeper thought than the basic uncertainties of everyday life (such as whether I will catch the bus, or whether my team will win). We live in a world of deep uncertainty, in our personal lives, on a national level, and in the wider world.
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>If God has perfect knowledge (omniscience), He knew the outcome of each test anyway. Therefore, the tests must have been for Avraham to learn about himself. Without being pushed out of one’s comfort zone, you will never know for sure what you can achieve. Alternatively, the tests could be for later generations, so we can learn and be inspired from Avraham.
All of the approaches explored in this <i>Covenant &amp; Conversation</i> essay are valuable lessons and messages. Rabbi Sacks expresses his discomfort with the classical approaches to this challenging story, and explains the source of his discomfort. However, he does not delegitimise these approaches. As he mentions at the outset, he has tried to find alternative interpretations in past editions of <i>Covenant &amp; Conversation</i>. In this essay, the approach he shares – that the test is to see if Avraham has the courage of faith in the face of uncertainty – is a novel one. Perhaps the people around your Shabbat table have their own ideas.
This is a discussion worth unpacking around your Shabbat table. Which is stronger, pure blind faith (where all challenges to faith are written off and explained away) or faith in the face of uncertainty, where there are no clear answers (because the answers so often given for the most difficult questions are simply inadequate) yet faith is maintained? Rabbi Sacks believes the latter shows more courage. But is that the same as having stronger faith?

II; God and Strangers

<big><strong>II. God and Strangers</strong></big><br><b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>Our <i>parasha</i> begins with a somewhat confusing opening scene, with Avraham sitting at the entrance to his tent:
“God appeared to Avraham by the oaks of Mamre, as he sat at the entrance to his tent in the heat of the day. He lifted up his eyes and looked and, lo, three men were standing over against him; and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent entrance and bowed down to the earth” (Bereshit 18:1–2).
At first glance the story seems simple. However, after a closer look it is actually complex and ambiguous. It consists of three sections:
Verse 1: God appears to Avraham.
Verses 2–16: Avraham meets the men/angels.
Verses 17–33: The dialogue between God and Avraham about the fate of Sedom.
The relationship between these sections is far from clear. Is this one scene, two, or three?
The most obvious possibility is three. Each of the sections is a separate event. First, God appears to Avraham, as Rashi explains, “to visit the sick” after Avraham’s circumcision (<i>brit mila</i>). Then the visitors arrive with the news that Sara will have a child. Then there is the great conversation between Avraham and God about justice and the punishment of the people of Sedom.
The Rambam suggests that there are only two scenes: the visit of the angels and the dialogue with God. The first verse does not describe an event at all; it is, rather, a chapter heading. It tells us that the events that follow are all part of a prophetic communication from God, a Divine-human encounter.
The third possibility is that we have a single continuous scene. God appears to Avraham, but before He can speak, Avraham sees the passers-by and asks God to wait while he serves them food. Only when they have departed – in verse 17 – does he turn to God, and the conversation begins.
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. Which of these three interpretations do you think best explains the story? Why do you prefer that interpretation to the others?</i>
<i>2. Consider the third interpretation. What do you think of Avraham’s decision to interrupt his conversation with God? Was this justified? Can that behaviour ever be justified?</i>
<i>3. What do you think is the message behind the third interpretation?</i>
<b><i>It Once Happened…</i></b><br><i>Ari Fuld deserved his nickname the “Lion of Zion.” He was a brave and passionate Zionist and dedicated his life to the Jewish people and to the Jewish state. Ari served in the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) as a sergeant in an elite paratroopers’ unit, and felt it was a privilege to serve in the IDF. When he turned forty, his discharge papers arrived but he tore them up and refused to retire. In his civilian life, he continued his life’s work to advocate for Israel in the media and on social media, and support IDF troops through the organisation he helped create and run called Standing Together.</i>
<i>Ari was killed one Sunday morning in September 2018 in a knife attack while doing his supermarket shopping. After fatally stabbing Ari, the terrorist continued his attack, running towards a woman serving falafel in a nearby shop. With a superhuman effort, with his very last breaths, Ari jumped over a wall and chased the terrorist, shooting him before he could kill again. Ari then collapsed and died from his wounds. He died as he lived, a hero dedicated to the Jewish people.</i>
<i>Ari’s true heroism and character became well known following his death, as stories from his life began to surface. A particularly poignant one came from a local Arab who reached out to Ari’s family to offer his condolences. He told them that every Friday, when Ari would shop for his own family for Shabbat, he would also buy some extra food to give to his family who were poor and often hungry. While Ari dedicated his life to his own people, he had compassion and love for the stranger also.</i>
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. What do you find most inspiring from this story?</i>
<i>2. Is it hard to show kindness to the stranger? Why is it important?</i>
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>In <i>The Core Idea,</i> we saw three possible interpretations of the story of the angels visiting Avraham. These options hinge upon the way we translate the word <i>Adonai</i> in Avraham’s appeal: “<i>Please Adonai, if now I have found favour in your sight, do not pass by, I pray you, from your servant</i>” (18:3). <i>Adonai</i> can be a reference to one of the names of God. But it can also be read as “my lords” or “sirs.” In the first case, Avraham would be addressing God. In the second, he would be speaking to the passers-by. In fact, an example of the second way to read the term <i>Adonai</i>, as “my lords,” can be seen in the very next chapter (Bereshit 19:1–2), when Lot receives two of the same angels in Sedom. The simplest reading of both stories would be to read the word consistently as “sirs,” and many English translations do just that. Jewish tradition, however, does not.
We know this because there are halakhic implications in this case of how we read this word. If we read <i>Adonai</i> as “God,” it is a holy name, and both the writing of the word by a scribe, and the way we treat a parchment or document containing it, have special stringencies in Jewish law. And that is how Jewish law rules in this case.
This is an extraordinary fact, because it suggests that <i>Avraham actually interrupted God as He was about to speak, asking Him to wait while he attended to the visitors</i>. The story must now be read like this: God appeared to Avraham, and then he also noticed three men approaching. Avraham then turned to God and said, “My God, if I have found favour in Your eyes, do not leave Your servant [i.e., Please wait until I have given hospitality to these men].” Then Avraham turned back to the men and offered his hospitality.
This daring interpretation became the basis for a principle in Judaism: “<i>Greater is hospitality than receiving the Divine Presence</i>” (Shabbat 127a). Faced with a choice between listening to God and offering hospitality to strangers, Avraham chose the latter. God accepted his request and waited while Avraham brought the visitors food and drink, before engaging him in dialogue about the fate of Sedom.
How could Avraham put the needs of (who he thought to be) human beings before God? This passage is teaching us a profound truth. The idolaters of Avraham’s time worshipped the sun, the stars, and the forces of nature as gods. They worshipped power and the powerful. Avraham knew, however, that God is not in nature but <i>beyond</i> nature. There is only one thing in the universe on which He has set His image: the human person, <i>every</i> person, powerful and powerless alike.
Avraham, father of monotheism, knew the paradoxical truth that to live the life of faith is to see the trace of God in the face of the stranger. It is easy to receive the Divine Presence when God appears as God. What is difficult is to sense the Divine Presence when it comes disguised as three anonymous passers-by. That was Avraham’s greatness. He knew that serving God and offering hospitality to strangers were not two things, but one.
By choosing the most radical of the three possible interpretations of Bereshit 18, the Sages allowed us to hear one of the most fundamental principles of the life of faith: we honour God by honouring His image, humankind.
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br><i>Tzedaka</i> is the gift of money or its equivalent. But sometimes that is not what we most need. We can suffer emotional as well as physical poverty. We can be depressed, lonely, close to despair. We may need company or comfort, encouragement or support. These too are human needs, no less real for being untranslatable into the language of politics or economics.
That is what <i>ḥesed</i> is about: emotional support, loving-kindness, love as compassion. It is what we mean when we speak of God in Psalm 147 as one who “heals the broken-hearted and binds up their wounds.” It includes hospitality to the lonely, visiting the sick, comforting the bereaved, raising the spirits of the depressed, helping people through crises in their lives, and making those at the margins feel part of the community. It is <i>tzedaka</i>’s other side.
<i>Tzedaka</i> is done with material goods, <i>ḥesed</i> with psychological ones: time and care. <i>Tzedaka</i> is practical support; <i>ḥesed</i> is emotional support. <i>Tzedaka</i> is a gift of resources, <i>ḥesed</i> a gift of the person. Even those who lack the means to give <i>tzedaka</i> can still give <i>ḥesed</i>. <i>Tzedaka</i> rights wrongs; <i>ḥesed</i> humanises fate.
Avraham and Sara were chosen because of their <i>ḥesed</i> to others. Rut became the ancestress of Israel’s kings because of her <i>ḥesed</i> to Naomi. At the heart of the Judaic vision is the dream of a society based on <i>ḥesed</i>: society with a human face, not one dominated by the competition for wealth or power. <i>Ḥesed</i> is the mark of a people joined by covenant. Covenant creates society as extended family; it means seeing strangers as if they were our long-lost brothers or sisters. A community based on <i>ḥesed</i> is a place of grace, where everyone feels honoured and everyone is at home.
<b>Ten Paths to God – <i>Chessed:</i> <i>Love as Compassion</i>, 3</b>
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. What is the difference  between</i> tzedaka<i> and</i> ḥesed<i>?</i>
<i>2. Avraham was known as a man of</i> ḥesed<i>. How do you think this impacts on his descendants?</i>
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>Do you think the main focus of Judaism is our relationship with God or with our fellow man?
According to Rabbi Sacks, there is a central philosophical message contained in this story, a polemic against the other religions of the time and perhaps also of our time. What is it?
“We honour God by honouring His image, humankind.” How can we do this? How can you do this in your life?
<b>EDUCATIONAL COMPANION TO THE QUESTIONS</b>
<b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>This is an open question, with no correct or incorrect answers. All three approaches are legitimate, despite Rabbi Sacks presenting the third one as the position of Jewish tradition (as proven by the halakhic status of the term <i>Adonai –</i> see <i>Thinking More Deeply</i>). The educational message of the third approach is a very strong one, and the basis of the message of this <i>Covenant &amp; Conversation</i> essay. But as Rabbi Sacks admits, the first approach is perhaps the easiest one to read into the text, and this could equally be argued for Rambam’s approach.
While it is understandable to consider Avraham’s behaviour towards God as disrespectful, and even sacrilegious, the profound message here is that showing <i>ḥesed</i> to humanity is more important even than our relationship with God. To some extent this represents two different approaches within Judaism – one focuses more on our relationship with God (known as <i>mitzvot bein adam leMakom</i>) and the other on our relationship with our fellow man (known as <i>mitzvot bein adam leḥavero</i>). A balance between both approaches is possible and perhaps the ideal.
The message of the third interpretation is further explored in the <i>Thinking More Deeply</i> section. It suggests that the primary focus of Judaism is concerned with humanity, even if it is at the expense of our relationship with God. Having said that, a close reading of Rabbi Sacks’s message shows us that when one honours our fellow man by treating him/her with respect and dignity, we are in fact also honouring God. Perhaps this is the balance between the two approaches, whereby our focus is both humanity and God.
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br>This is an open question with no correct or incorrect answers. There are many inspiring parts to the story, including Ari’s passion for the Jewish people and Israel, and how these were the ultimate values in his life. But the way in which he died, while tragic and sad, is also deeply inspiring and heroic. Perhaps the most inspiring part is the stories that only came to light after Ari’s death – the acts of kindness that he performed out of the spotlight without anyone knowing about them.
A powerful aspect of the <i>ḥesed</i> Ari showed to the Arab family is that Ari saw the humanity in the stranger, irrespective of politics and the conflict that ultimately took his life. It is often harder to show kindness and <i>ḥesed</i> to those who are not like us, but this is when <i>ḥesed</i> is most important, and Ari understood that.
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br><i>Tzedaka</i> is monetary or practical support, while <i>ḥesed</i> is about emotional support, loving-kindness, and compassion.
Avraham’s central quality was<i> ḥesed</i> and he was chosen to be the progenitor of the Jewish people. He can be considered a primary role model for the Jewish people, and perhaps just as his defining quality was <i>ḥesed,</i> so the core value of Judaism, and the defining quality of the Jewish people, is and should be <i>ḥesed</i>.
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>Judaism has a dual focus – our relationship with God (<i>mitzvot bein adam leMakom</i>) and our relationship with our fellow man (<i>mitzvot bein adam leḥavero</i>). A balance between both approaches is possible. While perhaps maintaining an equal focus on both is the ideal, the message of this story seems to be that we can compromise on our honouring and respecting God in order to bring respect and honour to the stranger. Having said that, Rabbi Sacks’s message is that when we honour our fellow man by treating him/her with respect and dignity, we are in fact also honouring God.
It is always easy to show kindness and love to those who are like us. That is the most natural thing in the world. Hence, we have immediate and unconditional love for those in our family and find it most easy to love those from our community and nation. The greater moral challenge is showing equal kindness and love to those who are not like us – those who look different from us, or believe in different things than us, and have a different lifestyle than us. That is what we should strive for if we are to replicate Avraham’s character trait of <i>ḥesed</i>.
This question asks the people around your Shabbat table to consider real and practical ways in which they can show honour and respect to the people in their lives, including those who are strangers to them. Examples of this could be the way they treat the members of their family, their friends, teachers, and the bus driver and shopkeeper whom they interact with on a daily basis, as well as the stranger they have never met before and will probably not meet again. Avraham models this last example, showing kindness and respect to people who were not like him, and whom he had no expectations of meeting again. This is the ultimate example of <i>ḥesed</i>.

Chayei Sarah

In a Nutshell

<b><i>IN A NUTSHELL</i></b><br>This <i>parasha</i> has three main stories. The first discusses how, after his wife Sara’s death, Avraham bought a field with a cave (the Cave of Makhpela, today in Ḥevron) to bury her. This was the first piece of the land of Israel to be owned by a Jew.
The second story tells us how Avraham’s servant searched for a wife for Yitzḥak. The servant understood that he must find a woman who lived by the same values as Avraham and his household, and so when Rivka showed him <i>ḥesed</i> (loving-kindness) by bringing him and his camels water, he knew he had found the right partner for Yitzḥak.
The third and final story describes the end of Avraham’s life, and his death. He remarried after Sara’s death, had six more children, and finally died peacefully at the age of 175.
<b>QUESTION TO PONDER</b>
<i>Do you think Avraham had a good or a bad life? How do you think he coped with all the challenges and difficulties he had in his life?</i>

I; To Have a Why

<big><strong>I. To Have a Why</strong></big><br><b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>The first sentence of this <i>parasha</i> of <i>Ḥayei Sara</i> is: “<i>Sara’s lifetime was 127 years: the years of Sara’s life</i>.” Rashi makes a strange comment on the seemingly unnecessary and extra phrase, “the years of Sara’s life.” He says, “The word ‘years’ is repeated and without a number to indicate that all her years were equally good.” How could anyone say that the years of Sara’s life were equally good? She had so many challenging episodes in her life.
Twice, first in Egypt, then in Gerar, she was asked by Avraham to say that she was his sister rather than his wife, and was then taken into a royal harem, a very difficult and dangerous situation. There were many years when, despite God’s repeated promise that she would have many children, she was infertile, and couldn’t have even a single child. There was the time when she persuaded Avraham to take her handmaid, Hagar, and have a child by her so that he could be a father, which caused her great emotional pain. Her life was one of uncertainty and decades of unfulfilled hopes. How can Rashi then say that all of Sara’s years were equally good?
The Torah is similarly puzzling with its description of Avraham. Immediately after he buys a burial plot for Sara, the Torah says, “Avraham was old, well advanced in years, and God had blessed Avraham with everything” (Bereshit 24:1).
Seven times, God had promised Avraham the land of Canaan. Yet when Sara died, he did not own a single plot of land in which to bury her, and had to go through an exhausting and humiliating negotiation with the Hittites to buy a small piece of the land. How can the Torah say that God had blessed Avraham with everything?
Equally confusing is the Torah’s description of Avraham’s death at the end of the <i>parasha</i>: “<i>Avraham breathed his last and died at a good age, old and satisfied, and he was gathered to his people</i>.” Avraham had been promised that he would become the father of many nations, and that he would inherit the land. But he did not live to see these promises fulfilled. So how can we imagine that he was “satisfied” at the end of his life?
The answer, for both Sara and Avraham, is that to understand a death, we have to understand a life.
Friedrich Nietzsche (a nineteenth-century German philosopher) said: <i>He who has a why in life can bear almost any how</i>. It was Sara and Avraham’s sense of destiny and calling that gave their lives purpose and allowed them to survive the difficult times and even the unfulfilled goals at the end of their lives – because they had faith that the journey was not yet over. They died satisfied that they had played an important part, and taken the first steps for their future family.

<b><i>It Once Happened…</i></b><br><i>Viktor Frankl was born in Vienna in 1905, and the Nazis deported him, with the rest of his family, to the concentration camp at Theresienstadt in 1942. He spent the next three years in extermination camps, among them Auschwitz and Dachau. He and one sister were the only members of the family to survive. It was during his time as a prisoner that he made the discovery which later became his life’s work.</i>
<i>Already a distinguished neurologist, he survived by constantly analysing what was happening to himself and others as if he and they were taking part in an experiment. The Nazis took everything away from the prisoners: all their possessions, clothes, shoes, hair, even their names. They seized Frankl’s most precious possession, a scientific manuscript containing his life’s research. They had erased his entire life. Frankl realised at that point that there is one freedom that can never be taken away: the personal choice of how to respond.</i>
<i>Two of his fellow inmates were contemplating suicide. By talking with them, he was able to get each to see that they had something still to live for. One had published a series of books on geography, but the series was not yet complete. The other had a daughter abroad who loved him devotedly and longed to see him again. In both cases, what was essential was the realisation that there was something more to be done that could be done by no one else. This knowledge gave meaning to life. By helping his fellow prisoners to find a reason to continue to live, he gave them, and himself, the strength to survive.</i>
<i>When he survived the Holocaust and rebuilt his life, he created a new school of psychotherapy around this idea. He called it Logotherapy, focusing on the spiritual dimension of human life, that which gives life a sense of purpose. He summarised his teaching in the title of his most famous book,</i> Man’s Search for Meaning<i>.</i>
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. How can Viktor Frankl’s theory help us understand the lives of Avraham and Sara?</i>
<i>2. Does every life have meaning?</i>
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>Avraham and Sara are among the supreme historical examples of what it is to have a “Why” in life. The entire course of their lives came as a response to a call, a divine voice, that told them to leave their home and family, set out for an unknown destination, go to live in a land where they would be strangers, abandon every conventional form of security, and have the faith to believe that by living by the standards of righteousness and justice they would be taking the first step to establishing a family, a nation, a land, a faith, and a way of life that would be a blessing to all humankind.
We do not know what Avraham or Yitzḥak felt as they walked towards Mount Moria. We do not know what Sara felt when she entered the harems, first of Pharaoh, then of Avimelekh of Gerar. With some conspicuous exceptions, we hardly know what any of the Torah’s characters felt. Which is why the two explicit statements about Avraham – that God blessed him with everything, and that he ended life old and satisfied – are so important. And when Rashi says that all of Sara’s years were equally good, he is attributing to her what the biblical text attributes to Avraham, namely a serenity in the face of death that came from a profound tranquillity in the face of life. Avraham knew that everything that happened to him, even the bad things, were part of the journey on which God had sent him and Sara, and he had the faith to walk through the valley of the shadow of death fearing no evil, knowing that God was with him.
In 2017, an unusual book became an international bestseller. One of the things that made it unusual was that its author was ninety years old and this was her first book. Another was that she was both a survivor of Auschwitz, and also of the Death March towards the end of the war, which in some respects was even more brutal than the camp itself.
The book was called <i>The Choice</i> and its author was Edith Eger. She, together with her father, mother, and sister Magda, arrived at Auschwitz in May 1944, one of twelve thousand Jews transported from Kosice, Hungary. Her parents were murdered on that first day. A woman pointed towards a smoking chimney and told Edith that she had better start talking about her parents in the past tense. With astonishing courage and strength of will, she and Magda survived the camp and the March. When American soldiers eventually lifted her from a heap of bodies in an Austrian forest, she had typhoid fever, pneumonia, pleurisy, and a broken back. After a year, when her body had healed, she married and became a mother. Healing of the mind took much longer, and eventually became her vocation in the United States, where she went to live.
On their way to Auschwitz, Edith’s mother said to her, “We don’t know where we are going, we don’t know what is going to happen, but nobody can take away from you what you put in your own mind.” That sentence became her survival mechanism. Initially, after the war, to help support the family, she worked in a factory, but eventually she went to university to study psychology and became a psychotherapist. She has used her own experiences of survival to help others survive life crises.
Early on in the book she makes an immensely important distinction between <i>victimisation</i> (what happens to you) and <i>victimhood</i> (how you respond to what happens to you). This is what she says about the first:
“We are all likely to be victimized in some way in the course of our lives. At some point we will suffer some kind of affliction or calamity or abuse, caused by circumstances or people or institutions over which we have little or no control. This is life. And this is victimization. It comes from the outside.”
And this, about the second:
“In contrast, victimhood comes from the inside. No one can make you a victim but you. We become victims not because of what happens to us but when we choose to hold on to our victimization. We develop a victim’s mind – a way of thinking and being that is rigid, blaming, pessimistic, stuck in the past, unforgiving, punitive, and without healthy limits or boundaries.”
In an interview on the publication of the book, she said, “I’ve learned not to look for happiness, because that is external. You were born with love and you were born with joy. That’s inside. It’s always there.”
We have learned this extraordinary mindset from Holocaust survivors like Edith Eger and Viktor Frankl. But in truth, it was there from the very beginning, from Avraham and Sara, who survived whatever fate threw at them, however much it seemed to derail their mission. And despite everything, they found serenity at the end of their lives. They knew that what makes a life satisfying is not external but internal, a sense of purpose, mission, being called, summoned, of starting something that would be continued by those who came after them, of bringing something new into the world by the way they lived their lives. What mattered was the inside, not the outside; their faith, not their often-troubled circumstances.
<b>I believe that faith helps us to find the “Why” that allows us to bear almost any “How.” The serenity of Sara’s and Avraham’s death was eternal testimony to how they lived.</b>
<b>QUESTION TO PONDER</b>
<i>Do you have a sense of your “Why”? Does that help you bear the “How” (the challenges in your life)?</i>
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>The search for meaning represents one of the deepest truths of the human condition, namely that what affects us is not what happens to us but how we perceive what happens to us, and that is not independent of our will. We are not billiard balls or atoms or genes, responses to stimuli, mere effects of a prior cause. We are free because our response depends on our perception, and that can always be revised. You can imprison the body but not the mind.
<b><i>To Heal a Fractured World</i>, 220</b>
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>What does it mean to have a “Why” in life? What was the “Why” of Avraham and Sara’s lives?
What is the difference between <i>victimisation</i> and <i>victimhood</i>?
What lessons for your own life can you take from Edith Eger and her story?
<b>EDUCATIONAL COMPANION TO THE QUESTIONS</b>
<b><i>IN A NUTSHELL</i></b><br>To answer this question, you will need to consider all of the events in Avraham’s life. These include leaving the land of his birth and travelling to an unknown land; leaving that land to travel to Egypt due to a famine; returning to Israel and arguing with his nephew Lot; being promised a child but experiencing years of childlessness; war; exile again in Egypt; strife between his wives Hagar and Sara; the birth of Yitzḥak; the <i>Akeida</i> (Binding of Yitzḥak); Sara’s death and burial; Yitzḥak’s marriage to Rivka; a second marriage and more children; and then death. Many of these events were deeply challenging for Avraham (and the Rabbis consider some of them tests from God). But because Avraham had faith that his life was fulfilling the destiny promised to him by God, and therefore it had meaning (because he was laying the foundations for the birth of the Jewish people), he could rise to each test and each challenge with faith in God and the destiny God had promised him.
<b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>The Mishna in <i>Ethics of the Fathers</i> (2:16) states: לֹא עָלֶיךָ הַמְּלָאכָה לִגְמֹר, וְלֹא אַתָּה בֶן חוֹרִין לִבָּטֵל מִמֶּנָּה (It is not your duty to finish the work, but neither are you at liberty to neglect it). Sometimes the most rewarding and important tasks are too big to be completed by one person or in one lifetime. Faith that you are contributing something worthwhile to the final goal should be enough to provide satisfaction.
Obviously young people will not necessarily have a developed sense of this, and should not be made to feel they should. However, trying to find meaning and purpose in life is a worthwhile conversation at any age. The message here is that looking for your mission in the world, your role in life, helps one live with, and overcome, many challenges, helping you to lead a better and more fulfilling life of purpose.
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br>Despite the many difficulties they faced in their lives, including dying before their life’s work (and God’s promises to them) had been fulfilled, Avraham and Sara survived disappointment, frustration, and challenge along the way because they lived a life of meaning and purpose, believing they were fulfilling God’s destiny for them. This is Frankl’s explanation for how humans can survive terrible challenges and experiences in their lives.
Every life has meaning, because every human being is unique and has a unique contribution to make to the world.
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>It is never too early to begin thinking about the purpose of our lives, what we hope to achieve and contribute to the world, and what God expects of us. Reflecting on whether a sense of this helps to overcome challenges in life is a complex conversation with no right and wrong answers, but the message of this <i>Covenant &amp; Conversation</i> essay, and the writings of people such as Viktor Frankl and Edith Eger, is that it can.
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>Having a “Why” in your life means having a purpose for living, knowing that there is something you are uniquely destined to contribute and achieve. Avraham and Sara are supreme examples of what it is to have a “Why” in life. The entire course of their lives came as a response to a call, a divine voice, that told them to leave their home and family, set out for an unknown destination, go to live in a land where they would be strangers, without security, and yet have the faith to believe that by living by the standards of righteousness and justice, they would be taking the first step toward establishing a nation, a land, a faith, and a way of life that would be a blessing to all humankind. This helped them live through the challenges and as-yet-unfulfilled goals of their lives.
According to Edith Eger,<i> victimisation</i> is what happens to you and <i>victimhood</i> is a way you may respond to what happens to you. Victimisation comes from the outside – the suffering of some kind of affliction or calamity or abuse, caused by circumstances or people or institutions over which you have little or no control. Victimhood comes from the inside. Only you can make yourself a victim. We become victims not because of what happens to us, but when we choose to hold on to our victimisation.
Every single person, whatever age and stage of life, has had things in their life that are a challenge in some shape, way, or form – things that do not go as we would have wished, or worse. Applying the lessons from Edith Eger to our own lives will help us to respond positively to these challenges. Rather than feeling victimised and frustrated by the world, she teaches us to move past the challenges by making the best of the situation we find ourselves in.

II; On Judaism and Islam

<big><strong>II. On Judaism and Islam</strong></big><br><b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>In the last <i>parasha</i> we saw that after the birth of Yitzḥak, Sara was upset by the presence of Avraham’s first wife Hagar and their son Yishmael in the house of Avraham. She demanded that Avraham send them away and God told Avraham to listen to his wife.
Yet in this <i>parasha</i> we see a strange detail in the description of Avraham’s death:
“And Avraham breathed his last and died in his ripe old age, aged and satisfied, and was gathered to his people. His sons, Yitzḥak and Yishmael, buried him in the Cave of Makhpela, near Mamre, in the field of Efron son of Tzoḥar the Hittite, the field Avraham had bought from the Hittites. There Avraham was buried with Sara his wife” (Bereshit 25:8–10).
Yishmael’s presence at the funeral is surprising. After all, he had been sent away into the desert years before, when Yitzḥak was young. Until now, we have assumed that the two half-brothers have lived in total isolation from one another. Yet the Torah places them together at the funeral without a word of explanation.
There is a midrash in <i>Pirkei DeRabbi Eliezer</i> which may shed some light on this. It tells of how Avraham visited his son Yishmael twice after he had sent him away. On the first occasion, Yishmael was not at home. His wife, not knowing Avraham’s identity, refused to give the stranger bread and water. Yishmael divorced her and married a woman named Fatimah. This time, when Avraham visited, again in disguise, the woman gave him food and drink. The midrash then says: “Avraham stood and prayed before the Holy One, blessed be He, and Yishmael’s house became filled with all good things. When Yishmael returned, his wife told him about it, and Yishmael knew that his father still loved him.” Father and son were reconciled.
<b><i>It Once Happened…</i></b><br><i>Shlomo Galster, an elderly hasidic man from the north of Israel, lay dying in his hospital bed in HaEmek Medical Center in Afula. He had contracted Covid-19 a month previously, and the medical staff attending to him knew he was nearing the end of his life. They contacted his family to come immediately and say their goodbyes, but he was declining rapidly and the family would not be able to make it in time. Shlomo lay dying alone.</i>
<i>Maher Ibrahim, an Arab nurse in the hospital, had been treating him since he was hospitalised, and as with all his patients, he felt deep compassion and care towards him. He knew the man would wish to say the</i> Shema<i> before he passed away, but had no one by his side who could help him do this. So Maher did it himself.</i>
<i>“I knew he was a religious man and it was important to him that his family pray with him,” Ibrahim, who was raised Muslim, said later when interviewed by the press. “I don’t know the entire prayer exactly, but I knew how important it was that he hear the words ‘</i>Shema Yisrael<i>.’ We knew him and his family. We were fond of him. We prayed with him, for his own sake and his family.” Ibrahim added, “It was clear to me that he wanted us to recite the</i> Shema<i> prayer for him. We have one God.”</i>
<i>When the family arrived, they were comforted to know what had happened. Shlomo’s daughter told the reporters: “It was a difficult, sad day. My father never stopped talking about the devoted care he received and how thankful he was to Maher and the entire team.”</i>
<i>The story quickly went viral, Maher inspiring so many in Israel because of his deep humanity, proving once again all humans have so much more in common than what sets us apart from each other. Some months later, Maher was officially honored by the State of Israel when he was given the honor of lighting a torch during the official ceremony for Israel’s seventy- third Independence Day.</i>
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. According to the Torah, Jews and Arabs are cousins. Does this make it easier or harder to understand why they sometimes fight?</i>
<i>2. How do the message of this story and the message of the</i> Covenant &amp; Conversation<i> essay complement each other?</i>
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>Beneath the surface of <i>Ḥayei Sara</i> is another story, with three important clues waiting in the text.
The first occurs when Avraham’s servant is returning with the woman who is to become Yitzḥak’s wife. As Rivka sees Yitzḥak in the distance, we are told that he is “<i>coming from the way of Be’er Laḥai Ro’i</i>” (Bereshit 24:62) to meditate in the field. Where is Be’er Laḥai Ro’i and what is its significance?
The second is the final stage of Avraham’s life. For chapter after chapter we read of the love and faithfulness Avraham and Sara had for one another. Then Sara’s life draws to a close. Avraham mourns and weeps for her and buys a cave in which she is buried. We might then expect to read that Avraham lived out the rest of his years alone before being placed beside “Sara his wife” in the Cave of Makhpela.
Unexpectedly, however, once Yitzḥak is married, Avraham marries a woman named Ketura and has six children with her. We are told nothing else about this woman, and the significance of the episode is unclear. But the Torah does not include mere incidental details. So what is the significance of Avraham’s second marriage and how is it related to the rest of the story?
The third clue is revealed in the Torah’s description of Avraham’s death – the surprising presence of Yishmael at Avraham’s funeral. The Sages pieced together these three puzzling details to form an enthralling story.
First, they point out that Be’er Laḥai Ro’i, the place from which Yitzḥak was coming, is mentioned once before, in Bereshit (16:14): it is the spot where Hagar, pregnant and fleeing from Sara, encountered an angel who told her to return. It is indeed she who gives the place its name, meaning “<i>the well of the Living One who sees me</i>.” The midrash says that Yitzḥak was there looking for Hagar, because he said, “Shall I be married while my father lives alone? I will go and return Hagar to him.”
This also explains the second question: Who was Ketura? The Sages tell us she was Hagar. Hagar was also called Ketura because “<i>her acts gave forth fragrance like incense (ketoret)</i>.” This together with the midrash we saw also answers the third question, and helps complete the challenging narrative of the expulsion of Hagar and Yishmael. Hagar did not end her days as an outcast and Yishmael and Avraham did not remain estranged. Hagar returned, at Yitzḥak’s prompting and with Avraham’s consent, to become the wife of her former master, and Yishmael and Avraham were ultimately reconciled.
In that midrash in <i>Pirkei DeRabbi Eliezer</i>, the name of Yishmael’s second wife, Fatimah, is highly significant. In the Koran, Fatimah is the daughter of Mohammad. <i>Pirkei DeRabbi Eliezer</i> is making an explicit, and positive, reference to Islam. The hidden story of<i> Ḥayei Sara</i> has immense consequence for our time. Jews and Muslims both trace their descent from Avraham – Jews through Yitzḥak, Muslims through Yishmael.
The fact that both sons stood together at their father’s funeral tells us that they too were reunited.
Beneath the surface of the narrative in <i>Ḥayei Sara</i>, the Sages read the clues and pieced together a moving story of reconciliation between Avraham and Hagar on the one hand, Yitzḥak and Yishmael on the other.
Yes, there was conflict and separation. But that was the beginning, not the end. Between Judaism and Islam there can be friendship and mutual respect. Avraham loved both his sons, and was laid to rest by both. There is hope for the future in this story of the past.
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>At the heart of all three faiths is the idea that within humanity there is one privileged position – favoured son, chosen people, guardian of the truth, gatekeeper of salvation – for which more than one candidate competes. The result is conflict of the most existential kind, for what is at stake is the most precious gift of all: God’s paternal love. One group’s victory means another’s defeat, and since this is a humiliation, a dethronement, it leads to revenge. So the strife is perpetuated….
On the surface, the story of Yitzḥak and Yishmael is about sibling rivalry and the displacement of the elder by the younger. Beneath the surface, however, the Sages heard a counter-narrative telling the opposite story: <i>the birth of Yitzḥak does not displace Yishmael</i>. To be sure, he will have a different destiny. But he too is a beloved son of Avraham, blessed by his father and by God. He becomes a great nation. God stays with him to ensure that his children flourish and become “twelve rulers.” Avraham and <i>Yitzḥak</i> both make a journey of reconciliation. The two half-brothers stand together at their father’s grave. There is no hostility between them. Their futures diverge, but they do not compete for God’s affection, which encompasses them both. This reading becomes all the more powerful when, in the midrash, it is extended to the relationship between Judaism and Islam.
This is the first indication of what will, in the next few chapters, emerge as a systemic feature of the biblical text. In each narrative of apparent choice-and-rejection, there is a counter-narrative that subverts the surface story and presents a more nuanced, generous picture of divine (and, by implication, human) sympathy. It is never blatant. It never unequivocally announces itself. But it is unmistakably there in the text….
The surface narrative is itself revolutionary. It asserts that the hierarchy of the ancient world – where the elder is destined to rule, the younger to serve – was about to be overthrown. The counter-narrative is more radical still, because it hints at the most radical of monotheism’s truths: that God may choose, but <i>God does not reject</i>. The logic of scarcity – of alpha males and chosen sons – has no place in a world made by a God whose “tender mercies are on <i>all</i> His works” (Tehillim 145:9).
<b><i>Not in God’s Name</i>, 99, 123–124</b>
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. What do Yishmael and Esav have in common? Why do you think their stories in the Torah can be described as “revolutionary”?</i>
<i>2. The “counter-narrative” that is hidden in the text below the surface is even more radical. Why do you think Rabbi Sacks describes it in this way and what is his message? How can this idea help us solve religious violence in our world today?</i>
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>Do you think Avraham was right or wrong to send Hagar and Yishmael away?
From the way the Rabbis in the midrash have read the story, what do you think Yitzḥak thinks of the episode of Hagar and Yishmael?
Do you think sibling relationships are a good model to teach us other inter-human relationships?
<b>EDUCATIONAL COMPANION TO THE QUESTIONS</b>
<b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>This is a difficult story in the Bible, and commentators through the ages, from midrashic to modern, have struggled to understand and justify why Sara made this demand. Perhaps Sara saw Hagar as a rival to her in the house, and saw Yishmael as a rival to Yitzḥak (perhaps as a rival for the love and attention of their father Avraham, or even as a rival for the inheritance and legacy that was at stake). However, many commentators also suggest that Sara was in fact worried about the negative influence that Yishmael would have on Yitzḥak if he remained in the same house during Yitzḥak’s childhood and upbringing.
While there is a midrash that suggests Avraham found it distressing that Yishmael was a bad influence on Yitzḥak, rather than finding Sara’s request distressing, Rashi admits that the simple reading of the text is that Avraham found it difficult, as a father, to send away his son Yishmael and Yishmael’s mother, Hagar.
Many commentaries and midrashim note that Yishmael was a bad influence on Yitzḥak, and Avraham’s first responsibility was to protect the son that God had promised him would be his legacy, the fulfilment of the <i>brit</i> between him and God. Furthermore, we know that Avraham did the right thing, because God told him listen to Sara, so it must have been the correct thing to do, even if Avraham (and we) don’t understand why.
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br>Sibling rivalry is natural and common and there are several examples of it in the Torah, including the story of Yitzḥak and Yishmael. Perhaps the modern-day conflict between Jews and Arabs is an extension of this, and just as there was reconciliation between Yitzḥak and Yishmael, we can learn from this that it is possible one day to have peace between Jew and Arab.
Rabbi Sacks’s message is that although there was conflict and separation between Avraham and Yitzḥak on the one side, and Hagar and Yishmael on the other, that was the beginning, not the end. There can be friendship and mutual respect between Judaism and Islam, inspired by the love of Avraham for both his sons. There is hope for the future in this story of the past.
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>Yishmael and Esav were both the firstborn sons and yet were rejected from the spiritual inheritance of being forefathers of the Jewish people and the carriers of the <i>brit</i> with God. Rabbi Sacks describes their stories as revolutionary, because the stories were written at a time when the accepted norm of society in the ancient world was a hierarchy of power where the elder son is always destined to rule, and the younger son to serve. The message of these stories is that age, or lineage, or physical strength, are not moral justifications for power and rule. This was a radical and new idea in that world.
The counter-narrative, however, is even more novel and radical. It suggests that while God makes His decision, based on His own criteria, who will be the carrier of the covenant and the forefather of the Jewish people, this does not mean that the other has been rejected. God may choose, but <i>God does not reject</i>. God has enough love to care deeply and fully for all of His creations.
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>While we can approach this question from a textual perspective (see <i>The Core Idea</i>, question 1), the question is asking for your own opinion. Yishmael was a bad influence on Yitzḥak, but ask the people around your Shabbat table to imagine Avraham’s dilemma, and how difficult that must have been. And finally, remember that God compelled Avraham to fulfil Sara’s demand. But despite that, should Avraham have done it, in your opinion?
It would seem that Yitzḥak also struggled with this decision, and the first chance he had, he arranged for the reconciliation of Avraham and Hagar. This is not to say that he felt his parents were wrong, but his behaviour demonstrates an empathy with the plight of Hagar, and perhaps Yishmael also.
One can argue that sibling relationships are a more intense version of all human relationships. The love is deeper, but then so too is the rivalry. So when we examine the sibling rivalries and reconciliations in the book of Bereshit, we can use these relationships as a model for understanding all human relationships.

Toldot

In a Nutshell

<b><i>IN A NUTSHELL</i></b><br><i>Parashat Toledot</i> tells the story of Yitzḥak and Rivka’s twin sons, Yaakov and Esav, who fought with each other even before they were born! Rivka had been told that although Esav would be born first, Yaakov would be the one to continue the Jewish people. But Yaakov wasn’t sure of this and one day he convinced Esav to sell him the special blessing he was due as the firstborn son. Rivka then helped her son Yaakov to dress in Esav’s clothes and pretend to be his brother, tricking his almost-blind father Yitzḥak into giving him Esav’s firstborn blessing.
When Esav found out, he screamed a bitter cry, and even though Yitzḥak tried to make him feel better by giving him a blessing just for him, Esav’s anger remained. Rivka was scared Esav might kill Yaakov in revenge, and so told Yaakov to run far away to Ḥaran, where he could stay with her brother Lavan.
<b>QUESTION TO PONDER</b>
<i>Do you think Rivka and Yaakov were right to trick Yitzḥak?</i>

I; Yitzhak and Esav

<big><strong>I. Yitzḥak and Esav</strong></big><br><b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>Why did Yitzḥak love Esav? The verse says explicitly, “Yitzḥak, who had a taste for wild game, loved Esav, but Rivka loved Yaakov” (Bereshit 25:28). Whichever way we read this verse, it is confusing. If we read it literally, it suggests that Yitzḥak’s love for Esav came from a taste for a particular kind of food. Surely that is not the way love is earned or given in the Torah.
Rashi, quoting a midrash, suggests that the phrase “who had a taste for wild game” really refers to Esav, and should be read “there was hunting in his mouth,” meaning that he used to trap and deceive his father with his words. This hints that Esav deceived Yitzḥak into thinking that he was more religious and spiritual than in fact he was. Yet, if we look back at the original text in the Torah, it still suggests undeniably that there was a genuine bond of love between Esav and Yitzḥak.
Here is another way to look at their relationship: Perhaps Yitzḥak, who loved Esav, was not tricked about the nature of his elder son. He knew what he was and what he wasn’t. He knew he was a man of the field, a hunter, impulsive in temperament, a man who could easily become violent and angry, and equally quickly, capable of being distracted and forgetting.
He also knew that Esav was not the child to continue the covenant between God and the Jewish people. That is clear in the difference between the blessing Yitzḥak gave Yaakov in Bereshit 27 (believing him to be Esav), and the blessing in Bereshit 28 that he gave Yaakov, knowing him to be Yaakov.
The first blessing, intended for Esav, is about <i>wealth</i> – “May God give you of the dew of heaven and the fat of the earth,” and <i>power</i> – “Let peoples serve you, and nations bow to you.” The second blessing, intended for Yaakov as he was leaving home, is about <i>children</i> – “May God Almighty bless you and make you fruitful and increase your numbers until you become a community of peoples,” and a <i>land</i> – “May He give you and your descendants the blessing given to Avraham, so that you may take possession of…the land God gave to Avraham.” The patriarchal blessings are not about wealth and power; they are about children and the land. <i>So Yitzḥak knew all along that the covenant would be continued by Yaakov; he was not deceived by Esav</i>. What then, was the source of his deep love for Esav?
I believe the answer is that Yitzḥak’s love for Esav was unconditional. He did not ignore who or what his firstborn son was. But he loved him anyway, even if he didn’t love everything he did – because that is how God loves us, unconditionally, even if He does not love everything we do.

<b><i>It Once Happened…</i></b><br><i>A water bearer in China had two large pots, each hung on the ends of a pole which he carried across his neck. One of the pots had a crack in it, while the other pot was perfect and always carried its full portion of water from the stream back to the house. But by the end of the long walk from the stream to the house, the cracked pot would only be half full.</i>
<i>For a full two years this went on daily, with the bearer delivering only one and a half pots full of water to the house. Of course, the flawless pot was proud of its accomplishments, perfect for which it was made. But the poor cracked pot was ashamed of its own imperfection, and miserable that it was able to accomplish only half of what it had been made to do.</i>
<i>After two years of what felt to the cracked pot like a bitter failure, it spoke to the water bearer one day by the stream. “Why don’t you throw me out and get a new pot, for the other water pot must be your favourite. I am ashamed of myself, because this crack in my side causes water to leak out all the way back to your house.”</i>
<i>The water bearer smiled and said to the pot, “I have always known about your crack, and I am very fond of it. Did you never notice that there were flowers only on one side of the long path? That’s because I planted flower seeds on your side of the path, and every day while we walk, you’ve watered them. For two years I have been able to pick these beautiful flowers to decorate the table. Without you being just the way you are, there would not be this beauty to grace the house.”</i>
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. What is the message of this story and how is it connected to our</i> parasha?
<i>2. Do you think it is difficult for parents to love two very different children, equally and unconditionally?</i>
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>Yitzḥak’s unconditional love for Esav can be better understood once we examine three extraordinary silences in the Torah. The most pointed one questions, <i>What happened to Yitzḥak after the binding?</i> Look at the text in Bereshit 22 and you will see that as soon as the angel has stopped Avraham from sacrificing his son, Yitzḥak disappears from the story completely. The text tells us that Avraham returns to the two servants who accompanied them to Moria, but there is no mention of Yitzḥak being there too.
This is a glaring mystery, tantalising the commentators. Some go so far as to say that Yitzḥak actually died at the binding and was brought back to life.
The second silence follows the death of Sara. We read that Avraham came to mourn for Sara and weep for her. But the primary mourner in Judaism is the child. It should have been Yitzḥak leading the mourning. But he is not mentioned at all in chapter 23 when we read of Sara’s death and its consequences.
The third missing conversation is in the narrative in which Avraham instructed his servant to find a wife for his son. There is no record in the text that Avraham consulted with Yitzḥak, or even informed him. Avraham knew that a wife was being sought for Yitzḥak; Avraham’s servant knew, but we have no idea as to whether Yitzḥak knew and whether he had any thoughts on the subject. Did he want to get married? Did he have any particular preference as to what his wife should be like? The text is silent. Only when the servant returns with his wife-to-be, Rivka, does Yitzḥak enter the narrative at all.
Another detail at this point in the text is significant: “Yitzḥak had come from Be’er Laḥai Ro’i.” What was this place? We have encountered it only once before. It is where the angel appeared to Hagar when, pregnant, she fled from Sara who was treating her harshly (Bereshit 16:14). An ingenious midrash says that when Yitzḥak heard that Avraham had sent his servant to find a wife for him, he said to himself, “Can I live with a wife while my father lives alone? I will go and return Hagar to him.” A later text tells us that “after Avraham’s death, God blessed his son Yitzḥak, who then lived near Be’er Laḥai Ro’i” (Bereshit 25:11). On this, the midrash says that even after his father’s death, Yitzḥak lived near Hagar and treated her with respect.
What does all this mean? We can only speculate. But if the silences mean something, they suggest that <i>even an aborted sacrifice still has a victim</i>. Yitzḥak may not have died physically, but the text seems to make him disappear, literarily, through three scenes in which his presence should have been central. He should have been there to meet with the two servants on his safe return from Mount Moria. He should have been there to mourn his departed mother Sara. He should have been there to at least discuss, with his father and his father’s servant, his future wife. Yitzḥak did not die on the mountain, but it seems as if something in him did perish, only to be revived when he married. The text tells us that Rivka “became his wife, and he loved her; and Yitzḥak was comforted after his mother’s death.”
That seems to be the message of the silences. The meaning of Be’er Laḥai Ro’i seems to be that Yitzḥak never forgot how Hagar and her son – his half-brother – Yishmael had been sent away. The midrash says that Yitzḥak reunited Hagar with Avraham after Sara’s death. The biblical text tells us that Yitzḥak and Yishmael stood together at Avraham’s grave (Bereshit 25:9). Somehow the divided family was reunited, seemingly at the instigation of Yitzḥak.
If this is so, then Yitzḥak’s love for Esav is easily explained. It is as if Yitzḥak had said to himself: I know what Esav is. He is strong, wild, unpredictable, possibly violent. It is impossible that he should be the person entrusted with the covenant and its spiritual demands. <i>But this is my child</i>. I refuse to sacrifice him, as my father almost sacrificed me. I refuse to send him away, as my parents sent Hagar and Yishmael away. My love for my son is unconditional. I do not ignore who or what he is. But I will love him anyway, even if I do not love everything he does – because that is how God loves us, unconditionally, even if He does not love everything we do. I will bless him. I will hold him close. And I believe that one day that love may make him a better person than he might otherwise have been.
In this one act of loving Esav, Yitzḥak redeemed the pain of two of the most difficult moments in his father Avraham’s life: the sending away of Hagar and Yishmael and the binding of Yitzḥak.
<b>I believe that love helps heal both the lover and the loved.</b>
<b>QUESTION TO PONDER</b>
<i>How did love heal and redeem Yitzḥak?</i>
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>Love is the energy God has planted in the human heart, redeeming us from narcissism and solipsism, making the human or Divine Other no less real to me than I am to myself, thus grounding our being in that-which-is-not-me. One cannot love God without loving all that is good in the human situation.

<b>EDUCATIONAL COMPANION TO THE QUESTIONS</b>
<b><i>IN A NUTSHELL</i></b><br>This is a tricky one! Clearly, this is a case of choosing between competing values, and they believed they were doing what was in the best interest of the (future) Jewish people. There does not seem to be any suggestion that this was for personal gain. Judaism believes in the values of truth and honesty and when it comes to relationships, honesty is always the best policy. Furthermore, according to the way Rabbi Sacks reads the story, Yitzḥak had more awareness of the situation than Rivka and Yaakov gave him credit for. In the end, both Yaakov and Esav received the appropriate blessings for them, and Yaakov ultimately became the next of the forefathers of the Jewish people. According to Rabbi Sacks, that was Yitzḥak’s plan all along.
<b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>While we would like to believe there is an inherent human inclination to be a good and loving parent, some parents struggle with this. All humans are fallible, and all parents make mistakes. The norm in all societies (as well as the animal world) is that parents find it natural to love and care for their children. Of course, every single child deserves (and needs) to be unconditionally loved, and where this is not the case, the state will often intervene in order to provide a nurturing and loving environment from somewhere else.
Sometimes this story is interpreted in a way that suggests that Yitzḥak loved Esav more than Yaakov, and Rivka loved Yaakov more than Esav. Rabbi Sacks is suggesting a significantly different approach. Yitzḥak’s love for both his sons may well have been the same, but his parenting of them was different. And this is the ideal approach to parenting. Every child is different and has different needs, and a good parent will understand that and work hard to parent each of their children in a unique way for them, to meet their individual needs.
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br>This beautiful story illustrates an example of a difference being appreciated not as a flaw but a value. If we see this story as an allegory for a parent with two children, it shows how a parent can love differently but equally, something the child will probably not be able to fully understand until they themselves become a parent. Unconditional parental love is at the centre of the way Rabbi Sacks understands the story in our <i>parasha</i>.
While good parenting takes hard work and effort, parental love is a force of nature, and the norm in human (and animal) society is that love governs parent-child relationships in a natural and powerful way. The difficulty may be in remembering to observe the children as they grow and change, and adapt to their different needs, appreciating that each child is on a different journey, and their gifts may need to be nurtured in individual ways.
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>The silences identified in the Torah text suggest that Yitzḥak was broken from his experience of the <i>Akeida</i> (the Binding of Yitzḥak). It was only through ensuring that he showed unconditional love to his own son that he felt vindicated and redeemed from his own pain. He expressed this in his unconditional love for Esav.
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>It is important not to judge others when we are not in a position to understand their reality. However, we do hold up our forefathers and foremothers as role models, despite their flaws (which the Torah does not shy away from highlighting). Rabbi Sacks’s approach to the story here highlights Yitzḥak’s good parenting approach – taking a tailored, unique parenting approach to each child, based on unconditional love.
We cannot be sure, but it seems implied that Yitzḥak’s brokenness, expressed in his disappearance from the text until he re-enters the story with his marriage to Rivka, was due to the experience of almost being sacrificed. Perhaps the knowledge that his father Avraham was willing to sacrifice him, and prioritise his love for God over his duty as a parent and love for his son, caused his silence and absence from the story. Yitzḥak’s pain was only redeemed when he himself had the chance to be a parent, and prioritise his love for his sons above everything else. This was a cathartic closure for him.
Implied in the approach we are taking here to the story is an implicit critique of Avraham’s parenting. Perhaps Avraham did not show unconditional love for his son, and Yitzḥak believed that the basis of parenting must be unconditional love. It is a common phenomenon that children choose to parent differently from their own parents, even while showing compassion and understanding for their parents’ “mistakes.”

II; The Courage of Persistence

<big><strong>II. The Courage of Persistence</strong></big><br><b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>In Bereshit 21, we read about an argument that arose over a well that Avraham had dug: “Then Avraham complained to Avimelekh about a well of water that Avimelekh’s servants had seized” (v. 25). The two men make a treaty. Unfortunately, this was not sufficient to prevent further difficulties for his son. Yitzḥak becomes rich from God’s blessings, causing envy among the Philistines. They fill up the wells that Yitzḥak’s father Avraham had dug, and then Avimelekh commands Yitzḥak to “move away from us; you have become too powerful for us” (26:16). Yitzḥak leaves the city and camps in the Valley of Gerar. He reopens the wells that his father had dug, and renames them with the same names. Two of these wells once again cause tension with the local people there in the valley who claim the water for themselves. But the third well causes no arguing, so he names it Reḥovot and says, “Now the Lord has given us room [from the same root as ‘Reḥovot’] and we will flourish in the land” (Bereshit 26:22).
Yitzḥak’s response in this story is inspiring. Defeated once, he tries again. He digs another well; this too produces opposition. So he moves on again, and eventually creates peace. How fitting it is that the town in Israel that today carries the name of this third well, Reḥovot, is a large bustling modern city. Israel Belkind, one of the founders of the settlement in 1890, called it Reḥovot precisely because of the verse in our <i>parasha</i>: “He named it Reḥovot, saying, ‘Now the Lord has given us room and we will flourish in the land.’”
Yitzḥak is the least original of the three patriarchs. His life lacks the drama of Avraham or the struggles of Yaakov. We see in this passage that Yitzḥak himself did not strive to be innovative, digging the same wells and naming them with the same names as his father. Often, we try to make ourselves distinctive from our parents. We do things differently, or even if we don’t, we give them different names. Yitzḥak was not like this. He was content to be a link in the chain of generations, faithful to what his father had started.
Yitzḥak represents the faith of persistence, the courage of continuity. He was the first Jewish child, and he represents the single greatest challenge of being a Jewish child: to continue the journey our ancestors began, rather than drifting from it. And Yitzḥak, because of that faith, was able to achieve the most elusive of goals, namely peace – because he never gave up. When one effort failed, he began again. So it is with all great achievements: one part originality, nine parts persistence.

<b><i>It Once Happened…</i></b><br><i>It once happened that Ḥoni the Circle Drawer was walking along the way and he saw an old man planting a young fruit tree. Ḥoni asked the man how long it would take until the tree would produce fruit. “Seventy years,” the old man answered him. “Do you really think you will be alive for another seventy years so you can enjoy the fruit from this tree?” Ḥoni asked the man with wonder.

<b><i>Taanit</i> 23a</b>
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. Who is the man planting the tree focused on, his ancestors before him or his descendants who will come after him? Or both?</i>
<i>2. What connection can you see between this story and</i> The Core Idea<i> above?</i>
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>Along with the idea contained in <i>The Core Idea</i> above, there are two further aspects of this passage in the <i>parasha</i> worthy of careful attention. The first is the hint it gives us of what will later be the turning point of the fate of the Israelites in Egypt. Avimelekh says, “You have become <i>too powerful</i> for us.” Centuries later, Pharaoh says, at the beginning of the book of Shemot, “Behold, the people of the children of Israel are greater in number and <i>power</i> than we are. Come on, let us deal wisely with them…and get them out of the land” (Shemot 1:9–10). The same word, <i>atzum</i>, “power/powerful,” appears in both cases. Our passage signals the birth of one of the deadliest of human phenomena, antisemitism.
Antisemitism is in some respects unique. It is, in Robert Wistrich’s phrase, the world’s longest hatred. No other prejudice has lasted so long, mutated so persistently, attracted such demonic myths, or had such devastating effects. But in other respects it is not unique, and we must try to understand it as best we can.
One of the best books about antisemitism is in fact not about antisemitism at all, but about similar phenomena in other contexts, Amy Chua’s <i>World on Fire</i>. Her thesis is that any conspicuously successful minority will attract envy that may deepen into hate and provoke violence. All three conditions are essential. The hated group must be <i>conspicuous</i>, for otherwise it would not be singled out. It must be <i>successful</i>, for otherwise it would not be envied. And it must be a <i>minority</i>, for otherwise it would not be attacked.
All three conditions were present in the case of Yitzḥak. He was conspicuous: he was not a Philistine; he was different from the local population as an outsider, a stranger, someone with a different faith. He was successful: his crops had succeeded a hundredfold, his flocks and herds were large, and the people envied him. And he was a minority: a single family in the midst of the local population. All the ingredients were present for the presence of hostility and hate.
There is a second aspect of our passage that has had reverberations through the centuries: the self-destructive nature of hate. The Philistines did not ask Yitzḥak to share his water with them. They did not ask him to teach them how he (and his father) had discovered a source of water that they – residents of the place – had not. They did not even simply ask him to move on. They “stopped up” the wells, “filling them with earth.” This act harmed them more than it harmed Yitzḥak. It robbed them of a resource that would have become theirs, once the famine had ended and Yitzḥak had returned home. More than hate destroys the hated, it destroys the hater.
But Yitzḥak refused to lose the faith of persistence (see <i>The Core Idea</i> above). I find it moving that Yitzḥak, who underwent so many trials, from the binding when he was young, to the rivalry between his sons when he was old and blind, carries a name that means “he will laugh.” Perhaps the name – given to him by God Himself before Yitzḥak was born – means what the psalm means when it says, “Those who sow in tears will reap with joy” (Tehillim 126:5). Faith means the courage to persist through all the setbacks, all the grief, never giving up, never accepting defeat. For at the end, despite the opposition, the envy and the hate, lie the broad spaces, Reḥovot, and the laughter, Yitzḥak: the serenity of the destination after the storms along the way.
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>Historically, antisemitism has been hard to define, because it expresses itself in such contradictory ways. Before the Holocaust, Jews were hated because they were poor and because they were rich; because they were Communists and because they were capitalists; because they kept to themselves and because they infiltrated everywhere; because they clung to ancient religious beliefs and because they were rootless cosmopolitans who believed nothing.
So what is antisemitism? Let’s be clear – not liking people because they’re different isn’t antisemitism. It’s xenophobia. Criticising Israel isn’t antisemitism: it’s part of the democratic process, and Israel is a democracy. Antisemitism is something much more dangerous – it means persecuting Jews and denying them the right to exist collectively as Jews with the same rights as everyone else.
It’s a prejudice that, like a virus, has survived over time by mutating. So in the Middle Ages, Jews were persecuted because of their religion. In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries they were reviled because of their race. Today, Jews are attacked because of the existence of their nation state, Israel. Denying Israel’s right to exist is the new antisemitism.
And just as antisemitism has mutated, so has its legitimisation. Each time, as the persecution descended into barbarity, the persecutors reached for the highest form of justification available. In the Middle Ages, it was religion. In post-Enlightenment Europe it was science: the so-called scientific study of race. Today it is human rights. Whenever you hear human rights invoked to deny Israel’s right to exist, you are hearing the new antisemitism….
Antisemitism is about the inability of a group to make space for difference. And because we are all different, the hate that begins with Jews never ends with Jews…. Antisemitism is the world’s most reliable early warning sign of a major threat to freedom, humanity, and the dignity of difference. It matters to all of us. Which is why we must fight it together.

<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>Is there a middle child in your family? What challenges do you think a middle child has to face in the family dynamic? Do you think Yitzḥak felt like a middle child?
Do you think persistence and continuity can be described as heroic and courageous?
Is it more heroic and courageous to blaze your own path or to continue in the path of your parents/ancestors who went before you?
<b>EDUCATIONAL COMPANION TO THE QUESTIONS</b>
<b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>It is natural for every child to answer yes to both and feel some tension between the two. While it is a natural and important part of growing up for adolescents to want to rebel and challenge the conventions of the upbringing they experience in their parents’ home, and forge a different path, it is equally normal for them to want to be like their parents. Challenge your child/student to connect to both ideas from a personal vantage point.
This concept is a core value of Judaism, and is one of the explanations for the miraculous history of Jewish continuity against all the odds. However, that is not to say that this is obvious for an adolescent and an easy value to connect to, especially as it demands sacrifice and difficult life choices. Challenge your child/student to evaluate this value and to connect to it on a personal level.
Both paths can be seen as heroic and courageous, and while it is easier to relate to the trailblazer as courageous, Rabbi Sacks gives Yitzḥak and the child who chooses to continue the legacy of his/her parents/ancestors dignity and worth. Try to do the same in your discussion on this point.
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br>There is a dual focus here. The man is clearly concerned with the world his descendants will inherit and therefore, despite his old age and the unlikelihood that he will benefit from the fruits of his labour, he still strives to improve the world for them by planting a carob tree. However, he also displays an awareness of, and gratitude for, his ancestors who did the same for their world and therefore for his. The story presents both the value of concern and responsibility for future generations, as well as the value and responsibility to continue the legacy of previous generations.
These values, responsibility for future generations and for the continuation of the legacy of previous generations, can be seen in the way that Rabbi Sacks explores Yitzḥak’s character and life story. He could be seen as someone who lived the same life as his father without achieving anything significant himself. But Rabbi Sacks sees him as a someone who continues his father’s legacy in order to be a link in the chain without which future generations would not exist.
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>Sadly, reported incidents of antisemitism are on the rise the world over, especially in Europe and the United States. While previous generations have believed that we live in a (post-Holocaust) world where antisemitism and even racism can no longer exist, it is hard to imagine anyone feeling that way today.
Obviously there are no wrong answers to this question. Jews believe that one day the world will live in a redeemed state where there will no longer be conflict or hatred (Messianic times). The question is whether it is mankind’s responsibility to bring this about (and with it the Messianic time period) or whether this redemption will be divinely orchestrated. Either way, it is an act of faith to believe this will happen one day, and this is something to explore with your child/student – what do they believe is the destiny of humanity?
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>Middle-child syndrome is when middle children feel excluded, ignored, or even neglected because of their birth order. A middle child will sometimes feel unloved or unnoticed, as they are forced to compete with both the oldest and youngest child. The oldest child is seen as more mature and closer to an adult, and often given extra responsibilities and privileges. The youngest child is often over-protected and indulged as the baby, the status that the middle child loses with their birth. Yitzḥak had to follow in the footsteps of his great father, the progenitor of our nation, the iconoclast, who trailblazed a new path in the world. It is easy to imagine that this must have defined his life and life choices. Yaakov perhaps felt less pressure being one generation removed, freer to make his own way in the world – and he did just that. Although Yitzḥak had no way of knowing the impact Yaakov would make, for us, we see Yitzḥak as the middle of our three patriarchs, with the challenge that presents. Ask your child/student to try and relate to the middle child in their family and Yitzḥak who faced the same challenges.
There is a dignity and perhaps courage in continuing a legacy. This <i>Covenant &amp; Conversation</i> essay extends that to Yitzḥak, and in your discussion you can find other examples from life to do the same.
This is an open question with no incorrect answers. There is courage in both, and it is important to extend the same dignity and value to someone who chooses to continue in the path of previous generations (a Jewish core value modelled by Yitzḥak), as well as those who blaze their own trail even in opposition to the generally accepted norms of society (as modelled by Avraham).

Vayeitze

In a Nutshell

<b><i>IN A NUTSHELL</i></b><br>In this <i>parasha</i>, Yaakov ran away from home because his brother Esav had promised to kill him for sneakily getting the firstborn’s blessing from his father. On his way to his Uncle Lavan’s home in Ḥaran, he stopped for the night on Mount Moria. While asleep, he dreamed of angels climbing up and down a ladder that reached heaven. During this vision, God promised that he would become father to many children and that his family would inherit the land of Israel.
He awoke and realised it was a prophetic dream, then continued his journey towards Ḥaran. He met Raḥel, the daughter of Lavan, at a nearby well, and fell in love with her. Raḥel had an older sister called Leah. Lavan agreed to let Yaakov marry Raḥel (although she was the younger sister) if Yaakov worked for him for seven years. After the wedding finally took place, Yaakov realised that Lavan had tricked him and he had really married Leah. Lavan said that he had done this because the custom was to marry the older child first, but if Yaakov agreed to another seven years of work, he could also marry Raḥel. They married, but both Raḥel and Leah became unhappy. Leah felt unloved, but had many children (six sons and one daughter). Raḥel was deeply loved by Yaakov, but could not have children. Both wives asked their maidservants to also be wives to Yaakov, and Yaakov became father to four more sons. Eventually Raḥel had her first child, a son who she called Yosef.
There was tension between Yaakov and Lavan over the flocks, as Lavan often changed the agreement of who owned which sheep. Eventually Yaakov decided to leave with his wives and children. Lavan followed behind and tried to stop him, but they finally parted ways in peace, and twenty years after leaving home, the four wives, twelve children, and all their sheep journeyed together, led by Yaakov, towards the place of his birth – Israel.

I; Lavan the Aramean

<big><strong>I. Lavan the Aramean</strong></big><br><b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>The Sages understood something important about the stories of the patriarchs and matriarchs. They explained it using this principle: <i>Maase avot siman lebanim</i>, “What happened to the parents was a sign for the children.” They saw that certain stories in Bereshit must be seen as an early forerunner, a parallel to similar, later events.
The classic example is in Bereshit 12 when, almost immediately after arriving in the land of Canaan, Avraham and Sara were forced into exile in Egypt. Avraham’s life was at risk. Sara was taken by Pharaoh. God then struck Pharaoh’s household with plagues, and Pharaoh sent them away. The parallels between this and the story of the Exodus are obvious.
Something similar happened again to Avraham and Sara later on in Gerar (Bereshit 20), as it did, also in Gerar, to Yitzḥak and Rivka (Bereshit 26). But did Yaakov undergo his own earlier version of the Exodus? We know that he did, late in life, go down to Egypt with his family. But this was not in anticipation of the Exodus. It was the Exodus itself.
Earlier, in our <i>parasha</i>, he was in exile after he ran away from home to live with his uncle, Lavan. But this was not because of famine, it was from fear of Esav. Nor was it to a land of strangers. He was travelling to his mother’s own family. Yaakov <i>seems</i> to be the only one of the patriarchs <i>not</i> to live out in advance the experience of exile and exodus.
The Sages, however, realised otherwise. Living with Lavan, he lost his freedom. He became, in effect, his father-in-law’s slave. Eventually he had to escape, without letting Lavan know he was going. He knew that, if he could, Lavan would keep him in his household as a kind of prisoner.
In this respect, Yaakov’s experience was closer to the Exodus than that of Avraham or Yitzḥak. No one stopped Avraham or Yitzḥak from leaving. No one chased after them. And no one treated them badly. It was Yaakov’s experience in the house of Lavan that was the closest experience to the actual Exodus. “What happened to the parents was a sign for the children.”

<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>Yaakov’s flight to Lavan, his stay there, and his escape, pursued by his father-in-law, gave rise to a strange passage in the Haggada: “<i>Arami oved avi</i>. Go and learn what Lavan the Aramean sought to do to our father Yaakov, for Pharaoh condemned only the boys to death, but Lavan sought to uproot everything.”
There are three problems with this text. <b>First</b>, it understands the words <i>Arami oved avi</i> to mean “[Lavan] an Aramean [tried to] destroy my father.” But the phrase, literally translated, means “My father was a wandering Aramean.” The “father” refers to either Yaakov (Ibn Ezra, Sforno), or Avraham (Rashbam), or all the patriarchs (Shadal). Aram was the region from which Avraham set out to travel to Canaan, and to which Yaakov fled to escape the anger of Esav. The general sense of the phrase is that the patriarchs had no land and no permanent home. They were vulnerable. They were nomads. Lavan <i>does not appear in the verse at all</i>, except by a very forced reading.
<b>Second</b>, there is no evidence that Lavan the Aramean actually harmed Yaakov. Pharaoh, by contrast, did not merely contemplate doing evil to the Israelites; he actually did so, ordering the killing of every male baby and enslaving everyone.
<b>Third</b>, and most fundamental: the Seder night is dedicated to retelling the story of the Exodus. We are charged to remember it, engrave it on the hearts of our children. Why then diminish the miracle by saying in effect: “Egypt? That was nothing compared to Lavan!”
All this is very strange indeed. Let me suggest an explanation. We have here a phrase with two quite different meanings, depending on the context in which we read it.
Originally the text of <i>Arami oved avi</i> had nothing to do with Pesaḥ. It appears in the Torah as the text of the declaration to be said on bringing first-fruits to the Temple, which normally happened on Shavuot.
Then you shall declare before the Lord your God: “<i>My father was a wandering Aramean,</i> and he went down into Egypt…. Then the Lord brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm…. He brought us to this place and gave us this land, a land flowing with milk and honey; and now I bring the first-fruits of the soil that You, Lord, have given me” (Devarim 26:5–10).
In the context of first-fruits, the literal translation, “My father was a wandering Aramean,” makes absolute sense. The text is contrasting the past when the patriarchs were nomads, forced to wander from place to place, with the present when, thanks to God, the Israelites have a land of their own. The contrast is between homelessness and home. But that is specifically when we speak about first-fruits – the produce of the land.
At some stage, however, the passage was placed in another context, namely Pesaḥ, the Seder, and the story of the Exodus. The Mishna specifies that it be read and expounded on Seder night. Almost certainly the reason is that the same (relatively rare) verb <i>h-g-d</i>, from which the word Haggada is derived, occurs both in connection with telling the story of Pesaḥ (Shemot 13:8), and making the first-fruits declaration (Devarim 26:3).
But the reading of the verse found in the Haggada is not easy. The words <i>Arami</i> and <i>oved</i> are radically reinterpreted.
How can we read Lavan into the phrase, <i>Arami oved avi</i>, “A wandering Aramean was my father”? Answer: only Lavan and Lavan’s father Betuel are called <i>Arami</i> or <i>haArami</i> in the whole Torah. Therefore <i>Arami</i> means “Lavan.”
How do we know that he sought to do Yaakov harm? Because God appeared to him at night and said, “Beware of attempting anything with Yaakov, good or bad.” God would not have warned Lavan against doing anything to Yaakov, had Lavan not intended to do so.
How can we read this into the verse? Because the root <i>a-v-d,</i> which means “lost, wandering,” might also, in the <i>pi’el</i> or <i>hifil</i> grammatical tenses, mean “to destroy.” Of course, Lavan did not destroy “my father” or anyone else. But that was because of divine intervention. Hence the phrase could be taken to mean “[Lavan] the Aramean [tried to] destroy my father.” This is how Rashi understands it.
What then are we to make of the statement, “Pharaoh condemned only the boys to death, but Lavan sought to uproot everything”? The answer is not that Lavan sought to kill all the members of Yaakov’s family. Quite the opposite. He said to Yaakov: “The women are my daughters, the children are my children, and the flocks are my flocks. All you see is mine” (Bereshit 31:43). Yaakov had worked for some twenty years to earn his family and flocks. Yet Lavan still claimed they were his own. Had God not intervened, he would have kept Yaakov’s entire family as prisoners. That is how he “sought to uproot everything” by denying them all the chance to go free.
This interpretation of <i>Arami oved avi</i> is not the plain sense. But the plain sense related this passage to the bringing of the first-fruits. It was the genius of the Sages to give it an interpretation that connected it with Pesaḥ and the Exodus. And though it gives a far-fetched reading of the phrase, it gives a compelling interpretation to the entire narrative of Yaakov in Lavan’s house. It tells us that the third of the patriarchs, whose descent to Egypt would actually begin the story of the Exodus, had himself undergone an exodus experience in his youth.
<i>Maase avot siman lebanim</i>, “What happened to the parents is a sign for the children,” tells us that what is happening now has happened before. That does not mean that danger is to be treated lightly. But it does mean that we should never despair. Avraham, Yitzḥak, Yaakov, and their wives experienced exile and exodus as if to say to their descendants: This is not unknown territory. God was with us then; He will be with you now.
<b>I believe that we can face the future without fear because we have been here before and because we are not alone.</b>
<b>QUESTION TO PONDER</b>
<i>How does</i> Maase avot siman lebanim<i> help us to face our future?</i>
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>I am a Jew because, being a child of my people, I have heard the call to add my chapter to its unfinished story. I am a stage on its journey, a connecting link between the generations. The dreams and hopes of my ancestors live on in me, and I am the guardian of their trust, now and for the future.
<b><i>A Letter in the Scroll,</i> 217</b>
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>Was Lavan a bad person?
Why do you think the author of the Haggada chose this biblical passage (<i>Arami oved avi</i>) to begin the telling of the story of the Exodus?
What can we learn for our lives today from the concept of <i>Maase avot siman lebanim</i>?
<b>EDUCATIONAL COMPANION TO THE QUESTIONS</b>
<b><i>IN A NUTSHELL</i></b><br>The philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche famously said, “He who has a ‘Why’ in life can bear almost any ‘How.’” Yaakov was driven by the knowledge that he was an integral part of the plan for the covenant between God and his grandfather Avraham and father Yitzḥak, as God had told him directly when this covenant was renewed with him. He had deep faith that the covenant would ultimately be fulfilled despite the twists and turns of his life. The fact that similar chaotic events had precedence in the lives of his father and grandfather allowed him to feel the presence of God, which imbued his life with purpose and faith.
<b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>It is reassuring to understand that personal and national events have occurred previously, and that our ancestors have come through these events with the guidance and protection of God. Despite the trepidation and fear that a meandering narrative can cause, precedence in history provides a foundation for faith in our future.
There are themes that repeat themselves throughout Jewish history. These include antisemitism, persecution, expulsion, and exile, as well as resilience, creativity, golden ages, return, and redemption. In our generation we are witnessing a resurgence of antisemitism that seems all too familiar, but we can also reflect on the resilience, creativity, and golden ages of Jewish communities around the world, as well as a strong homeland dedicated to the well-being of Jews wherever they live.
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br><i>Zekhut avot</i> suggests that our lives are influenced by the merits of our ancestors. Because God had a close relationship with our forefathers, and committed to a covenantal relationship with them and their descendants, our national narrative is influenced by God for the positive. <i>Maase avot siman lebanim</i> is a related concept, but not identical. It suggests that trials and tribulations in our national story have been faced by previous generations, and just as God protected our ancestors, so He will be with us, and we will prevail.
Newton said this in reference to scientific knowledge and progress. Every generation makes scientific discoveries and technological advances, but they do so based on the knowledge and understanding of the previous generations. The concepts of <i>zekhut avot</i> and<i> Maase avot siman lebanim</i> are the spiritual equivalent of this. Our relationship with God and the role He plays in our national story has its foundation in His relationship with our ancestors.
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>Facing an uncertain future takes courage and faith. <i>Maase avot siman lebanim</i> helps us with that. Whatever we may encounter, the knowledge that as a nation we have already faced the same trials and challenges is reassuring. Just as God was there accompanying us then, He too will be with us in the future. Believing this provides a strong foundation for us to find the faith and courage necessary to face an uncertain future.
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>The Torah describes Lavan as a wheeler-dealer willing to use trickery to his own advantage. But does this make him a bad person? Rabbi Sacks here suggests that he did seek to do Yaakov harm. We know this because “God appeared to him at night and said, ‘Beware of attempting anything with Yaakov, good or bad.’ God would not have warned Lavan against doing anything to Yaakov had Lavan not intended to do so.” Perhaps Lavan’s greatest crime here was that despite the fact that Yaakov had worked for twenty years to earn his family and flocks, Lavan still claimed they were his own, and had God not intervened, he would have kept Yaakov’s entire family as prisoners.
Despite the passage originating from the declaration made at the time of the bringing of the first-fruits, the author of the Haggada chose to incorporate this passage into the <i>Maggid</i> section of the Haggada probably because of the use of the verb <i>h-g-d</i> in the passage, which links the two mitzvot of first-fruits and Seder night. However, the reinterpretation explored here also links the two through the concept of <i>Maase avot siman lebanim,</i> where we now see this narrative as Yaakov’s own exodus experience.
We can learn that there is nothing truly new under the sun and that our national story has a precedent. God made a covenantal commitment to our ancestors and to their descendants, so just as He was always there for our ancestors, He will also be there for us, whatever we face.

II; When the "I" Is Silent

<big><strong>II. When the “I” Is Silent</strong></big><br><b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>In this <i>parasha</i>, Yaakov, alone and far from home, lies down for the night, with only stones for a pillow, and dreams of a ladder set on earth but reaching heaven, with angels ascending and descending. Yaakov calls the dream an encounter with the “house of God,” hinting that this is the future location of the Temple, which will be a model for our “house of God” today, the synagogue. This was the first dream of a “gate of heaven” that would allow access to a God who stands above, letting us know finally that “God is truly in this place.”
There is, though, something strange in the Hebrew text that is lost in translation, and it took the hasidic masters to remind us of it. The word <i>yadati</i> means “I knew,” and <i>lo yadati</i>, “I did not know.” When Yaakov wakes from his sleep, however, he says, “Surely the Lord is in this place <i>ve’anokhi lo yadati</i>.” <i>Anokhi</i> means “I,” which in this sentence is superfluous. To translate it literally we would have to say, “And I, I knew it not.” Why the double “I”?
To this, Rabbi Pinchas Horowitz (<i>Panim Yafot</i>) gave a magnificent answer. How, he asks, do we come to know that God is in this place? By <i>ve’anokhi lo yadati</i> – not knowing the I. We know God when we forget the self. We sense the “Thou” of the Divine Presence when we move beyond the “I” of egocentricity (thinking about yourself first). Only when we stop thinking about ourselves do we become truly open to the world and the Creator.
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. Have you ever been so engrossed in something that you have forgotten where you are and what time it is? Have you ever forgotten who you are for a split second?</i>
<i>2. Can you think of a day in the Jewish calendar when Jewish law makes demands on us designed to do just this – ignore ourselves and only concentrate on the world and the Creator?</i>
<i>3. Why do you think being focused on ourselves makes it harder to pray or establish a deeper relationship with God?</i>
<b><i>It Once Happened…</i></b><br><i>The hasidic master Rabbi Simcha Bunim of Peschischa used to say to his students: “Everyone must have two pockets, with a note in each pocket, so that he or she can reach into the one or the other, depending on the need. When feeling low, discouraged, or disconsolate, one should reach into the right pocket and, there, find the words:</i> For my sake was the world created.<i> But when feeling high and mighty one should reach into the left pocket and find the words:</i> I am but dust and ashes.”
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. What is the message of this story? How is it connected to</i> The Core Idea<i> above?</i>
<i>2. Which of the two notes do you think is more important to focus on? Can they both be true at the same time?</i>
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>The idea presented in <i>The Core Idea</i> above gives us insight into some of the great questions about prayer: What difference does it make? Does it really change God? Surely God does not change. Besides which, does not prayer contradict the most fundamental principle of faith, which is that we are called on to do God’s will rather than ask God to do ours? What really happens when we pray?
Prayer has two dimensions, and the first is a mysterious one. In times of crisis we cry out from the depths of our soul, and something happens. Sometimes we only realise it later, when looking back. Prayer makes a difference to the world – but how it does so is mysterious.
There is, however, a second dimension which is non-mysterious. Less than prayer changes the world, it changes us. The Hebrew verb <i>lehitpallel</i>, meaning “to pray,” is reflexive, implying an action done to oneself. Literally, it means “to judge oneself.” It means to escape from the prison of the self and see the world, including ourselves, from the outside. Prayer is where the relentless first person singular, the “I,” falls silent for a moment and we become aware that we are not the centre of the universe. There is a reality outside. That is a moment of transformation.
If we could only stop asking the question, “How does this affect me?” we would see that we are surrounded by miracles. There is the almost infinite complexity and beauty of the natural world. There is the divine word, our greatest legacy as Jews, the library of books we call the Bible. And there is the unparalleled drama, spreading over forty centuries, of the tragedies and triumphs that have befallen the Jewish people. Respectively, these represent the three dimensions of our knowledge of God: creation (God in nature), revelation (God in holy words), and redemption (God in history).
Sometimes it takes a great crisis to make us realise how self-centred we have been. The only question strong enough to endow existence with meaning is not “What do I need from life?” but “What does life need from me?” That is the question we hear when we truly pray. More than an act of speaking, prayer is an act of listening – to what God wants from us, here, now. What we discover – if we are able to create that silence in the soul – is that we are not alone. We are here because someone, the One, wanted us to be, and He has set us a task only we can do. We emerge strengthened, transformed.
More than prayer changes God, it changes us. It lets us see, feel, know that “God is in this place.” How do we reach that awareness? By moving beyond the first person singular, so that for a moment, like Yaakov, we can say, “I know not the I.” In the silence of the “I,” we meet the “Thou” of God.
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>Prayer is our intimate dialogue with Infinity, the profoundest expression of our faith that at the heart of reality is a Presence that cares, a God who listens, a creative Force that brought us into being in love. It is this belief more than any other that redeems life from solitude and fate from tragedy. The universe has a purpose. We have a purpose. However infinitesimal we are, however brief our stay on earth, we matter. The universe is more than particles of matter endlessly revolving in indifferent space. The human person is more than an accidental concatenation of genes blindly replicating themselves. Human life is more than “a tale, told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing” (<i>Macbeth</i> 5.5.26–28). Prayer gives meaning to existence.
It is possible to believe otherwise. There can be a life without faith or prayer, just as there can be a life without love, or laughter, or happiness, or hope. But it is a diminished thing, lacking dimensions of depth and aspiration. Descartes said, “I think, therefore I am.” Judaism says, “I pray, therefore I am not alone.”
It takes courage to believe. Jews need no proof of the apparent injustice of events. It is written on the pages of our history. Jews had no power or earthly glory. For the better part of forty centuries our ancestors lived dispersed throughout the world, without a home, without rights, all too often experiencing persecution and pain. All they had was an invisible God and the line connecting us to Him: the siddur, the words of prayer. All they had was faith. In Judaism, we do not analyse our faith, we pray it. We do not philosophise about truth, we sing it, we <i>daven</i> it. For Judaism, faith becomes real when it becomes prayer.
In prayer we speak to a presence vaster than the unfathomable universe yet closer to us than we are to ourselves: the God beyond who is also the Voice within. Though language must fail when we try to describe a Being beyond all parameters of speech, yet language is all we have, and it is enough. For God who made the world with creative words, and who revealed His will in holy words, listens to our prayerful words. Language is the bridge that joins us to Infinity.
In prayer God becomes not a theory but a Presence, not a fact but a mode of relationship. Prayer is where God meets us, in the human heart, in our offering of words, in our acknowledged vulnerability.

What is the linguistic message behind the grammatical form of the verb “to pray” (<i>lehitpallel</i>)? Do you feel prayer changes you?
<b>EDUCATIONAL COMPANION TO THE QUESTIONS</b>
<b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>This question is describing a condition called “flow,” where you become so engrossed in an activity, you lose a sense of yourself, sometimes momentarily, and sometimes for longer periods of time. This could be while reading a book, watching a movie, or listening to music, or during a more creative activity such as writing, building, or playing music. The idea behind the question is to allow the reader to tap into an experience where they had a short period of self-negation. This will help them connect to the core idea from the <i>Covenant &amp; Conversation</i> essay.
Yom Kippur has five prohibitions, designed to limit the sense of self (and self-enjoyment) to better concentrate on the larger ideas of the day such as the judgement of the world and one’s relationship with God. These prohibitions are eating and drinking; sexual relations; wearing leather shoes; washing; and anointing oneself. (The Rabbis also instituted the same prohibitions on the Ninth of Av to help us focus on the solemn themes of the day, such as national mourning.)
It is human nature to be concerned with and focused on oneself, to the exclusion of other people, the world in general, or God. God transcends our small and finite lives, so focusing on oneself is a barrier to connecting to the infinite and transcendental Divine. Having said that, <i>tefilla</i> (Jewish prayer) is a realistic and healthy balance between these two poles. Much of prayer, especially during the weekday <i>Amida</i> (the standing prayer at the core of all three daily prayer services) focuses on our individual, national, and universal needs. Judaism represents a balance between our own needs and concerns and the infinite divine, as will be seen further on in this <i>Covenant &amp; Conversation</i> essay.
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br>The story represents the need for a balance between self-negation (“I am but dust and ashes”), which will prevent pride and arrogance and allow more space for building a relationship with God, and the dignity of the human being that is found in the knowledge that, as is stated in Bereshit, all mankind is created in the divine image (“For my sake was the world created”). The dignity and sense of self-worth that this affords every human being is also a core value in Judaism, and the story encourages each person to find an equilibrium between these two poles in order to live a balanced and fulfilling life connected to God and humanity. <i>The Core Idea</i> asks the reader to understand the need for self-limitation and negation in order to build a relationship with God based on prayer. However, there is a danger when this is taken to an extreme, so the story represents a healthy balanced approach inspired by Jewish values.
The answer to this could depend on the natural inclination of the individual. Those who are prone to lack self-esteem should focus on the note that the words, “For my sake was the world created” are written on, and those prone to arrogance should focus on the note with the words, “I am but dust and ashes.” Ask your child/student to analyse their own personality to answer this question and encourage them to consider the appropriateness of a balanced approach between the two.
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>These include: silencing the “I”; mysterious prayer (when God responds to our prayers); non-mysterious prayer (when we respond to our prayers); prayer as intimate dialogue with Infinity; prayer as the profoundest expression of our faith; prayer that redeems life from solitude and fate from tragedy; prayer as a declaration that the universe has a purpose and that we have a purpose; prayer as the song of truth; that in prayer God becomes not a theory but a Presence; that prayer is where God meets us, in the human heart.
Encourage your child/student/friend/family/self to analyse their own prayer, and if none of these speak to them, make sure they volunteer another mode of prayer as meaningful to them. If prayer is not meaningful to them in any way, ask them to articulate why.
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>Much has been written and researched about the dangers of the iGen generation growing up in the world of smartphones and selfies, and much of it revolves around a sense of self and self-worth being heightened to the extreme. Having a more balanced approach to the self will avoid some of the ills in society and difficulties that the people of this generation are experiencing in finding their place in the world. Having said that, too much self-negation can also lead to the secondary issues that come from low self-esteem. On a societal level, a society that negates the individual can lead to totalitarianism and other evils. The Jewish approach attempts to find a suitable median.
While we do believe that God is a personal God who acts in history for our benefit, on a personal, national, and universal level, God transcends the universe itself. To connect to an infinite transcendental God, one must be able to focus and connect to the world beyond the self.
<i>Lehitpallel</i>, to pray, comes from the Hebrew root <i>p-l-l</i> which means “to judge” (or “criminal” in modern Hebrew). It is in the reflexive grammatical form (<i>lehitpallel</i>) and therefore this process is happening to oneself. So prayer on some level is self-judgement. When you stand before God and list your needs and deepest wishes, you are forced to examine your life, your needs, your dependencies, and your worthiness. This process is self-judgement. This can mean that prayer is a transformational act. For some, prayer can lead to a greater sense of humility engendered from an acknowledgement of dependency and need, or it can foster a deep connection to the Jewish people across time and space, or prayer may be a powerful spiritual and meditative experience.

Vayishlach

In a Nutshell

<b><i>IN A NUTSHELL</i></b><br>In this <i>parasha</i>, we read the story of Yaakov and Esav’s reunion. After many years of separation, Yaakov hears that his brother is on his way to meet him with an army of four hundred men. So he decides to do three things: (1) He divides his camp into two separate groups. (2) He prays to God for help. (3) He sends servants to deliver gifts to Esav.
That night he is attacked by a mysterious stranger, whom he fights. He refuses to let the stranger go until he is given a blessing. Instead, the stranger gives Yaakov a new name – Yisrael, which means “Someone who fights with God and with men and wins.” Our Rabbis teach us that Yaakov had been renamed by an angel.
The next day the two brothers meet, and hug. Yaakov had been scared they would fight but instead there is only love between them.
The <i>parasha</i> ends with the death of Yitzḥak and a list of all of the descendants of Esav.
<b>QUESTION TO PONDER</b>
<i>What do you think was going through Yaakov’s mind when Esav was approaching?</i>

I; No Longer Shall You Be Called Yaakov

<big><strong>I. No Longer Shall You Be Called Yaakov</strong></big><br><b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>After his wrestling match with the angel, Yaakov was told: “<i>No longer will your name be Yaakov</i>, but Yisrael, for you have struggled with God and with men, and have won” (Bereshit 32:29). This new name is in fact given a second time in our <i>parasha</i>. After his meeting with Esav, and the story of Dina and Shekhem, God tells Yaakov to go to Beit El. Then we read: “After Yaakov returned from Padan Aram, God appeared to him again and blessed him. God said to him, ‘Your name is Yaakov, but <i>you will no longer be called Yaakov</i>; your name will be Yisrael.’ So He named him Yisrael” (Bereshit 35:9–10).
This is not an adjustment of an existing name by the change or addition of a letter, like when God changed Avram’s name to Avraham, or Sarai’s to Sara. It is an entirely new name, as if to say that this will be a complete change of character. It is therefore puzzling that having said twice that his name will no longer be Yaakov,<i> the Torah continues to call him Yaakov</i>. God Himself does so. So do we, every time we pray to the God of Avraham, Yitzḥak, and Yaakov. How can this be when the Torah twice tells us that his name will no longer be Yaakov?
The Radak suggests that “Your name will no longer be called Yaakov” means “Your name will no longer <i>only</i> be called Yaakov.” You will have another name as well. This is clever, but it certainly is not the plain meaning of the verse. Sforno says, “In the Messianic Age, your name will no longer be called Yaakov.” This is also difficult. The future tense in the Torah generally means the near future, not the distant one, unless clearly specified.
A third approach is to read this not as a statement but as a request, a challenge, an invitation. Read it not as “You <i>will</i> no longer be called Yaakov but Yisrael.” Instead read it as “<i>Let</i> your name no longer be Yaakov but Yisrael,” meaning don’t be what the name Yaakov represents, rather be what the name Yisrael represents.
So the question is, what do the names Yaakov and Yisrael represent?

<b><i>It Once Happened…</i></b><br><i>They say the chances of two world-class athletes being born into the same family were as likely as the same parents giving birth to Picasso and Monet. And yet Venus and Serena Williams, two of the greatest tennis players of all time, are sisters.</i>
<i>Venus was born in June 1980, followed by her sister Serena just fifteen months later. Venus’s obvious talent as a tennis player was first spotted when she was seven, and by the time she was ten, the family had moved to Florida so she and Serena could attend a tennis academy there.</i>
<i>Venus was the first to turn professional, aged just fourteen, followed by Serena exactly one year later. Venus was also the first to win Wimbledon and the first to be ranked World No. 1. In their early professional matches playing against each other, Venus was the dominant player, winning four of their first five matches. The pressure on Serena must have been immense. Her desire to be, and to beat, her older sister may have fuelled her hard work.</i>
<i>Today, Serena has spent many more weeks ranked as World No. 1 (316 weeks for Serena, 11 weeks for Venus) and she has won seventy-two singles titles to Venus’s forty-nine. They have played each other thirty times, Serena leading Venus 18</i>–<i>12.</i>
<i>Serena played tennis to emulate her sister, as younger siblings often do. She soon found out she was just as talented as her sister, and that she could find her own strengths and develop an individual, forceful style, playing in her own way. She progressed as a player and achieved astounding successes. And when the two sisters played together in doubles matches, they became an almost invincible team!</i>
<i>Most important in this story is the close bond of love between the two sisters. They hate playing against each other, because they know there will have to be a loser. But this strong relationship brings a unique perspective to competition. For one sister, the joy of winning is dimmed by the pain of having inflicted a loss. For the other, the pain of losing will be brightened by the joy of watching a loved one win.</i>
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. Do you think you would be more or less likely to take up tennis if your sister was Venus Williams?</i>
<i>2. What do you think is the most important message we can take from this story?</i>
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>Yaakov and Esav are two different kinds of human beings. Commentators and stories in the Midrash contrast the two men heavily, to the point where Esav is depicted as the exact opposite of Yaakov. One is shown as wholly bad to make it clear that the other is purely good. But in the text of the Torah, there is more subtlety. We read less about the golden hero and the evil villainous character, but more about two very different personalities. Yaakov represents reason, modesty, order, self-control, while Esav stands for emotion, pride, and passion.
It is not so much that Esav is bad and Yaakov good, but that Esav represents the world that was, while Yaakov represents a new world about to be brought into being, whose spirituality would be radically different, new, and challenging.
The fact that Yaakov and Esav are twins is fundamental to understanding them. Their relationship is one of the classic cases of sibling rivalry. A key to examining their story is understanding mimetic desire: the desire to have what someone else has, because they have it. Ultimately, this is the desire to be someone else.
That is what the name Yaakov signifies. It is the name he acquired because he was born holding onto his brother Esav’s heel. That was his posture during the key events of his early life. He bought his brother’s birthright. He wore his brother’s clothes. At his mother’s request, he took his brother’s blessing. When asked by his father, “Who are you, my son?” he replied, “I am Esav, your firstborn.”
Yaakov was the man who wanted to be Esav. Why so? Because Esav, the firstborn, had his father’s unconditional love. “Yitzḥak…loved Esav, but Rivka loved Yaakov.”
All that changed in the great wrestling match between Yaakov and the angel. That was when he was told that his name would now be Yisrael. The stated explanation of this name is “For you have wrestled with God and with man and have prevailed.” It also resonates with two other senses. The root letters in the name <i>Yisrael</i> are<i> sar</i> which means “prince, royalty.” <i>Yashar</i> means “upright.” Both of these are in sharp contrast with the name “Yaakov,” from <i>ekev</i>, so named because he was one who “holds onto his brother’s heel.”
The mysterious stranger (the angel), and then God, challenged Yaakov to “<i>let</i> your name no longer be Yaakov but Yisrael,” meaning, “Act in such a way that this is what people call you. Be a prince. Be royalty. Be upright. Be yourself. Don’t long to be someone else.” This would turn out to be a challenge not just then but many times in the Jewish future.
Often, Jews have been content to be who they are born to be. But from time to time, they have come into contact with a civilisation whose intellectual, cultural, and even spiritual sophistication was undeniable. It made them feel awkward, inferior, like a villager who comes to a city for the first time. Jews lapsed into the condition of Yaakov. They wanted to be someone else.
The first time we hear this is in the words of the prophet Yeḥezkel: “You say, ‘We want to be like the nations, like the peoples of the world, who serve wood and stone’” (Yeḥezkel 20:32). In Babylon, the people encountered an impressive empire whose military and economic success contrasted radically with their own condition of exile and defeat. Some wanted to stop being Jews and become someone else, anyone else.
We hear it again in the days of the Greeks. Some Jews became Hellenised. We recognise that in the names of high priests like Jason and Menelaus. The battle against this is the story of Ḥanukka. Something similar happened in the days of Rome. Josephus was one of those who went over to the other side, though he remained a defender of Judaism.
It happened again during the period of Enlightenment. Jews fell in love with European culture, with philosophers like Kant and Hegel, poets like Goethe and Schiller, and musicians like Mozart and Beethoven. Some were able to integrate this with faithfulness to Judaism as creed and deed – figures like Rabbis Samson Raphael Hirsch and Nechemiah Nobel. But some did not. They left the fold. They changed their names. They hid their identity. None of us is entitled to be critical of what they did. The combined impact of intellectual challenge, social change, and incendiary antisemitism was immense. Yet this was a Yaakov response, not a Yisrael one.
It is happening today in large swathes of the Jewish world. Jews have overachieved. Judaism, with some notable exceptions, has underachieved. There are Jews at or near the top of almost every field of human endeavour today, but all too many have either abandoned their religious heritage or are indifferent to it. For them, being Jewish is a slender ethnicity, too thin to be transmitted to the future, too hollow to inspire.
We have waited so long for what we have today and have never had simultaneously before in all of Jewish history: independence and sovereignty in the State of Israel, freedom and equality in the Diaspora. Almost everything that a hundred generations of our ancestors prayed for has been given to us. Will we really throw this all away? Or will we embrace our Judaism? Will we be Yisrael? Or will we show, to our shame, that we have not yet outlived the name of Yaakov, the person who wanted be someone else? Yaakov was often fearful because he was not sure who he wanted to be, himself or his brother. That is why God said to him, “Let your name not be Yaakov but Yisrael.” When you are afraid, and unsure of who you are, you are Yaakov. When you are strong in yourself, as yourself, you are Yisrael.
<i>The fact that the Torah and tradition still use the word Yaakov, not just Yisrael, tells us that the problem has not disappeared</i>. Yaakov seems to have wrestled with it throughout his life, and we still do today. It takes courage to be different, a minority, counter-cultural. It’s easy to live in the moment, like Esav, or to “be like the peoples of the world” as Yeḥezkel said.
<b>I believe the challenge issued by the angel still echoes today. Are we Yaakov, embarrassed by who we are? Or are we Yisrael, with the courage to stand upright and walk tall in the path of faith?</b>
<b>QUESTION TO PONDER</b>
<i>In what ways do you express your identity and show you are proud of who you are?</i>
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>Sibling rivalry is defeated the moment we discover that we are loved by God for what we are, not for what someone else is. We each have our own blessing…. Sibling rivalry is not fate but tragic error. As a young man, Yaakov had wanted to be what he was not. Alone at night, wrestling with the angel, he discovered the conflict-dissolving truth that it is for what we uniquely are that we are loved.
<b><i>Not in God’s Name,</i> 141</b>
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>Why was Yaakov jealous of Esav? Why did he wish to be him?
What message was contained in the new name the angel gave to Yaakov?
What can Jews learn today from Yaakov’s two names?
<b>EDUCATIONAL COMPANION TO THE QUESTIONS</b>
<b><i>IN A NUTSHELL</i></b><br>The Torah tells us that Yaakov was afraid. He had run away many years earlier, because Esav had sworn to kill him. While it is impossible to know everything Yaakov was feeling, we can speculate based on human nature and our understanding of their relationship from the narrative in the text. Yaakov must have hoped they could reconcile (proved by his symbolic subservience in the messages and gifts he sent ahead to Esav). But perhaps he also had a greater sense of self and self-worth, and was no longer so envious of Esav. Perhaps he felt he could finally embrace Esav as an equal, and was hoping for the opportunity to do so.
<b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>To answer this question, it is helpful to know what the name Yaakov means, and what it represented, which was a desire from birth to be in Esav’s position. From his first act during his birth, Yaakov was grabbing onto the heel of his brother, perhaps in an attempt to be the firstborn. His new name, Yisrael, represented a pride in who he was (<i>yashar</i> – straight, or a <i>sar</i> – prince). His new name was a challenge set to him to move on from his desire to be his elder brother, and come to terms with his own identity and role.
Names represent identity. They are given to us by our parents (or in this case God) as a statement of values and culture and we carry them with us everywhere. They indicate who we are. In this story, they represent who Yaakov was in birth and who he was called on to be – they express his understanding of his own identity and destiny.
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br>Younger siblings often want to be just like their older siblings (like in our <i>parasha</i>) and need to be encouraged to be their own people. Serena Williams, like Yaakov, ultimately established herself as a player and a person in her own right, although she followed in her sister’s footsteps. However, de-identification is where the siblings strive hard to be different from their sibling so they don’t have to compete directly. It is natural for us to rebel against our siblings, trying to set out on our own path, and forge our own identity. If we are aware of this tendency, we can check that we are making choices for the right reasons, and not only from a desire to be different.
While sibling rivalry is natural, the love between siblings (which is equally natural) can be a positive way to compete. The Williams sisters love and support each other as unique individuals, and while they compete fiercely, they also cheer each other on, because the foundation of their relationship is sisterly love.
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>We all have opportunities in our lives to step up and be proud to be Jews, whether in conversations, or with our external appearances, in our actions, and in our choices. We each need to feel proud of who we are and how we live our lives.
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>Yaakov was born holding onto his brother Esav’s heel. Right from the beginning he wanted to be in Esav’s place. He bought his brother’s birthright. He wore his brother’s clothes. At his mother’s request, he took his brother’s blessing. When asked by his father, “Who are you, my son?” he replied, “I am Esav, your firstborn.” Yaakov wanted to be Esav, the main reasons being that he believed that the firstborn would inherit the covenant with God, and that Yitzḥak’s relationship with Esav was apparently stronger.
The angel gave Yaakov a new name not as a statement but as a request, a challenge, an invitation. Not “You <i>will</i> no longer be called Yaakov but Yisrael” but “<i>Let</i> your name no longer be Yaakov but Yisrael,” meaning, “Act in such a way that this is what people call you.” The name Yisrael means “For you have wrestled with God and with man and have prevailed.” But it also contains two other meanings. <i>Sar</i> means “prince, royalty.” <i>Yashar</i> means “upright.” Both of these are in sharp contrast with the name “Yaakov,” one who “holds onto his brother’s heel.” This is a message for all children of Israel. Be royalty. Be upright. Be yourself. Don’t waste your life longing to be someone else.
The fact that the Torah and tradition still use the word Yaakov, not just Yisrael, tells us that the problem has not disappeared. Yaakov seems to have wrestled with it throughout his life, and we still do today. Often, Jews have been content to be themselves. But from time to time, we are tempted by other people’s ways. It takes courage to stand up and be different, to be a minority, to be counter-cultural. Look at Rabbi Sacks’s final statement of belief in <i>Thinking More Deeply</i>, and consider how you can embrace your Jewish identity and your beliefs, your strengths and your own unique personality. (Also see answer 2, above).

II; Physical Fear, Moral Distress

<big><strong>II. Physical Fear, Moral Distress</strong></big><br><b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>Twenty-two years have passed since Yaakov fled his brother Esav, penniless and alone; twenty-two years have passed since Esav swore his revenge for what he saw as the theft of his blessing. Now the brothers are about to meet again. It is a tense encounter. Esav had sworn to kill Yaakov. Will he do so now – or has time healed the wound? Yaakov sends messengers to let his brother know he is coming. They return, saying that Esav is coming to meet Yaakov with an army of four hundred men – suggesting to Yaakov that Esav plans to fight him.
Yaakov’s reaction to the news is immediate and intense: “<i>Then Yaakov was greatly afraid and distressed”</i> (Bereshit 32:8). His fear is understandable, but the Torah’s description of his response is also puzzling. Why use two verbs that are similar in meaning? What is the difference between fear and distress?
To this a midrash gives a profound answer:
<i>Rabbi Yehuda bar Ilai said: Are not fear and distress identical? The meaning, however, is that “he was afraid” that he might be killed; “he was distressed” that he might kill. For Yaakov thought: If he overcomes me, will he not kill me; if I overcome him, will I not kill him? That is the meaning of “he was afraid” – that he may be killed; “and distressed” – that he may have to kill.</i>
The difference between being afraid and distressed, according to the midrash, is that the first is a physical anxiety, the second a moral one. It is one thing to fear one’s own death, quite another to contemplate being the cause of someone else’s. Yaakov’s emotional crisis had two levels – both physical and psychological, material and moral.
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. Do you think it is likely that brothers could hate each other so much they could come to kill one another?</i>
<i>2. Would it have been wrong of Yaakov to kill Esav in this situation? If not, then why did this possibility still cause him distress?</i>
<i>3. Yaakov was worried he may become a killer. Are you scared of becoming a person you are not proud to be?</i>
<b><i>It Once Happened…</i></b><br><i>Long before the Temple was built, two brothers lived and farmed on that site. One was married and had a large family, while the other was single. They lived in close proximity to each other, and each worked his land growing wheat. When harvest time arrived, each was blessed with a bountiful crop and piled up his grain for long-term storage.</i>
<i>The unmarried brother, observing his good fortune, thought to himself that God had blessed him with more than he needed, whereas his brother, who was blessed with a large family, could surely use more. He arose in the middle of the night and secretly took from his grain and put it in his brother’s pile.</i>
<i>Similarly, the married brother thought to himself that he was fortunate to have children who will care for him in his old age, while his brother will depend on what he saved. He, too, arose in the middle of the night and quietly transferred grain from his pile to his brother’s.</i>
<i>In the morning, each pondered why there was no noticeable decrease in his own pile, and so they repeated the transfer the next night. These nocturnal activities went on for several nights, until one night the brothers bumped into each other. In that instant, in the dark of night, the glow of brotherly love lit up the mountain sky; they each understood what the other had been doing and fell into each other’s arms in a loving embrace. According to the legend, when God saw that display of brotherly love, He selected the site for His Temple.</i>
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. What is the message of this story? How is it connected to the story of Yaakov and Esav’s meeting in the</i> parasha<i>?</i>
<i>2. If you have siblings, is your relationship more like Yaakov and Esav’s, or more like the brothers in this story, or a bit of both?</i>
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>The idea contained in <i>The Core Idea</i> raises a further question. Self-defence is permitted in Jewish law. If Esav were to try to kill Yaakov, Yaakov would be justified in fighting back, if necessary at the cost of Esav’s life. Why then should this possibility raise moral misgivings?
There is a possible explanation for Yaakov’s fear – namely that the midrash means what it says, no more, no less: Yaakov was distressed at the possibility of being forced to kill <i>even if it were entirely justified</i>. What we are encountering here is the concept of a moral dilemma. This phrase is often used imprecisely, to mean a moral problem or a difficult ethical decision. But a dilemma is not simply a conflict. There are many moral conflicts. May we perform an abortion to save the life of the mother? Should we obey a parent when he or she asks us to do something forbidden in Jewish law? May we desecrate the Shabbat to extend the life of a terminally ill patient? These questions have answers. There is a right course of action and a wrong one. Two duties conflict and we have meta-halakhic principles to tell us which takes priority. There are some systems in which all moral conflicts are of this kind. There is always a decision procedure and thus a determinate answer to the question, “What should I do?”
A dilemma, however, is a situation in which there is no right answer. It arises in cases of conflict between right and right, or between wrong and wrong – where, whatever we do, we are doing something that in other circumstances we ought not to do. Moral dilemmas are situations in which doing the right thing is not the end of the matter. The conflict may be inherently tragic. Yaakov, in this <i>parasha</i>, finds himself trapped in such a conflict: on the one hand, he ought not allow himself to be killed; on the other, he ought not kill someone else; but he must do one or the other. The fact that one principle (self-defence) overrides another (the prohibition against killing) does not mean that, faced with such a choice, he is without qualms, especially given the fact that Esav is his twin brother. Despite their differences, they grew up together. They were kin. This intensifies the dilemma yet more. Sometimes being moral means that one experiences distress at having to make such a choice. Doing the right thing may mean that one does not feel remorse or guilt, but one still feels regret or grief about the action that needs to be taken.
A moral system which leaves room for the existence of dilemmas is one that does not attempt to eliminate the complexities of the moral life. In a conflict between two rights or two wrongs, there may be a proper way to act – the lesser of two evils, or the greater of two goods – but this does not cancel out all emotional pain. A righteous individual may sometimes be one who is capable of distress even while knowing that they have acted correctly. What the midrash is telling us is that Judaism recognises the existence of dilemmas. Despite the intricacy of Jewish law and its meta-halakhic principles for deciding which of two duties takes priority, we may still be faced with situations in which there is an ineliminable cause for distress. It was Yaakov’s greatness that he was capable of moral anxiety even at the prospect of doing something entirely justified, namely defending his life at the cost of his brother’s.
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>At the Pesaḥ seder, our custom is to spill a drop of wine at the words “Blood,” “Fire,” and “Pillars of smoke”; at the mention of each of the plagues; and at the three words of Rabbi Yehuda’s mnemonic. One of the most beautiful explanations offered is that of Abudraham, who interprets it in accordance with the verse in Mishlei, “Do not rejoice when your enemy falls” (24:17). Even as we give thanks for the miracle of the plagues, as a result of which our ancestors gained their freedom, we also shed a symbolic tear for those who suffered. According to some commentators, that is why the Torah does not mention the word <i>simḥa</i>, “rejoicing,” in connection with Pesaḥ, unlike the other festivals. A talmudic passage (<i>Megilla</i> 10b) states that when the waters of the sea returned and trapped the pursuing Egyptian army, the angels wished to sing a song of praise. God silenced them with the words, “My creatures are drowning in the sea, and you wish to sing a song?” God does not rejoice in the downfall of the wicked.
Moral maturity involves an ability to live with complex situations and emotions. We may be uplifted by an event because it represents the triumph of justice, while at the same time identifying with the suffering of the victims. One of the glories of Judaism is that it reflects the complexity of the moral life without retreating into skepticism or relativism. The heroes of the Torah are rarely without their faults, nor are the villains wholly without virtues. This does not prevent us from making moral judgements, any more than grey refutes the existence of black and white. But it should protect us against the kind of attitude that grew up among the sectarians of the Dead Sea Scrolls, who divided humanity into the “children of light” and the “children of darkness.” Judaism forbids <i>schadenfreude</i>, malicious joy in the discomfort of others. It was the first faith in history to teach the unity of mankind under the universal fatherhood of God. Tears, therefore, are a universal language, and sympathy should know no religious or national borders.
<b><i>The Jonathan Sacks Haggada, 70</i></b>
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. Can you see a connection between Yaakov’s ethical dilemma explored above and the idea described here? What is the message of these ideas?</i>
<i>2. Are these ideas relevant in a practical way to modern Jewish history in general, and in your life in particular?</i>
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>Would Yaakov have been justified if he had killed Esav?
Do you believe it is ever ethically right to kill? If so, when?
What impact do you think the act of killing can have on a person, emotionally and spiritually, even when morally justified?
<b>EDUCATIONAL COMPANION TO THE QUESTIONS</b>
<b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>Family relationships are often more intense versions of non-familial relationships. The love between siblings will often be an intense love, but then there is also the potential for sibling relationships to go wrong, and when they do, this can lead to intense emotions. In this case, Esav feels that his birthright has been stolen from him in an act of deep betrayal. It isn’t difficult to imagine how this could lead to extreme emotions (though no one is justifying murder even in this situation).
If Esav had the intent to threaten the life of Yaakov, then Yaakov would have been morally justified in killing Esav in self-defence. This in fact is a halakhic imperative. However, despite moral, ethical, and halakhic justification, this does not mean that it wouldn’t distress Yaakov – all the more so because this is his twin brother.
There are many factors that influence who we become as people, such as social pressures from friends, work, and society as a whole. Sometimes we find ourselves being gradually influenced in very small ways, until one day we wake up to find we no longer recognise who we are. This is a legitimate fear.
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br>The story illustrates just how deep and strong sibling love can be. In the story, it is held up as a model for the ultimate human love as each brother found a rationale for caring for his brother at the expense of his own resources. God saw the depth of this love and chose this site for His Temple, to remind the world that His abode in this world represents love because His relationship with the world is based on pure love. (It is important to note that this legend, while widely known, and containing a very Jewish message, is not found in Jewish sources.)
Siblings can hate and love each other at one and the same time. There is something very beautiful about that, and it is a model for all human relationships. All humans can and should have a sibling-type relationship with one another, a brotherhood of man. Even if this leads sometimes to over-familiarity and negative emotions, the basis for a sibling relationship is always love.
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>Just as Yaakov feared killing Esav and the impact that would have on him, despite being ethically justified, so we must be sensitive to the value of life and the dignity of our enemies, even when we are justified in fighting them, or even in destroying them. They are still fellow human beings, creatures of God, and while it may be challenging, we must strive to relate to them as such.
These messages have relevance to modern Jewish history, for example in the Arab-Israeli conflict. It may be relevant to an individual who has experienced antisemitism. Turning the other cheek is not a Jewish value. Judaism does not expect unqualified forgiveness towards our enemies. We have every right, and in fact a religious obligation, to national defence, even when that means full-blown conflict. However, Jewish ethics also demands ethical and emotional sensitivity to the value of life, and to the human dignity of our enemies.
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>If Esav was a threat to Yaakov’s life, and there was no other way to neutralise this threat, then not only would Yaakov be morally justified in killing Esav, but he would have had a religious duty to protect his own life, even at the expense of Esav’s.
Pacifism is not a Jewish value. There are specific conditions when killing is justified, and in fact religiously required. Self-defence, including a war of self-defence, would be one of them.
Despite Judaism’s stance on pacifism and ethically justified killing, this is not to suggest that there is not an emotional and spiritual cost to killing. The sanctity of life is an ultimate value in Judaism, and those who are forced to kill run the risk of becoming desensitised to the value and holiness of human life.

Vayeshev

In a Nutshell

<b><i>IN A NUTSHELL</i></b><br>In our <i>parasha,</i> the story shifts focus from Yaakov to his children and their relationship. Yosef was Yaakov’s favourite son, as he was the firstborn of his beloved wife Raḥel. This caused tension and jealousy between Yosef and his brothers.
Yosef was a dreamer and he shared two of his dreams with the family, one about sheaves of wheat, and the other about the sun, moon, and stars all bowing down to him. This upset his brothers, who thought Yosef was saying he believed he was better than them, so they plotted, faked his death, and sold him as a slave. Yosef was sent to work in Egypt. This terrible crime eventually led, many years later, to the entire family, who by then were a nation, being slaves in Egypt.
Yosef’s master Potifar was impressed by Yosef but Potifar’s wife had him thrown into prison, where he found himself interpreting the dreams of Pharaoh’s troubled baker and butler. Yosef understood from the dreams that the baker would soon be killed, but the butler would get his job back. Yosef asked the butler to help him once he was free. Yosef’s interpretations of the dreams came true, but the butler forgot his promise to ask Pharaoh to free Yosef.

I; The Angel Who Did Not Know He Was an Angel

<big><strong> I.  The Angel Who Did Not Know He Was an Angel</strong></big><br><b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>The story of Yosef and his brothers takes place over four <i>parashot</i>. It is the longest and most detailed narrative in the Torah. Nothing is there by accident; every detail counts. Let us look at one moment, which may seem unimportant, but in fact contains one of the most beautiful ideas in the Torah.
The scene is set. Yosef is envied and hated by his brothers. They cannot even talk to one another without arguing. Now the brothers have left home to tend their sheep, and Yaakov tells Yosef to go and see how they are doing. This will ultimately lead to the dramatic incident where the brothers sell Yosef as a slave, and change everything.
But it nearly didn’t happen. Yosef arrived at Shekhem where he expected his brothers to be, but they were not there. He might well have wandered around for a while and then, failing to find them, gone home. None of the events that take up the rest of the Torah would have happened: no Yosef the slave, no Yosef the viceroy to Pharaoh, no storage of food during the years of plenty, no descent of Yosef’s family to Egypt, no exile, no slavery, no exodus. The entire story – already revealed to Avraham in a night vision – seemed about to be derailed. Then we read the following:
<i>“A man found [Yosef] wandering around in the fields and asked him, ‘What are you looking for?’ He replied, ‘I’m looking for my brothers. Can you tell me where they are grazing their flocks?’ ‘They have moved on from here,’ the man answered. ‘I heard them say, “Let’s go to Dotan.”’ So Yosef went after his brothers and found them near Dotan”</i> (Bereshit 37:15–17).
There is no other moment like this in the rest of the Torah: three verses dedicated to an apparently unimportant, forgettable detail of someone having to ask directions from a stranger. Who was this unnamed man? And what message does the episode hold for future generations, for us? Rashi says he was the angel Gavriel. Ibn Ezra says he was a passerby. Ramban, however, says that “the Holy One, blessed be He, sent him a guide without his knowledge.”
I am not sure whether Ramban meant without Yosef’s knowledge or without the guide’s knowledge. I prefer to think both. The anonymous man represents an act of divine guidance to make sure that Yosef went to the place where he was supposed to be, so that the rest of the drama could unfold. He may not have known he had such a role. Yosef surely did not know. To put it simply: <i>he was an angel who did not know he was an angel</i>. He had a vital role in the story. Without him, it would not have happened. But he had no way of knowing, at the time, the importance of his role.
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. Does it make a difference to the story whether the “angel” knew about his role or not?</i>
<i>2. Is this encounter with the unnamed man the only time God manages events in this story to ensure a specific result?</i>
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br><i>No one knows the power of a smile. A smile can literally save a life. I should know. My life was saved by a smile.</i>
<i>That was a dark time in my life. I could no longer feel joy. There was only sadness in my heart. I could not see a reason to live. Who would even notice if one day I just disappeared? The answer, I believed, was no one.</i>
<i>My pain was so deep, I couldn’t bear to sit in my empty house alone. I left in a daze. I didn’t know where I was going. I don’t know if I would have taken my own life, but I do know I couldn’t see any point in living. I hardly cared if I lived or died.</i>
<i>But then I met her. I don’t even know her name. Someone’s grandmother. Someone’s mother. Someone’s neighbour. Someone’s friend. But not mine. I was no one to her. But she saw me. She saw my tears, smiled the warmest smile, and said the simplest of words: “Are you okay, love?” That was all it took. Someone saw me. Saw my pain. And reached out with a smile and four words that changed my life. She was my angel from above.</i>
<i>I decided in that moment that my life was worth living. And I found a purpose for it. I wanted to be an angel for others, wherever I could find them. Because who knows the power of just a smile?</i>

<i>1. Did the lady smile because she knew she was destined to save the storyteller that day?</i>

<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>The message of the <i>angel who didn’t know he was an angel</i> is a very important one. When Heaven intends something to happen, and it seems to be impossible, sometimes it sends an angel down to earth – an angel who does not know he or she is an angel – to move the story from here to there. Let me tell the story of two such angels, without whom there might not be a State of Israel today.
One was a remarkable young woman from a Sephardi family who, at the age of seventeen, married into the most famous Ashkenazi family in the world. Her name was Dorothy Pinto; her husband was James de Rothschild, son of the great Baron Edmond de Rothschild who did so much to support the settlement of the land in the days before the proclamation of the state.
A critical juncture occurred during the First World War that would eventually lead to the defeat of the Ottoman Empire and the placing of Palestine under a British mandate. Suddenly, Britain became absolutely central to the Zionist dream. A key figure in the Zionist movement, Chaim Weizmann, was in Britain, experimenting and lecturing in chemistry at Manchester University. But Weizmann was a Russian immigrant, not a prominent member of British society. Manchester was not London. Chemistry was not politics. The most influential and well-connected Jewish family in the country was the Rothschilds. But Edmond was in France. James was a soldier on the battlefield. And not every member of the British Rothschilds was a Zionist.
At that moment, Dorothy swiftly assumed a leading role. She was only nineteen when she first met Weizmann in December 1914, and she understood very little of the political complexities involved in realising the Zionist dream. But she learned quickly. She was perceptive, resourceful, energetic, delightful, and determined. She connected Weizmann with everyone he needed to know and persuade. Simon Schama, in his definitive account of <i>Two Rothschilds and the Land of Israel</i>, says that “young as she was…she combined charm, intelligence and more than a hint of steely resolution in just the right mixture to coax commitment from the equivocal, enthusiasm from the lukewarm and sympathy from the indifferent.”
His judgement on the effect of her interventions is that “through tireless but prudent social diplomacy she had managed to open avenues of influence and persuasion at a time when they were badly needed.” The result, in 1917, was the Balfour Declaration, a milestone in the history of Zionism – and we should not forget that the declaration itself took the form of a letter to Lord (Walter) Rothschild.
Dorothy’s husband James, in his will, left the money to build the Knesset, Israel’s parliament building. In her own will, Dorothy left the money to build a new Supreme Court building, a project undertaken by her nephew Jacob, the current Lord Rothschild. But of all the things she did, it was those connections she made for Chaim Weizmann in the years 1914 to 1917 that were surely the most important. Without them, there might have been no Balfour Declaration and no State of Israel.
The other angelic figure, who could not have been less like Dorothy de Rothschild, was Eddie Jacobson. The son of poor Jewish immigrants, born in New York’s Lower East Side, he moved with his family to Kansas City where he met another young man called Harry Truman. They knew one another in their youth, and then grew closer in 1917 when they underwent military training together. After the end of World War I, they opened a haberdashery business together. It failed in 1922 because of the recession.
From then on, they went their separate ways, Jacobson as a travelling salesman, and Truman successively a county administrator, senator, vice president, and then, when F. D. Roosevelt died in office in 1945, he became president of the United States. Despite their very different life trajectories, the two stayed friends, and Jacobson would often visit Truman, talking to him about, among other things, the fate of European Jewry during the Holocaust.
After the war, the position of America vis-à-vis the State of Israel was deeply ambivalent. The State Department was opposed. Truman himself refused to meet Chaim Weizmann.
On March 13, 1948, Jacobson went to the White House and persuaded Truman to change his mind and meet Weizmann. Largely as a result of this, the United States became the first nation to grant diplomatic recognition to Israel on May 14, 1948.
Many years later, Truman wrote:
<i>One of the proudest moments of my life occurred at 6:12 p.m. on Friday, May 14, 1948, when I was able to announce recognition of the new State of Israel by the government of the United States. I remain particularly gratified by the role I was fortunate to play in the birth of Israel as, in the immortal words of the Balfour Declaration, “a national home for the Jewish people.”</i>
Two people, Dorothy de Rothschild and Eddie Jacobson, appeared on the scene of history and connected Chaim Weizmann with individuals he might otherwise not have met, among them Arthur Balfour and Harry Truman. They were like the stranger who connected Yosef and his brothers, but with infinitely more positive consequences. I think of them both as angels who did not know they were angels.
Perhaps this is true not only about the destiny of nations but also about each of us at critical junctures in our lives. <b>I believe that there are times when we feel lost, and then someone says or does something that lifts us or points the way to a new direction and destination.</b> Years later, looking back, we see how important that intervention was, even though it seemed slight at the time. That is when we know that we too encountered an angel who didn’t know he or she was an angel.
<b>QUESTION TO PONDER</b>
<i>Should we wait for an “angel” to be sent by God to redirect our lives or should we try ourselves to ensure our lives take the direction we want?</i>
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>None of us has all the gifts, but each of us has some. We all count; we each have a unique contribution to make. We come before God as a people, each giving something, and each lifted by the contributions of others.
<b>Ten Paths to God<i> –</i> <i>Identity: On Being a Jew,</i></b> 3
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>Why do you think the story of Yosef and his brothers is so detailed and so full of plot twists?
Can you think of a time when the direction of your life was changed by an “angel who didn’t even know they were an angel”?
What will be your unique contribution to history? How will you discover what history needs from you?
<b>EDUCATIONAL COMPANION TO THE QUESTIONS</b>
<b><i>IN A NUTSHELL</i></b><br>This is one of the most complex stories in the Torah, with so many stages and twists and turns. Just as in life, small details can change the direction of the story completely, and we believe that God is behind all the details that lead to the larger picture (in fact, at the very end of the story, Yosef tells his brothers exactly that). Every detail is important. If even one were different, then the outcome of the story would have been different. Perhaps that is one of the core messages of this story.
<b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>The “angel” was an agent of God, even if he didn’t realise it, just as we could be carrying out the wishes of God with any single act that we do. We may never know how our acts have impacted the people we meet in our lives. But we believe that God looks after the bigger picture, and with every act, we may be playing a part in other people’s lives.
Our belief is that God manages all the details necessary to deliver His desired outcome. This story has so many moving parts and small details, each one noteworthy, to deliver the final outcome. One of the core messages of this narrative is just that – to remember that God plays a role in our lives on a daily basis even if we don’t realise it at the time. This is the message that Yosef gives his brothers at the conclusion of the story (Bereshit 45:5).
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br>Just like the man in the Yosef story, the woman may have had no idea how important her act of a simple smile could be, and she likely had no idea she had been sent to the storyteller for some purpose. She simply smiled because it was the compassionate and kind thing to do. The good intent was there but the impact could not have been predicted.
You cannot decide for sure. You don’t know what the result of your actions will be, or what the people you come across really need. You have to live your life being the best you can, living according to the values you believe God wishes from you, and leave the rest to Him. Our job is to do our best for others, making the kind and moral choice at every opportunity, and it is our hope that these acts lead to positive outcomes.
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>We do not believe in waiting passively for God to take control of our lives and we do not rely on heaven-sent miracles happening to us. We must take charge of our own lives and take responsibility for them. However, the message here is that sometimes people are sent to change the direction of our lives and we must ensure we are open to seeing them and the positive influence they can have (even if sometimes it doesn’t feel positive at the time).
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>Narrative in the Torah is not about historical truth. That is not to say that it is not necessarily historically accurate, but conveying historical details is not the main aim of narrative in the Torah. Narrative delivers other truths. The Torah could have told the story of Yosef in a more direct, less complex way. Not all the details were necessary to arrive at the end of the story. But the Torah does not waste words. There is a message in all the details. One of the main and overarching messages is that God is behind the scenes making sure that events occur and destinations are reached according to His plan. This was in fact the message Yosef delivered to his brothers at the end of the story in Bereshit 45:5: “Now, do not be distressed or angry with yourselves because you sold me here. There was a reason that God sent me ahead of you.” God has a larger plan, and all the details in our lives happen to achieve that divine plan.
We all have examples in our lives where we changed direction because of a small event or a chance meeting or a conversation with someone. Try and think of examples from your own life, whether the impact was large or small. In truth, we don’t always know how important these chance events are until much later.
The unnamed man in the story changed history, without even knowing the role he was playing and impact he was having. Dorothy de Rothschild and Eddie Jacobson were also key figures who changed Jewish history. This question asks each individual to consider what small impact they can make on the world, to change it for the good, to help deliver the larger plan that God has for the world. The challenge is that we can’t know what the larger plan is or what role God has in mind for us. So we must strive the best we can to make the world a better place, and leave the rest to God.

II; Refusing Comfort, Keeping Hope

<big><strong>II. Refusing Comfort, Keeping Hope</strong></big><br><b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>The deception has taken place. Yosef has been sold into slavery. His brothers dipped his coat in blood. They bring it back to their father, saying, “Look what we have found. Do you recognise it? Is this your son’s coat or not?” Yaakov recognises it and replies, “It is my son’s coat. A wild beast has devoured him. Yosef has been torn to pieces.” We then read:
Yaakov tore his clothes, put on sackcloth, and mourned his son for a long time. His sons and daughters tried to comfort him, but he <i>refused to be comforted</i>. He said, “I will go down to the grave mourning for my son” (Bereshit 37:34–35).
There are laws in Judaism about the limits of grief – <i>shiva</i>, <i>sheloshim</i>, a year. There is no such thing as a bereavement for which grief is endless. The Talmud says that God rebukes one who weeps beyond the appointed time. And yet Yaakov refuses to be comforted.
A midrash gives a remarkable explanation. “One can be comforted for one who is dead, but not for one who is still living,” it says. In other words, Yaakov refused to be comforted <i>because he had not yet given up hope that Yosef was still alive</i>. That, tragically, is the fate of those who have lost members of their family (the parents of soldiers missing in action, for example), but have as yet no proof that they are dead. They cannot go through the normal stages of mourning because they cannot abandon the possibility that the missing person is still capable of being rescued. Their continuing anguish is a form of loyalty; to give up, to mourn, to be reconciled to loss is a kind of betrayal. In such cases, grief lacks closure. To refuse to be comforted is to refuse to give up hope.
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. Why do you think Judaism has specific time periods for different levels of mourning, such as</i> shiva<i> (the first week after the death of a loved one),</i> sheloshim<i> (the first thirty-day period of mourning), and the completion of the first year?</i>
<i>2. Do you think the pain is greater for the loss of a child, or when a child is missing and presumed dead?</i>
<i>3. Do you know of any stories of parents who refused to give up hope that their child may still be alive? What can we learn from Yaakov and these other parents?</i>
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br><i>A legend is told of Napoleon, the French emperor in the early nineteenth century, taking a stroll through the streets of Paris with his advisors one Tisha B’Av during his reign. As his entourage passed a small synagogue they heard wailing and crying coming from within. Puzzled by the commotion, Napoleon sent an aide inside to inquire as to what had happened.</i>
<i>The aide returned after a few minutes and told Napoleon that the Temple of the Jews had been destroyed and they were in mourning over its loss. Napoleon was outraged! “How can it be I have no knowledge if this event? Where in the empire did this occur? When did this befall the Jews of that community and who were the perpetrators?”</i>
<i>The aide responded, “Sir, the Temple was lost in Jerusalem on this date more than 1,700 years ago.”</i>
<i>Napoleon stood in silence and shock. “A people who can mourn for Jerusalem so long will one day have it restored to them!” he said.</i>
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. What is the message of this story? How is it connected to the story of Yaakov’s grief and refusal to give up hope?</i>
<i>2. What do you think would have happened if we had moved on after the destruction of Jerusalem and the Temple in 70 CE? Why are Jews so obsessed with remembering history?</i>
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>On what basis did Yaakov continue to hope that Yosef was still alive? Surely he had recognised Yosef’s blood-stained coat – he said explicitly, “A wild beast has devoured him. Yosef has been torn to pieces.” Do these words not mean that he had accepted that Yosef was dead?
The late David Daube made a suggestion that I find convincing. The words the sons say to Yaakov – “<i>Haker na</i>,” literally, “Identify please” – have a quasi-legal connotation. Daube relates this passage to another, Shemot 22:10–13, with which it has close linguistic parallels. The issue discussed is the extent of responsibility borne by a guardian (<i>shomer</i>). If an animal is lost through negligence, the guardian is at fault and must make good the loss. If there is no negligence, merely <i>force majeure</i>, an unavoidable, unforeseeable accident, the guardian is exempt from blame. One such case is where the loss has been caused by a wild animal. The wording in the law – “<i>tarof yitaref</i>,” “torn to pieces” – exactly parallels Yaakov’s judgement in the case of Yosef: “<i>Tarof toraf Yosef</i>,” “Yosef has been torn to pieces.”
An elder brother carried a similar responsibility for the fate of a younger brother placed in his charge, as, for example, when the two were alone together. That is the significance of Kayin’s denial when confronted by God as to the fate of Hevel: “Am I my brother’s guardian (<i>shomer</i>)?” (Bereshit 4:9).
We now understand a series of nuances in the encounter between Yaakov and his sons upon their return without Yosef. Normally they would be held responsible for their younger brother’s disappearance. To avoid this, as in the case of later biblical law, they “bring the remains as evidence.” If those remains show signs of an attack by a wild animal, they must – by virtue of the law then operative – be held innocent. Their request to Yaakov, “<i>Haker na</i>,” must be construed as a legal request, meaning, “Examine the evidence.” Yaakov has no alternative but to do so, and by virtue of what he has seen, to acquit them. A judge, however, may be forced to acquit someone accused of a crime because the evidence is insufficient to justify a conviction, while still retaining lingering private doubts. So Yaakov was forced to find his sons innocent, without necessarily trusting what they said. In fact, Yaakov did not believe it, and his refusal to be comforted shows that he was unconvinced. He continued to hope that Yosef was still alive. That hope was eventually justified: Yosef <i>was</i> still alive, and father and son were ultimately reunited.
The refusal to be comforted sounded more than once in Jewish history. The prophet Yirmeyahu was sure that Jews would return to Israel <i>because</i> they refused to be comforted – meaning, they refused to give up hope (Yirmeya 31:15–17). So it was during the Babylonian exile, as articulated in one of the most paradigmatic expressions of the refusal to be comforted: “By the rivers of Babylon we sat and wept, as we remembered Zion….”
Jews are the people who refused to be comforted because they never gave up hope. All the evidence of Jewish history may seem to signify irretrievable loss, a decree of history that cannot be overturned, a fate that must be accepted. Jews never believed the evidence because they had something else to set against it – a faith, a trust, an unbreakable hope that proved stronger than historical inevitability. It is not too much to say that Jewish survival was sustained in that hope. And that hope came from a simple – or perhaps not so simple – phrase in the life of Yaakov. He refused to be comforted. And so – while we live in a world still scarred by violence, poverty, and injustice – must we.
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>In the Hebrew Bible, a new concept of time was born…. Time, for ancients, was cyclical, a matter of the slow revolving of the seasons and the generations, an endlessly repeated sequence of birth, growth, decline, and death…. Mythic time is not historical but <i>anti</i>-historical time: time in which nothing really changes…. Until Israel appeared on the scene, all cultures were like that. Some still are.
Cyclical time is time as it appears in nature. All that lives, dies, but life itself lives on. Winds, storms, floods, and drought wreak devastation, but nature recovers, homes are rebuilt, fields are replanted, and the cycle begins again. The dream of myth is order, and its perennial fear is chaos. Life is an ongoing struggle between these two opposites, which reflect the struggles of the gods, told in the endless stories of myth itself…. The permutations are endless, but the basic plot is the same. First, there is order, then it is disturbed by a force of chaos: there is a battle and finally order is restored. So it was in ancient myth, and so it is today in its cinematic equivalents: <i>Star Wars, The Lord of the Rings</i>, and the rest.
The Hebrew Bible is a radical break with this way of seeing things. God is to be found in history, not just in nature. Things do change. Human life is an arena of transformation. Avraham leaves the world of the Mesopotamian city-states to begin a new way of serving God. Moshe and the Israelites leave Egypt to found a new social order. They are about to build a future unlike the past. That was the revolution. Without it, we would simply not have the key words we have come to accept as obvious, words like <i>progress, development, advance, creativity, originality.</i> Until Avraham and Moshe, no one thought of time as a journey in which where you are tomorrow will not be where you were yesterday. The concept of change as progress would have been equally incomprehensible. For the ancients, change was a challenge to the established order. That too exists in some cultures and individuals today…<i>in Judaism a new concept was born, of a future substantively different from the past</i>.
<b><i>Future Tense</i>, 234–236</b>
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. How did Judaism introduce the idea to the world that the future can be different from the past, and that we can hope for a better world?</i>
<i>2. What do you think is the source of the obstinate Jewish refusal in history to give up hope?</i>
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>Why do you think Yaakov refused to give up hope that Yosef was still alive?
Can you think of examples from Jewish history of when the Jewish people refused to give up hope? What do you think is the source of this refusal to give up hope?
What can other people of the world learn from the Jewish refusal to give up hope in the face of adversity?
<b>EDUCATIONAL COMPANION TO THE QUESTIONS</b>
<b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>Jewish law strives to create a healthy outlet for grief while at the same time ensuring grief does not become crippling and overwhelm the mourner. It does this through these various stages of bereavement. Judaism ordains a precisely calibrated sequence of grief, from the initial, numbing moment of loss itself, to the funeral and the return home, to the period of being comforted by friends and members of the community, to a more extended period during which one does not engage in activities associated with joy. The more we learn about the psychology of bereavement and the stages through which we must pass before loss can be healed, so the wisdom of Judaism’s ancient laws and customs has become clearer. However, in our <i>parasha</i>, Yaakov refused to allow himself to pass through these stages of grief because deep down he still had faith that Yosef was alive.
The pain is unimaginable in both cases. However, one could imagine that as long as there is a chance the child is still alive, in the absence of proof to the contrary, then there can be a glimmer of hope that perhaps can distract from the pain.
In Israel there are several stories of parents and families of soldiers missing in action who refused to give up hope until they were given absolute proof of the death of their child. These parents did everything in their power to influence governments and other agencies to bring back their children, or at least bring proof of their death, and bring back their bodies. Never giving up hope can achieve very powerful and meaningful results.
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br>The message of this story is the impressive emotional connection that Jews have to their history. So much so that these Jews still mourned the destruction of their Temple 1,700 years earlier as if it had just happened. Their refusal to be consoled over the centuries that had passed impressed Napoleon so much that he was convinced they would merit as a nation to see Jerusalem restored to them.
If Jews over the centuries had given up their hope of returning as a sovereign nation to their land and moved on with their national life, then it is hard to see how the reemergence of the Jewish national movement in the late nineteenth century that ultimately led to the establishment of the State of Israel would have happened. In fact, some historians believe that this unbreakable hope and will is one factor that ensured the survival  of the Jewish people in exile for so many generations.
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>In his book <i>Future Tense</i> (231–241), Rabbi Sacks identifies four features of Jewish faith that distinguish Jews and Jewish thought, and encourages them to always believe that the future can be better than the present:
God reveals His name to Moshe at the Burning Bush as <i>Ehyeh asher ehyeh</i> (Shemot 3:14) – literally, “<i>I will be what I will be</i>.” God’s name is in the future tense.
A Jewish sense of time is a radical break with the ancient concept of time, which was merely cyclical. In Judaism, “human life is an arena of transformation.”
Jewish narrative in the Bible and in history breaks the rules of narrative form. Jewish history is a story without ending. Its conclusion is yet to be fulfilled.
Judaism’s “golden age” is always in the future – the Messiah has not yet come.
Perhaps hope is written into Jewish DNA because of the four factors written in the answer above. Perhaps it is a steadfast faith in the existence of a God who acts for the good of the Jewish people and humanity in history.
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>The love a parent has for their child is so strong that until incontrovertible proof is presented to prove there is no hope, the parent will refuse to be consoled, stop grieving, and give up hope of reuniting with their child.
The whole of Jewish history is a story of refusing to give up hope. In the face of profound adversity, the Jewish people have refused to give up their religion and their age-old dream of returning to their land. The Jewish dream of a world of peace and redemption in a Messianic Age is also a dream they have refused to give up on. Historians have struggled to explain this aspect of Jewish history. Perhaps the only explanation is a steadfast faith in the existence of a God who acts for the good of the Jewish people and humanity in history.
Life for both the individual and on a national level can often be difficult and challenging, and despair and loss of hope are easy to understand. The Jewish story can inspire and be an antidote to this. Few peoples can compare their national suffering and pain or point to quite so many tragic and dark periods in their history. Yet the Jews refused to despair or lose hope. In a world that still suffers great moments of darkness, they continued to believe in a better future for humanity.

Miketz

In a Nutshell

<b><i>IN A NUTSHELL</i></b><br>This <i>parasha</i> begins with Yosef at his lowest point, chained and forgotten in prison. But when Pharaoh is disturbed by two dreams, his butler remembers Yosef is an interpreter and may be able to help explain them. Yosef tells Pharaoh that the dreams contain a prophecy that there will be seven good years in Egypt, followed by seven years of drought and famine, but he also tells Pharaoh he has a solution to the problem – storehouses during the good years to help them survive the bad years. Pharaoh is impressed, and appoints Yosef to be his prime minister. Only Pharaoh himself is now more powerful than Yosef.
The famine affects Canaan too, and Yosef’s family struggle, until Yaakov sends the ten elder brothers to Egypt to buy sacks full of food. (Egypt is the only place with extra supplies because of Yosef’s plan!) The brothers come before Yosef, but do not recognise him as their brother because he has now grown up, and is dressed and speaking like an Egyptian. Yosef, however, recognises them immediately.
Without revealing who he is, Yosef creates a situation for the brothers that is designed to test them. He tells them to come back with their youngest brother, Binyamin, and then he accuses Binyamin of stealing from him. The test is this: Will they abandon another brother like they abandoned Yosef, or have they learned to be better brothers? We will have to wait until the next <i>parasha</i> to find out!
<b>QUESTION TO PONDER</b>
<i>How did Yosef get his new job? Was this always his plan?</i>

I; Yosef and the Risks of Power

<big><strong>I. Yosef and the Risks of Power</strong></big><br><b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>The story of Yosef in <i>Miketz</i> shows us the fastest and most extreme transformation of one man in all of the Torah. In a single day, Yosef moves from zero to hero, from forgotten, abandoned prisoner to prime minister of Egypt. He becomes the second most powerful man in the land, controlling all the money in the whole country.
Before this, Yosef was hardly ever in control of his own life. He had things done to him, rather than being the doer. First his father, then his brothers, then the Midianites and Ishmaelites, then Potifar and his wife, then the prison warden, all directed his life. He showed a special talent for understanding dreams, but dreams are also things that happen to you, not things you choose.
Then, after explaining the chief butler’s dream, Yosef realised that the chief butler would soon be in a position to help him get released from prison, and asked him to do this – a decisive act! However, the butler “did not remember Yosef, and forgot him.” This one attempt to take control of his life failed. Despite being the centre of the story, Yosef was still not in control.
But then, suddenly, everything changes. Yosef is asked to interpret Pharaoh’s dreams. But he does far more than that. First, he interprets the dreams. They are a prophecy of the next fourteen years. The people are in danger of starving during seven years of famine. But with a stroke of genius, Yosef solves the problem. Store a fifth of the produce during the years of plenty, and it will then be available to feed the people during the famine.
Pharaoh is so impressed, he gives Yosef the job of carrying out the plan. At the age of thirty, he becomes the most powerful man in Egypt, next to Pharaoh. He travels round the country, arranges for collection of the grain, and ensures that it is stored safely. There is so much that, in the Torah’s words, he stops keeping records because it is plentiful beyond measure. When the years of plenty are over, his position becomes even more powerful. Everyone turns to him for food. Pharaoh himself tells the people, “Go to Yosef and do what he tells you.”
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. What is the source of Yosef’s power and authority?</i>
<i>2. What kind of a leader did Yosef become?</i>
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br><i>Once a non-Jewish man came to see the great Rabbi Shammai, saying he would like to convert to Judaism if the entire Torah could be taught to him while he stood on one foot. Shammai was furious at the idea that the Torah was being mocked, or that it could be taught in mere minutes, so he grabbed a nearby stick and chased the man away.</i>
<i>The same non-Jewish man then approached Hillel, a rabbi just as learned and respected as Shammai, and he made the same request. Hillel smiled and summarised the whole Torah in one sentence: “All you need to truly understand is this: That which is hateful to you, do not do to another person. That is the entire Torah; the rest is just an interpretation of that. Now go and study it!” Hillel converted that man to Judaism.</i>
<b><i>Shabbat</i> 31a</b>
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. Why did Shammai react in the way he did? What gave him the right?</i>
<i>2. What kind of values can we learn here from Hillel’s behaviour and leadership style?</i>
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>The second half of the story shifts its focus from Yosef, prime minister of Egypt, controller of its economy, to Yosef, son of Yaakov, and his relationship with the brothers who, twenty-two years earlier, had sold him as a slave. It is this story that will dominate the next few chapters, rising to a climax in Yehuda’s speech at the beginning of the next <i>parasha</i>.
One effect of this is that it tends to move Yosef’s political and administrative activity into the background. But if we read the story carefully – not just how it begins, but how it continues – we discover something quite disturbing. The narrative is taken up in the next <i>parasha</i> in chapter 47. It describes an extraordinary sequence of events.
It begins when the Egyptians have used up all their money buying grain. They come to Yosef asking for food, telling him they will die without it, and he replies by telling them he will sell it to them in exchange for ownership of their livestock. They willingly do so: they bring their horses, donkeys, sheep, and cattle. The next year, he sells them grain in exchange for their land. The result of these transactions is that within a short period of time – seemingly a mere three years – he has transferred to Pharaoh’s ownership all the money, livestock, and private land, with the exception of the land of the priests, which he allowed them to retain.
Not only this, but the Torah tells us that Yosef “removed the population town by town, from one end of Egypt’s border to the other” (Bereshit 47:21) – a policy of enforced resettlement that would later in history be used against Israel by the Assyrians.
The question is – was Yosef right to do this? Seemingly, he did it of his own accord. He was not asked to do so by Pharaoh. The result of all these policies is that unprecedented wealth and power were now concentrated in Pharaoh’s hands – power that would eventually be used against the Israelites. More seriously, twice we encounter the phrase “<i>avadim leFaro</i>,” “slaves to Pharaoh” – one of the key phrases in the Exodus account and in the answer to the questions of the child in the Seder service (Bereshit 47:19, 25), with this difference: <i>that it was said not by the Israelites, but by the Egyptians.</i>
During the famine itself, the Egyptians say to Yosef, “Buy us and our land in exchange for food, and <i>we, with our land, will be slaves to Pharaoh</i>” (Bereshit 47:19). Later, agreeing to a permanent arrangement whereby they would be Pharaoh’s servants, giving him a fifth of all they produce, they said, “You have saved our lives. May we find favour in the eyes of our lord; <i>we will be slaves to Pharaoh</i>.”
This entire passage, which begins in our <i>parasha</i> and continues into the next, raises a most serious question. We tend to assume that the enslavement of the Israelites in Egypt was a consequence of, and punishment for, the brothers selling Yosef as a slave. But Yosef himself turned the Egyptians into a nation of slaves. What is more, he created the highly centralised power that would eventually be used against his people.
Aaron Wildavsky, in his book about Yosef, <i>Assimilation versus Separation</i>, says that Yosef “left the system into which he was elevated less humane than it was by making Pharaoh more powerful than he had been.” Leon Kass, in <i>The Beginning of Wisdom</i>, says about Yosef’s decision to make the people pay for food in the years of famine (food that they themselves had handed over during the years of plenty): “Yosef is saving life by making Pharaoh rich and, soon, all-powerful. While we may applaud Yosef’s forethought, we are rightly made uneasy by this man who profits from exercising his god-like power over life and death.”
It may be that the Torah intends no criticism of Yosef whatsoever. He was acting loyally to Pharaoh and judiciously to Egypt as a whole. Or it may be that there is an implied criticism of his character. As a child, he dreamed of power; as an adult he exercised it. But Judaism is critical of power and those who seek it. Another possibility: the Torah is warning us of the hazards and ambiguities of politics. A policy that seems wise in one generation discloses itself as dangerous in the next. Or perhaps Leon Kass is right when he says, “Yosef’s sagacity is technical and managerial, not moral and political. He is long on forethought and planning but short on understanding the souls of men.”
What this entire passage represents is the first intrusion of politics into the life of the family of the covenant. From the beginning of Exodus to the end of Devarim, politics will dominate the narrative. But this is our first introduction to it: Yosef’s appointment to a key position in the Egyptian court. And what it is telling us is the sheer ambiguity of power. On the one hand, you cannot create or sustain a society without it. On the other hand, it almost cries out to be abused. Power is dangerous, even when used with the best of intentions by the best of people. Yosef acted to strengthen the hand of a Pharaoh who had been generous to him, and would be likewise to the rest of his family. He could not have foreseen what that same power might make possible in the hands of a “new Pharaoh who knew not Yosef.”
Tradition called Yosef <i>hatzaddik</i>, the righteous. At the same time, the Talmud says that he died before his brothers “because he assumed airs of authority.” Even a <i>tzaddik</i> with the best of intentions, when he or she enters politics and assumes airs of authority, can make mistakes. <b>I believe the great challenge of politics is that politicians remain humble and policies are humane so that power, always so dangerous, is not used for harm. That is an ongoing challenge, and tests even the best.</b>
<b>QUESTION TO PONDER</b>
<i>How could Yosef have wielded his power in a more humane way?</i>
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>There is a distinction between leadership and authority. Authority is something you have in virtue of office or the position you hold in a family, community, or society…. Judaism has tended to be critical of power. Kings had it and often abused it. Prophets had none, but their influence has lasted to this day…. Judaism is about leadership by influence, not about authority in virtue of formal office.
<b><i>Daring Greatly: Introduction to Lessons in Leadership,</i> xxii–xxiv</b>
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>What do you understand to be the agenda behind Yosef’s leadership decisions?
Do you think Yosef was cruel?
What is the lesson to be learned here? Did Yosef have an opportunity to learn it in his lifetime?
<b>EDUCATIONAL COMPANION TO THE QUESTIONS</b>
<b><i>IN A NUTSHELL</i></b><br>Yosef became the second most powerful man in Egypt through a complex series of events over which he had no control. It seems clear from the story that this was not his plan or agenda. He merely wanted to gain his freedom, and probably just to return to his family and the land of his birth. But God had other ideas, and before he knew what had happened, he had become Pharaoh’s viceroy. Pharaoh saw that he was talented, intuitive, and eager to help, and therefore likely had the potential to be a great asset to Egypt, if given a leadership role. The question is, what did he do with this power?
<b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>The simple answer to this question is Pharaoh. Pharaoh gave him the authority when he appointed him as his viceroy. Pharaoh had this ability because of his own power, which he chose to share with Yosef. However, we can also say that Yosef earned this power through his intelligence, both spiritual (that he interpreted the dreams successfully) and political (and when he created an economic plan for Egypt). Finally, of course, it is God who is the ultimate source of all of our resources, and it was God’s plan to place Yosef in this position of power and influence.
This is the subject of this <i>Covenant &amp; Conversation</i> essay, and a full evaluation is explored in the <i>Thinking More Deeply</i> section. At the beginning it seems that Yosef was a highly competent and deeply thoughtful leader. It is also possible to say that his loyalty and full commitment is to his new country and its leader. If we look further into Rabbi Sacks’s interpretation in this essay, we will see that this was at the expense of its people, and arguably without engaging the core values of compassion and morality.
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br>The man came to Shammai because he was one of the greatest rabbis of his generation. He said he was interested in converting to Judaism and the Rabbis held the key to that. The source of Shammai’s power was his knowledge, his position as leader of the community, a spiritual and halakhic authority. Shammai felt the man was mocking the Torah. The request was so ludicrous he must be a time-waster who needed to be sent away, because there is no way to learn the entire corpus of Jewish knowledge in a few moments (while standing on one foot). So, Shammai concluded, he could not have been genuine if he was not showing respect, and therefore he did not merit a respectful response. To show him his behaviour was unacceptable, Shammai chased him away.
Hillel, unlike Shammai, found room for compassion, even though the request seemed unreasonable. Perhaps the man was cynical, but his question could still be answered gently. Perhaps the man was genuine and merely felt he would not be able to embark on a long educational journey of some depth. Hillel applied his power through the lens of compassion. However, he left the man with an eternal message (one which also addressed the possibility that he was not genuine and was there to mock). Don’t do to others what you wouldn’t want done to you. This is the core message of the Torah – concern and love for your fellow.
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>The plan concocted by Yosef saved the Egyptian people from starvation and rewarded Pharaoh financially. The economy and state flourished more than the people though, because by the end of the famine, the Egyptians were penniless and landless, and totally dependent on Pharaoh and the state. If Yosef’s leadership had been based on values such as compassion and concern for the weak in society, he would have found a way to maintain the dignity of the people of Egypt and ensure they had the means for independent economic sustainability following the famine.
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>Yosef’s clear agenda was twofold – his loyalty to Egypt, and to Pharaoh as its leader, meant that he wanted to ensure that there was enough food for all during those years of famine, and he also saw an opportunity to create economic growth and power for Pharaoh. The plan he created to deal with the impending economic disaster was designed to ensure the economic stability of the institutions of state in Egypt. Unfortunately, this agenda and the resulting plan was not focused on the long-term needs of the people of Egypt, exploiting them and their need for food, to gain power and wealth for the leader, and taking their animals, land, and freedom in exchange for the same food they had willingly put into storage just a few years earlier.
This did not make Yosef cruel per se<i>.</i> But in choosing this agenda, rather than focusing on the needs of the people, Yosef was not demonstrating leadership based on the values of compassion and concern for the individual subjects of the realm. It was a leadership strategy lacking humanity.
Yosef’s leadership ultimately led to the enslavement of the Egyptian people to Pharaoh and the state, and in the longer term it enabled a future ruler to enslave Yosef’s own people, in the cruelest way. The lesson to be learned here is that a leadership focused on anything other than the concerns and needs of the people is a leadership lacking in humanity and compassion, and this can ultimately lead to cruelty and injustice. Yosef did not learn this message in his lifetime, but the message is there for us to learn with the hindsight of history.

II; The Universal and the Particular

<big><strong>II. The Universal and the Particular</strong></big><br><b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>When Yosef is brought from prison to interpret Pharaoh’s dreams, both men refer to God. Three times the word <i>Elokim</i>, God, appears in Bereshit 41. On the face of it, this is surprising. Egypt was not a monotheistic (belief in one God) culture. On the contrary, it was a place of many gods and goddesses – the sun, the Nile, and so on. Why then does Yosef take it for granted that Pharaoh will understand his reference to God – an assumption proved correct when Pharaoh twice uses the word himself? What is the significance of the word <i>Elokim</i>?
The Torah has two primary ways of referring to God: the four-letter name we allude to as <i>Hashem</i> (“the name”) and the word <i>Elokim</i>. Judah Halevi, the philosopher-poet of the eleventh century, believed these represented two different ways to relate to God.
The ancients worshipped forces of nature, which they personified as gods. Each was known as <i>el</i>, or <i>eloah</i>. The word “<i>el</i>” therefore generically means “a force, a power, an element of nature.” Judaism, however, believed that the forces of nature were not independent and autonomous. They represented a single totality, one creative will, the Author of being – God. The Torah therefore speaks of <i>Elokim</i> in the plural, meaning “the sum of all forces, the totality of all powers.” Today we might say that <i>Elokim</i> is God as He is found in science: the Big Bang, the various forces that give the universe its configuration, and the genetic code that shapes life from the simplest bacterium to Homo sapiens.
<i>Hashem</i> is God’s proper name. The difference between proper names and general descriptions is important. <i>Things</i> have descriptions, but only <i>people</i> have proper names. When we call someone by name, we are relating to them in their uniqueness and ours. We are opening up ourselves to them and inviting them, in readiness and respect, to open themselves up to us.
<i>Elokim</i> is God as we encounter Him in nature. <i>Hashem</i> is God as we encounter Him in personal relationships, above all in that essentially human mode of relationship that we call speech, verbal communication, conversation, dialogue, words. That is why Yosef is able to assume that Egyptians will understand the idea of <i>Elokim</i>, even though they are wholly unfamiliar with the idea of <i>Hashem</i>. An Egyptian can understand <i>Elokim</i>, the God of nature. He cannot understand <i>Hashem</i>, the God of personal relationship.
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. Do you find it easy or hard to relate to</i> Elokim, <i>the God of science and creation?</i>
<i>2. Do you find it easier or harder to relate to </i>Hashem, <i>the personal God, with whom you can speak and have a relationship?</i>
<i>3. Can you think of  examples from your own life of times when you have connected to the aspects of God that we are referring to as</i> Elokim<i> and</i> Hashem?
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br><i>Eliyahu was one of the greatest of the prophets, a man of justice unafraid to confront kings and prophets alike. What upset him the most was the spread of idolatry among his people. He decided to confront the prophets of the god Baal on Mount Carmel. He and they would offer a sacrifice. The God who sent fire to consume the offering would be the true God. His opponents prepared the sacrifice, said their prayers, and waited. No fire came. Eliyahu then said a prayer and fire came down from heaven. Eliyahu had won! And the people declared, “The Lord is God.”</i>
<i>But the story does not end there. Queen Izevel orders Eliyahu’s arrest and he runs away to Mount Ḥorev, which is Mount Sinai. God asks him: “What are you doing here, Eliyahu?” Eliyahu replies: “I have been very zealous for the Lord God Almighty.” God says: “Go and stand on the mountain in the presence of the Lord, for the Lord is about to pass by.” Suddenly there was a whirlwind “tearing the mountains apart and shattering the rocks.” But God was not in the wind. Then came an earthquake, but God was not in the earthquake. Then there was a fire, but God was not in the fire. Then came a “still, small voice.” Immediately, Eliyahu recognised that this was the voice of God.</i>
<i>God then repeated his question, “What are you doing here, Eliyahu?” Eliyahu replied in the same words as before. God then told Eliyahu to appoint Elisha as his successor.</i>
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. In</i> The Core Idea<i>, we saw two aspects of God, represented by two different names,</i> Elokim<i> and</i> Hashem<i>. Which of those do you see in this story?</i>
<i>2. What lesson do you think God was trying to teach Eliyahu?</i>
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>As we saw in <i>The Core Idea</i>, Yosef refers to God in a way Pharaoh can understand – as <i>Elokim</i>, the aspect of God to be found in creation, rather than <i>Hashem,</i> the aspect of God we find in personal relationships and in revelation (direct divine communication). This is the tension, within Judaism, between the universal and the particular. God as we encounter Him in creation is universal; God as we hear Him in revelation is particular.
This is mirrored in the way the narrative of Bereshit develops. It begins with characters and events whose significance is that they are universal archetypes: Adam and Ḥava, Kayin and Hevel, Noaḥ and the Flood, the builders of Bavel. Their stories tell us about the human condition as such: obedience and rebellion, faith and fratricide, hubris and nemesis, technology and violence, the order God makes and the chaos we create. Not until the twelfth chapter of Bereshit does the Torah turn to the particular, to one family, that of Avraham and Sara, and the covenant God enters into with them and their descendants.
That duality and its sequence – from the universal to the particular – is not marginal to Judaism. One might almost call it the basic structure, the depth grammar, of the Jewish mind. The duality has legal-theological expression in the form of two covenants, the first with Noaḥ and all humanity after the Flood, the second with Avraham and his descendants, given detailed articulation at Mount Sinai and during the wilderness years. On the one hand there is the Noahide covenant with its seven commands: not to murder, steal, commit adultery, blaspheme, worship idols, or practise needless cruelty against animals, together with a positive command to establish a system of justice. These are the minimal and basic requirements of humanity as such, the foundations of any stable and morally acceptable society. On the other is the richly detailed code of 613 commandments that form Israel’s constitution as “a kingdom of priests and a holy nation” (Shemot 19:16).
Not only is the duality worked out in the form of law and ethics, covenant and command. It is also expressed in Judaism’s dual epistemology (philosophy of knowledge), its twofold scheme of human knowledge – <i>ḥokhma</i> and Torah. <i>Ḥokhma</i> is the truth we discover; Torah is the truth we inherit. <i>Ḥokhma</i> is the universal heritage of mankind, by virtue of the fact that we are created in God’s “image and likeness”; Torah is the specific heritage of Israel. <i>Ḥokhma</i> reveals God in creation; Torah is the word of God in revelation. <i>Ḥokhma</i> is ontological truth (how things are); Torah is covenantal truth (how things ought to be). <i>Ḥokhma</i> can be defined as anything that allows us to see the universe as the work of God, and humanity as the image of God; Torah is God’s covenant with the Jewish people, the architecture of holiness, and Israel’s written constitution as a nation under the sovereignty of God.
So there are the universals of Judaism – creation, humanity as God’s image, the covenant with Noaḥ, and knowledge-as-<i>ḥokhma</i>. There are also its particularities – revelation, Israel as God’s “firstborn child,” the covenants with Avraham and the Jewish people at Sinai, and knowledge-as-Torah. The first represents the face of God accessible to all mankind (creation); the second, that special, intimate, and personal relationship He has with the people He holds close, as disclosed in the Torah (revelation) and Jewish history (redemption). The word for the first is <i>Elokim</i>, and for the second, <i>Hashem</i>.
Judaism was – and to this day remains – unique in its combination of universalism and particularism. We believe that God is the God of all humanity. He created all. He is accessible to all. He cares for all. He has made a covenant with all. Yet there is also a relationship with God that is unique to the Jewish people. It alone has placed its national life under His direct sovereignty. It alone has risked its entire being on a divine covenant. It alone testifies in its history to the presence within it of a Presence beyond it.
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>Without Torah we cannot understand the Jewish story. But without <i>ḥokhma</i> we cannot understand the human story. There are three elements of Jewish faith: creation, revelation, and redemption. Creation is God’s relationship with the universe. Revelation is God’s relationship with us. Redemption is what happens when we apply revelation to creation, when we apply God’s word to God’s world. <i>We cannot apply Torah to the world unless we understand the world.</i> Without an understanding of creation, we will fail to bring about redemption.
<b><i>Future Tense,</i> 226</b>
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. According to Rabbi  Sacks, is it a mitzva to learn</i> ḥokhma <i>and if so, why?</i>
<i>2. How is the Jewish people in a unique position to influence the world for the better, and how can we do this?</i>
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>What aspects of your life and your faith connect you to people of other faiths, and what aspects are an obstacle to connecting and forming relationships with people from other faiths?
Do you think the fact that Jews have a particular and special relationship with God and a specific covenant with Him make the Jewish people superior in any way?
How does Judaism’s dual approach of universalism and particularism make it a unique message?
<b>EDUCATIONAL COMPANION TO THE QUESTIONS</b>
<b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>The human experience is universal, and <i>Elokim</i> represents the God of that universal experience. All humans who are open to finding room for God in their life should be able to connect to the God of science and creation, and each religion provides a suggested path to that connection (but organised religion is not necessarily the only path to connecting to this universal God).
A personal God, the God who plays a role in history in general, and in your life specifically, the God who listens and answers prayers, is a God with whom a relationship takes a deeper faith and harder work to cultivate. These two modes of relationship with God were expressed by the modern Jewish philosopher Martin Buber as I-It and I-Thou relationships respectively.
This is a personal question that requires self-introspection and a personal answer.
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br>One possible approach to this story, found in chapter 19 of I Melakhim, is that the God of Power whom Eliyahu brings to judge the prophets of Baal on Mount Carmel, and the God who reveals Himself to Eliyahu on Mount Ḥorev/Sinai in the power of nature (the whirlwind, the earthquake, and the fire) was the God of creation, represented by the name <i>Elokim</i>. The personal God, <i>Hashem</i>, was found in the “still, small voice” that Eliyahu could connect to.
A possible lesson that God is teaching Eliyahu is that while there is a time and a place for the powerful God of nature (and supernatural miracles like those that happened on Mount Carmel in the story), that is not the personal God with whom one can form and nurture a relationship. Only the God of the “still small voice,” the voice found within us, can be connected to on a personal and intimate level.
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>According to Rabbi Sacks, it is vital that Jews learn <i>ḥokhma</i> as well as Torah, to fulfil the mission and destiny of the Jewish people to the world. Rabbi Sacks believes the Jewish people have a radical responsibility to improve the world through spreading the values of the Torah through modelling them individually and as a nation. In this way, we will bring about redemption for the world. However, the only way it is possible to do this is through understanding the world by studying the wisdom of the world. He called this kind of knowledge <i>ḥokhma</i>, which can be explained as natural and social sciences (including the arts and general human culture). In this way, we will be able to apply Torah values (revelation) to the world (creation) and bring about redemption.
The Jewish people have been charged with the mission of helping to bring redemption to the world through spreading Torah values through living them, and hence were brought into a specific covenant with God, which is the observance of the Torah. This is a task given to the Jewish people, not because of any inherent superiority or preferential treatment or relationship with God. Rather, it is a responsibility placed on them (and this is what Rabbi Sacks believes is the meaning of the Jews being a Chosen People).
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>Ultimately, all humans share the basic experience of humanity, and this should be enough for empathy, connection, and relationship. There are many aspects of Judaism specifically that can be found in other faiths and cultures and provide other ways to connect to people of other faiths and cultures. These may come from both the universal aspects of Judaism, as well as the particular aspects of Judaism, providing a particular example of faith and religion similar enough to other particular specific faiths, reminding us all that we have so much more in common than that which separates us. There are many examples of these particular and unique laws, especially the aspects of Judaism that are designed to strengthen our national and religious identity, perhaps at the expense of a more general identity that can be shared with the rest of humanity. These include laws such as Shabbat and kashrut, for example. However, these in themselves can also bring people of various faiths together if they are all approached as examples of ritual law, which all religions have.
The particular relationship the Jewish people believe they have with God does not preclude God having other relationships with all other people, just as the particular loving relationship a parent has with one child does not preclude a second deeply loving and special relationship with a second sibling. In fact, it is a core belief of Judaism that “God is the God of all humanity. He created all. He is accessible to all. He cares for all. He has made a covenant with all.” God’s unique relationship with the Jewish people does not impact that in any way, just as God’s unique relationship with other peoples has no impact on the Jewish people and their relationship with God.
Some other religions are only universal or ultimately particular in their message. This means that according to these religions, there is only one way to serve God and live in His shadow. Those who choose to convert and live their lives according to the doctrine of this religion will be saved, and those who refuse will miss out on salvation, facing whatever alternative they believe God has in store for those outside of the true faith. In Latin, this is called “<i>extra Ecclesiam nulla salus</i>.” However, Judaism’s approach is diametrically opposed to this. The universal dimension of Jewish thought allows an open and tolerant approach to all people, lifestyles, and religions that are compatible with the basic morality contained in the Noahide covenant and the seven laws contained therein (see <i>Thinking More Deeply</i> above). Those who wish to convert to Judaism can, but this is not a necessity (and in fact Jewish law makes this process challenging in order to ensure the integrity of the motivation of the would-be convert).

Vayigash

In a Nutshell

<b><i>IN A NUTSHELL</i></b><br>Our <i>parasha</i> begins with Yehuda’s emotional speech to the viceroy of Egypt, pleading for Binyamin to be set free. Yehuda even asked to switch places with Binyamin and become the prisoner instead. Then the viceroy finally revealed that he was actually their brother Yosef. The brothers were shocked by this twist in their story, and Yosef told them not to worry that he might still be angry with them for selling him as a slave all those years ago. He explained that this was always God’s plan, and that everything had turned out okay for him. All twelve brothers came close together and hugged.
Both Pharaoh and Yosef then gave them many presents, and the brothers returned to Yaakov their father in the land of Canaan to tell him the news that his beloved son Yosef was still alive. Yaakov gathered the entire family together and they travelled to Egypt, seventy people in all.
Finally, the family is reunited. They settle in an area called Goshen, in Egypt, and the family of Benei Yisrael continues to grow and grow.
<b>QUESTION TO PONDER</b>
<i>How was it comforting to his brothers when Yosef told them this was always God’s plan?</i>

I; The Future of the Past

<big><strong>I. The Future of the Past</strong></big><br><b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>In our <i>parasha</i>, Yosef does something unusual. When he reveals himself to his brothers, he is fully aware that they will suffer shock and then guilt as they remember how it is that their brother is in Egypt. So he <i>reinterprets the past</i>:
<i>“I am your brother Yosef, the one you sold into Egypt! And now, do not be distressed and do not be angry with yourselves for selling me here, because it was to save lives that God sent me ahead of you. For two years now, there has been famine in the land, and for the next five years there will be no ploughing and reaping. But God sent me ahead of you to preserve for you a remnant on earth and to save your lives by a great deliverance. So then, it was not you who sent me here, but God. He made me father to Pharaoh, lord of his entire household and ruler of all Egypt”</i> (Bereshit 45:4–8).
This is very different from how Yosef explained these events to the chief butler in prison, when he said, “I was forcibly carried off from the land of the Hebrews, and even here I have done nothing to deserve being put in a dungeon” (Bereshit 40:15).
Then, it was a story of kidnap and injustice. Now, it has become a story of divine providence and redemption. It wasn’t you, he tells his brothers. It was God. You didn’t realise that you were part of a larger plan. Although it began badly, it has ended well. So do not feel guilty. And do not be afraid that I want revenge. I do not. I realise that we were all being directed by a force greater than ourselves, greater than we can fully understand.
Yosef repeats this in the next <i>parasha</i>, when the brothers fear that he may finally take revenge after their father’s death: “Don’t be afraid. Am I in the place of God? <i>You intended to harm me, but God intended it for good</i> to accomplish what is now being done, the saving of many lives” (Bereshit 50:19–20).
Yosef is helping his brothers to change their memory of the past. In doing so, he is challenging an assumption we make about time, that we can change the future but not the past. But is that entirely true? What Yosef is doing for his brothers is what he has clearly done for himself: events have changed his – and now their – understanding of the past.
Which means: We do not understand what is happening to us now until we can look back in retrospect and see how it all turned out. This means that we are not held captive by the past. Things can happen to us that can completely alter the way we look back and remember. <i>Through action in the future, we can redeem the past</i>.
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. How can our understanding of the past be changed by what happens in the future?</i>
<i>2. Doesn’t Yosef have a right to feel like a victim in the story? Why does he reframe his experiences without this aspect of the story?</i>
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br><i>Early on the morning of September 11, 2001, Rabbi Leivi Sudak boarded a plane at London’s Heathrow Airport to New York’s JFK. It was one week before Rosh HaShana, and his plan was to make a brief visit to the grave of the Lubavitcher Rebbe to pray for a good and sweet new year, and then take a return flight to London that evening, as he did every year. But this time, it was not to be. In the middle of the flight, his plane, along with thirty-eight other planes, was sent in a different direction – and 6,700 bewildered passengers were re-routed to the tiny town of Gander, in Newfoundland, Canada. They later found out why: there had been airplane hijackings and attacks on the Twin Towers in New York and the Pentagon in Washington, and US airspace had been shut down until further notice.</i>
<i>Even after landing, the passengers were stuck in their planes for over fourteen hours. Rabbi Sudak found himself thinking, “Why am I here? What is the purpose of all this?”</i>
<i>Rabbi Sudak and his fellow stranded passengers were awestruck by the kindness and generosity displayed by the citizens of Gander. They were not a wealthy community, but upon learning of the diverted planes, they mobilised, converting every possible space into shelters, and set up communication centres so that the passengers could contact their families. Toiletries were shared around and grocery shelves emptied as residents cooked thousands of meals to feed the guests, who came from ninety-five different countries. The local school became their sleeping base, and many families hosted visitors in their private homes.</i>
<i>Rabbi Sudak took upon himself responsibility for any Jews who were stranded, and immediately set up a kosher kitchen, with the help of a local schoolteacher, Eithne Smith.</i>
<i>During his stay, Rabbi Sudak also met a local<b></b> Gander resident called Ed Brake, an elderly man who, hearing a rabbi was on the island, wanted to share his story. He was Jewish but had hidden his identity for decades – Brake was born in Nazi Germany and his parents had saved him and his brother by finding a British family to care for them. (Later, when Rabbi Sudak finally reached home again, he sent Ed Brake a kippa, tallit, and siddur, and later learned from his son that before he died, he had asked to be buried with these sacred Jewish items.)</i>
<i>Shabbat approached and Rabbi Sudak provided Shabbat meals for all those who needed them. Then word came that flights were leaving the island. Unable to travel on Shabbat, Rabbi Sudak and a Chabad mother and daughter stayed behind.</i>
<i>After Shabbat, Eithne Smith and her husband Carl, eager to help the trio reach a Jewish community in time for Rosh HaShana, drove them more than three hundred miles to catch a flight to New York. Rabbi Sudak arrived at his relatives’ home in New York just seven minutes before candle-lighting. That Rosh HaShana was like no other, as Rabbi Sudak reflected on this experience. “It was a very momentous moment of change in my life because I had witnessed four days of absolute pure generosity.”</i>
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. How do you imagine Rabbi Sudak and the other passengers must have felt at first about being diverted to Gander?</i>
<i>2. How did Rabbi Sudak change his perspective of this unfortunate turn of events?</i>
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>A classic example of someone in our time who redeemed the past through action in the future is the late Steve Jobs. In his 2005 speech at Stanford University, now with more than forty million YouTube views, he describes three crushing blows in his life: dropping out of college, being fired by Apple – the company he had founded – and being diagnosed with cancer. Each one, he said, had led to something important and positive.
After dropping out of college, he was able to audit any course he wished. He attended one on calligraphy and this inspired him to build into his first computers a range of proportionally spaced fonts, that gave computer script an elegance that had previously been available only to professional printers. Getting fired from Apple led him to start a new computer company, NeXT, that developed capabilities he would eventually bring back to Apple, as well as acquiring Pixar Animation, the most creative of computer-animated film studios. The diagnosis of cancer led him to a new focus in life. It made him realise: “Your time is limited, so don’t waste it living someone else’s life.”
Jobs’s ability to construct these stories – what he called “connecting the dots” – was surely not unrelated to his ability to survive the blows he suffered in life. Few could have recovered from the blow of being dismissed by his own company, and fewer still could have achieved the transformation he did at Apple when he returned, creating the iPod, iPhone, and iPad. He did not believe in tragic inevitabilities. Though he would not have put it in these terms, he knew that by action in the future we can redeem the past.
Professor Mordechai Rotenberg of the Hebrew University has argued that this kind of technique, of reframing the past, could be used as a therapeutic technique in rehabilitating patients suffering from a crippling sense of guilt. If we constantly regret the past, then it will constantly hold us back like a ball and chain around our legs. We cannot change the past, but we can reinterpret it by integrating it into a new and larger narrative. That is what Yosef did, and having used the technique to survive a personal life of unparalleled ups and downs, he then used it to help his brothers overcome their guilt.
We find this in Judaism throughout its history, starting with the prophets, who reinterpreted biblical narrative for their day. Since then, there has hardly been a generation in all of Jewish history when Jews did not reinterpret their texts in the light of the present-tense experience. We are the people who tell stories, and then retell them repeatedly, each time with a slightly different emphasis, establishing a connection between then and now, rereading the past in the light of the present as best we can.
It is by telling stories that we make sense of our lives and the life of our people. And it is by allowing the present to reshape our understanding of the past that we redeem history and make it live as a positive force in our lives.
I can personally attest to this way of looking back at events in my life, and seeing the journey differently. In 1978, I visited the Lubavitcher Rebbe to seek his advice on which career I should follow. I did the usual thing everyone did: I sent him a note with the options, A, B, or C, expecting him to indicate which one I should follow. The options were to become a barrister, or an economist, or an academic philosopher, whether as a fellow of my college in Cambridge or as a professor somewhere else.
The Rebbe read out the list and said “No” to all three. My mission, he said, was to instead train rabbis at Jews’ College (now the London School of Jewish Studies) and to become a congregational rabbi myself. So, overnight, I found myself saying goodbye to all my aspirations, to everything for which I had been trained.
The strange thing is that I ultimately fulfilled all those ambitions despite walking in the opposite direction. I became an honourary barrister (Bencher) of Inner Temple and delivered a law lecture in front of six hundred barristers and the Lord Chief Justice. I delivered Britain’s two leading economics lectures, the Mais Lecture and the Hayek Lecture, at the Institute of Economic Affairs. I became a fellow of my Cambridge college and a philosophy professor at several universities. I identified with the biblical Yosef because, so often, what I had dreamed of came to be at the very moment that I had given up hope. Only in retrospect did I discover that the Rebbe was not telling me to give up my career plans. He was simply charting a different route and a more beneficial one.
<b>I believe that the way we write the next chapter in our lives affects all the others that have come before. By action in the future, we can redeem much of the pain of the past.</b>
<b>QUESTION TO PONDER</b>
<i>Can you think of any examples of times in Jewish history where we have found positivity after disaster?</i>
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>If we search for revelation in history, we will find it, more compellingly than anywhere else, in the history of that unusual people, our ancestors.... Judaism is the insistence that history does have a meaning. Therefore each one of us has significance. We are not free-floating atoms in infinite space. We are letters in the scroll.
<b><i>A Letter in the Scroll</i>, 38–42</b>
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>Why does Yosef revise the way he presents the events that led to his arrival in Egypt?
How can the future change the way we understand the past?
Can you think of any examples in your life of events that seemed bad at the time but in hindsight were meaningful?
<b>EDUCATIONAL COMPANION TO THE QUESTIONS</b>
<b><i>IN A NUTSHELL</i></b><br>Yosef’s brothers must have felt terrible guilt for many years for the way they had treated Yosef, especially when they saw their father’s grief. Yosef comforted them by reassuring them that this was always God’s plan, and although they were responsible for their actions, they were also fulfilling God’s plan for Yosef and for the Jewish people. He told them he forgave them, so that they could forgive themselves.
<b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>When something happens to us, we have limited information to decide if this is good or bad for our life story. We decide based on our own short-term vision and plan for our life. But at a later time, when we can reflect on how this event changed our life in the longer term, we can often decide that what originally felt like a bad occurrence was in fact for the best. This idea encourages us to be positive and have hope, and to make the best of a bad event, in order to redeem it from being bad.
If the victim of tragedy continues to focus on their victimhood, they will never be able to move past it and grow beyond their difficult experiences. Yosef decides to reframe the way he looks at his life so that he lets go of his victimhood, and regains the agency of his life. He does this by understanding how these events pushed him to grow and pushed his life towards his destiny. Rabbi Sacks spoke many times about how he learned this lesson of letting go of victimhood from Holocaust survivors, and how they rebuilt their lives after the Holocaust.
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br>When things don’t go as planned, it can be a deeply frustrating feeling. This story is a profound example of this. Rabbi Sudak had important work and preparations to do for Rosh HaShana in London, and now, not only would he be unable to visit the grave of the Rebbe before Yom Tov, but there was a chance he would also not be able to get home in time for Rosh HaShana. The frustration and disappointment must have been great, for him and the other 6,700 stranded passengers.
He managed to see this as an opportunity to give and receive love and kindness. It became a very important and positive experience. He was inspired by seeing the people of Gander mobilise to care for thousands of unexpected guests, and he also saw this as his opportunity to care for the needs of the Jews in Gander at that time, and bring them closer to Judaism. He turned what felt at first like a negative event into a deeply positive and meaningful one.
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>Jewish history contains a long list of catastrophic events that have led to positive opportunities for national growth. From slavery in Egypt at the outset of Jewish history, through years of exile, culminating in the Holocaust, the character of the Jewish people, and the evolution of Judaism and Jewish culture, has been deeply impacted by these events. Jews have taken each tragic event and found a way to redeem it for the good and positive.
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>Yosef realised that the trauma of this period in his life was a necessary step for him, leading him to achieve the position he now held, which was part of God’s plan for both Egypt and Jewish history. He stressed this to his brothers so they would not feel grief and shame at the role they played, and this would allow the brothers to be reconciled with him.
Bad events in life can lead to positive outcomes. When we manage to see the positive in the longer term, we can then revisit the bad event and decide that it wasn’t so bad after all because of where it led us. In fact, after reframing the event, we can say that it was an important event in our lives, leading to an ultimately positive outcome.
This could be something as insignificant as missing the bus, and because of this bumping into an old friend. Or something more significant, like being rejected by a school, university, or job, which led to a different opportunity and experience that shaped your life and took it in a different direction.

II; Does My Father Love Me?

<big><strong>II. Does My Father Love Me?</strong></big><br><b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>It is one of the great questions we naturally ask each time we read the story of Yosef. Why did he not, at some time during their twenty-two-year separation, send word to his father, Yaakov, that he was alive? For part of that time – when he was a slave in Potifar’s house, and when he was in prison – it would have been impossible. But he certainly could have done so when he became the second most powerful person in Egypt, or when the brothers came before him on their first journey to buy food.
Yosef knew how much his father loved him. He must have known how much their separation grieved him. He did not know what Yaakov thought had happened to him, but this surely he knew: that it was his duty to communicate with him when the opportunity arose, to tell his father that he was alive and well. Why then did he not?
The story of Yosef’s descent into slavery and exile began when his father sent him, alone, to see how the brothers were faring. Immediately prior to this episode, the Torah tells us about the second of Yosef’s dreams: “The sun and moon and eleven stars were bowing down to me.” When he told his father as well as his brothers, his father rebuked him and said, “What is this dream you had? Will your mother and I and your brothers actually come and bow down to the ground before you?” (Bereshit 37:9–11).
Immediately afterwards, we read of Yaakov sending Yosef, alone, to his brothers. It was there, at that meeting far from home, that they plotted to kill him, lowered him into a pit, and eventually sold him as a slave. Yosef had many years to reflect on that episode. That his brothers were hostile to him, he knew. But surely Yaakov knew this as well. In which case, why did he send Yosef to them? Did Yaakov not contemplate the possibility that they might do him harm? Did he not know the dangers of sibling rivalry? (In fact, he knew this better than anyone from his personal experience with Esav!) Did Yaakov not contemplate the possibility that by sending Yosef to them he was risking his life?
Yet Yaakov sent Yosef to his other sons knowing that they were jealous of him and hated him. What else could he conclude, as he reflected on the events that led up to his sale as a slave, but that Yaakov had deliberately placed him in this danger? Why? Because of the immediately prior event, when Yosef had told his father that “the sun and moon” – his father and mother – would bow down to him. This angered Yaakov, and Yosef knew it. His father had “rebuked” him. What else could he conclude but that Yaakov had deliberately put his life at risk? <i>Yosef did not communicate with his father because he believed his father no longer wanted to see him or hear from him</i>.
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. Is it normal for a child to question how much their parents really love them?</i>
<i>2. Do you think Yaakov was wrong to send Yosef to check on his brothers?</i>
<i>3. What can we learn from this story about how important communication is in relationships?</i>
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br>The following is a short story based on <i>“</i>Somebody’s Son<i>”</i> by Richard Pindell.
<i>As David sat on the side of the road in the Dakota plains, waiting for his next ride, he wrote:</i>
<i>“Dear Mom, if Dad will permit it, I would like to come home. I know there’s little chance he will. I’m not going to kid myself. I remember he said once, if I ever ran off, I might as well keep going. All I can say is that I felt like leaving home was something I had to do. I wanted to find out more about life and about me, and the best way for us (life and me) to live with each other. You won’t be able to reach me by mail, because I don’t know where I will be next. But in a few days, I hope to be passing our place. If there’s any chance Dad will have me back, please ask him to tie a white cloth to the apple tree in the south pasture. I’ll be going by on the train. If there’s no cloth on the tree, I’ll just quietly, and without any hard feelings towards Dad, keep going. Love, David”</i>
<i>David mailed the letter with a knot in his stomach. The coming days brought new acquaintances and adventures as David hitchhiked with cars, vans, trucks, and freight trains, all the time edging closer to his home in Maryland.</i>
<i>Finally, as he ascended the passenger train that would be the last leg of his journey homewards, the knot returned and firmly lodged itself in his core. He could hardly bring himself to imagine the apple tree in the pasture of his childhood home, for fear it would be bereft of the white cloth, even in his imagination.</i>
<i>As he sat down next to the window that would deliver his fate, an elderly gentleman sat in the seat beside him. As day turned to night, and once again back to day, the travel companions shared their stories. As David regaled his neighbor with stories of the West Coast, Canada, and even Mexico, he realised that in just a short while the train tracks would take a gentle bend to the right, and there would be the farm on which he grew up, with its south-facing pasture, and the old apple tree which he used to climb as a child. He couldn’t look. He was too afraid the cloth would not be there – too afraid he would find, staring back at him, just another tree, just another field – so he turned quickly away.</i>
<i>Desperately, he nudged his travel companion beside him. “Mister, will you do me a favor? Around this bend on the right, you’ll see an apple tree. I wonder if you’ll tell me if you see a white cloth tied to one of its branches.”</i>
<i>“Son,” the man said in a voice slow with wonder, “I see a white cloth tied on almost every twig.”</i>
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. What is the message of this story, and how is it linked to the story of Yosef in our</i> parasha?
<i>2. Do you think parental love is unconditional?</i>
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br><i>Yosef did not communicate with his father because he believed his father no longer wanted to see him or hear from him</i>. His father had terminated the relationship. That was a reasonable inference from the facts as Yosef knew them. He could not have known that Yaakov still loved him, that his brothers had deceived their father by showing him Yosef’s bloodstained cloak, and that his father mourned for him, “refusing to be comforted.” We know these facts because the Torah tells us. But Yosef, far away, in another land, serving as a slave, could not have known. This places the story in a completely new and tragic light.
Evidence for this theory is contained in the choice of name Yosef gave to his firstborn son Menashe: “It is because God has made me forget all my trouble <i>and all my father’s house</i>” (Bereshit 41:51). Uppermost in Yosef’s mind was the desire to forget the past, not just his brothers’ conduct towards him but “all my father’s house.” Yosef believed that his father had deliberately put him at his brothers’ mercy because, angered by the second dream, he no longer wanted contact with the son he had once loved. That is why he never sent a message to Yaakov that he was still alive.
If this is so, it sheds new light on the great opening scene of <i>Vayigash</i>. What was it in Yehuda’s speech that made Yosef break down in tears and finally reveal his identity to his brothers? Yehuda says words that, for the first time, allow Yosef to understand what had actually occurred twenty-two years previously. Yehuda recounted what happened after the brothers returned from their first journey to buy food in Egypt when Yaakov refused to allow the brothers to return with Binyamin, saying, “You know that my wife bore me two sons. One of them went away from me, and I said, ‘He has surely been torn to pieces.’ And I have not seen him since. If you take this one from me too and harm comes to him, you will bring my gray head down to the grave in misery” (Bereshit 44:27–31).
At that moment, Yosef realised that his fear that his father had rejected him was unwarranted. On the contrary, he had been bereft when Yosef did not return. He believed that he had been “torn to pieces,” killed by a wild animal. His father still loved him, still grieved for him. This explains why after revealing himself to his brothers, Yosef’s first thought is not about Yehuda or Binyamin, but about Yaakov. A doubt he had harboured for twenty-two years had turned out to be unfounded. Hence his first question: “Is my father still alive?” (Bereshit 45:1–3).
The theme of fathers and sons runs through the book of Bereshit. How did Yitzḥak feel towards Avraham, knowing that he had lifted a knife to sacrifice him? How did Yaakov feel towards Yitzḥak, knowing that he loved Esav more than him? How did Leah’s sons feel about Yaakov, knowing that he loved Raḥel and her children more? <i>Does my father really love me?</i> – that is a question we feel must have arisen in each of these instances. Now we see that there is a strong case for supposing that Yosef, too, must have asked himself the same question.
For Sigmund Freud, the Oedipus complex – the tension between fathers and sons – is the single most powerful determinant of the psychology of the individual, and of religion as a whole. Freud, however, took as his key text a Greek myth, not the narratives of Bereshit. Had he turned to the Torah instead, he would have seen that this fraught relationship can have a non-tragic resolution. Avraham did love Yitzḥak. Yitzḥak did bless Yaakov a second time, this time knowing he was Yaakov. Yaakov did love Yosef. And transcending all these human loves is divine love, rescuing us from feelings of rejection, and redeeming the human condition from tragedy.
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>If there’s one element of Judaism I’d love to share with everyone it’s this: If you want to survive and thrive as a people, a culture, a civilisation, celebrate the family. Hold it sacred. Eat together. Tell the story of what most matters to you across the generations. Make children the most important people. Put them centre stage. Encourage them to ask questions, the more the better. That’s what Moshe said thirty-three centuries ago and Judaism is still here to tell the tale, having survived some of the most brutal persecutions in human history, yet as a religious faith were still young and full of energy.
“<b>Thought for the Day<i>,</i>” BBC Radio 4, March 30, 2012</b>
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. Why do you think Rabbi Sacks claims that celebrating the family is the secret to Jewish continuity?</i>
<i>2. Can you think of any examples when Judaism makes “children the most important people”?</i>
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>Who do you relate to more in this tragic story, Yosef or Yaakov? Why?
What lessons can we draw from this story?
Why do you think the theme of parental love runs throughout the book of Bereshit?
<b>EDUCATIONAL COMPANION TO THE QUESTIONS</b>
<b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>This is a natural and normal phenomenon and the power of the biblical narrative is how it presents our forefathers as very human personalities with very human emotions, making it easier to learn from them as human beings.
Just as Yosef is presented in this story as vulnerable, Yaakov’s fallibility is also highlighted. It seems clear that he was not in touch with the dynamics of the relationships among his children. It is hard to lay blame at his door for what transpired after he sent Yosef away.
Communication is fundamental to healthy relationships. Trust in a relationship is also critical. When we can trust someone enough to be vulnerable around them, communication and avoiding miscommunication (or lack of communication) become much easier.
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br>The central message of this story is the power of parental love. Despite disappointment, or a dissonance between the values, ideas, and decisions of the child and parent, a healthy parent-child relationship will always be based on forgiveness, compassion, understanding, and love. Yosef feared this was not the case with his relationship with his father Yaakov, but he was mistaken.
This is a complex question because of the complex reality of the human condition. This is a great opportunity to have an honest discussion with your child about your relationship with them (or to explore parental relationships with your students).
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>The most formidable vehicle for the transmission of values, culture, and heritage is the family. It is no exaggeration to claim that Judaism’s obsession with parenting and family is a major factor explaining the improbable miracle of Jewish survival under profoundly adverse conditions through 2,000 years of exile and persecution.
Judaism is deeply committed to the values of family, children, and education. Thousands of years before any other civilisation, Jewish law instituted compulsory education from the youngest age. Judaism enshrined in sanctity of Jewish law the mitzva of having and rearing children. And Judaism placed learning and education at the centre of Jewish life. While other civilisations saw children as the property of their parents with no rights of their own, Judaism and Jewish law spoke of parental responsibility to children. Judaism always understood that our children are the secret to the survival of the Jewish people.
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>If you find that adults/parents find it easier to identify with Yaakov, and children with Yosef, then challenge them to switch their position and express what must have been going through the mind of the other character in order to try and connect and empathise with them more.
These could include the power of parental love, the importance of communication, trust, and honesty in relationships, and the parent-child relationship as a model for our relationship with God.
The book of Bereshit explores the human condition, from the universal themes of creation and humanity earlier in the book, to the narrower themes of familial relationships later on in the narrative. The parent-child relationship is central to the human condition, and the Torah wants to present it in an honest way and provide models for us. Rabbi Sacks also suggests at the end of this <i>Covenant &amp; Conversation</i> essay that this relationship can be seen as a model for our relationship with God. We certainly believe that God’s love for us is unconditional, in a way that we hope the parental love in our lives is also.

Vayechi

In a Nutshell

<b><i>IN A NUTSHELL</i></b><br>After all the family fights and arguments we have seen in the book of Bereshit, this chapter gives a peaceful end to the story. Yaakov is finally reunited with his beloved son Yosef, and meets his grandsons for the first time. This is the only time in the Torah we see a grandfather together with his grandchildren in this way. He blesses them, and then, just before he dies, he also blesses his twelve sons.
He is buried in the Cave of Makhpela with his parents Yitzḥak and Rivka, and his grandparents Avraham and Sara.
After their father’s death, the brothers worry that Yosef will take revenge for what they did to him all those years ago. So Yosef explains to his brothers again that he forgives them. Yosef also promises his brothers that God will eventually bring the family back to Israel, and then he dies.
With this, the story of Avraham’s family concludes, and we are ready to begin a new age – the birth of Israel as a nation – in the book of Shemot.
<b>QUESTION TO PONDER</b>
<i>Why do you think there are so many family fights in the book of Bereshit?</i>

I; Family, Faith, and Freedom

<big><strong>I. Family, Faith, and Freedom</strong></big><br><b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>If you want to understand what a book is about, look carefully at how it ends. Bereshit ends with three deeply significant scenes.
First, Yaakov blesses his grandsons, Efrayim and Menashe. This is the blessing that Jewish parents use on Friday nights to bless their children. Lord Jakobovits, who was chief rabbi before me, used to ask why this is the blessing we use for our children, rather than all the other blessings in the Torah? He gave a beautiful reply. He said, all the other <i>berakhot</i> are from fathers to sons – and between fathers and sons there can be tension. <i>Yaakov’s blessing of Efrayim and Menashe is the only instance in the Torah of a grandparent blessing a grandchild</i>. And between grandparents and grandchildren there is no tension, only pure love.
Second, Yaakov blesses his twelve sons. This time there is some lingering tension. Yaakov’s blessings to his eldest three sons, Reuven, Shimon, and Levi, read more like curses than blessings. Yet the fact is that he is blessing all twelve together in the same room at the same time. We have not seen this before. There is no record of Avraham blessing either Yishmael or Yitzḥak. Yitzḥak blesses Esav and Yaakov separately. The mere fact that Yaakov is able to gather his sons together for this moment is unique and important. In the next chapter – the first of the book of Exodus – the Israelites are, for the first time, described as a people. They had to first be able to live together as a family before they could grow into a nation.
Third, after the death of Yaakov, the brothers asked Yosef to forgive them, which he does. He had also done so earlier, but the brothers were worried that he had been waiting until their father died, as Esav at one point promised to do, before exacting vengeance. Sons do not take revenge within the family while the father is alive – that seems to have been the principle in those days. Yosef speaks directly to their fears and puts them at rest. “You intended to harm me but God intended it for good,” he says.
The Torah is telling us an unexpected message here: <i>the family is prior to all else</i>, to the land, the nation, politics, economics, the pursuit of power, and the accumulation of wealth. From an external point of view, the impressive story is that Yosef reached the heights of power in Egypt. But when we turn the page and begin the book of Exodus, we discover that the position of the Israelites in Egypt was very vulnerable indeed, and all the power Yosef had centralised in the hands of Pharaoh would eventually be used against them.
Bereshit is in fact not about power. It is about families. Because that is where life together begins, and where we learn to care and love.
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. Why do you think families so often have tensions and arguments?</i>
<i>2. What does “family is prior to all else” mean? What message is the Torah giving us?</i>
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br><i>In 1939, Lord Richard Attenborough (15), Sir David Attenborough (13), and their brother John (11) were living with their parents in Leicester, England, and two young girls aged 10 and 12 were staying with them for a short while. Their mother had recently died and their father had been taken as a prisoner in Germany. The plan was that the girls would soon journey to the United States where they had relatives, but then war was declared and they realised that they would now be unable to cross the Atlantic. What was to be done?</i>
<i>The Attenborough parents wanted to offer the girls a home for the duration of the war, but they felt it was a decision that could only be made as a family. Richard never forgot how his parents called him and his two brothers into the study and told them the situation. They explained that the two girls, Helga and Irene, were Jewish and without a home. They had escaped to the UK on the Kindertransport, but they had no one to care for them and nowhere to go.</i>
<i>Lord Attenborough recalled his parents’ words. “We want to adopt the girls. We think it is the right thing to do. But we will only do it if you agree. It will call for sacrifices. We were a family of five. Now we will be a family of seven. There will be things we won’t be able to afford. There will be things you will have to share. One of those will be love. You know how much we love you. But now you will have to share that love with Helga and Irene. We will have to show them special affection, because you have a family, but now they have no one at all.”</i>
<i>The boys agreed. Thinking back to that day, Lord Attenborough describes it as the most important day of his life. He had been given the chance to sacrifice something for someone else. He had been invited by his parents to join them in an act of courage and generosity.</i>
<i>The Attenboroughs never lost touch with Helga and Irene, whom they immediately accepted as their sisters. “They helped shape our lives, and we loved them,” he said.</i>
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. What lessons and values did the Attenborough children learn when they brought Helga and Irene into the family?</i>
<i>2. Can you learn these lessons from your family even without a profound act of kindness such as this? How?</i>
<b><i>Thinking More Deeply</i></b><br>The Torah does not imply that there is anything easy about making and sustaining a family. The patriarchs and matriarchs – Sara, Rivka, and Raḥel especially – know the agony of infertility. They know what it is to wait in hope and wait again.
Sibling rivalry is a repeated theme of the Torah. The psalm tells us, “How good and pleasant it is for brothers to dwell together.” It might have added, “and how rare.” Almost at the beginning of the human story, Kayin kills Hevel. There are tensions between Sara and Hagar that led to Hagar and Yishmael being sent away. There is rivalry between Yaakov and Esav, and between Yosef and his brothers, in both cases coming close to murder.
Yet there is no reduction of the significance of the family. To the contrary, it is the main vehicle of blessing. Children figure as central to God’s blessings. It is as if the Torah were telling us, with great honesty, that yes, families are challenging. The relationship between husband and wife, and between parent and child, is rarely straightforward. But we have to work at it. There is no guarantee that we will always get it right. It is by no means clear that the parents in Bereshit always got it right. But this is our most human institution.
The family is where love brings new life into the world. That in itself makes it the most spiritual of all institutions. It is also where we have our most important and lasting moral education. To quote Harvard political scientist, the late James Q. Wilson, the family is “an arena in which conflicts occur and must be managed.” People within the family “love and quarrel, share and sulk, please and disappoint.” Families, he says, “are the world in which we shape and manage our emotions.”
The Torah guides us through areas that have been identified in the twentieth century as the most important arenas of conflict. Freud saw the Oedipus complex – the desire to create space for yourself by removing your father – as one of the primary drivers of human emotion. René Girard saw sibling rivalry as a, perhaps the, source of human violence.
I have argued in the past that the story of the binding of Yitzḥak is directed precisely at the Oedipus complex. God does not want Avraham to kill Yitzḥak. He wants him to relinquish ownership of Yitzḥak. He wants to abolish one of the most widespread beliefs of the ancient world, known in Roman law as the principle of <i>patria potestas</i>, that parents own their children. Once this has gone, and children become legal personalities in their own right, then much of the force of the Oedipus complex is removed. Children have space to be themselves.
I have argued also that the story of Yaakov’s wrestling match with the angel is directed against the source of sibling rivalry, namely <i>mimetic desire</i>, the desire to have what your brother has because he has it. Yaakov becomes Yisrael when he ceases wanting to be Esav and stands tall as himself.
So Bereshit is not a hymn to the virtue of families. It is a candid, honest, fully worked-through account of what it is to confront some of the main problems within families, even the best.
Bereshit ends on these three important resolutions: first, that grandparents are part of the family and their blessing is important. Second, Yaakov shows it is possible to bless all your children, even if you have a fractured relationship with some of them. Third, Yosef shows it is possible to forgive your family, even if they have done you great harm.
People who look to the state, politics, and power to deliver the good, the beautiful, and the true – the Hellenistic tradition – tend to regard the family and all it presupposes in terms of fidelity and responsibility as a distraction. But for people who understand, not just the importance of politics but also its limitations and dangers, relationships between husband and wife, parent and child, grandparents and grandchildren, and siblings, are the most important basis of freedom. That is an insight that runs all the way through Alexis de Tocqueville’s <i>Democracy in America</i>, summed up in his statement that “as long as family feeling was kept alive, the opponent of oppression was never alone.”
James Q. Wilson put it beautifully: “We learn to cope with the people of this world because we learn to cope with the members of our family. Those who flee the family flee the world; bereft of the former’s affection, tutelage, and challenges, they are unprepared for the latter’s tests, judgements, and demands.”
That, surprisingly, is what Bereshit is about. Not about the creation of the world, which occupies only one chapter, but about how to handle family conflict. Once Avraham’s descendants can create strong families, they can move from Bereshit to Shemot and their birth as a nation.
<b>I believe that family is the birthplace of freedom. Caring for one another, we learn to care for the common good.</b>
<b>QUESTION TO PONDER</b>
<i>What is the connection between freedom and the family?</i>
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>In the family I learn the complex choreography of love – what it means to give and take and share, to grow from obedience to responsibility, to learn, challenge, rebel, make mistakes, to forgive and be forgiven, to argue and make up, to win without triumph and know when to lose graciously. It is where we acquire emotional intelligence, that delicate negotiation between the given and the chosen, the things I will and the things resistant to my will.
<b><i>Celebrating Life,</i> 100</b>
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>What important lessons can we learn from our families and the tensions we experience within them?
Why does the Torah have a whole book on the topic of Avraham and his family?
Why do you think family is such a central value to Judaism?
<b>EDUCATIONAL COMPANION TO THE QUESTIONS</b>
<b><i>IN A NUTSHELL</i></b><br>Families fight. This is the most natural thing in the world. Human beings, when forced to live in close proximity, find it challenging to manage the needs and agenda of other individuals next to their own or next to the needs of the group. The Torah presents our ancestors as realistic models for us to follow, and to do this, the Torah includes the human elements of their relationships, presenting their mistakes and faults, and the way they are overcome. These characters can have a powerful impact on us from the way they managed to love despite the tensions and fights and mistakes. That is the message for us to learn for our own lives.
<b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>Families are made up of diverse people. Even when they share DNA, they often have very different personalities and needs and dreams. It is only natural when diverse people live in close proximity that there will be tensions. Because of the familiarity and love and trust usually present in families, tensions come to the fore even more than outside of the family context, where we invest more emotional energy holding these tensions at bay. Because grievances are repeated, we feel frustrated, and because we feel safe with and/or accustomed to our families, we are often comfortable expressing ourselves more honestly and this will often lead to tension.
Family is a core value in Judaism. It is clear to us how important a strong and nurturing family environment is for children to develop into healthy adults. And the message here is that family is the safe environment where we learn the important lessons in life such as how to manage conflict between people, while still basing relationships on love and mutual respect.
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br>They learned the values of kindness, self-sacrifice, responsibility, morality, courage, gratitude for what they had, and the importance of love and security, and what is really valuable in life (love and family rather than possessions and money). These lessons stayed with them for the rest of their lives.
While this family had a powerful opportunity to learn and act on these lessons when two Jewish refugee children were brought into their home, these lessons can also be learned in any family environment. Family is the first place we experience these values and are forced to learn how to share, how to be generous, how to love and be loved, etc. These lessons, experienced and experimented within our families, are what form us into moral, compassionate human beings, and ready us to live adult lives in wider society.
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>Freedom is a value based on the rights of the individual to dignity, safety, and protection from oppression. It is the right to think and live as we choose (providing this brings no harm to others). These ideas are experienced and absorbed for the first time when we are children growing up in a strong family unit, where each individual is respected and loved for who they are. Family is the first place we learn how to disagree with someone and still maintain love and respect for them.
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>Being human means making mistakes. Being human means having personal needs that sometimes conflict with those around us. When living in such close proximity to others, like in a family setting, this can sometimes cause tensions and lead to fights. Learning to deal with these tensions in the context of the family, where the foundation of the relationships is love, is an ideal setting. The family provides a safe environment to learn how to live with diversity and conflict. The message of family is also that despite the fact that we can be quite different from each other (which can lead to tension and conflict), we are one unit – we have much more in common with each other than what separates us. This message, learned in the family unit, is applicable to all of humanity.
The Torah wants to present our ancestors as humans, with flaws just like us, dealing with challenges just like us. This makes them even more powerful role models than if they were flawless and perfect. Showing the origins of the Jewish people through the families of their ancestors, even before they became a nation, is an important message – “family first.” This means we learn how to be humans in the family unit before we can become members of a nation or society. This is one of the reasons why family has become a core and central value in Judaism.
One reason is that this is where we learn to be humans; this is where we first learn the basic values of Judaism and humanity. It is also a way to ensure the continuity of the Jewish people, something that cannot be taken for granted.

II; Transforming the Story

<big><strong>II. Transforming the Story</strong></big><br><b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>The brothers fear for their lives as Yosef reveals himself to them. What would stop him from taking his revenge? Yosef reassures them with these words: “Don’t be afraid,” said Yosef. “Am I in place of God? You intended to harm me but God intended it for good, to accomplish what is now being done, the saving of many lives” (Bereshit 50:19–20). The conclusion to this story is the original source for understanding the concept of <i>teshuva</i> (repentance).
Another important source for understanding <i>teshuva</i> is one of the most colourful characters of the Talmud – the third-century Sage known as Reish Lakish. Reish Lakish was originally a highway robber and gladiator who later in life repented and became a great scholar. Perhaps speaking from his own experience, he is quoted as the author of several sayings about <i>teshuva</i>, two of which are reported in the tractate of Yoma (86b): “Reish Lakish said: ‘Great is repentance, because through it deliberate sins are accounted as unintentional.’ Reish Lakish also said: ‘Great is repentance, because through it deliberate sins are accounted as though they were merits.’”
Confused by the contradiction between the two statements (does <i>teshuva</i> make sins “unintentional” or “merits”?), the Talmud solves the contradiction: the first applies to repentance from fear (of punishment), the second to repentance from love (of God and the good).
Reish Lakish’s statement about sins and merits is almost certainly inspired by the words Yosef speaks to his brothers in the closing chapter of Bereshit: “You intended to harm me but God intended it for good.” This is the paradigm that stands at the basis of Reish Lakish’s argument. The brothers had committed a deliberate sin by selling Yosef into slavery; they (or at least Yehuda, the instigator of the decision to sell Yosef) had done <i>teshuva</i>. The result is that – through divine providence (“God intended it”) – their action is now reckoned “for good.” Any act we perform has multiple consequences, some good, some bad. When we intend evil, the bad consequences are attributed to us because they are what we sought to achieve. The good consequences are not: they are mere by-products or unintended outcomes.
So in the case of Yosef, many positive things happened once he had been brought to Egypt. None of these consequences could be credited to his brothers, even though they would not have happened had the brothers not done as they did. However, once the brothers underwent complete repentance, their original intent was cancelled out. It was now possible to see the good, as well as the bad, consequences of their act – and to credit the good to them.

<i>1. What do you think is most important: the motivation behind an act or the outcome of the act?</i>
<i>2. Can you think of bad things that have happened to you that have ultimately also had good outcomes?</i>
<i>3. What heroic traits is Yosef modelling for us in this story?</i>
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br><i>Reish Lakish was the leader of a gang of bandits. One day, he saw Rabbi Yoḥanan bathing in the River Jordan. Reish Lakish jumped into the river to chase him. Rabbi Yoḥanan said to Reish Lakish, “Your immense strength would be better used for Torah study.” Reish Lakish said to him, “Your immense beauty would be better used for women.” Rabbi Yoḥanan said to him, “If you return to Torah study, I will give you my sister in marriage, who is more beautiful than I am.” Reish Lakish accepted upon himself to study Torah (Bava Metzia 84a).</i>
<i>When one sees Reish Lakish studying Torah in the study hall it is as though he is uprooting mountains and grinding them into each other (Sanhedrin 24a).</i>
<i>When Rabbi Imi was kidnapped in Sifsufa, Rabbi Yoḥanan despaired and proclaimed him as good as dead. Reish Lakish replied to him, “Before we abandon hope, I am willing to run the risk that I may be killed in order to save him.” He went and rescued him from the hands of the kidnappers, who all were eventually killed themselves. On another occasion, Rabbi Yoḥanan was robbed in Ale-kaniah. When Reish Lakish noticed something was wrong, he admitted that he had been robbed. Reish Lakish told him to show him where, and he went and found the robbers and took back all of Rabbi Yoḥanan’s belongings (Talmud Yerushalmi, Teruma 8:10).</i>
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. How does Reish Lakish show in his own life that</i> teshuva<i> can redeem previous actions, making them a source of future good?</i>
<i>2. What skills and resources do you have that could be used for bad or for good?</i>
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>The idea explored in <i>The Core Idea</i>, that through repentance, deliberate sins can be accounted as merits, is hugely significant, for it means that by a change of heart we can redeem the past. However, this still sounds impossible, for we tend to take for granted the concept of the asymmetry of time: The future is open, but the past is closed. Before us lie a series of paths. Which we take depends upon our choice. Behind us lies the history of our previous decisions, none of which we can undo. We cannot go back in time. That is a logical impossibility. We can affect what is yet to be, but in the words of the Sages, “What has been, has been,” and we cannot alter it. With or without repentance, the past is surely immutable. All of this is true, but it is not the whole truth. The revolutionary idea behind Yosef’s and Reish Lakish’s words is that there are two concepts of the past. The first is what happened. The second is the significance, the meaning, of what happened.
In ancient Israel a new concept of time was born. This did more than change the history of the West; in a sense, it created it. Until Tanakh, time was generally conceived of as a series of eternal recurrences, endlessly repeating a pattern that belonged to the immutable structure of the universe. The seasons – spring, summer, autumn, winter – and the lifecycle – birth, growth, decline, and death – were a reiterated sequence in which nothing fundamentally changed. This is variously called cyclical, or cosmological, or mythic time.
This conception of time produces a deeply conservative philosophy of life. It justifies the status quo. Inequalities are seen as written into the structure of the universe. All attempts to change society are destined to fail. People are what they are, and the world is what it has always been. At best this view leads to resignation, at worst to despair. There is no ultimate meaning in history.
The Jewish understanding of time that emerges from Tanakh, in contrast, was utterly revolutionary. For the first time people began to conceive that God had created the universe in freedom, and that by making man in His image, He endowed him too with freedom. That being so, he might be different tomorrow from what he was today, and if he could change himself, he could begin to change the world. Time became an arena of change. With this, the concept of history (as opposed to myth) was born.
We live life forwards, but we understand it backwards. The simplest example of this is autobiography. Reading the story of a life, we understand how early experiences shape who we become. What we become depends on our choices, and we are (almost) always free to choose this way or that. But what we become shapes the story of our life, and only in hindsight, looking back, do we see the past in context, as part of a tale whose end we now know. In life considered as a narrative, later events change the significance of earlier ones. It was the gift of Judaism to the world to discover time as a narrative.
That was what Reish Lakish knew from his own experience. He had been a highway robber. He might have stayed one. Instead he became a <i>baal teshuva</i>, and the very characteristics he had acquired in his earlier life – physical strength and courage – he later used to virtuous ends (see <i>It Once Happened</i>). He knew he could not have done so had he had a different past, a life of study and peace. His sins became merits because in retrospect they were an essential part of the good he eventually did. What had happened (the past as past) did not change, but its significance (the past as part of a narrative of transformation) did.
That too was the profound philosophical-spiritual truth Yosef conveyed to his brothers. By your repentance – he intimated to them – you have changed the story of which you are a part. The harm you intended to do ultimately brought about good. So long as you stayed the people prepared to sell a brother into slavery, none of that good could be attributed to you, but now you have transformed yourself through <i>teshuva</i>, and so have transformed the story of your life as well. By your change of heart you have earned the right to be included in a narrative whose ultimate outcome was benign.
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br><i>Teshuva</i> sensitises us to the full significance of time. There are those who live purely in the present, but their lives have no overarching meaning. They react rather than act. They travel with no ultimate destination. They are “like chaff blown by the wind” (Tehillim 1:4). To be a Jew is to live poised between past and future: the past and future of our individual lives, of our ancient but still young people, and of humanity as a whole.
<i>Teshuva</i> tells us that our past does not determine our future. We can change. We can act differently next time than last. If anything, our future determines our past. Our determination to grow as human beings – our commitment to a more faithful, sensitive, decent life in the year to come – gives us the courage and honesty to face our past and admit its shortcomings. Our <i>teshuva</i> and God’s forgiveness together mean that we are not prisoners of the past, held captive by it. In Judaism, sin is what we do, not what we are. Therefore we remain intact, able to acknowledge our failures and then move on.

<i>1. How does the concept of</i> teshuva <i>sensitise us to the significance of time, helping us to live in the moment?</i>
<i>2. Where do we see this message in</i> Parashat Vayeḥi<i>?</i>
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>What similarities are there between the stories of Yosef and Reish Lakish?
What does Rabbi Sacks mean by “We live life forwards, but we understand it backwards”?
Why do you think the book of Bereshit ends with this story (hint: the connection between <i>teshuva</i> and freedom)?
<b>EDUCATIONAL COMPANION TO THE QUESTIONS</b>
<b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>The motivation behind an act is important for the individual and their moral and spiritual growth and journey. Unintentional acts produce bad outcomes all the time in life, and the knowledge that these acts were unintended helps those impacted by them to move on. However, when it comes to the way our acts impact others, the claim that this was an unintended outcome of the act may well not be enough. In these instances, the outcome is what is important, and this must be kept in mind when decisions are made (risk assessment of the potential negative outcomes of any act/decision) and especially when it comes to addressing bad things that we have caused.<i> Teshuva</i> is a process that only focuses on the person who has brought the bad outcome about. It does not help the victim of their actions. Asking for forgiveness, and redressing injustices that have come about from our actions, is the only way to address the situation we have caused to others.
This value in Judaism is often called “<i>gam zu letova</i>” (literally, “also this is for the good”) – seeing the good outcomes from bad events in life. Sometimes it takes much time to be able to see how things turn out for the best.
Yosef models understanding, patience, forgiveness, unconditional love, and possibly most importantly, a positive outlook on life and an ability to analyse his past and always find the good, despite considerable and obvious bad.
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br>Reish Lakish had immense strength and skills that allowed him to be a formidable robber and gladiator. Once he took the decision to dedicate himself to a life of Torah study and practice, he used those same skills for the good. For example, he used his strength and passion for learning Torah, and he used for the good the skills that had previously made him a cunning and effective fighter (saving his friends and their property).
Every talent and skill, as well as resource, can be used for bad or for good. Encourage your child/student to engage in a process of self-introspection to analyse what these could be in their life.
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>Some people are fixated on the past and the mistakes they have made. Some are obsessed with the future, worrying they are missing opportunities they will regret in the future. <i>Teshuva</i> tells us that our past does not determine our future because we can change. Rabbi Sacks says here that actually, our future determines our past because who we become will redeem the past. “Our <i>teshuva</i> and God’s forgiveness together mean that we are not prisoners of the past, held captive by it,” which allows us to live in the present and not obsessively worry about who we will become in the future because of our past mistakes.
Yosef taught his brothers this message. Their <i>teshuva</i> redeemed their past, allowing them to let go of the mistakes they made and live in the present, in the comforting knowledge that they can determine their own futures, without being beholden to the past.
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>Both Yosef and Reish Lakish saw their past in a positive light, with important significance for how they would live their lives in the future. Yosef knew the past was part of God’s plan, and despite the negative aspects of it, it led to a tremendous amount of good. Reish Lakish used his past life for future positive benefit.
While it is only the future that we can shape, going forwards, we can also reflect on our past to understand its significance, make a change in our minds, and use that to build a better future.
This is best understood from the final paragraph of the main edition of <i>Covenant &amp; Conversation Genesis</i>:
“We now see the profound overarching structure of the book of Genesis. It begins with God creating the universe in freedom. It ends with the family of Yaakov on the brink of creating a new social universe of freedom which begins in slavery, but ends in the giving and receiving of the Torah, Israel’s ‘constitution of liberty.’ Israel is charged with the task of changing the moral vision of humankind, but it can only do so if individual Jews, of whom the forerunners were Yaakov’s children, are capable of changing themselves – that ultimate assertion of freedom we call <i>teshuva</i>. Time then becomes an arena of change in which the future redeems the past and a new concept is born – the idea we call hope.”

Shemot

In a Nutshell

<b><i>IN A NUTSHELL</i></b><br><i>Shemot</i> tells the story of how a family became a nation called the Jewish people. The descendants of Yaakov were away from their homeland, living instead in Egypt. They grew and grew until they were no longer a family, but a people. Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, became scared that they would become so strong and powerful, they might rebel against him and take over Egypt. So he decided to make them his slaves. Then, just to be doubly sure they couldn’t flourish, he ordered all male Israelite babies to be killed.
Yokheved, a Jewish woman, saved her baby son by hiding him in a basket and placing him on the River Nile, hoping someone would find him and look after him. That baby was Moshe. He was found and adopted by Pharaoh’s daughter, and he grew up in Pharaoh’s royal household.
Moshe saved a Jewish slave from a harsh Egyptian taskmaster and then was forced to run away from Egypt to Midyan, where he married Tzipora and became a shepherd.
While looking after his sheep, Moshe discovered the Burning Bush, through which God spoke to him, giving him the mission of returning to Egypt to set the people free. Moshe didn’t feel he was the right man for the job, but he nervously agreed, and travelled back to Egypt to carry out this task with the help of his brother Aharon.
Unfortunately, Pharaoh’s response to Moshe’s request for the people’s freedom was to increase the work expected of his Jewish slaves. The <i>parasha</i> ends with God telling Moshe that He would soon act to save the people from Pharaoh.
<b>QUESTION TO PONDER</b>
<i>How do you think the people must have felt at the moment when Moshe was sent to save them?</i>

I; Faith in the Future

<big><strong>I. Faith in the Future</strong></big><br><b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>At the Burning Bush, Moshe listened to his new mission and asked God how to explain Himself to the people: “Suppose I go to the Israelites and say to them, ‘The God of your fathers has sent me to you,’ and they ask me, ‘What is His name?’ Then what shall I tell them?” (Shemot 3:14). God replied with three keywords: “<i>Ehyeh asher ehyeh</i>.”
This is often translated as “I am who I am,” or “I am He who is.” Early and mediaeval Christian thinkers understood it to mean God was saying He was “Being-itself, timeless, infinite, purely spiritual, and the source of all life.”
But this is not a Jewish definition of God, and “<i>Ehyeh asher ehyeh</i>” means none of these things.
It means “I will be what, where, or how I will be.” What is important here (and what is missed by all other translations) is the future tense. God is defining Himself as the Lord of history who is soon to get involved in human history like never before, to make great change, to set free a group of slaves from the mightiest empire of the ancient world and lead them on a journey towards freedom.
“I will be what I will be” means that God was about to enter history and transform it. God was telling Moshe that there was no way he or anyone else could know in advance what God was about to do, but that if they would just have trust in God, they were about to see the future that He will bring about.
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. Had God played a role in history before this? What was different about what was about to happen?</i>
<i>2. Is it a radical idea that God intervenes and guides our future?</i>
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br><i>In the year 68 CE, Jerusalem was besieged by the Roman general Vespasian and his troops. The powerful Roman army was undefeatable, and it was only a matter of time before the city would fall, and with it, the Temple destroyed. Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Zakkai, the spiritual leader of the community, felt they could find a peaceful resolution with the Romans. But the city was controlled by the Jewish Zealots, who would rather die than surrender to Rome (these were the same people who controlled Masada).</i>
<i>Jews fought one another inside the walls of Jerusalem, and food supplies were destroyed. Soon, all would perish and the city would fall. Rabbi Yoḥanan tried to find a way for the people, and their study of Torah, to survive, even if they lost Jerusalem as their capital and religious focus. But the Zealots strengthened the siege, and refused to allow any Jews to leave the city, for fear they would negotiate with the Romans.</i>
<i>So Rabbi Yoḥanan faked his own death and had his students smuggle him out of Jerusalem in a coffin. They carried the coffin to Vespasian’s tent, and then opened the coffin. The rabbi told Vespasian, “You are destined to rule over the Roman Empire!” and he asked Vespasian to set aside a place in Yavneh (near modern-day Reḥovot) where he could start a small school and study Torah in peace. Vespasian promised that if the prophecy came true, he would grant the request. Within a few days, news arrived that Vespasian was the new emperor, and he kept his word, allowing the school to be established after the war was over.</i>
<i>The school Rabbi Yoḥanan established at Yavneh became the centre of Jewish learning for centuries, and replaced Jerusalem as the seat of the Sanhedrin. Because of Rabbi Yoḥanan’s forward thinking and hope and faith in the future (even during a time when the present looked dire and doomed), the Jewish people’s spiritual, and ultimately physical, future was saved.</i>
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. Why didn’t Rabbi Yoḥanan</i> <i>ben Zakkai ask Vespasian to save Jerusalem?</i>
<i>2. How did his request show he had faith and hope in the future?</i>
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>God used the words “<i>Ehyeh asher ehyeh</i>” to tell Moshe that great change was coming, and His actions would soon speak for themselves. But until that time, they just needed faith, for the events to come could not be imagined. He also told Moshe in general terms that He was about to rescue the Israelites and bring them to a land flowing with milk and honey. But as for the specifics, Moshe and the people would know God not through His essence but through His acts, and so they could not know Him <i>until</i> He acted.
He would be a God of surprises. He would do things never seen before, create signs and wonders that would be spoken about for thousands of years. They would set in motion wave after wave of repercussions. People would learn that slavery is not an inevitable condition, that might is not right, that empires are not impregnable, and that a tiny people like the Israelites could do great things if they attached their destiny to heaven. But none of this could be predicted in advance. God was saying to Moshe and to the people, <i>You will have to trust Me. The destination to which I am calling you is just beyond the visible horizon.</i>
It is very hard to understand how revolutionary this was. Ancient religions were deeply conservative, designed to show that the existing social hierarchy was inevitable, part of the deep structure of reality, timeless and unchangeable. Just as there was a hierarchy in the heavens, and another within the animal kingdom, so there was a hierarchy in human society. That was order. Anything that challenged it represented chaos. Until Israel appeared on the scene, religion was a way of consecrating the status quo.
That is what the story of Israel would overturn. The greatest empire on earth was about to be overthrown. The most powerless of people were going to go free. This was not simply a blow to Egypt. Although it would take thousands of years, it was a deadly blow to the very concept of a hierarchical society, or of time as Plato called it, “a moving image of eternity,” a series of passing shadows on a wall of reality that never changes.
Instead, history became an arena of change. Time became something understood as a narrative, a journey, or a quest. All this hinted at in those three words, “I will be what I will be.” I am the God of the future tense.
So Judaism, in the concept of a Messianic Age, became the only civilisation whose golden age is in the future. And throughout the Torah, the promised land lies in the future. Avraham does not acquire it. Nor does Yitzḥak. Nor does Yaakov. Even Moshe, who spends forty years leading the people there, never gets to enter it. It is always just beyond. Soon but not yet.
After years of practising psychology, the founder of positive psychology, Martin Seligman, came to the conclusion that the people with a positive psychology tended to be future-oriented, whereas those with a negative mindset – he called this, in a brilliant phrase, “learned helplessness” – were often fixated on the past. He asked: What is it that makes Homo sapiens different from other species? His answer was that we have an unrivalled ability “to be guided by imagining alternatives stretching into the future – prospection.” We are the future- oriented animal.
A misconception dominates the scientific study of humankind. Science searches for causes; a cause always precedes its effect; therefore science will always seek to explain a phenomenon in the present by reference to something that happened in the past – anything from the genome to early childhood experiences to brain chemistry to recent stimuli. It will follow that science will inevitably deny the existence of human free will. The denial may be soft or hard, gentle or brutal, but it will come. Freedom will be seen as an illusion.
But this is a fallacy. Human action is always oriented to the future. I put the kettle on because I want a cup of coffee. I work hard because I want to pass the exam. I act to bring about a future that is not yet. Science cannot account for the future because something that hasn’t happened yet cannot be a cause. Therefore, there will always be something about intentional human action that science cannot fully explain.
When God said, “I will be what I will be,” He was telling us something not only about God but about us when we are open to God and have faith in His faith in us.
We can be what we will be if we choose the right and the good. And if we fail and fall, we can change, because God lifts us and gives us strength.
And if we can change ourselves, then together we can change the world. We cannot end evil and suffering but we can diminish it. We cannot eliminate injustice, but we can fight it. We cannot abolish sickness, but we can treat it and search for cures.
Whenever I visit Israel, I find myself awestruck by the way this ancient people in its history- saturated land is one of the most future-oriented nations on earth, constantly searching for new advances in medical, informational, and nano-technology. Israel writes its story in the future tense.
And the future is the sphere of human freedom, because I cannot change yesterday but I can change tomorrow by what I do today. Therefore, because Judaism is a religion of the future, it is a religion of human freedom, and because Israel is a future- oriented nation, it remains, in the Middle East, an oasis of freedom in a desert of oppression. Tragically, most of Israel’s enemies are fixated on the past, and as long as they remain so, their people will never find freedom and Israel will never find peace.
<b>I believe that we must honour the past but not live in it. Faith is a revolutionary force. God is calling to us as once He called to Moshe, asking us to have faith in the future and then, with His help, build it.</b>
<b>QUESTION TO PONDER</b>
<i>How does having faith in the future lead to a partnership with God in building it?</i>
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>To be a Jew is to be an agent of hope. Every ritual, every command, every syllable of the Jewish story is a protest against escapism, resignation, and the blind acceptance of fate. Judaism, the religion of the free God, is a religion of freedom. Jewish faith is written in the future tense. It is belief in a future that is not yet but could be, if we heed God’s call, obey His will, and act together as a covenantal community. The name of the Jewish future is hope.
<b><i>Future Tense,</i> 250</b>
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>What is the difference between the ancient Greek understanding of God (the God of Aristotle) and the Jewish understanding of God (the God of Avraham)?
Why is it healthier to focus on the future than the past?
What support for the idea that God is the “God of the future tense” can you see in Judaism?
<b>EDUCATIONAL COMPANION TO THE QUESTIONS</b>
<b><i>IN A NUTSHELL</i></b><br>The people may well have lost all hope of salvation and freedom before Moshe arrived. When he finally arrived and interceded on their behalf, Pharaoh’s response was to make the work harder for the Israelites. At this point, it must have been hard to find hope in their hearts and belief that Moshe could ultimately succeed. Under these extreme circumstances, it is easy to understand how a people can despair. But the message of this <i>Covenant &amp; Conversation</i> essay is to find faith that the future will be better, and that God will intercede on our behalf in history. This faith is a core idea in Judaism.
<b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>The book of Bereshit is all about God interacting with human beings and making an impact in their lives. But this was only ever on an individual basis. God had never influenced history on a national level like He was about to in the book of Shemot. For the first time, He was building a relationship with an entire people. Shemot is testament to our belief that God influences and guides history on the largest scale, bringing the world to its ultimate destiny.
This was certainly radical in biblical times, as ancient philosophy (including Greek philosophy) believed that God was the source of all life and the First Cause, who initiated life, but the divine force played no further role after creation. However, the God of Judaism, as described in the Torah, continued to influence history after creation, and it is our faith that He continues to do so to this day. (This is also a radical belief in our secular world today.)
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br>Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Zakkai knew Vespasian would refuse a request to save Jerusalem. The Roman conquest of the land of Israel revolved around the capture and destruction of Jerusalem and the Temple. They wanted to remove all vestiges of Jewish sovereignty over the land of Israel. Knowing this, Rabbi Yoḥanan limited his request to something they might consider, but also wisely requested something that was significant enough to save the Jewish future.
Rabbi Yoḥanan had faith that there would be a Jewish future. He had faith that despite this dark time, God had not forsaken the Jewish people, and that the people could survive and one day, return to the land of Israel, regaining independence there. For this to happen, he needed to guarantee the continuity of the Jewish religion, and he did this by transferring the religious focus of Judaism from the Temple to Torah learning and halakhic observance. For this, he needed an academy and a court, and so he chose Yavneh as a base for this new beginning, to protect Jewish continuity.
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>Judaism does not believe in passive faith. Faith in the future does not mean waiting for God to make the future happen. It means believing that the future will be better – but this must lead to action. God expects an active partnership with humanity. This is the message of the Torah and Judaism.
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>The ancient Greek conception of God was as a Prime Mover – they thought that God created the world, setting it on its course with the laws of nature, and then withdrew from history. This is the meaning of God as “Being-itself, timeless, infinite, purely spiritual, and the source of all life.” The God of the Torah did not withdraw after creation, and is more than the cause of all life. The God of the Torah is the God of history, who has a continual relationship with humanity in history.
Focusing on the past prevents a person from moving forwards and growing. If your past is painful, and you focus only on that pain, you will feel helpless and despondent. Future-oriented people have a more positive and creative approach to life. The founder of positive psychology, Martin Seligman, suggests that this trait, of being able to focus on the future and hope for something better than what came before, is what separates humankind from other species. Humans have a unique ability to “be guided by imagining alternatives stretching into the future – prospection.” We are the future-oriented animal.
Judaism is predicated on the belief in free will. It says that time is an arena of change, where tomorrow can be better than today. The Torah is one long narrative about achieving a destiny – both national and universal – that will herald a better age. Judaism’s concept of a Messianic Age created a civilisation whose golden age is in the future. The national mission of the Jewish people is to redeem the world and bring about that age – in the future. This is the core focus of Judaism.

II; The Light at the Heart of Darkness

<big><strong>II. The Light at the Heart of Darkness</strong></big><br><b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>Pharaoh’s daughter is one of the most unexpected heroes of the Hebrew Bible. Without her, Moshe might not have lived. The whole story of the Exodus would have been different. Yet she was not an Israelite. She had nothing to gain, and everything to lose, by her courage. Yet she seems to have had no doubt, experienced no reservations, made no hesitation. If it was Pharaoh who hurt the children of Israel, it was another member of his own family who gave them hope: Pharaoh’s daughter.
This is how it happened: Pharaoh had decreed death for every male Israelite child. Yokheved, Amram’s wife, had a baby boy. For three months, she was able to conceal his existence, but no longer. Fearing his certain death if she kept him, she set him afloat on the Nile in a basket, hoping against hope that someone might see him and take pity on him. This is what follows:
Pharaoh’s daughter went to bathe in the Nile, while her maids walked along the Nile’s edge. She saw the box in the reeds and sent her slave girl to fetch it. Opening it, she saw the boy. The child began to cry, and she had pity on it. “This is one of the Hebrew boys,” she said (Shemot 2:6).
Note the sequence. First she sees that it is a child and has pity on it, a natural, human, compassionate reaction. Only then does it dawn on her who the child must be. Who else would abandon a child? She remembers her father’s decree against the Hebrews. Instantly the situation has changed. To save the baby would mean disobeying the royal command. That would be serious enough for an ordinary Egyptian; doubly so for a member of the royal family.
More than that, she is not alone when the event happens. Her maids are with her; her slave girl is standing beside her. She must face the risk that one of them, perhaps after an argument, or even just to gossip, will tell someone. Rumours spread quickly in royal courts. Yet she does not shift her ground. She does not tell one of her servants to take the baby and hide it with a family far away. She does not flinch. She has the courage of her compassion.

<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br><i>Raoul Wallenberg, the Swedish diplomat, was sent, at the age of thirty-two, to be part of the Swedish diplomatic mission in Budapest in July 1944. By then the mass extermination of Hungarian Jews was underway. Over 400,000 of them had already been killed in Auschwitz.</i>
<i>With courage, imagination, and a single-minded sense of purpose, he resolved to do what he could to save at least some of those who remained. He printed and handed out Swedish protective passports. He created safe houses where Jews could take refuge. In some cases, he even rescued people who’d already boarded the transportation trains. And he managed to delay Adolf Eichmann’s (one of the main organisers of the Holocaust) planned massacre of the Budapest ghetto, so that when the Russians reached the city two days later they found over 90,000 Jews still alive. One way or another, he saved more than 100,000 lives.</i>
<i>We don’t know what happened to him. Suspected of being an American spy, he was taken to Russia, and there all traces of him disappear. He remains the hero without a grave. But as long as humanity remembers those days, his name will remain a symbol of courage in the face of seemingly invincible evil. He stood firm. He refused to be intimidated. He resisted, knowing that in dark times, what we do makes a difference. The good we do lives after us, and it’s the greatest thing that does.</i>

<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. What similarities are there between the story of Pharaoh’s daughter and Raoul Wallenberg?</i>
<i>2. What do you think you would have done in Raoul Wallenberg’s position or in Pharaoh’s daughter’s position?</i>
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>Immediately after the crying baby is discovered, Miriam, the baby’s sister, reveals herself to Pharaoh’s daughter and presents her audacious plan: “Shall I go and call a Hebrew woman to nurse the child for you?” (Shemot 2:7). She proposes a plan brilliant in its simplicity. If the real mother is able to keep the child in her home to nurse him, we both minimise the danger. You will not have to explain to the court how this child has suddenly appeared. We will be spared the risk of bringing him up: we can say the child is not a Hebrew, and that the mother is not the mother but only a nurse. Miriam’s ingenuity is matched by Pharaoh’s daughter’s instant understanding and consent.
Then comes the final surprise: “When the child matured, [his mother] brought him to Pharaoh’s daughter. She adopted him as her own son and named him Moshe. ‘I bore him from the water,’ she said” (Shemot 2:10). Pharaoh’s daughter did not simply have a moment’s compassion. She has not forgotten the child. Nor has the passage of time diminished her sense of responsibility. Not only does she remain committed to his welfare; she adopts the riskiest of strategies. She will adopt him and bring him up as her own son. This is courage of a high order.
Yet the single most surprising detail comes in the last sentence. In the Torah, it is parents who give a child its name, and in the case of a special individual, God Himself. It is God who gives the name Yitzḥak to the first Jewish child, God’s angel who gives Yaakov the name Yisrael, God who changes the names of Avram and Sarai to Avraham and Sara. We have already encountered one adoptive name – Tzafenat Paneaḥ – the name by which Yosef was known in Egypt; yet Yosef remains Yosef. How surpassingly strange that the hero of the Exodus, the greatest of all the prophets, should bear not the name Amram and Yokheved have undoubtedly used thus far, but the one given to him by his adoptive mother, an Egyptian princess.
A midrash draws our attention to the fact: “This is the reward for those who do kindness. Although Moshe had many names, the only one by which he is known in the whole Torah is the one given to him by the daughter of Pharaoh. Even the Holy One, blessed be He, did not call him by any other name” (Shemot Rabba 1:26). Indeed Moshe – Meses – is an Egyptian name, meaning “child,” as in Ramesses (which means “child of Ra”; Ra was the greatest of the Egyptian gods).
Who then was Pharaoh’s daughter? Nowhere is she explicitly named. However, the first book of Divrei HaYamim (4:18) mentions a daughter of Pharaoh, named Bitya, and it was she the Sages identified as the woman who saved Moshe. The name Bitya (sometimes rendered as Batya) means “the daughter of God.” From this, the Sages drew one of their most striking lessons: “The Holy One, blessed be He, said to her: ‘Moshe was not your son, yet you called him your son. You are not My daughter, but I shall call you My daughter’” (Vayikra Rabba 1:3). They added that she was one of the few people (tradition enumerates nine) who were so righteous that they entered paradise in their lifetime.
Instead of “Pharaoh’s daughter,” read “Hitler’s daughter” or “Stalin’s daughter” and we see what is at stake. Tyranny cannot destroy humanity. Moral courage can sometimes be found in the heart of darkness. That the Torah itself tells the story the way it does has enormous implications. It means that when it comes to people, we must never generalise, never stereotype. The Egyptians were not all evil: even from Pharaoh himself, a heroine was born. Nothing could signal more powerfully that the Torah is not an ethnocentric text; that we must recognise virtue wherever we find it, even among our enemies; and that the basic core of human values – humanity, compassion, courage – is truly universal. Holiness may not be; goodness is.
Outside Yad Vashem, the Holocaust memorial in Jerusalem, is an avenue dedicated to righteous gentiles. Pharaoh’s daughter is a supreme symbol of what they did and what they were. I, for one, am profoundly moved by that encounter on the banks of the Nile between an Egyptian princess and a young Israelite child, Moshe’s sister Miriam. The contrast between them – in terms of age, culture, status, and power – could not be greater. Yet their deep humanity bridges all the differences, all the distance. Two heroines. May they inspire us.
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>Judaism has a unique dual structure of ethics. On the one hand there is the covenant of Noaḥ, which binds all humanity on the basis of seven fundamental commands. On the other is the Abrahamic and later Sinai covenant that binds Jews by a more detailed and demanding system of commands. Judaism is constituted by this basic tension between the universal and the particular. Its way of life is intensely particular, yet its God and ultimate gaze are universal, concerned with all humankind, indeed all creation. How are we to understand the significance of this duality?
Helpful in this context is the distinction suggested by the Israeli philosopher Avishai Margalit between <i>morality</i> and <i>ethics</i>. Morality refers to the universal principles we use in dealings with humanity in general: our relationships with strangers. Ethics, by contrast, refers to our relationships with those with whom we share a special bond of shared memory and belonging: family, friends, fellow countrymen, or people with whom we share a faith. The two systems have a different tonality: “Morality is greatly concerned, for example, with respect and humiliation.... Ethics, on the other hand, is greatly concerned with loyalty and betrayal.”
This is the best way of understanding the difference between <i>tzedek</i> and <i>mishpat</i> on the one hand, ḥesed and <i>raḥamim</i> on the other. <i>Tzedek</i> and <i>mishpat</i> belong to morality. <i>Ḥesed</i> and <i>raḥamim</i> belong to ethics. The former are about justice, the latter about loving attention, for which the simplest English term is <i>care</i>. Justice is and must be impersonal. “You shall not recognise persons in judgement,” says Devarim (16:19). The beauty of justice is that it belongs to a world of order constructed out of universal rules through which each of us stands equally before the law. <i>Ḥesed</i>, by contrast, is intrinsically personal. We cannot care for the sick, bring comfort to the distressed, or welcome a visitor impersonally. If we do so, it merely shows that we have not understood what these activities are. Justice demands disengagement. <i>Ḥesed</i> is an act of engagement. Justice is best administered without emotion. <i>Ḥesed</i> exists only in virtue of emotion, empathy, and sympathy, feeling-with and feeling-for. We act with kindness because we know what it feels like to be in need of kindness. We comfort the mourners because we know what it is to mourn. <i>Ḥesed</i> requires not detached rationality but emotional intelligence.

<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>Was Miriam also a hero in this story?
What is the message of the midrash when it points out that Moshe was only ever known by his Egyptian name Moshe (Meses)?
What message are the Sages giving us when they identify Pharaoh’s daughter as “Batya”?
<b>EDUCATIONAL COMPANION TO THE QUESTIONS</b>
<b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>It would have been understandable for the daughter of Pharaoh, whose father was the instigator of the genocide of Israelite baby boys, to turn the other way and ignore the child. As a product of the society that produced a ruler such as Pharaoh, and having grown up in his house, it is easy to understand that she would have found it difficult making the moral and courageous decision to save the child. The move was also of great personal risk to her, and the repercussions may have been great. The question is: Is morality innate, and therefore can we have the expectation that she should have implicitly understood the right and wrong of the situation? And if so, should that override the concern for personal risk? These are some of the factors to take into account when considering this question.
She is a model of moral courage who clearly had a strong and innate sense of morality. This is what drove her to do the right thing.
A hero is a person noted for courageous acts or nobility of character. Rabbi Sacks considers her a hero according to this definition.
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br>The stories are very similar, and both personalities could be described as righteous gentiles. Similar to the daughter of Pharaoh, Raoul Wallenberg also took great personal risks to save Jews. He was under the same societal pressure not to do anything, while the monstrous Nazi genocidal machine was carrying out its work.
We obviously would like to think we would do the right thing. But it is impossible to know how we would react. The question is, should we find empathy and understanding for bystanders who did nothing, or demand the moral high ground be reached in all circumstances?
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>Both their actions were first and foremost an act of moral courage. They were acting on the innate values of justice and out of a conviction for what is right. However, it is hard to imagine they were not also acting upon the values of love, empathy, and sympathy for their fellow human beings. If you relate to another human being as a brother, seeing them as a fellow created equally in the image of God, then your act of justice can be said to also be one of love and kindness.
In the case where love of a fellow you have a personal relationship with is the main motivating factor, while still heroic, it is less astounding than saving the life of a stranger, simply because they are a fellow human being. This, then, is the greater example of moral courage, and Pharaoh’s daughter and Raoul Wallenberg were true moral heroes in this respect.
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>Rabbi Sacks says that she was. Apart from the brilliance of her plan, she also took great risk to address the royal princess, and with some brazenness. How does a slave child have the audacity to address a princess?
Moshe, the greatest of all Jewish leaders, who spoke to God “face to face,” is only ever known in the Torah (and therefore throughout Jewish literature) as Moshe/Meses – the Egyptian name for “child,” despite no doubt receiving a Hebrew name from his parents. The Midrash says this is a powerful statement – a reward to Pharaoh’s daughter for her kindness and bravery.
Batya is a name with a Hebrew root meaning “the daughter of God.” This was almost certainly not the name by which she was known. But the Sages are saying that despite who her biological father was (a man of great evil) she should be known and remembered as the daughter of God. A title such as this is earned, and any human, created in the image of God and who walks in the path of God, deserves this title.

Vaera

In a Nutshell

<b><i>IN A NUTSHELL</i></b><br>Pharaoh was bathing in the River Nile when Moshe and Aharon delivered their message and warning from God. Pharaoh refused to listen and so the Ten Plagues began.
First the Nile turned to blood, then millions of frogs appeared, and then all the Egyptians were affected by lice. But still Pharaoh refused to listen. So the plagues continued.
Wild animals roamed the streets, pets and farm animals died from disease, and the people suffered with boils. Each time Pharaoh became more stubborn and denied the Israelites their freedom. <i>Vaera</i> tells of seven terrible plagues, ending with large hailstones (containing fire), and each time, Pharaoh refused to let Moshe lead his people to freedom. But soon he would. The Exodus story had finally begun.
<b>QUESTION TO PONDER</b>
<i>Why do you think God needed to send so many plagues to take the Israelites out of Egypt?</i>

I; The Weighing of the Heart

<big><strong>I. The Weighing of the Heart</strong></big><br><b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>In this <i>parasha</i>, before even the first plague has struck Egypt, God tells Moshe: <i>“I will harden Pharaoh’s heart</i> and multiply My miraculous signs and wonders in Egypt” (Shemot 7:3).
The hardening of Pharaoh’s heart is mentioned twenty times during the story of the Exodus. Sometimes it is Pharaoh who is said to harden his own heart. At other times, God is said to have done so. The Torah uses three different verbs in this context: <i>ḥ-z-k</i>, to strengthen, <i>k-sh-ḥ</i>, to harden, and <i>k-b-d</i>, to make heavy.
Throughout the ages, our Rabbis have pondered the following question: If God hardened Pharaoh’s heart, how could he have been criticised for not letting the Israelites go? He had no choice in the matter, because it was God’s doing, not his. So why was he punished?
Look carefully in <i>Vaera</i>, and you will see that Pharaoh was the one hardening his heart for the first five plagues. So for quite a while, his stubbornness and refusals are all his choice. Then, starting with the sixth plague, God hardened Pharaoh’s heart. Noting this, our commentators made several points.
Rashi says that the hardening of Pharaoh’s heart for the final five plagues was a <i>punishment</i> <i>for the first five</i>, when it was Pharaoh’s own obstinacy that led him to refuse to let the people go.
Rambam says that his heart was hardened so he could not repent. He was no longer deserving of the freedom to “turn away from his wickedness.”
Albo and Sforno offer the opposite interpretation. God hardened Pharaoh’s heart precisely <i>to restore his free will</i>. After the series of plagues that had devastated the land, Pharaoh was under overwhelming pressure to let the Israelites go. Had he done so, it would not have been out of free choice, because who could resist the power of direct miracles from God?! God therefore <i>strengthened</i> Pharaoh’s heart so that even after the first five plagues he was genuinely free to say yes or no.
It may be that all three answers are right, and each one responds to a different verb. <i>K-sh-ḥ</i>, “hardening,” supports Rashi’s reading. Pharaoh was hard on the Israelites, so God was hard on him. <i>K-b-d</i>, “making heavy,” supports Rambam. Pharaoh lacked the energy, the strength, to repent. <i>Ḥ-z-k</i>, “to strengthen,” supports Albo and Sforno. What is important to note here is that God did not find a quick, rushed solution. He was interested in the process more than the result. The world was watching and God was sending out a message.
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. Why do the commentators need to justify the hardening of Pharaoh’s heart?</i>
<i>2. Which of the three interpretations do you like the most?</i>
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br><i>The Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. (MLK) was the leader of the American civil rights movement from 1955 until 1968. He believed in advancing the civil rights and equality of African Americans through non-violent means, such as peaceful marches and civil disobedience.</i>
<i>On April 3, 1968, at a church in Memphis, Tennessee, MLK delivered a speech commonly known as the “I’ve Been to the Mountaintop” speech. This was his final speech. On the following day, he was assassinated.</i>
<i>In his “Mountaintop” speech, MLK called for unity and non-violent protest, and challenged the United States to live up to its ideals. He portrayed the civil rights struggle for equality as a modern-day Exodus. He also discussed time periods in history that he would have liked to personally see. “I would watch God’s children in their magnificent trek from the dark dungeons of Egypt through, or rather across, the Red Sea, through the wilderness on toward the Promised Land,” he said. His speech reminded his followers that the Israelites suffered before gaining their freedom from Pharaoh, in much the same way as his own listeners were suffering at that time.</i>
<i>The Exodus story helped MLK and his followers understand the past, present, and future of their own journey and struggle. They felt connected to the Exodus story. It was the original journey from oppression to freedom. It gave them hope.</i>
<i>He concluded his speech with these words: “I’ve been to the mountaintop…. And I’ve looked over. And I’ve seen the Promised Land. I may not get there with you. But I want you to know tonight, that we, as a people, will get to the Promised Land.”</i>
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. Why do you think MLK spoke about the Exodus to his followers?</i>
<i>2. What did he mean when he said, “I’ve been to the mountaintop and seen the Promised Land”?</i>
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>There is a fourth approach we can take to the question discussed in <i>The Core Idea</i>. The Egyptians – especially their rulers – were preoccupied by death. Their funereal practices were astonishingly elaborate, intended to prepare the person for life after death. The tombs of the Pharaohs were among their most lavish creations. Tutankhamun’s, discovered in 1922, is a dazzling example.
The Torah notes the attention the Egyptians gave to death. At the end of Bereshit, we read of how the Egyptians accompanied Yosef and his family in the funeral procession to bury Yaakov. The Canaanites noted, “The Egyptians are holding a solemn ceremony of mourning” (Bereshit 50:11). Then we read of how Yosef himself was embalmed and placed in a coffin in Egypt. In the Torah, only Yosef, and Yaakov at Yosef’s request, are embalmed. This indicated the great significance of death to the Egyptian mind.
There is one specific aspect of Egyptian belief that we should also consider. According to Egyptian myth, the deceased underwent a trial to establish their worthiness to enjoy life after death in Aaru, the Field of Reeds, where souls live on in pleasure for eternity. They believed that the soul resides in the heart, and the trial consisted of the ceremony of “The Weighing of the Heart.” Other organs were removed by Egyptians after death, but the heart was left because it was needed for the trial.
On one side of the scales was a feather. On the other, the heart was placed. If the heart was as light as the feather, the dead could continue to Aaru, but if it was heavier, its owner was condemned to live in Duat, the underworld.
It follows that the root <i>k-b-d</i>, “to make heavy,” would have had a highly specific meaning for the Egyptians of that time. It would imply that Pharaoh’s heart had become heavier than a feather. He would fail the heart-weighing ceremony and therefore be denied what was most important to him – the prospect of joining the gods in the afterlife.
No one would have been in any doubt as to why this was so. The feather represented <i>ma’at</i>, the central Egyptian value that included the concepts of truth, balance, order, harmony, justice, morality, and law. Not only was this fundamental to Egyptian culture, it was the task of the Pharaoh to ensure that it prevailed. This had been a key Egyptian principle for a thousand years. <i>Ma’at</i> meant cosmic order. Its absence invited chaos. A Pharaoh whose heart had become heavier than the <i>ma’at</i> feather was not only endangering his own afterlife, but also threatening his entire people with turmoil and disarray.
If the “heavying” of Pharaoh’s heart is an allusion to “The Weighing of the Heart” ceremony, it allows us to read the story in a completely new way.
First, it suggests that it is directed to Egyptians as well as Israelites, to humanity as a whole. The Torah tells us three times that the purpose of the signs and wonders was “so that the <i>Egyptians</i> may know that I am the Lord” (Shemot 7:5, 14:4, 14:18). This is the core belief of monotheism. It is not that the Israelites have their God, and the Egyptians their pantheon, but rather that there is one sovereign power in the universe.
Our religion is not intended to be the religion of all humanity. Nowhere in the narrative does God imply that He wants the Egyptians to adopt Israelite religious practices. The point is quite different. <i>Religion is particular. Morality is universal</i>. If the story of the “heavying” of Pharaoh’s heart does allude to the <i>“</i>The Weighing of the Heart<i>”</i> ceremony, then the story of the Exodus is not simply a partisan account from an Israelite point of view. It is telling us that <i>certain things are wrong, whoever does them and whoever they are done against.</i> They are wrong by Egyptian standards too. That was true of Pharaoh’s decision to kill all male Israelite children. That was an unforgivable sin against <i>ma’at</i>.
Justice is universal. That is the point made plainly by the Torah’s three stories of Moshe’s early life. He sees an Egyptian hitting an Israelite and intervenes. He sees Israelites hitting one another and intervenes. He sees gentile shepherds behaving roughly to Yitro’s daughters and intervenes. The first was a case of non-Israelite against Israelite, the second was Israelite against Israelite, the third was non-Israelite against non-Israelite. This is the simplest way of telling us that Moshe’s sense of justice was impartial and universal.
The most generous interpretation of Pharaoh’s treatment of the people is that he was trying to maintain order in the empire. A successful minority like the Israelites could be seen as a threat to such order. If they stayed and thrived, they might take over the country as the Hyksos had done several centuries earlier. If they were allowed to leave, other enslaved groups might be tempted to do likewise. Emigration is a bad sign when the place people are trying to leave is a superpower. That is why, for many years, the Soviet Union forbade Jews to leave the country.
Pharaoh, in his repeated refusal to let the people go, must have justified his decision in each case on the grounds that he was securing <i>ma’at</i>, order. Meanwhile, however, with each plague the country was reduced to ever greater chaos. That is because oppressing people, which is what Pharaoh was doing, was a fundamental offence against <i>ma’at</i>.
For the first five plagues, Pharaoh could tell himself that he was enduring minor inconvenience to protect a major principle. But as the plagues became more serious, reducing Egypt to chaos, Pharaoh’s room for manoeuvre grew ever less. Having five times said no to the Israelites, he could not now back down without making himself look ridiculous, forfeiting his authority and damaging his standing. <i>Pharaoh was a prisoner of his own system</i>, held captive by his own decisions. The Torah states that Pharaoh’s heart was heavy as a way of hinting at a self-contradiction at the heart of the Egyptian concept of <i>ma’at</i>.
Seeking to protect order, he created chaos. That is because the order he was seeking to protect was built on a foundation of injustice: the enslavement of the many for the benefit of the few. The more he tried to defend it, the heavier his heart grew.
<b>I believe that this story of how the supreme Power entered history to liberate the supremely powerless is not just for Jews. The story of Exodus is the world’s greatest metanarrative of hope.</b>
<b>QUESTION TO PONDER</b>
<i>How can the Exodus story bring hope to humanity?</i>
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>The Exodus is the inexhaustible source of inspiration to all those who long for freedom. It taught that right was sovereign over might; that freedom and justice must belong to all, not some; that, under God, all human beings are equal; and that over all earthly powers is the supreme power, the King of kings, who hears the cry of the oppressed and who intervenes in history to liberate slaves.
<b><i>The Jonathan Sacks Haggada</i>, The Universal Story, 83</b>
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>What does the Torah mean by God “hardening” the heart of Pharaoh? Why is this problematic?
According to our understanding of the Egyptian approach to death, what does it mean that Pharaoh’s heart was heavy?
What is the message of the Exodus narrative for the Jewish people and for the world?
<b>EDUCATIONAL COMPANION TO THE QUESTIONS</b>
<b><i>IN A NUTSHELL</i></b><br>God could have decided to take the Israelites out of Egypt in one instant, using supernatural means. There are other ways He could have saved them without bringing the Ten Plagues to wear down Pharaoh and the Egyptians. But the goal of the Exodus was to teach the world, at that time and all future generations, the message of the story: that it is unjust to enslave a people, and that God acts in history to address injustice.
<b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>The plagues function both to punish the Egyptians and to educate them (and the rest of the world). It seems unjust to harden Pharaoh’s heart and take away his free will to relent and allow the Israelites their freedom, thereby incurring more forms of punishment for him and his people. The commentators explained to us why God would harden Pharaoh’s heart until the Ten Plagues were over.
Each commentator takes a unique approach, and which appeals more is a personal decision. There is a fourth approach taken by Rabbi Sacks (in the name of Rabbi Dr. Rafi Zarum), which can be found in the <i>Thinking More Deeply</i> section. This approach calls for an understanding of ancient Egyptian ideology, and analyses the language used to describe this process, focusing more on the educational impact of the story rather than the punitive aspect.
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br>The Exodus story resonated with African Americans during the time of the civil rights movement because it was a similar story to their own: of oppression and a journey towards liberation. The story has a strong leader (Moshe – they saw MLK as their own Moshe), delivering them from oppression to liberty. Parallel to the story of the Israelites, African Americans had been forced to be slaves in America, and were on a journey towards gaining the civil rights and equality denied them until now. The story of the Exodus, despite being about the Israelites, gave them hope. It was the hope that God always seeks and ensures that justice is achieved (this is echoed in MLK’s famous statement, “The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.”) This gives oppressed people the inspiration to rise up and gain their freedom.
The mountaintop, referring to Mount Nevo where Moshe stood to see the Promised Land in the distance, is a metaphor for MLK’s sense that he has seen enough to give him faith that there would be a time in the not-too-distant future that Black Americans would have full civil rights and equality in America. This is their Promised Land. Sadly, MLK was assassinated before his dream became a reality, which has further symmetry with Moshe, who died before his people entered the land of Israel.
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>Justice will ultimately prevail. God acts in history, and just as He saved the underdog in this narrative and reinstated a just world order, so He will in future generations. There is a Judge, and He does justice. The Exodus narrative has provided inspiration for many social revolutions in history for nations beyond the Jews.
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>The traditional approach to this element of the Exodus story is that God made Pharaoh’s heart obstinate (hard), forcing him to continue to refuse to allow the Israelites to go free despite the relentless ill effects of the plagues that his people were suffering. This is problematic because it seems to take away his free choice in the matter, and continue the suffering presumably encountered as a punishment.
One of the Hebrew terms used for hardening Pharaoh’s heart is <i>k-b-d</i> – God made his heart heavy. According to Egyptian myth, the deceased underwent a trial to establish their worthiness. They believed that the soul resides in the heart, and the trial consisted of the ceremony of “The Weighing of the Heart.” If the heart weighed more than a feather, then the person was not worthy. The feather represented truth and order. God made sure the Egyptians knew that Pharaoh was risking their well-being and the order of society by building it on the injustice of the enslavement of a people.
The message of the Exodus is that there is one sovereign power in the universe, and although religion is particular, morality is universal. Justice is universal. The story of the Exodus is not simply about Israelites, for Israelites. It is telling us that certain things are wrong, whoever does them and whoever they are done against. They are wrong by Egyptian standards too. Further, we are taught through this that injustice should be addressed, and freedom should be fought for. The Jewish people suffered but were freed, and ultimately prevailed. This provides inspiration for other oppressed people, who can also hope and strive for freedom.

II; The God Who Acts in History

<big><strong>II. The God Who Acts in History</strong></big><br><b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>We are at the lowest point in Israelite history so far. They have been enslaved. Pharaoh has decreed that every Jewish male child is to be killed. Moshe is sent to liberate them, but the first effect of his intervention is to make matters worse, not better. Now they have to provide their own straw, and still make the same number of bricks as before. At first they believed Moshe when he performed the various signs God had given him, and told them that God was about to rescue them, but now they turn on him and his leadership.
None of this, however, has been accidental. The Torah is preparing the ground for one of its most epic assertions: It is in the darkest night that Israel has its greatest visions. Hope is born in the depth of despair. There is nothing natural about this, nothing inevitable. No logic can give rise to hope; no law of history charts a path from slavery to redemption, exile to return. The entire sequence of events has been a run-up to the single most formative moment in the history of Israel: the intervention of God in history – the supreme Power intervening on behalf of the supremely powerless, not (as in every other culture) to endorse the status quo, but to overturn it.
This is a world-changing idea. What is revolutionary in Judaism is not simply the concept of monotheism – that the universe is not a blind clash of conflicting powers but the result of a single creative will. It is that God is <i>involved</i> in His creation. God is not simply the force that brought the universe into being, nor is He reached only in an individual’s private soul. At a certain point He intervened in history, to rescue His people from slavery and set them on the path to freedom.

<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br><i>Several years after the destruction of the Holy Temple, Rabban Gamliel, Rabbi Eliezer ben Azarya, Rabbi Yehoshua, and Rabbi Akiva were going up to Jerusalem. When they reached Mount Scopus, the site of the Temple came into view, and they tore their garments in mourning. When they reached the Temple Mount, they saw a fox dart out from the spot where the Holy of Holies had stood in the Holy Temple. The Rabbis began to weep, but Rabbi Akiva laughed. They said to him: “Akiva, you never cease to amaze us. We are crying, and you laugh!” But Rabbi Akiva said, “And you, why are you crying?”</i>
<i>The Rabbis responded: “What? Shall we not weep? The place about which Scripture states (Bemidbar 1:51), ‘And the stranger who draws close shall die’ has become a den of foxes! Indeed, this is a fulfilment of the verse, ‘For Mount Zion which lies desolate; foxes prowl over it’”</i> (Eikha 5:18)<i>.</i>
<i>Rabbi Akiva answered them: “This is exactly why I laugh. For just as we have seen the prophecies of Jerusalem’s destruction have come to pass, so too, know that the prophecies of her future consolation shall also be fulfilled. I laughed because I remembered the verses (Zekharya 8:4–5), ‘Old men and old women will once again sit in the streets of Jerusalem, each with his staff in his hand because of advanced age, and the city will be filled with boys and girls playing in its streets.’ The Holy One, blessed be He, has declared that just as the first prophecies have been fulfilled, so shall the latter. I am joyous that the first have already come to pass, for the latter shall be fulfilled in the future.”</i>
<i>Said the Rabbis, “You have comforted us, Akiva; you have comforted us. May you be comforted by the footsteps of the Messiah.”</i>

<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. What do you think is the connection between the message of this midrash and the message in</i> The Core Idea <i>above?</i>
<i>2. Is it hard to have the faith in God and Jewish history displayed by Rabbi Akiva in this midrash? Do you find this difficult or easy?</i>
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>God’s speech to Moshe that delivers the world-changing idea discussed in <i>The Core Idea</i>, in Shemot 6:2–8, is breathtaking in its grandeur and literary structure. But what will concern us – as it has successive generations of interpreters – is the proposition signalled at the outset: “I appeared to Avraham, to Yitzḥak, and to Yaakov as the Lord Almighty, but by My name God I was not known to them.” A fundamental distinction is being made between the experience the patriarchs had of God, and the experience the Israelites are about to have. Something new, unprecedented, is about to happen. What is it?
Clearly it has to do with the names by which God is known. The verse distinguishes between <i>El Shaddai</i> (“the Lord Almighty”) and the four-letter name of God which, because of its sanctity, Jewish tradition referred to simply as <i>Hashem</i> – “The Name” par excellence (which is translated above simply as “God”).
As the classic Jewish commentators point out, the verse must be read with great care. It does not say that the patriarchs “did not know” this name; nor does it say that God did not “make this name known” to them. The four-letter name appears no less than 165 times in the book of Bereshit. God Himself uses the phrase “I am <i>Hashem</i>” to both Avraham (Bereshit 15:7) and Yaakov (Bereshit 28:13).
For the Sages of the Midrash, <i>Hashem</i> signified the divine attribute of compassion: God said to Moshe, “You wish to know My name? I am called according to My deeds…. When I judge creatures, I am called <b><i>Elokim</i></b>. When I wage war against the wicked, I am called ‘<b>Lord of hosts</b>.’ When I suspend judgement for man’s sins, I am called <b><i>El Shaddai</i></b>. When I am merciful towards My world, I am called <b><i>Hashem</i></b>.”
For Judah Halevi and Ramban, the key difference has to do with God’s acts within and beyond nature. This is how Halevi puts it in <i>The Kuzari</i>: “This is perhaps what the Bible means when it says, ‘And I appeared to Avraham…as <i>El Shaddai</i>,’ namely, in the way of power and dominion…. He did not, however, perform any miracle for the patriarchs as he did for Moshe.”
Rashi’s explanation is the simplest and most elegant: “I was not recognised by them in My attribute of ‘keeping faith’ (implied by My name ‘<i>Hashem</i>’), namely that I am faithful to fulfil My word, for I made promises to them but I did not fulfil them [during their lifetime].”
Something was about to change. The patriarchs had received the covenantal promise. They would become a nation. They would inherit a land. None of this, however, happened in their lifetime. To the contrary, as the book of Bereshit reaches its close, the family of the patriarchs numbers a mere seventy souls and they are in exile in Egypt. Now, the fulfilment is about to begin. Already, in the first chapter of the book of Exodus, we hear, for the first time, the phrase “<i>am benei Yisrael</i>,” “the people of the children of Israel” (Shemot 1:9). Israel has at last become not merely a family, but a nation. Moshe at the Burning Bush has been told by God that He will bring them to “a good and spacious land, a land flowing with milk and honey” (Shemot 3:8). <i>Hashem</i> therefore means the God who acts in history to fulfil His promises.
At the heart of most visions of the human condition is what Mircea Eliade (in his book <i>Cosmos and History</i>) calls “the terror of history.” The passage of time, with its disasters, its apparent randomness, its radical contingency, is profoundly threatening to the human search for order and coherence. There seems to be no meaning in history. We live, we die, and it is as if we had never been. The universe gives no sign of any interest in our existence. If that was so in ancient times, when people believed in the existence of gods, how much more so is it true today for those neo-Darwinians who see life as no more than the operation of “chance and necessity” (Jacques Monod) or “the blind watchmaker” (Richard Dawkins). Time seems to obliterate all meaning. Nothing lasts. Nothing endures.
In ancient Israel, by contrast, “for the first time, the prophets placed a value on history…. For the first time, we find affirmed and increasingly accepted the idea that historical events have a value in themselves, insofar as they are determined by the will of God…. Historical facts thus become situations of man in respect to God, and as such they acquire a religious value that nothing had previously been able to confer on them. It may, then, be said with truth that the Hebrews were the first to discover the meaning of history as the epiphany of God.” Judaism is the escape into history, the unique attempt to endow events with meaning, and to see in the chronicles of mankind something more than a mere succession of happenings – to see them as nothing less than a drama of redemption in which the fate of a nation reflects its loyalty or otherwise to a covenant with God.
Some 3,300 years ago, God told Moshe that He would intervene in the arena of time, not only (though primarily) to rescue the Israelites but also “so that My name may be declared throughout the world” (Shemot 9:16). The script of history would bear the mark of a hand – not human, but divine. And it began with these words: “Therefore say to the Israelites: ‘I am God, and I will bring you out from under the yoke of the Egyptians.’”
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>Somewhere in the tale of Jewish survival was a mystery of great significance…there was one people whose history broke all the rules…[the] encounter with the Jewish story [suggests] the important idea that God might be found not only in nature but in history. And if we search for revelation in history, we will find it, more compellingly than anywhere else, in the history of that unusual people, our ancestors. For almost two thousand years Jews remained a distinctive nation without any of the usual prerequisites of nationhood. They had no land, no sovereignty, no power, no overarching political structures, not even a shared culture. They were scattered over the face of the earth and almost everywhere they were a minority. For the most part they refused active efforts to convert them, and resisted the passive pull of assimilation. No other people kept its identity intact for so long in such circumstances.

Do you think this is a controversial or radical idea?
<b>EDUCATIONAL COMPANION TO THE QUESTIONS</b>
<b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>There are no definitive answers to this question, but if one believes in the God who acts in history, then it is reasonable to presume that there has to be some meaning behind the national narrative of the Jewish people. Various Jewish thinkers have suggested rationales in answer to this question (too many to summarise here). However, in the context of the message of this <i>Covenant &amp; Conversation</i> essay, we might postulate that the nature of the situation the Israelites found themselves in before God intervened to fulfil the covenant He had made with the forefathers highlights the magnificence of God acting in history, in order to clearly emphasise this message.
There could be no God at all and history is a random sequence of events that are without meaning. Alternatively, there could be a creator who created the world but does not play an active role in it (this is a position found in Greek philosophy).
In the book of Bereshit, we see a personal God who has intimate relationships with individuals, including communicating with them and influencing the trajectories of their lives. But we do not see a God who intervenes on the larger stage of the history of nations and the world as a whole.
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br>In the Midrash, Rabbi Akiva demonstrates faith that God acts in history, fulfilling promises, covenants, and prophecies. This is the central message found in <i>The Core Idea</i> – that God acts in history.
This is a subjective question that must be answered on an individual basis. Faith is hard for some and easier for others. History is a great source of religious faith for some (see <i>From the Thought of Rabbi Sacks</i>) but a challenge to the faith of others.
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>For many, including Rabbi Sacks, Jewish history is a great source of faith. This quote, from Rabbi Aharon Lichtenstein, expresses this in a personal way: “[My] faith [in God] has been persistently reinforced by Jewish history…. ‘These are His awesome effects, for were it not for awe of God, how could one nation survive among the nations?’ (Yoma 69b)…. Our singular history has provided much reinforcement” (see also <i>It Once Happened</i>, question 2).
This could be answered in many ways, and obviously requires a personal response. However, we can encourage our children or students to consider the period in history that we are living through in this way also (and at the very least the period immediately preceding ours, including the early years of the State of Israel).
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>The entire narrative, from the creation story until the Israelites are about to enter the Promised Land, is a testament to the fact that not only did God create the world, and not only did God form intimate relationships with individuals (such as the forefathers), but God continually acts and intervenes in history, on a national and world level. In the book of Bereshit, we see a personal God, but in the book of Shemot we see a God who intervenes on the larger stage of the history of nations and the world as a whole. The nature of God’s intervention during the narrative of the book of Shemot is spectacular, both because of the supernatural aspects (miracles beyond nature) and because of the manner in which God intervenes on behalf of a small and downtrodden people at the expense of the most advanced and powerful nation on earth.
The knowledge (or faith) that God acts in history and has a plan for history helps us live in a world that at times feels like it has no order and no justice.
It is an idea that is based on faith and can never be proven scientifically. There are many, and always have been many, who find it hard to believe this to be the case. In the world of philosophy, both today and in ancient times, there were many who attacked this notion. And, in fact, Rabbi Sacks presents it as one of the core ideas that Judaism brought to the world that flew in the face of the conventional thought of that time, and on some level, even in our time.

Bo

In a Nutshell

<b><i>IN A NUTSHELL</i></b><br>In the last <i>parasha,</i> we read of the first seven plagues. In <i>Parashat Bo,</i> the eighth plague of locusts and the ninth plague of darkness are described. Pharaoh still refuses to free the Israelite slaves, so God tells Moshe that the tenth plague will bring death to all the firstborn Egyptian sons. Each Israelite family must paint lamb’s blood on their doorpost, in order to protect their firstborn.
After the death of the Egyptian firstborns, Pharaoh finally lets the Israelites go. In fact, he demands that they leave! Finally, the people have been set free and are ready to journey to the Promised Land. Then the Torah describes the very first Pesaḥ celebration, and Moshe tells the people how to celebrate Pesaḥ in the future also.
<b>QUESTION TO PONDER</b>
<i>When and how do we tell this story every year (without using these verses from the Torah)?</i>

I; Writing My Own Chapter

<big><strong>I. Writing My Own Chapter</strong></big><br><b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>Every culture has its stories. The tradition goes back to the days when our ancestors were hunter-gatherers, sharing stories around the campfire at night.
Storytelling has always been central to the Jewish tradition. But what is truly remarkable is the way in which, in this <i>parasha</i>, just before finally leading the Israelites out of Egypt, Moshe tells them three times how they are to tell the story to their children in future generations:
1. When your children ask you, “What does this ceremony mean to you?” <i>then tell them</i>, “It is the Passover sacrifice to the Lord, who passed over the houses of the Israelites in Egypt and spared our homes when He struck down the Egyptians” (Shemot 12:26–27).
2.<b></b> <i>On that day tell your child</i>, “I do this because of what the Lord did for me when I came out of Egypt” (Shemot 13:8).
3.<b></b> In days to come, when your child asks you, “What does this mean?” <i>say</i>, “With a mighty hand the Lord brought us out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery” (Shemot 13:14).
The Israelites had not yet left Egypt, and yet already Moshe was telling them how to tell the story. That is an extraordinary fact. Why so? Why this focus on storytelling?
The simplest answer is that <i>we are the story we tell about ourselves</i>. There is a basic link between narrative (stories) and identity (who we think we are). In the words of the thinker who first brought this to our attention, Alasdair MacIntyre, “Man is in his actions and practice, as well as in his fictions, essentially a story-telling animal.” We come to know who we are by discovering of which story or stories we are a part.
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. Can you think of other examples of storytelling in Judaism and Jewish culture?</i>
<i>2. What stories have formed your Jewish identity?</i>
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br>On November 28, 1947, member countries voted on the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine.
The plan proposed creating two states, a Jewish and Arab state side by side. If the plan gained two-thirds of the votes, it would herald the creation of the first Jewish state since biblical times and with it, the realisation of the Zionist dream. But this was by no means a sure verdict. It took much lobbying and convincing on the part of the Zionist movement to persuade other nations to vote for the plan. In his speech to the United Nations, David Ben-Gurion argued the case for the creation of the State of Israel by referring to Pesaḥ and the story told in the Haggada:
<i>“Three hundred years ago, a ship called the Mayflower set sail to the New World. This was a great event in the history of England. Yet I wonder if there is one Englishman who knows at what time the ship set sail? Do the English know how many people embarked on this voyage? What quality of bread did they eat? Yet more than 3,300 years ago, before the Mayflower set sail, the Jews left Egypt. Every Jew in the world, even in America or Soviet Russia, knows on exactly what date they left – the fifteenth of the month of Nisan. Everyone knows what kind of bread they ate. Even today, the Jews worldwide eat matza on the fifteenth of Nisan. They retell the story of the Exodus and all the troubles Jews have endured since being exiled. They conclude this evening with two statements: This year, slaves. Next year, free people. This year here. Next year in Jerusalem, in Zion, in</i> Eretz Yisrael<i>. That is the nature of the Jews.”</i>
Jews don’t just remember their history, they live and breathe it, and relive and experience it every year on Pesaḥ, by using the Haggada to tell the story of the Exodus.
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. What point was Ben-Gurion making?</i>
<i>2. Why do you think the Jewish people care so much about learning all the details of the Exodus story?</i>
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>Jerome Bruner is an American psychologist who has persuasively argued that narrative is central to the construction of meaning, and meaning is what makes the human condition human. No computer needs to be persuaded of its purpose in life before it does what it is supposed to do. Genes need no motivational encouragement. No virus needs a coach. We do not have to enter their mindset to understand what they do and how they do it, because they do not have a mindset to enter.
But humans do. We act in the present because of things we did, or that happened to us, in the past, and in order to realise a sought-for future. Even minimally to explain what we are doing is already to tell a story. Take three people eating salad in a restaurant, one because he needs to lose weight, the second because she’s a principled vegetarian, the third because of religious dietary laws. These are three outwardly similar acts, but they belong to different stories and they have different meanings for the people involved.
Even so, why such focus on telling our specific story of the Exodus?
One of the most powerful passages I have ever read on the nature of Jewish existence is contained in Jean-Jacques Rousseau’s <i>Considerations on the Government of Poland</i> (1772). This is an unlikely place to find insight on the Jewish condition, but it is there. Rousseau is talking about the greatest of political leaders. The very first of these, he says, was Moshe, who “formed and executed the astonishing enterprise of instituting as a national body a swarm of wretched fugitives who had no arts, no weapons, no talents, no virtues, no courage, and who, since they had not an inch of territory of their own, were a troop of strangers upon the face of the earth.”
Moshe, he says, “dared to make out of this wandering and servile troop a body politic, a free people, and while it wandered in the wilderness without so much as a stone on which to rest its head, gave it the lasting institution, proof against time, fortune, and conquerors, which 5,000 years have not been able to destroy or even to weaken.” This singular nation, he says, so often subjugated and scattered, “has nevertheless maintained itself down to our days, scattered among the other nations without ever merging with them.”
Moshe’s genius, he says, lay in the nature of the laws that kept Jews as a people apart. But that is only half the reason. The other half lies in this <i>parasha</i>, in the institution of storytelling as a fundamental religious duty, recalling and re-enacting the events of the Exodus every year, and in particular, making children central to the story. Noting that in three of the four storytelling passages (three in our <i>parasha</i>, the fourth in <i>Va’etḥanan</i>), children are the ones asking questions, the Sages held that the narrative of Seder night should be told in response to a question asked by a child, wherever possible. If we are the story we tell about ourselves, then as long as we never lose the story, we will never lose our identity.
This idea found expression some years ago in a fascinating encounter. Tibet has been governed by the Chinese since 1950. During the 1959 uprising, the Dalai Lama, his life in danger, fled to Dharamsala in India, where he and many of his followers have lived ever since. Realising that their stay in exile might be prolonged, in 1992 he decided to ask Jews, whom he regarded as the world’s experts in maintaining identity in exile, for advice. What, he wanted to know, was the secret? The story of that week-long encounter has been told by Rodger Kamenetz in his book <i>The Jew in the Lotus.</i> One of the things they told him was the importance of memory and storytelling in keeping a people’s culture and identity alive. They spoke about Pesaḥ and the Seder service in particular. In 1997, rabbis and American dignitaries held a special Seder service in Washington, DC with the Dalai Lama. He wrote this to the participants:
“In our dialogue with rabbis and Jewish scholars, the Tibetan people have learned about the secrets of Jewish spiritual survival in exile: one secret is the Passover Seder. Through it, for 2,000 years, even in very difficult times, Jewish people remember their liberation from slavery to freedom, and this has brought you hope in times of difficulty. We are grateful to our Jewish brothers and sisters for adding to their celebration of freedom the thought of freedom for the Tibetan people.”
Cultures are shaped by the range of stories to which they give rise. Some of these have a special role in shaping the self-understanding of those who tell them. We call them <i>master-narratives</i>. They are about large, ongoing groups of people: the tribe, the nation, the civilisation. They hold the group together horizontally across space and vertically across time, giving it a shared identity handed on across the generations.
No narrative has been more powerful than the Exodus story, whose frame and context is set out in our <i>parasha</i>. It gave Jews the most tenacious identity ever held by a nation. In the eras of oppression, it gave hope of freedom. At times of exile, it promised return. It told two hundred generations of Jewish children who they were and of what story they were a part. It became the world’s master-narrative of liberty, adopted by an astonishing variety of groups, from Puritans in the seventeenth century to African Americans in the nineteenth and to Tibetan Buddhists today.
<b>I believe that I am a character in our people’s story, with my own chapter to write, and so are we all. To be a Jew is to see yourself as part of that story, to make it live in our time, and to do your best to hand it on to those who will come after us.</b>
<b>QUESTION TO PONDER</b>
<i>What do you think it is about storytelling that makes it such a powerful factor in building our identity?</i>
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>Jews will never own buildings like Windsor Castle. We are not that kind of people. But we own something that is, in its way, no less majestic and even more consecrated by time. The Jewish castle is built not of bricks or stone, but of words. But it too has been preserved across the centuries, handed on by one generation to the next, added to and enhanced in age after age, lovingly cherished and sustained. As a child I knew that one day I would inherit it from my parents, as they had inherited it from theirs. It is not a building but it is, nonetheless, a home, a place in which to live. More than it belongs to us, we belong to it; and it too is part of the heritage of mankind. What we have is not a physical construction but something else – a story.
It was given to me by my parents when I was a child. I received it on the festival of Passover. It is an exceptionally moving story. It tells of how our ancestors were once slaves who, through a succession of wondrous events, were given their freedom. They then began a journey across the desert for forty years, and later through a wilderness of dispersion for two thousand years, in search of a home, a promised land, a place of grace and justice and freedom and dignity. Though at times the destination seemed to lie beyond the furthest horizon of hope, they did not give up. They never ceased to travel. And I am part of that journey. I did not choose to be, any more than the member of a royal family chooses to be born into royalty; but this is my legacy, my heritage. It defines who I am. I know, just as does the heir to a castle, that I am a link in the chain of generations, and that I owe a duty of loyalty to the past and to the future.
<b><i>The Jonathan Sacks Haggada</i>, The Story of Stories, 10–11</b>
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>Why do you think Jews have a reputation of being a people who tell stories?
Why is it particularly important in Jewish tradition to tell stories to children?
What is it about the Exodus story that makes it so critical that the Jewish people remember and retell it?
<b>EDUCATIONAL COMPANION TO THE QUESTIONS</b>
<b><i>IN A NUTSHELL</i></b><br>We tell this story every year on Seder night by reciting the Haggada. But the Haggada is just an aid to the real storytelling, which must be experiential. It must involve a re-enactment and re-experiencing of the story. We do this through eating matza and <i>maror</i>, through reclining and feeling like liberated royalty. This is the best way to tell a story – in a way that the listener feels they are actually experiencing the story.
<b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>Storytelling is central to Jewish culture. The foundational text of the Jewish people – the Tanakh – is largely a narration of ancient Jewish history. Our other classical texts such as the Talmud and Midrash are full of stories. Education is a core value of Judaism, and storytelling is a fundamental tool of the educator. While rabbis and teachers have always told stories, the more modern Jewish movement of <i>Ḥasidut</i> has elevated storytelling to new spiritual levels. The hasidic Rebbe enraptures his Hasidim with tales of <i>tzaddikim</i> and miracles. Jews have always been passionate about Jewish history, and every parent and educator invests time in telling the next generation the tales of their people’s history.
While this is a personal question, no doubt every Jewish child can name the biblical stories and other stories from Jewish history that have formed the foundation of their Jewish identity. Childhood experiences of Seder night in particular will likely give them life-long memories and associations that will accompany most Jews into adulthood.
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br>The point Ben-Gurion was urging the United Nations delegates to understand was that Jews have always felt connected to the land of Israel, to the extent that they know, in minute detail, the history that took them there at the dawn of their existence as a nation. Because of the Jewish commitment to ritual and historical Judaism throughout their four-thousand-year history, especially in the form of the Seder night rituals and telling of the Exodus story, every Jew knows every single detail of the story, because it is an intrinsic part of their identity. And central to that national identity is their connection to their ancestral homeland.
Perhaps without this obsessive attention to every detail, Jews would have lost their national narrative and with it their national identity. The fact that two thousand years after exile from the land of Israel there was still a strong connection to our homeland, even though it had not had a significant Jewish presence in all that time, is indicative of the national narrative created by the storytelling Jews do.
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>Rabbi Sacks quotes several thinkers who explain that humans are a “storytelling animal,” and that there is an intrinsic connection between narrative and identity. We come to know who we are by discovering of which stories we are a part. Narrative is central to the construction of meaning, and meaning is what makes the human condition human.
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>Jewish classical texts are replete with narrative, such as the Tanakh, which presents ancient Jewish history, and the rabbinic texts of the Talmud and Midrash, which explore the doctrines and theology of Judaism through stories and legends. There are also core mitzvot that revolve around storytelling, such as Seder night and the weekly public reading of the Torah. This has led to Jews becoming known as a people who tell stories. This has also led to the modern Jewish movement of <i>Ḥasidut</i>, where the telling of the legends of <i>tzaddikim</i> is a central tenet.
Judaism has always focused on educating the next generation as a way to ensure Jewish continuity. Storytelling is a powerful way to build identity and socialise young Jews into the adult community and into the norms and beliefs of their nation. This is why the ritual of the Passover Seder has become so central and widely observed (even by Jews who in general are not ritually observant).
The Exodus story teaches us about the creation of the Jewish people as a nation. It is the beginning of a long story where we are the most recent chapters. To understand the rest of Jewish history, you have to understand the beginning of Jewish history. More than a way to understand Jewish history, the core values of Judaism were born in the experience of slavery in Egypt and the story of liberation. Fundamental Jewish beliefs and values, such as God acting in history to protect the weak and vulnerable, and the responsibility to learn from our experience in Egypt to protect the weak in society today, were all formed in the collective memory of the Exodus narrative and passed on with the transmission of the Exodus story.

II; Against Their Gods

<big><strong>II. Against Their Gods</strong></big><br><b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>The ninth plague – darkness – comes shrouded in a darkness of its own. What is this plague doing here? It seems out of sequence. So far there have been eight plagues, and they have become steadily and increasingly more serious. The first two, blood and frogs, seemed more like signs than anything else. The third and fourth, gnats and wild beasts, caused worry, not crisis. The fifth, the plague that killed livestock, affected animals, not human beings. The sixth, boils, was again a discomfort, but more serious this time. The seventh and eighth, hail and locusts, destroyed the Egyptian grain. Together with the previous loss of livestock, now there was no food. Still to come was the tenth plague, the death of the firstborn, that would eventually break Pharaoh. So we would expect the ninth plague to be very serious indeed.
Instead it seems to be an anticlimax. Darkness is a nuisance, but no more. The phrase “darkness that can be felt” suggests what happened: a <i>khamsin</i>, a sandstorm usually produced by a southern wind that blows into Egypt from the Sahara Desert, was probably not unusual for Egyptians, especially at this time of year in the spring. It can last for several days and produce sand- and dust-filled air that obliterates the light of the sun. The ninth plague was no doubt unusual in its intensity, but it was not an event unfamiliar to the Egyptians, then or now. Why then does it figure in the plague story, and why did it not happen nearer the beginning, as one of the less severe plagues?
The answer lies in a line from “<i>Dayeinu</i>,” the song we sing as part of the Haggada: “If God had executed judgement against them [the Egyptians] but had not done so against their gods, it would have been sufficient.” And this sentiment is also found in the Torah itself: “I will perform acts of judgement against all the gods of Egypt: I (alone) am God” (Shemot 12:12).
Not all the plagues were directed, in the first instance, against the Egyptians. Some were directed against things they worshipped as gods. That is the case in the first two plagues. The Nile was considered the god of fertility and frogs were associated with the goddess who was present at births. The plagues were not only intended to punish Pharaoh and his people for their mistreatment of the Israelites, but also to show them the powerlessness of the gods in which they believed. The greatest god in the Egyptian pantheon was Ra the sun god. The obliteration of the sun was a message that there is a power greater than Ra: God.

<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br>Here is a translation of the <i>Ḥad Gadya</i> song from the Pesaḥ Haggada:
<i>One little goat my father bought for two zuzim. Along came a cat and ate the goat. Then came a dog and bit the cat. Then came a stick and hit the dog. Then came a fire and burned the stick. Then came water and put out the fire. Then came an ox and drank the water. Then came a slaughterer and slew the ox. Then came the angel of death and slew the slaughterer.</i>
<i>Then came the Holy One and slew the angel of death, who slew the slaughterer who slew the ox who drank the water that put out the fire that burned the stick that hit the dog who bit the cat who ate the goat my father bought for two zuzim; one little goat, one little goat.</i>
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. What do you think all the characters in this story represent? What is the overall message of the song? Why do you think this song is found in the Haggada?</i>
<i>2. How is the message of this song connected to the message of</i> The Core Idea<i>?</i>
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>As set out in <i>The Core Idea</i> above, the plagues were not only intended to punish Pharaoh and his people for their mistreatment of the Israelites, but also to show them the powerlessness of the gods in which they believed. The symbolism of these plagues, often lost on us, would have been immediately apparent to the Egyptians.
By first ordering the midwives to kill all male Israelite babies, and then, when that failed, by commanding, “Every boy who is born must be cast into the Nile” (Shemot 1:22), Pharaoh had turned what should have been symbols of life (the Nile, which fed Egyptian agriculture, and midwives) into agents of death. The river that turned to blood, and the frogs (that represent childbirth in Egyptian culture) that infested the land were not afflictions as such, but rather coded communications, as if to say to the Egyptians: Reality has an ethical structure. See what it feels like when the gods you turned against the Israelites turn on you. If used for evil ends, the powers of nature will turn against man, so that what he does will be done to him in turn. There is justice in history.
Hence the tenth plague, to which all the others were a mere prelude. Whereas the first two plagues were symbolic representations of the Egyptian murder of Israelite children, the tenth plague was the enactment of retributive justice, as if Heaven was saying to the Egyptians: You committed, or supported, or passively accepted the murder of innocent children. There is only one way you will ever realise the wrong you did, namely, if you yourself suffer what you did to others.
This too helps explain the difference between the two words the Torah regularly uses to describe what God did in Egypt: “<i>otot umoftim</i>,” “signs and wonders.” These two words are not two ways of describing the same thing – miracles. They describe quite different things. A <i>mofet</i>, a wonder, is indeed a miracle. An <i>ot</i>, a sign, is something else: a symbol (like tefillin or circumcision, both of which are called <i>ot</i>), that is to say, a coded communication, a message.
The significance of the ninth plague is now obvious. The greatest god in the Egyptian pantheon was Ra or Re, the sun god. The name of the pharaoh often associated with the Exodus, Ramesses II, means <i>meses</i>, “son of” (as in the name Moses/Moshe) Ra, the god of the sun. Egypt – so its people believed – was ruled by the sun. Its human ruler, or pharaoh, was semi-divine, the child of the sun god.
The plague of darkness was not a <i>mofet</i> but an <i>ot</i>, a sign. The obliteration of the sun signalled that there is a power greater than Ra. Yet what the plague represented was less the power of God over the sun, but the rejection by God of a civilisation that turned one man, Pharaoh, into an absolute ruler (son of the sun god) with the ability to enslave other human beings – and of a culture that could tolerate the murder of children because that is what Ra himself did.
When God told Moshe to say to Pharaoh, “My son, My firstborn, Israel,” He was saying: I am the God who cares for His children, not one who kills His children. The ninth plague was a divine act of communication that said: There is not only physical darkness but also moral darkness. The best test of a civilisation is to see how it treats children, its own and others’. In an age of broken families, neglected and impoverished children, and worse – the use of children as instruments of war – that is a lesson we still need to learn.
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>There can be no doubt that the religion of ancient Israel was one of the most stunning transformations ever wrought in humanity’s moral imagination, never more so than in the fact of the Exodus itself. In antiquity the gods were on the side of the established power. They underwrote the reign of kings, emperors, and princes – an idea revived in Europe in the Middle Ages in the form of the doctrine of the “divine right of kings.” Rulers ruled because they were gods, or children of gods, or prime intermediaries between the gods and mankind. They held sway on earth for the same reason as did the sun in the sky: there was an order on earth as in heaven, by which the strong ruled the weak, and power was the guarantor of order. That God, Creator of heaven and earth, might intervene in history <i>to liberate slaves</i> was the ultimately unthinkable. Thus a paradox was born, which ever since has inspired men and women to break the chains of their oppression: that true power is distinguished by its concern for the powerless, that greatness is measured by the ability to hear the cry of the otherwise unheard – the weak, the vulnerable, “the widow, the orphan, and the stranger” – and that freedom is not worthy of its name unless it means freedom for all.

Do you think there is a similar phenomenon in modern times of leaders who think they are gods or the sons of gods?
<b>EDUCATIONAL COMPANION TO THE QUESTIONS</b>
<b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>The plagues had multifaceted functions that can be understood on three levels. On a basic level, they were designed to liberate the Israelites. But it is often asked why God didn’t do this in a simpler, less dramatic way (or in fact, why did He allow or orchestrate their enslavement in the first place)? The basic premise of this <i>Covenant &amp; Conversation</i> essay is that the Exodus narrative in general and the plagues in particular were designed with another objective in mind. This could be the punishment of Pharaoh and the Egyptian people who were complicit in the Israelite enslavement. In which case, the third level of God’s agenda in the story is the re-education of the Egyptian people (a regional superpower in the world) and the nations of the world, then and throughout history. In a nutshell, they were designed to show the inherent flaws in a hierarchical society built on the back of an oppressed minority, and to show the way towards building an ideal ethical society based on the core values of the Torah of liberty and equality for all.
The plagues were therefore not just for the benefit of the Israelites who gained their liberty through them, but also for the Egyptian people as a process of re-education, and in fact people of the entire world throughout history, who have learned and incorporated the values of the narrative of the Exodus into their societies.
Education is a lengthy process. The end result, the acceptance of truths such as these, necessitates an experiential journey. A sudden and miraculous demonstration of strength would have proven merely that the Israelite God at that moment was stronger than the Egyptian gods, rather than the core message: there is one ultimate power who created all humans in His image, and has charged them to build societies based on the values of liberty and equality.
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br>Rabbi Sacks writes in the essay “One Little Goat” in <i>The Jonathan Sacks Haggada</i> that each character represents a different nation that attempted to destroy the Jewish people. The message is that each one has been destroyed in one way or another and no longer exists, but God has ensured that the Jewish people survived. This is one possible interpretation, while there could be others. But the overarching message is that while at any point in history it seems as if there are nations or people or other forces that are all-mighty and invincible, only God is truly invincible. The story told in the Haggada is the beginning of the long story of the Jewish people and signifies the first time in history when a nation tried to destroy them. While this was certainly not the only time, the result will always be the same, for the Jewish people have an unbreakable covenant with God that protects them.
Just as each element in the <i>Ḥad Gadya</i> song believes itself to be invincible, it was proved not to be the case. Only Hashem is ultimately invincible, and the ruler of the world. While the people of Egypt believed in the invincibility of their gods and of their leader Pharaoh, as the son of god, the truth became painfully apparent by the end of the Exodus story.
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>Judaism’s core value, that every human being is created in the image of God ensures that while soft hierarchies may be necessary in society, all people are created equal and have equal worth and rights. Judaism as a civilisation and moral code places great emphasis on protecting the weak in society.
The despot Pharaoh, who believed himself to be an invincible deity, and who had built his empire and power on the back of defenseless, weak, and oppressed people within his kingdom, was unceremoniously dethroned and in the process the one true God was revealed. The core message of liberty and equality has captured the hearts and minds of humanity ever since. This story has not only impacted and deeply influenced the Jewish people who continue to retell the story every year, but all societies under the influence of the Judaeo-Christian worldview have built their societies on its values and transmitted its story to each following generation.
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>There are some scholars who have found ways to explain all ten plagues, and the splitting of the Red Sea, in natural terms. This does not take away from their miraculous nature, because we believe that even through nature God acts and influences history. The exact timing to achieve a divine agenda in itself should be seen as part of the miraculous nature of the story. In this particular case, the Torah also goes out of its way to mention that there was light in the dwellings of the Israelites, suggesting that there was still a supernatural aspect to this miracle, even if you explain it as a <i>khamsin</i>.
A <i>mofet</i> is a supernatural miracle, while an <i>ot</i> focuses on the outcome of the wonder. An <i>ot</i> could be through natural means, but its timing and clear message make it more about the message it delivers. A <i>mofet</i> can still function as an <i>ot</i> delivering a clear message.
Many despots and dictators throughout history, including contemporary times, have a sense of their own invincibility, and display signs of a belief in a god-given autocracy. The political system of democracy tries to ensure enough transparency and checks and balances to protect from such autocrats rising to power and abusing the power they have. However, history has proven this not to always be sufficient.

Beshalach

In a Nutshell

<b><i>IN A NUTSHELL</i></b><br>The Israelites walked out of Egypt and into the desert, finally a free people. God led them by a pillar of cloud during the day and a pillar of fire at night. They were headed to Mount Sinai, but they went the long way round, to avoid possible battles on their way.
Then Pharaoh felt regret for setting them free, and chased after them with his powerful army of many men, horses, and chariots. The Israelites reached the Red Sea with nowhere safe to turn. They panicked and cried out to God in despair. Moshe calmed them and promised that God would save them. Then God caused the sea to miraculously divide, forming two walls of water with a path in the middle.
The Israelites walked along the dry path. As they reached the other side of the sea, the Egyptian army chased them along the same path, but the sea walls crashed down and drowned the army. The Israelites, led by Moshe and Miriam, sang songs of praise and thanksgiving for the miracle they had just witnessed.
But their troubles were not over. The people needed water and food and complained to Moshe. God sent both: water sprang from a rock, and manna came down from heaven. Then a new enemy, the Amalekites, attacked. The Israelite army defeated the Amalekites with the help of God, who then told Moshe to write all these events down as a remembrance.
<b>QUESTION TO PONDER</b>
<i>What do you find to be the most impressive miracle in this</i> parasha<i>: the pillars of fire and cloud, the splitting of the sea, the water from the rock, the manna from heaven, or the victory in battle over Amalek?</i>

I; Crossing the Sea

<big><strong>I. Crossing the Sea</strong></big><br><b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>Our <i>parasha</i> begins with an apparently simple statement:
<i>“When Pharaoh let the people go, God did not lead them on the road through the land of the Philistines, though that was shorter. For God said, ‘If they face war, they might change their minds and return to Egypt.’ So God led the people around by the desert road towards the Red Sea. The Israelites went up out of Egypt prepared for battle”</i> (Shemot 13:17–18).
God did not lead the people through the coastal route, which would have been more direct, because He did not want them to be attacked on the highway by groups like the Hittite army. He knew if they felt too much fear, they would ask to go back to their old lives in Egypt.
There are some confusing points here. The route they took instead led straight to the Red Sea – a terrifying dead end. Pharaoh was soon to send his army to pursue the Israelites, which God knew would happen. And at the end of the <i>parasha</i>, the Israelites faced an attack along their route anyway – against their new archenemy, the Amalekites. So how can we understand the text that explains God’s plan?
In the beginning of the <i>parasha</i>, what we see is God taking care of the people. He performed powerful miracles for them to show His protection. He knew they were not ready to face attack. But after the unforgettable splitting of the sea, saving them and destroying the Egyptian army, their spirits were stronger, and God took a step back. He did not fight the battle against the Amalekites on behalf of the Israelites; He had given the Israelites the strength to do so themselves.
Furthermore, once they had crossed the sea, the people knew that there was no way back. So they took responsibility and partnered God in achieving their own destiny. They went from passive to active participants in their own history, because from now on, they could only journey forwards.
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. How were the Israelites affected by taking the longer route out of Egypt?</i>
<i>2. What was God trying to teach them here, and how do we know they understood this message?</i>
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br><i>As I opened the card and felt the embossed words with my fingers, “Good Luck!” I felt tears welling. The message written below in familiar handwriting read: “Darling Mia, Good luck on your big day tomorrow. We are so proud of you. You are going to be great. Onwards! All our love, Mum and Dad.” I read it for a second and third time, a rush of warm and loving memories flooding back to me. It felt like I had been here before. Many times.</i>
<i>The first time was earlier than my memories stretch back. I was born two weeks after my due date. My dad always jokes that I didn’t want to leave the comfort and safety of my mum’s womb. But I was dragged literally kicking and screaming into the world by the doctor and midwife, and of course my mum.</i>
<i>I have clear memories of the next time I was pushed forwards, against my will, into a new world. It was my first day of school, and I wasn’t ready for my life to change. “Why are they making me do this?” I remember thinking…but after a few days, school almost felt like a second home.</i>
<i>The next time I remember feeling forced to do something I wasn’t sure about, it wasn’t my parents doing the pushing, but my closest friend. Camp just didn’t appeal to me, but Sophie would not take no for an answer. “I’ll look after you,” she said. “And we will have the BEST time!” And she was right, of course.</i>
<i>Thinking about it now, this has been a theme running throughout my life. My bat mitzva speech in front of hundreds of people…starting high school…my gap year away from home…university. The list goes on and on. Each one scarier than the one before. Each time those who loved me most, helped me, not just with encouragement but by forcing me out of my comfort zone. And each time I grew a little more into the person I am today.</i>
<i>Tomorrow I start my first real job. Tomorrow I start life as an adult. I’ve never liked change, and I am petrified! But my parents are right. I have got this. No more looking back –</i> <i>onwards!</i>
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. What things have your parents or teachers forced you to do that that you didn’t want to, that in hindsight you can now see was for your own good?</i>
<i>2. How is this story connected to this</i> parasha<i>?</i>
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>Let us really try to understand God’s decision to take a circuitous route out of Egypt: <i>“If they face war, they might change their minds and return to Egypt.”</i> It seems to raise a number of significant questions.
First: We see that the alternative route they took was potentially even more traumatic. God led them around by the desert road towards the Red Sea. When the Israelites saw the Egyptian chariots pursuing them in the distance, they had nowhere to go. They were terrified. So they were not spared the fear of war. Hence the first question: Why the Red Sea? On the face of it, it was the worst of all possible routes.
Second: If God did not want the Israelites to face war, and if He believed it would lead the people to want to return to Egypt, why did the Israelites leave <i>ḥamushim</i>, “armed” or “ready for battle”?
Third: <i>If God did not want the Israelites to face war, why did He provoke Pharaoh into pursuing them?</i> The text says so explicitly: “And I will harden Pharaoh’s heart, and he will pursue them” (Shemot 14:4).
Fourth: God did not want the Israelites to have reason to say, “Let us return to Egypt.” However, at the Red Sea, they <i>did</i> tell Moshe something very close to this: “Was it because there were no graves in Egypt that you brought us to the desert to die? What have you done to us by bringing us out of Egypt? Didn’t we say to you in Egypt, ‘Leave us alone; let us serve the Egyptians’? It would have been better for us to serve the Egyptians than to die in the desert!” (Shemot 14:11–12).
Fifth: God clearly wanted the Israelites to develop the self-confidence that would give them the strength to fight the battles they would have to fight in order to conquer the Holy Land. Why then did He bring about a situation at the sea where they had to do exactly the opposite, leaving everything to God?
The miracle that followed has so engraved itself on Jewish minds that we recite the Song at the Sea in our daily Morning Service. The Division of the Sea was, in its way, the greatest of all the miracles. But it did not contribute to Jewish self-confidence and self-reliance. <i>“The Lord will fight for you; you need only to be still”</i> (Shemot 14:14). The Egyptians were defeated not by the Israelites but by God, and not by conventional warfare but by a miracle. How then did the encounter teach the Israelites courage?
Sixth: Our <i>parasha</i> ends with another battle, against the Amalekites. But this time, <i>there is no complaint on the part of the people</i>, no fear, no trauma, no despair. Yehoshua leads the people in battle. Moshe, supported by Aharon and Ḥur, stands on a hilltop, his arms upraised, and as the people look up to heaven, they are inspired, strengthened, and they prevail.
<i>Where, then, was the fear spoken of in the opening verse of the</i> parasha<i>?</i> Faced by the Amalekites, in some ways more fearsome than the Egyptians, the Israelites did not say they wanted to return to Egypt. The sheer silence on the part of the people stands in the strongest possible contrast to their previous complaints about water and food. The Israelites turn out to be good warriors.
<i>So why the sudden change between the opening of our</i> parasha<i> and its close</i>? In the opening, God is protective and miracle-working. At the close, God is more concealed. He does not fight the battle against the Amalekites; He gives the Israelites the strength to do so themselves. In the opening, the Israelites, seeing the pursuing Egyptians, panic and say that they should never have left Egypt. By the close, attacked by the Amalekites, they fight and win.
What has changed?
The answer, it seems to me, is that we have perhaps the first recorded instance of what later became a key military strategy. In 1519, a man named Cortes (the Spanish commander engaged in the conquest of Mexico) burned the ships that had carried his men. His soldiers now had no possibility of escape. They had to win or die. Hence the phrase, “burning your boats.”
Sometimes you have to arrange that there is no way back, no line of retreat, no possibility of fear-induced escape. It is a radical strategy, undertaken when the stakes are high and when exceptional reserves of courage are necessary. That is the logic of the events in this <i>parasha</i> that are otherwise hard to understand.
Before they crossed the Red Sea, the Israelites were fearful. But once they had crossed the sea, there was no way back. Their ability to fight and defeat the Amalekites showed how profoundly they had changed. Their boats and bridges were burned. They looked only forwards, for there was no return.
Any great undertaking comes with fear. Often we fear failure. Sometimes we even fear success. Are we worthy of it? Can we sustain it? We long for the security of the familiar, the life we have known. We are afraid of the unknown, the uncharted territory. And the journey itself exposes our vulnerability. We have left home; we have not yet reached our destination. Courage is not fearlessness. It is, in the words of a well-known book title, feeling the fear but doing it anyway.
Sometimes the only way to do this is to know that there is no way back. That is what crossing the Red Sea was for the Israelites, and why it was essential that they experienced it at an early stage in their journey. It marked the point of no return, the line of no retreat; the critical point at which they could only move forwards.
<b>I believe that some of the greatest positive changes in our lives come when, having undertaken a challenge, we cross our own Red Sea and know that there is no way back. There is only a way forwards.</b>
<b>Then God gives us the strength to fight our battles and win.</b>
<b>QUESTION TO PONDER</b>
<i>Why do some people need to be in a situation where there are no other options in order to take on scary challenges?</i>
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>Failure is the supreme learning experience, and the best people, the true heroes, are those most willing to fail…. God lifts us when we fall, gives us hope when we despair, and believes in us more than we believe in ourselves…. Even more than the strength to win, we need the courage to try, the willingness to fail, the readiness to learn, and the faith to persist.
<b>“Credo,” <i>The Times</i>, February 24, 2007</b>
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>What was God’s plan for the next stage in Jewish history, following the Exodus?
Why do you think the Israelites were prone to fear when they left Egypt?
How did the Israelites gain the courage to bravely battle Amalek?
<b>EDUCATIONAL COMPANION TO THE QUESTIONS</b>
<b><i>IN A NUTSHELL</i></b><br>All these miracles are impressive, and while the splitting of the Red Sea is perhaps the most remarkable, the others are no less miraculous. However, the odd one out here is the defeat of Amalek. The others are all supernatural miracles directly from God. The battle with Amalek is a natural miracle, and for the first time, a partnership between the people and God. Perhaps this is the most notable of them all.
<b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>There simply was no choice here but to be brave and move forwards and trust in God. There were no other options. The Egyptian army was behind them and rapidly approaching, and the Sea of Reeds, impossible to traverse, stood in front of them. This was the educational journey God took them on to increase their faith in God and to build bravery and faith in the face of adversity.
The message God was imparting here was that all growth incurs fear. There is no growth in the comfort zone and no comfort in the growth zone. It is only natural to want to remain in a safe and secure place and never take risks. But then there will be no growth and no progress. God was teaching that sometimes you need to be forced into an endeavour to overcome the fear that would otherwise prevent you from trying. The message was understood by the end of the <i>parasha</i>, and this can be seen in the way the Israelite army fought Amalek without a word of complaint or an expression of fear.
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br>It is a parent and teacher’s responsibility to encourage growth. This sometimes means forcing a child to leave their comfort zone and tackle their fears. This could be at school, in a social context, or with other endeavours in their life. As difficult as this is for the child, it is for their own benefit and growth (and it is difficult for the parent also!).
In the <i>parasha</i>, God acts as a parent and mentor, forcing the Israelites into an uncomfortable situation with no easy way out. But by the end of the <i>parasha</i> their growth is easy to identify.
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>It is only natural to want to remain in the comfort and safety of the familiar. It is normal to want to be protected and safe. But without ever being tested, and without being forced into a situation of discomfort, a person will miss out on opportunities for growth by always taking the easy and familiar path.
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>The simple answer is that God planned to get the people to Mount Sinai, give them the Torah, and then bring them to the Promised Land. But God’s agenda was more complex than just this. He wished to take the Israelites on a journey and through an educational process, building them as a people and teaching them the core values of Judaism. This meant inserting these values and national character traits into the national DNA of the people. The message contained in <i>Parashat Beshalaḥ</i> is an example of that. The narrative is about the process as much as the destination and outcome.
The Israelites still had a slave mentality. They had been subservient to a hostile authority for hundreds of years, and then when they finally gained their freedom and independence, it was by way of a miraculous event in history brought about by a benevolent, all-powerful God. The people were passive during this whole process. They did not yet have the skills or independent thinking to tackle challenging issues for themselves. They were totally reliant on God, and on Moshe their leader.
Through an educational process, revolving around the experiences they had in the wilderness, including the one described here, they slowly gained the confidence and courage to be independent and create a partnership with God. The battle against Amalek is an example of this. Rather than complain to God from a position of fear and weakness, they stepped up and entered the battle, with confidence and faith in God. This partnership is a model for all subsequent generations.

II; The Divided Sea; Natural or Supernatural

<big><strong>II. The Divided Sea: Natural or Supernatural</strong></big><br><b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>The splitting of the Sea of Reeds is engraved in Jewish memory. We mention it twice every day during the morning service. It was the ultimate miracle of the Exodus. But in what sense? If we listen carefully to the way the Torah describes it, we can distinguish two ways of looking at it.
This first is the supernatural dimension of what happened. “The waters were divided, and the Israelites went through the sea on dry ground, with a wall of water on their right and on their left…. The water flowed back and covered the chariots and horsemen – the entire army of Pharaoh that had followed the Israelites into the sea. Not one of them survived. But the Israelites went through the sea on dry ground, with a wall of water on their right and on their left” (Shemot 14:22, 28–29). Water, which normally flows, stood upright. The sea parted to expose dry land. The laws of nature were suspended. Something happened for which there can be no scientific explanation.
However, if we listen carefully, we can also hear a different note: “Then Moshe stretched out his hand over the sea, and all that night the Lord drove the sea back with a strong east wind and turned it into dry land” (Shemot 14:21). Here there is not a sudden change in the behaviour of water, with no apparent cause. God brings a wind that, in the course of several hours, drives the waters back.
Viewed from this perspective, the events that took place could be described as follows: The Israelites had arrived at the Sea of Reeds at a point at which it was shallow. Possibly, there was a ridge in the seabed, normally covered by water, but occasionally exposed – for example, when a fierce east wind blows.
We have here two ways of seeing the same events: one natural, the other supernatural. The supernatural explanation – that the waters stood upright – is immensely powerful, and so it entered Jewish memory. But the natural explanation is no less compelling. To put it another way: a miracle is not necessarily something that suspends natural law. It is, rather, an event for which there may be a natural explanation, but which – happening when, where, and how it did – evokes wonder, such that even the most hardened sceptic senses that God has intervened in history. The weak are saved; those in danger, delivered.
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. Which do you find more plausible: the natural explanation for the splitting of the Sea of Reeds or the supernatural explanation?</i>
<i>2. If the splitting of the Sea of Reeds was caused by a fierce east wind, does this make it any less miraculous?</i>
<i>3. In our age, where there are no perceptible supernatural miracles, do you still believe God intervenes in history and acts through nature? Can you give any examples?</i>
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br><i>During Israel’s War of Independence in 1948 a famous miracle occurred in the Arizal’s synagogue in the holy city of Tzefat. The synagogue was full of people while the battle for the city was going on around them outside. During the tefilla, a bomb exploded just outside the synagogue, spraying debris everywhere, including into the synagogue. Miraculously, just as the worshippers by the</i> bima<i> bowed their heads for the blessing of Modim, a piece of metal flew directly above their heads, and lodged itself in the</i> bima<i>. Bowing their heads saved their lives. The hole it made can still be seen today, reminding visitors of this miracle, and the need to thank God.</i>
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. This story describes this event as a miracle. Do you agree that it was miraculous? What aspect of it was a miracle?</i>
<i>2. Can you think of any other stories from Israel’s history that you would consider a miracle?</i>
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>There is an extra dimension to the second perspective to the splitting of the Sea of Reeds. “During the last watch of the night, the Lord looked down from the pillar of fire and cloud at the Egyptian army and threw it into confusion. He made the wheels of their chariots come off so that they had difficulty driving. The Egyptians said, ‘Let’s get away from the Israelites! The Lord is fighting for them against Egypt’” (Shemot 14:24–25). The emphasis here is less on miracle than on irony. The great military assets of the Egyptians – making them almost invulnerable in their day – were their horses and chariots. These were Egypt’s speciality.
In our second reading of these events, the wind that exposed the ridge in the bed of the sea led to dramatic events. Suddenly, the Israelites, travelling on foot, had an immense advantage over the Egyptian chariots that were pursuing them. Their wheels became stuck in the mud. The charioteers made ferocious efforts to free them, only to find that they quickly became mired again. The Egyptian army could neither advance nor retreat. So intent were they on the trapped wheels, and so reluctant were they to abandon their prized war machines, the chariots, that they failed to notice that the wind had dropped and the water was returning. By the time they realised what was happening, they were trapped. The ridge was now covered with sea water in either direction, and the island of dry land in the middle was shrinking by the minute. The mightiest army of the ancient world was defeated, and its warriors drowned, not by a superior army, not by human opposition at all, but by their own folly in being so focused on capturing the Israelites that they ignored the fact that they were driving into mud where their chariots could not go.
The Egyptians’ strength proved to be their weakness. The weakness of the Israelites became their strength. On this reading, what was significant was less the supernatural than the moral dimension of what happened. God visits the sins on the sinners. He mocks those who mock Him. He showed the Egyptian army, which revelled in its might, that the weak were stronger than they. More significant than the miraculous or natural nature of these events is the moral message such an event conveys: that hubris is punished by nemesis; that the proud are humbled and the humble given pride; that there is justice in history, often hidden but sometimes gloriously revealed.
This idea can be taken further. Emil Fackenheim has spoken of “epoch-making events” that transform the course of history. It is as if all normal perception fades away and we know that we are in the presence of something momentous, to which we sense we must remain faithful for the rest of our lives. It is through transformative events that we feel ourselves addressed, summoned, by something beyond history, breaking through into history. In this sense, the division of the Sea of Reeds was something other and deeper than a suspension of the laws of nature. It was the transformative moment at which the people “believed in the Lord and in Moshe His servant” (14:31) and called themselves “the people You acquired” (15:16).
The genius of the biblical narrative of the crossing of the Sea of Reeds is that it does not resolve the issue one way or another. It gives us both perspectives. To some, the miracle was the suspension of the laws of nature. To others, the fact that there was a naturalistic explanation did not make the event any less miraculous. That the Israelites should arrive at the sea precisely where the waters were unexpectedly shallow, that a strong east wind should blow when and how it did, and that the Egyptians’ greatest military asset should have proved their undoing – all these things were wonders, and we have never forgotten them.
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>The creation of the State of Israel was fraught with difficulty…. Yet it has achieved wondrous things.
Through it, Hebrew, the language of the Bible, was reborn as a living tongue. Jewish communities under threat have been rescued, including those like the Jews of Ethiopia who had little contact with other Jews for centuries. Jews have come to Israel from over a hundred countries, representing the entire lexicon of cultural diversity. A desolate landscape has bloomed again. Jerusalem has been rebuilt. The world of Torah scholarship, devastated by the Holocaust, has been revived and the sound of learning echoes throughout the land. Economically, politically, socially, and culturally, Israel’s achievements are unmatched by any country of its age and size. The Sages said that, at the crossing of the Red Sea, the simplest Jew saw miracles that the greatest of later prophets were not destined to see. That, surely, was the privilege of those who witnessed Israel’s rebirth and youth. The Messiah has not come. Israel is not yet at peace. The <i>Beit HaMikdash</i> has not been rebuilt. Our time is not yet redemption. Yet many, if not all, of the prayers of two thousand years have been answered.

<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. Do you think the history of the State of Israel is miraculous?</i>
<i>2. Do you find modern Jewish history strengthens or challenges your faith in God?</i>
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>Why do you think the Torah leaves room for understanding this miracle both supernaturally and naturally?
Have you ever experienced a miracle in your life? What was it?
Why do you think Rabbi Sacks describes the splitting of the Sea of Reeds as a “transformative moment” in history? What lessons could be learned from this event?
<b>EDUCATIONAL COMPANION TO THE QUESTIONS</b>
<b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>Sometimes natural explanations for a phenomenon can be just as fantastical as supernatural explanations. The miraculous aspect in the natural explanation for this event is the timing and the impact that it had on history (namely on the Egyptians and the ramifications for the Israelites). Each in its way is inspiring and can lead to a strengthening of faith in God and His role in history.
Because of the impact the event had on the course of history, including the remarkable timing of the natural phenomenon to bring that effect, this event can be described as miraculous. Describing an event as a miracle is testifying to its divine orchestration, whether through supernatural or natural means.
While this question asks for the reader to share their personal faith, the following quote from Rabbi Sacks’s book <i>A Letter in the Scroll</i> (p.  ??), gives us a sense of his approach to this: “If we search for revelation in history, we will find it, more compellingly than anywhere else, in the history of that unusual people, our ancestors.” See also <i>From the Thought of Rabbi Sacks</i> for suggestions from modern Jewish history.
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br>Those with strong faith will see the hand of God in all events. In this case, the timing of the event is key – that the explosion happened at the exact time the congregation was saying the <i>Modim</i> prayer and therefore bowing, so the shrapnel missed them and injury or death was avoided.
So much of Israel’s history can be described as miraculous – whether that be because we believe it was the hand of God orchestrating events, or because much of Israel’s history seems not to be governed by the laws of rational logic. In the words of David Ben-Gurion: “In Israel, in order to be a realist you must believe in miracles.”
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>Rabbi Sacks describes the history of the State of Israel as miraculous, as seen in this text. When we say <i>Hallel</i> on Yom HaAtzma’ut to commemorate and celebrate Israel’s independence, we are testifying to our belief that the creation of the State of Israel is due to the hand of God. So much of modern Israeli history defies the laws of logic and rational explanation, but even if this were not true, one who believes that God acts in history will see God’s hand in history, and be comfortable explaining events from history as miraculous (even if not supernatural). For another thinker who directly sees the hand of God in modern Jewish history, see Rabbi J. D. Soloveitchik’s seminal essay “<i>Kol Dodi Dofek</i>.”
While this question asks for the reader to share their personal approach to history and faith, the following quote from Rabbi Sacks’s book <i>Radical Then, Radical Now</i> sums up his approach to this: “If we search for revelation in history, we will find it, more compellingly than anywhere else, in the history of that unusual people, our ancestors.” While there is clearly much in Jewish history that can challenge the faith that God is orchestrating Jewish history (because there have been so many dark periods in our history, including the Holocaust which is still in our recent national collective memory), Rabbi Sacks still finds Jewish history as a whole an inspiration for his faith in God and His role in history.
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>Different people find inspiration from different places and in different ways. Perhaps this quintessential miracle is described in the Torah leaving room for both approaches to ensure it has maximum impact for its readers.
There are three main dictionary definitions of the word “miracle”:
an effect or extraordinary event in the physical world that surpasses all known human or natural powers and is ascribed to a supernatural cause;
such an effect or event manifesting or considered as a work of God;
a wonder; marvel.
Only the first of these definitions involves a supernatural act. The second and third definitions allow us to use the word “miracle” to explain any event in history we believe is an act of God, even if through nature (and in fact the third definition even allows the use of the word “miracle” without any reference to God whatsoever). Encourage your children/students to consider this question in its broadest sense using all three definitions of the word “miracle” (there may be an inclination to only relate to supernatural miracles), and to consider events in their personal history as well as national and world history to answer this question.
It was a transformative event where the world finally understood God’s role and presence in history. The world understood that God will protect the weak and defeat those who have more faith in their own physical and military might than in a just God. He will defeat those who build their power on the back of the oppressed and weak. These are the messages of the Exodus story as a whole.

Yitro

In a Nutshell

<b><i>IN A NUTSHELL</i></b><br>The <i>parasha</i> of <i>Yitro</i> contains two main stories. In the first story, Yitro (Moshe’s father-in-law, who is not Jewish) advises him to choose a large team of people to become leaders and advisers for the people, so he won’t get worn out being the sole leader, and so that the people will have less waiting time when they need help. Not only does the Torah show respect to Yitro and his wisdom, the Rabbis even named the <i>parasha</i> after him!
In the second story this week, the children of Israel prepare for three days, and then they receive the Ten Commandments, and the Torah, at Mount Sinai. The Torah contains all the laws on which Jewish society must be based. It is also a covenant between Israel and God. A covenant is an agreement between two people (or groups of people) where promises by both are made.
The people hear the voice of God Himself at Mount Sinai.
<b>QUESTION TO PONDER</b>
<i>What message do you think we can learn from the respect and honour that the Torah shows to Yitro?</i>

I; Particular Paths to a Universal God

<big><strong>I. Particular Paths to a Universal God</strong></big><br><b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>“<i>Barukh Hashem</i>” is the main Jewish expression of thanks and appreciation. It means “Thank God,” or “Praise be to the Lord.”
The words “<i>Barukh Hashem</i>” appear in this <i>parasha</i>. But they are not spoken by a Jewish person. The man who says them is Yitro, a Midianite priest and Moshe’s father-in-law. Yitro returns to Moshe after the Exodus, bringing with him Moshe’s wife and children, and after hearing the story of what happened in Egypt, he says, “Praise be to the Lord (<i>Barukh Hashem</i>), who rescued you from the hand of the Egyptians and of Pharaoh, and who rescued the people from the hand of the Egyptians” (Shemot 18:10).
Three people in the Torah use this expression – and all of them are non-Jews, people outside the Abrahamic covenant. The first is Noaḥ, who says: “Praise be to the Lord, the God of Shem” (Bereshit 9:26). The second is Avraham’s servant (Eliezer) who is sent to find a wife for Yitzḥak: “Praise be to the Lord, the God of my master Avraham, who has not abandoned His kindness and faithfulness to my master” (Bereshit 24:27). The third is Yitro in this <i>parasha</i>.
Is this significant? Why is it that this praise of God is attributed to Noaḥ, Eliezer, and Yitro, whereas the Israelites, apart from their song of thanks after the splitting of the Sea, seem to deliver constant complaints? It may be simply that this is human nature: we tend to focus on what is lacking in our lives, while others see more clearly than we do the blessings we have. We complain, while others wonder what we are complaining about when we have so much to be thankful for. That is one explanation.
It is possible that an even more important point is being made. The Torah is signalling its most subtle and least understood idea: that the God of Israel is the God of all humankind, even though the religion of Israel is not the religion of all humankind. As Rabbi Akiva put it: “Beloved is humanity, for it was created in the image of God. Beloved is Israel, for they are called children of God” (Mishna Avot 3:14).
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. How can the God of Israel also be the God of all humankind?</i>
<i>2. If God is universal (the same for everyone), why do we need different religions to worship Him?</i>
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br><i>Israel is a fractured society. At least it looks that way from the outside. So many divisions. So many communities that seem unwilling to integrate or even acknowledge the other. So much mistrust. But this is a superficial view from an outsider’s perspective. If you know where to look, you can see the truth beyond the surface. In specific places in society, hidden in plain sight, you can see all the people of Israel in their glorious, vulnerable humanity.</i>
<i>One such place is the hospital ward in a children’s hospital in Israel. Especially on the seventh floor. Take a look around you. So many different kinds of people. So different from you. So many different languages contributing to the hubbub. Hebrew, Arabic, Russian, Amharic, French, English. So many different shades of skin colour, sitting right there alongside your own. So many different cultures and religious communities in that waiting room with you. Jews from lands so far away…Morocco, the Ukraine, Yemen, Ethiopia, France, and Britain. Are they really all from the same nation? Maybe they feel that way when they look at the others they share the room with –</i> <i>Muslim Arabs from Haifa, Christian Arabs from Nazareth, Druze Arabs from a village in the Galil, a refugee family from Eritrea.</i>
<i>Sitting there with your child, broken, in need of a miracle, you look into the eyes of the other parents, and the eyes of the other children, and suddenly those languages, and cultures, and religions, melt away. All you see is the same fear, the same pain, the same hope, and the same love. The same as you feel in your heart. All you see is humanity.</i>
<i>And then the miracles arrive. The angels sent directly from God Himself. Wearing their white coats, their surgical masks, with stethoscopes around their necks. Those doctors, nurses, and volunteers, the heroes that offer patients and their families help and hope. Under their white coats, you may not even notice this doctor was born in Russia, and that nurse is an Arab, and this hospital orderly has a different skin colour to yours. Two married women volunteer here regularly and one covers her hair. Both help you in this time of great need. You fail to notice all the distinctions between these people, because these angels work together as a seamless team, and subtly, they remind us that there are some things that are just more important than our differences.</i>
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. What makes us all the same?</i>
<i>2. Do you think the things that make us different are good or bad?</i>
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>We believe that God is universal. He created the universe. He set in motion the processes that led to stars, planets, life, and humanity. His concern is not limited to Israel. As we say in the prayer of <i>Ashrei</i>, “His tender mercies are on all His works.” You do not need to be Jewish to have a sense of reverence for the Creator or recognise, as Yitro did, His hand in miraculous events. It would be hard to find another religious literature that confers such dignity on figures who stand outside its borders.
This is true even beyond the three notable figures who said “<i>Barukh Hashem</i>.” The Torah calls Avraham’s contemporary, Malkitzedek, king of Shalem, a “priest to God Most High.” He, too, blessed God: “Blessed be Avram by God Most High, Creator of heaven and earth. And blessed be God Most High who delivered your enemies into your hand” (Bereshit 14:19–20).
Consider the fact that our own <i>parasha</i>, perhaps the most important of all <i>parashot</i> because it contains both the Ten Commandments and the most significant event in all of Jewish history, the covenant at Sinai, carries the name of a non-Jew. What is more, immediately prior to the revelation at Sinai, the Torah tells us how it was Yitro the Midianite priest who taught Moshe how to delegate and organise the leadership of the people.
These are remarkable expressions of spiritual generosity to those outside the covenant.
Or consider Tishrei, the holiest month of the Jewish year. On the first day of Rosh HaShana, as well as reading about the birth of Yitzḥak, we read of how an angel came to the aid of Hagar and Yishmael. “What is the matter, Hagar? Do not be afraid. God has heard the boy crying as he lies there. Lift the boy up and take him by the hand, for I will make him into a great nation” (Bereshit 21:17–18). Yishmael was not destined to be a carrier of the covenant, yet he was rescued and blessed.
On Yom Kippur, in the afternoon, after we have spent most of the day fasting and making confession, we read the book of Yona, in which we discover that the prophet uttered a mere five Hebrew words (“In forty days Nineveh will be destroyed”) and then the entire population – Assyrians, Israel’s enemies – repented. Tradition takes this as the very model of collective repentance.
On Sukkot we read Zekharya’s prophecy that in days to come, <i>all</i> the nations will come to Jerusalem to celebrate the festival of rain (Zekharya 14:16–19).
These are three stunning examples of universalism. They do not imply that in the fullness of time everyone will convert to Judaism. Rather, that in the fullness of time everyone will recognise the one God, Creator and Sovereign of the universe. That is quite a different thing.
This idea that you can stand outside the faith and still be acknowledged by people within the faith as someone who recognises God is very rare indeed. Far more common is the approach of one truth, one way. Whoever stands outside that way is Godless, unsaved, the infidel, unredeemed, a lower class of humanity.
Why then does Judaism distinguish between the universality of God and the particularity of our relationship with Him? Answer: because this helps us solve the single greatest problem humanity has faced since earliest times. <i>How can I recognise the dignity and integrity of the “other”?</i> History and biology have written into the human mind a capacity for altruism towards the people like us, and aggression towards the people not like us. We are good, they are bad. We are innocent, they are guilty. We have truth, they have lies. We have God on our side, they do not. Many crimes of nation against nation are due to this propensity.
Which is why Tanakh teaches otherwise. Noaḥ, Eliezer, and Yitro were people of God without being members of Israel. Even the people of Nineveh became an example of how to heed a prophet and repent. God blessed Yishmael as well as Yitzḥak. These are powerful lessons.
It is hard to think of a more compelling principle for the twenty-first century. The great problems humanity faces – climate change, economic inequality, cyberwarfare, artificial intelligence – are global, but our most effective political agencies are, at most, national. There is a mismatch between our problems and the available solutions. We need to find a way of combining our universal humanity with our cultural and religious particularity.
That is what the Torah is doing when it tells us that Noaḥ, Eliezer, and Yitro said “<i>Barukh Hashem</i>.” They thanked God, just as we, today, thank God. God is universal. Therefore humanity, created in His image, is universal. But the revelation and covenant at Mount Sinai were particular. They belong to our personal story, <i>not</i> the universal story of humankind.
<b>I believe this ability to be both particular in our identity and universal in our commitment to the human future is one of the most important messages we, as Jews, have to deliver in the twenty-first century. We are different, but we are human. Therefore let us work together to solve the problems that can only be solved if we work together.</b>
<b>QUESTION TO PONDER</b>
<i>What message does Judaism give to the world by having both a distinct identity and a commitment to working towards the human future?</i>
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>Not until chapter 12 [of the book of Bereshit] do Avraham and Sara appear on the scene, and from then on the entire narrative shifts its focus, from humanity as a whole to one man, one woman, and their children. They become an extended family, then a collection of tribes, then a nation, and eventually a kingdom. In some obscure and unmistakable way – this is the Hebrew Bible’s fundamental theme – they were to become the carriers of a universal message. For the God they believed in was not a tribal deity, a God of this people and not that. He is the God of all, Creator of heaven and earth, who, in love, set His image on all humanity.
<b><i>Future Tense</i>, 75</b>
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>What is Judaism’s approach to non-Jews?
If Judaism is divine truth, why isn’t it the religion of all humankind?
How does Judaism teach us to recognise the dignity and integrity of the “other”?
<b>EDUCATIONAL COMPANION TO THE QUESTIONS</b>
<b><i>IN A NUTSHELL</i></b><br>The Torah teaches us to see value in everybody, not only in members of the Jewish people. Judaism does not require or even encourage non-Jews to convert. Judaism is also open to learning from all people, and Moshe learning from Yitro is an example of this. Many talmudic Sages argue that Yitro did convert to Judaism, thereby becoming our first convert at Sinai. Whether he did or not, he was first a Midianite priest, and yet showed honour to God, and is thus honoured by the Torah, teaching us that we must not judge people as lesser because they have a different background, ethnicity, or faith.
<b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>Although different religions and faith groups may have different names for God, and different belief systems that govern their lives, ultimately they all worship the same God. The God of Israel is how the Jewish people relate to God, but nowhere in the Torah can the claim be found that God is only interested in a relationship with the Jewish people. There is one God and He loves all of His creations, and welcomes a relationship with all of humanity.
We are not all the same and so we do not all need to worship God in the same way. Each religion has its own approach to worshipping God. Judaism is the true religion for the Jewish people, but there is a need for other religions, for other people, each bringing something unique to the world.
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br>The basic things that make us human are what we all have in common. In the language of the Torah, we are all created in the image of God. We each have a spark of divinity within us. This gives every human the potential for greatness and holiness. This story also highlights the vulnerability of all human beings. Everyone needs health and love, feels fear and pain, and ultimately has hope in their heart. These things are all more profound than the things that separate and differentiate us. These are what we should focus on to create a unity of humankind.
The things that separate us are a source of beauty and dignity, and should be celebrated. They each bring to the world something unique. This is the “particular” of our identity and community, that we work hard to ensure brings a unique contribution to humanity. Seeing the beauty in every unique community is what Rabbi Sacks terms the “dignity of difference.” It is a challenge to see this. Humans are tribal animals. They create communities based on the things they have in common, and that creates an “us and them” situation, where it becomes a challenge not to demonise or disparage “them.” Our challenge is to value the differences, and to ultimately realise we have more things in common where it really counts.
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>We are all different. This is a good thing. There is dignity in difference. We should all be proud of the things that make us different. However, we are all part of a universal humanity, with one God above us. Judaism urges us to be different and yet the same. The sameness brings us to work together with the rest of humanity to build a better future for all. This dual model helps us solve the single greatest problem humanity has faced since earliest times. How can I recognise the dignity and integrity of the “other”?
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>Judaism has respect for non-Jews and non-Jewish culture. It sees value and dignity in those who are different. It does not demand that those outside of the covenant convert or change their particular identity or ideas to join the covenantal community. Non-Jewish communities can create their own covenants and relationships with God, and join as partners with the Jewish people to work on the universal challenges that humanity faces.
Judaism is a divine truth for the Jewish people, not necessarily for the rest of humanity. There can be other divine truths for other peoples. The opposite of a truth is not necessarily a falsehood. It can be another truth. These multiple approaches to God must be within the theological framework of ethical monotheism. But beyond that they can have significant particular differences. There is not only one path to God for humanity.
Judaism teaches us that distinct identities are not necessarily in conflict with each other, but rather are parallel examples of connections to and covenants with God. Particular communities can join together in their joint humanity to recognise the dignity and integrity of the “other.” The examples in the Torah of the role of non-Jews in the history of the Jewish people, and the respect with which the Torah presents these characters, illustrate these ideas. By noting that Yitro worked with Moshe to set up a system of Jewish leadership, the Torah teaches us that cooperation and mutual respect are key factors.

II; Mount Sinai and the Birth of Freedom

<big><strong>II. Mount Sinai and the Birth of Freedom</strong></big><br><b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>At Mount Sinai, a new kind of nation was being formed, and a new kind of society, too  – one that would be the opposite of Egypt. In Egypt, the few had power and the many were weak and enslaved. This new nation was to be, in Abraham Lincoln’s words in the Gettysburg Address, “a new nation, conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that <i>all men are created equal</i>.” Indeed, without the covenant between the Jewish people and God, enacted at Mount Sinai, Lincoln’s words would have been unimaginable. For nowhere else do we find anything like the politics of Sinai, with its radical vision of a society held together not by power but by the agreement of its citizens. This envisioned society was founded on the decision taken in total freedom by its members, to be bound, individually and collectively, by a moral code and by a covenant with God.
Many historians studying the history of the politics of freedom trace this idea back to Greek philosophers like Plato and Aristotle, and to the Greek city-states (Athens in particular) of the fifth century BCE. But they are mistaken in this. Although the word “democracy” (which literally means “rule by the people” and is the word we use for the political system believed to be most reflective of the politics of freedom) is Greek in origin, the Greek city-states were far from democratic. True democracy was born in Europe and America in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and the philosophers of these times who were thinking and writing about these ideas looked first and foremost to the Hebrew Bible for inspiration. The concept of a free society was born at Mount Sinai.
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. Why can a Jewish society based on Torah values be called a “free society”?</i>
<i>2. Are there any societies found in today’s world that are similar to Egypt as described by Rabbi Sacks?</i>
<i>3. What Torah values are also the foundations of democracy?</i>
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br><i>On July 12, 1997, Malala Yousafzai was born in Mingora, a city in the Swat District of Pakistan. She was born at home because her family couldn’t afford a hospital birth. Malala grew up in awe of her father, an activist who believed the lack of education was the root of all of Pakistan’s problems. She attended a public school founded by her father and developed a thirst for knowledge from an early age. She adored books and decided she wanted to become a doctor. But her father sensed early on that his daughter had a gift for something beyond medicine. He encouraged her to think openly and express her political opinions freely. After he had sent her two younger brothers to bed, he and Malala would stay up discussing politics late into the night.</i>
<i>In 2007, when Malala was only ten years old, her hometown began to change as Taliban militants inched closer. Violence soon spread across the Swat Valley, and girls-only schools faced regular threats. As class attendance fell, Malala refused to give up her right to an education. Her father noticed her passion for standing up against the Taliban’s oppressive campaign and took Malala to Peshawar to speak at the local press club, where she gave an impassioned speech to an audience of newspaper and TV reporters in support of education for girls. Then the BBC came calling, asking her to blog for them anonymously.</i>
<i>By 2009 her experiences had received global attention and she was approached by the</i> New York Times<i> to be featured in a documentary. That same year, the documentary was released and gained international coverage. It was revealed that Malala was the student behind the BBC blog and her profile in Pakistan grew, and in 2011, she was awarded Pakistan’s National Youth Peace Prize. But the Taliban were not happy about Malala’s activism, and began to send death threats. They published warnings in the newspapers and slipped menacing notes under the door of her home.</i>
<i>On October 9, 2012, Malala was riding home from school on a bus with her friends when a masked gunman boarded the bus and demanded to know which girl was Malala. As her friends turned to look at her, he fired three shots. One bullet hit Malala on the left side of her head, travelling down her neck and embedding itself in her shoulder. Malala was airlifted to a military hospital in critical condition. After a five-hour operation, the bullet was removed, but she was far from stable. Her organs were failing, an infection had developed, and she was in an induced coma. Offers to treat Malala poured in from around the world, and she was transferred to Germany and then the United Kingdom for treatment. In January 2013, Malala Yousafzai was finally released from the hospital after having her skull reconstructed and receiving a cochlear implant to restore her hearing.</i>
<i>The shooting changed her life. As the murder attempt spurred worldwide outrage, she dedicated her life to activism on behalf of children and women everywhere. She has shared her ideas at the United Nations and Harvard University, and met with Queen Elizabeth and President Barack Obama. In 2014, at age seventeen, Malala became the youngest person to receive a Nobel Peace Prize. She went on to is study Philosophy, Politics, and Economics at Oxford University. She has her own non-profit Malala Fund, and continues to be a voice for freedom and education in the world today.</i>
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. Do you think education is a basic right of every human being? Why do you think education is sometimes limited in societies that are not free?</i>
<i>2. How is the story of Malala connected to the message of</i> The Core Idea <i>in this</i> Covenant &amp; Conversation<i> essay?</i>
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>Three things about the Jewish people’s experience at Sinai were to prove crucial. <b>The first</b> is that long before Israel entered the land and acquired their own system of government (first by judges, later by kings), they had entered into an overarching covenant with God. That covenant (<i>Brit Sinai</i>) set moral limits to the exercise of power. The code we call Torah established for the first time the primacy of right over might. Any king who behaved contrarily to Torah was acting <i>ultra vires</i> (beyond legitimate authority) and could be challenged. This is the single most important fact about biblical politics.
Democracy on the Greek model always had one fatal weakness. Alexis de Tocqueville and John Stuart Mill called it “the tyranny of the majority.” J. L. Talmon called it “totalitarian democracy.” The rule of the majority contains no guarantee of the rights of minorities. As Lord Acton rightly noted, it was this that led to the downfall of Athens: “There was no law superior to that of the state. The lawgiver was above the law.” In Judaism, by contrast, prophets were mandated to challenge the authority of the king if he acted against the terms of the Torah.
<b>The second</b> key element lies in the prologue to the covenant. God tells Moshe to say to the people, “Now, if you obey Me fully and keep My covenant, you will be My treasured possession, for the whole earth is Mine. You will be for Me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation…’” (Shemot 19:5–6), and the people reply, “We will do everything the Lord has said” (19:8). Until the people had signified their consent, the revelation could not proceed. The principle at stake was that there is no legitimate government without the consent of the governed, even if the governor is Creator of heaven and earth. I know of few more radical ideas anywhere. At the heart of Judaism is the idea – way ahead of its time, and not always fully realised – that the free God desires the free worship of free human beings. God, said the Rabbis, does not act tyrannically with His creatures.
<b>The third</b>, equally ahead of its time, was that the partners to the covenant were to be “all the people” – men, women, and children. This fact is emphasised later on in the Torah in the mitzva of <i>Hak’hel</i>, the septennial covenant-renewal ceremony. The Torah states specifically that the entire people is to be gathered together for this ceremony, “men, women, and children” (Devarim 31:10–13). A thousand years later, when Athens experimented with democracy, only a limited section of society had political rights. Women, children, slaves, and foreigners were excluded. In many respects, this held true until very recently. In Britain, women did not get the vote until 1918. In America, women’s suffrage was complete only in 1920, though some states had enacted it earlier.
According to the Sages, when God was about to give the Torah at Sinai, He told Moshe to consult first with the women and only then with the men. This is the meaning of the verse, “This is what you are to say to the house of Yaakov and tell the people of Israel” (Shemot 19:3). The house of Yaakov, our Sages tell us, refers to the women. The Torah, Israel’s “constitution of liberty,” includes everyone. It is the first moment, by thousands of years, that citizenship is conceived as being universal.
With the revelation at Sinai, something unprecedented entered the human horizon, though it would take centuries, millennia, before its full implications were understood. At Sinai, the politics of freedom was born.
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>[Jewish] destiny was to create a society that would honour the proposition that we are all created in the image and likeness of God. It would be a place in which the freedom of some would not lead to the enslavement of others. It would be the opposite of Egypt, whose bread of affliction and bitter herbs of slavery they were to eat every year on the festival of Passover to remind them of what they were to avoid…. <i>Judaism is the code of a self-governing society</i>…. Because Judaism is also the code of a society, it is also about the social virtues: righteousness (<i>tzedek/tzedaka</i>), justice (<i>mishpat</i>), loving-kindness (<i>ḥesed</i>), and compassion (<i>raḥamim</i>). These structure the template of biblical law, which covers all aspects of the life of society, its economy, its welfare systems, its education, family life, employer-employee relations, the protection of the environment, and so on.
The broad principles driving this elaborate structure, traditionally enumerated as 613 commands, are clear. No one should be left in dire poverty. No one should lack access to justice and the courts. No family should be without its share of the land. One day in seven, everyone should be free. One year in seven, all debts should be cancelled. One year in fifty, all land that had been sold was to revert to its original owners. It was the nearest thing the ancient world had ever seen to an egalitarian society.

How were the founding fathers of America (and other Western countries) influenced by the Torah and the covenant at Sinai?
Where in the Torah can we see the value of universal citizenship, allowing all citizens to vote in a democracy (including women and ethnic and religious minorities)?
<b>EDUCATIONAL COMPANION TO THE QUESTIONS</b>
<b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>The society that the Torah commands us to create in the land of Israel is based on the values of equality and equal dignity and worth of all humans, because all human beings are created in the image of God.
There are still totalitarian societies in existence in various parts of the world, where there is a powerful leader and ruling class while the majority of citizens have no power at all.
That every human is created in the image of God and therefore equal in the eyes of God. That each human being has inalienable rights and dignity, and that we as a society must protect the weak in our society.
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br>Education is a basic human right. Education encourages independent thinking and empowers. In totalitarian societies where there is a ruling authority that has a vested interest in limiting the power of the regular people, they often wish to limit access to education; one such example was the Taliban’s attempts to limit education of girls in Pakistan.
Malala fought to protect the rights of young girls in Pakistan, ensuring they had access to education. Although society there was far from being based on freedom, she fought for the freedom and rights of girls to be educated.
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>This quote describes what a free society based on the values of the Torah would look like. This is the Jewish national mission, instructed to the Israelites at Sinai. The laws and institutions that will ensure freedom and dignity for all members of society, including its weaker members, are described here briefly.
In <i>Future Tense</i>, Rabbi Sacks argues that the only situation where a Jewish society can be created at a national level is in the land of Israel, where “Judaism is the constitution of a self-governing nation, the architectonics of a society dedicated to the service of God in freedom and dignity. Without a land and state, Judaism is a shadow of itself. In exile, God might still live in the hearts of Jews but not in the public square, in the justice of the courts, the morality of the economy, and the humanitarianism of everyday life.”
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>Many religions have an individual moral code, whereby instructions and commandments are given to the individual, making demands on their own lives and behaviour. Few religions have a national moral code whereby the legal system extends to a societal level. The Torah and Judaism is one such religion.
The values upon which the American constitution aimed to create, in the words of Lincoln, “a new nation, conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal” were inspired by those contained in the Torah. All humans created in the image of God must therefore be equal and have equal rights and dignity. The many laws protecting the weak in society, and the fact that the covenant between God and His people was a free one that necessitated a commitment out of choice, were all ideas contained in the Torah that inspired the founding fathers.
While many Western societies had still not extended voting rights and full citizenship to women and minorities until well into the twentieth century, the idea of universal citizenship and rights of all members of society is contained in the covenant at Sinai. This is based on the idea that all people are created in the image of God, and is implied in the mitzva of <i>Hak’hel</i> (Devarim 31:10–13), where all the women were also assembled to accept the covenant at Sinai.

Mishpatim

In a Nutshell

<b><i>IN A NUTSHELL</i></b><br>In the previous <i>parasha,</i> Hashem gave the children of Israel the Torah at Mount Sinai. This included the Ten Commandments. In this <i>parasha</i> we read more about the details of many of the laws and mitzvot.
This <i>parasha</i> mainly focuses on the laws of how the Israelites should live after they enter the land of Israel and create a society there. These kind of mitzvot are called <i>civil laws</i>. Here are some examples of the kind of mitzvot we learn in <i>Mishpatim</i>: we have laws about slaves and when they must be freed; laws about what happens if someone damages your property or hurts you; laws of social responsibility, justice, and compassion – how we must treat each other every day; and also some laws about Shabbat and the festivals.
At the end of the <i>parasha</i>, the covenant of the Torah (which is like a contract between God and the Jewish people) is “signed” in a symbolic ceremony with sacrifices. The people agree to their part of the covenant with the words, “We will do and we will hear.” Moshe then climbs to the top of Mount Sinai, to sit with God for forty days and forty nights.
<b>QUESTION TO PONDER</b>
<i>What is the difference between “We will do” and “We will hear”? Why did the people need to make both these promises?</i>

I; We Will Do and We Will Hear

<big><strong>I. We Will Do and We Will Hear</strong></big><br><b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>The two words we read towards the end of our <i>parasha</i> – “<i>naase venishma</i>,” “We will do and we will hear” – are among the most famous words in the Torah. They are what our ancestors said when they accepted the covenant at Sinai. They are the opposite in spirit to the many other stories of the people’s complaints, sins, and rebellions during the wilderness years.
Let us examine what the words <i>naase venishma</i> actually mean. <i>Naase</i> is straightforward. It means “We will do.” It is about action, behaviour, deed. But <i>nishma</i> is not so clear. It could mean “We will hear.” But it could also mean “We will obey.” Or it could mean “We will understand.” These multiple options suggest that there is more than one way to decode the phrase “<i>naase venishma</i>.” The Rabbis offered these interpretations:
1. The view of the Talmud (Shabbat 88a) and Rashi is that it means “We will do and <i>then</i> we will hear.” This suggests that the people accepted the covenant even before they heard what was in it. They said “We will do” before they knew what it was that God wanted them to do, which showed their total faith in God.
2. Rashbam suggests it means “We will do [what we have already been commanded until now] and we will obey [all future commands].” The Israelites’ statement looked both back and forwards. The people understood that they were on a spiritual as well as a physical journey and they might not know all the details of the law at once. <i>Nishma</i> here means not “to hear” but to hearken, to obey, to respond faithfully in deed.
3. “We will obediently do” (Sforno). On this view, the words <i>naase</i> and <i>nishma</i> are a hendiadys, that is, a single idea expressed by two words. The Israelites were saying that they would do what God asked of them, not because they were looking to benefit but simply because they wanted to do His will. He had saved them from slavery, led and fed them through the wilderness, and they wanted to show their complete loyalty to Him as their redeemer and lawgiver.
4. “We will do and we will understand” (Isaac Arama in <i>Akeidat Yitzḥak</i>). The word <i>nishma</i> can have the sense of “understanding.” According to this explanation, when the Israelites put “doing” before “understanding,” they were giving expression to a profound philosophical truth. There are certain things we can only understand by doing. We only understand leadership by leading. We only understand music by listening. Reading books about these things is not enough. So it is with faith. We can only truly understand Judaism through living by its commands. You cannot comprehend a faith from the outside. Doing leads to understanding.
Staying with this interpretation, we may be able to hear another important idea here. If you look carefully at the book of Shemot, chapters 19 and 24, you will see that the Israelites accepted the covenant three times. But the three verses in which these acceptances took place are significantly different:
1. The people all <i>responded together</i>, “We will do (<i>Naase</i>) everything the Lord has said” (Shemot 19:8).
2. When Moshe went and told the people all the Lord’s words and laws, they <i>responded with one voice</i>, “Everything the Lord has said we will do (<i>naase</i>)” (Shemot 24:3).
3. Then [Moshe] took the Book of the Covenant and read it to the people. They responded, “We will do and hear (<i>naase</i> <i>venishma</i>) everything the Lord has said” (Shemot 24:7).
Only the third of these contains the entire phrase “<i>naase</i> <i>venishma</i>.” And only the third has no<i> statement about the people’s unanimity</i>. Notice how the first two emphasise that the people were as one: the people “responded together” and “responded with one voice.”
This suggests that when it comes to action (<i>naase</i>), we must be united. However, there can be more than one path to understanding our faith (<i>nishma</i>).
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. How can the Jewish people be united in action?</i>
<i>2. Can you think of examples of different paths to faith within Judaism?</i>
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br><i>The first Satmar Rebbe, Rav Yoel Teitelbaum, was known to be a fierce opponent of the Zionist movement. Central to his philosophy of Judaism was the opinion that the Jewish people are forbidden from creating a Jewish state in the land of Israel until Mashiaḥ comes. He was also known as a tremendous philanthropist, giving money to any Jew in need whom he met, without asking any questions, his willingness to help coming from a deep sense of love and kindness.</i>
<i>Once, a desperate Jew who was an outspoken supporter of Zionism came to visit him. He had recently found out his child was in need of an emergency life-saving operation that would cost a large amount of money, more than he could ever afford. He had been told the only person who would give him that much money on such short notice was the Satmar Rebbe. He had deep misgivings, and did not have high hopes. After all, he was from an entirely different world to that of the Satmar Rebbe. Why would the Rebbe give him</i> tzedaka<i>, when he was a Zionist Jew who stood for everything the Rebbe opposed?! But the man was so desperate to save the life of his child he was willing to try anything, and went to meet the Rebbe.</i>
<i>As he entered the Satmar yeshiva, he felt a silence fall and saw all eyes turn to look at him. He approached the Rebbe, and quietly began to talk about his child’s medical needs and their desperate situation. Before he had even finished his story, the Rebbe instructed his attendant to give the man the money he needed. In amazement, the man left the yeshiva with tears rolling down his face.</i>
<i>After the man had left, one of the Hasidim asked the Rebbe: “How can you support that man when he is a Zionist?!” The Rebbe turned to him with fire in his eyes, and replied, “We fight with opinions and philosophies. We don’t fight with Jews!”</i>
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. How does this story illustrate the idea of the many individual paths to faith (</i>nishma<i>)?</i>
<i>2. How does this story illustrate the idea of unity from action (</i>naase<i>)?</i>
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>At the level of <i>naase</i>, the Jewish deed, we are one. To be sure, there are differences. In every generation there are disagreements between leading <i>posekim</i>, halakhic authorities. That is true in every legal system. Poor is the Supreme Court that leaves no space for dissenting opinions. Ashkenazim and Sephardim differ too. Yet these differences are insignificant in comparison with the agreed fundamentals of halakha.
This is what has historically united the Jewish people. Judaism is a legal system. It is a code of behaviour. It is a community of deed. That is where we require consensus. Hence, when it came to doing – <i>naase</i> – the Israelites spoke “together” and “with one voice.” Despite the differences between Hillel and Shammai, Abaye and Rava, Rambam and Rosh, Rabbi Yosef Karo and Rabbi Moshe Isserles, we are bound together by the choreography of the Jewish deed.
At the level of <i>nishma</i>, understanding, however, we are not called on to be one. Judaism has had its rationalists and its mystics, its philosophers and poets, scholars whose minds were firmly fixed on earth and saints whose souls soared to heaven. The Rabbis famously said that at Sinai, every person received the revelation in their own way: “<i>‘And all the people saw’</i> (see Shemot 20:15) – they saw the sounds of sounds and the flames of flames. How many sounds were there and how many flames were there? Each heard according to their own level of understanding what they were experiencing” (<i>Mekhilta</i> 20:15b).
What unites Jews – what <i>should</i> unite us – is action, not reflection. We do the same deeds but we may understand them differently. There can be agreement on the <i>naase</i> but not the <i>nishma</i>. That is what Rambam meant when he wrote in his <i>Commentary to the Mishna</i> that “when there is a disagreement between the Sages and it does not concern an action, but only the establishment of an opinion (<i>sevara</i>), it is not appropriate to make a halakhic ruling in favour of one side.”
This does not mean that Judaism lacks strong beliefs. It has very important tenets. The simplest formulation consists of three fundamental beliefs: in creation, revelation, and redemption. Rambam’s Thirteen Principles elaborate this basic structure. These three beliefs also form the pattern of Jewish prayer.
Creation means seeing the universe as God’s work. Revelation means seeing Torah as God’s word. Redemption means seeing history as God’s deed and God’s call. But within these broad parameters, we must each find our own understanding, guided by the sages of the past, instructed by our teachers in the present, and finding our own route to the Divine Presence.
Heresy-hunting is not our happiest activity. One terrible episode of Jewish history is the treatment of Rambam, who was accused of heresy during his lifetime, and after his death many of his books were confiscated and burned. These were shameful events.
Judaism is a matter of creed as well as deed. But we should allow people great leeway in how they understand the faith of our ancestors. “We will do and we will understand” means: We will do in the same way; we will understand in our own way.
<b>I believe that action unites us, leaving us space to find our own way to faith.</b>
<b>QUESTION TO PONDER</b>
<i>Do you think the Jewish people are united in action? Do we allow space for others in our communities to find their own ways to faith?</i>
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>Different groups evolved widely different responses to modernity. Orthodoxy, then, is diverse.... It embraces a wide variety of different constructions. To what might we compare it? Perhaps the best analogy is language. A language is determined by rules of syntax and semantics. But within that language an infinite number of sentences can be uttered or books written. Within it, too, there can be regional accents and dialects. Orthodoxy is determined by beliefs and commandments. These are its rules of syntax and semantics. But within that framework lies an open-ended multiplicity of cognitive, emotional, spiritual, and cultural styles.
<b><i>One People?</i> 92–93</b>
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>What do you think “<i>Naase venishma</i>” means?
What is it about the word <i>nishma</i> that suggests different philosophical approaches to faith?
What are the basic faith statements we must believe in, and where is there room to take an individual approach?
<b>EDUCATIONAL COMPANION TO THE QUESTIONS</b>
<b><i>IN A NUTSHELL</i></b><br>The basic understanding of these words (before delving into a deeper level of understanding, explored in the rest of the <i>Covenant &amp; Conversation</i> essay) is that <i>naase</i> means we will do everything God asks of us, and we agree to this before we even hear the details of the laws in the Torah – <i>nishma</i>. By making these promises as a group, rather than saying “We’ll read the laws first and only then agree to them if we like them,” they were showing their <i>emuna</i>, their faith in God. Normally we are taught to read a contract carefully before signing it. To make a legal agreement, you must fully trust the person who drew up the contract, and trust yourself to be able to meet all the conditions. The people stood at Mount Sinai and made a declaration of faith.
<b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>Being united in action means Judaism has normative practices – whether halakhic, or ethical behaviour based on the values of Judaism. In these modern times, when not all Jews agree on or are united in these normative behavioural aspects of Judaism, there is an additional message to be learned. There are issues that can and must unite us. Issues that face all Jews and on which all Jews can agree on the importance of action, such as antisemitism or poverty and suffering.
Different paths towards faith in Judaism are the differences in the way we are Jewish. For some Jews, the mystical spirituality of <i>Ḥasidut</i> speaks to them, while others may be more comfortable with a more intellectual approach. For some Jews, Zionism is core to their Jewish identity, and for others it poses a religious challenge. We do not need to come to a consensus in these approaches to Judaism, and can still be a unified people without consensus.
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br>“Individual paths to faith” (<i>nishma</i>) illustrated in this story are the Zionist position of the Jew who came to ask for <i>tzedaka</i> from the Satmar Rebbe, and Satmar’s philosophical position on Zionism, which is that it is against their Torah outlook.
The “unity from action” (<i>naase</i>) modelled in the story is the mitzva of <i>tzedaka</i>. This action is something deeply valued by all Jews.
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>The reality of Jewish society today is that we do not have a normative consensus on action. Not all Jews are committed to halakha, and not all Jews who are committed to halakha can agree on the boundaries of halakha and how the halakha should be developed, applied, and implemented. However, the things that bring us together are truly greater than those which separate us. We can and must focus on these things, and join forces in acting on the issues that are really important. This is what will keep us united as a people. There are many ways to be a Jew today, and we do not always manage to allow space for each other. If we focus on the unity of action, it may help us find space for Jews who live their Judaism in a different way to us.
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>Take a look at the different approaches presented in this <i>Covenant &amp; Conversation</i> essay and decide which speaks to you the most. Rabbi Sacks explores and expands upon the opinion of Rabbi Isaac Arama, but that is not to say that it is a more legitimate interpretation than the others presented here.
<i>Nishma</i> means “We will hear.” When one listens to something, there is no guarantee you will hear this the same way others will. Two people can listen to a piece of music and get completely different things from it. This suggests that there is space for interpretation here in the way we understand the Torah, allowing for different approaches and philosophies.
Rambam authored the Thirteen Principles of Faith (<i>Ani Maamin</i>). Rabbi Sacks, based on the thought and writing of Rabbi Shimon ben Zemaḥ Duran, Yosef Albo, and Franz Rosenzweig, consolidated these ideas into three fundamental beliefs: in creation, revelation, and redemption. (See Rabbi Sacks’s <i>Introduction to the Koren Siddur</i> for more on this.) He writes that within the broad parameters of faith and practice of halakha, “we must each find our own understanding, guided by the sages of the past, instructed by our teachers in the present, and finding our own route to the Divine Presence.”

II; Loving the Stranger

<big><strong>II. Loving the Stranger</strong></big><br><b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br><i>Mishpatim</i> contains many laws of social justice – against taking advantage of a widow or orphan, for example, or charging interest on a loan, against bribery and injustice, and so on. The first and last of these laws, however, is the repeated command against harming a <i>ger</i>, a “stranger.”
<i>“Do not ill-treat a stranger or oppress him, for you were strangers in Egypt”</i> (Shemot 22:20).
<i>“Do not oppress a stranger; you yourselves know how it feels to be a stranger [literally, ‘you know the soul of a stranger’], because you were strangers in Egypt”</i> (Shemot 23:9).
Clearly something fundamental is at stake in the Torah’s vision of a just and gracious social order.
What is the logic of this command? The most profound commentary is that given by Ramban. According to Ramban, the command has two dimensions. The first is the relative powerlessness of the stranger. He or she is not surrounded by family, friends, neighbours, a community of those ready to come to their defence. Therefore, the Torah warns against wronging them; God has made Himself protector of those who have no one else to protect them. This is the political dimension of the command.
The second reason is the psychological vulnerability of the stranger. The stranger is one who lives outside the normal securities of home and belonging. He or she is, or feels, alone – and throughout the Torah, God is especially sensitive to the sigh of the oppressed, the feelings of the rejected, the cry of the unheard. That is the emotional dimension of the command.
Rabbi Ḥayim ibn Attar (<i>Or HaḤayim</i>) adds a further fascinating insight. It may be, he says, that as children of the covenant, Jews look down on those who are not Jewish. Therefore they are commanded not to feel superior to the <i>ger</i>, but instead to remember the degradation their ancestors experienced in Egypt. It is, he says, a command concerning humility in the face of strangers.
Whichever way we look at it, there is something powerful about the Torah’s concern for the stranger – together with the historical reminder that “you yourselves were slaves in Egypt.” The Torah seems to imply that these laws are important in defining what it means to be a Jew.
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. Why do we need to be reminded that we were strangers in Egypt? Surely not ill-treating the stranger is the right thing to do anyway?</i>
<i>2. Which of the three reasons mentioned behind the command do you find most convincing? (a) The stranger is weak in society and needs protecting; (b) the stranger is emotionally vulnerable; or (c) the command is a warning against arrogance.</i>
<i>3. What do you think is the connection between these laws and what it means to be a Jew?</i>
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br><i>In 1966, an eleven-year-old black boy moved with his parents and family to a white neighbourhood in Washington, DC. Sitting with his two brothers and two sisters on the front steps of the house, he waited to see how they would be greeted. They were not. Passers-by turned to look at them, but no one gave them a smile or even a glance of recognition. All the fearful stories he had heard about how whites treated blacks seemed to be coming true. Years later, writing about those first days in their new home, he says, “I knew we were not welcome here. I knew we would not be liked here. I knew we would have no friends here. I knew we should not have moved here….”</i>
<i>As he was thinking those thoughts, a white woman coming home from work passed by on the other side of the road. She turned to the children and with a broad smile said, “Welcome!” Disappearing into the house, she emerged minutes later with a tray laden with drinks and sandwiches which she brought over to the children, making them feel at home. That moment – the young man later wrote – changed his life. It gave him a sense of belonging where there was none before. It made him realise, at a time when race relations in the United States were still fraught, that a black family could feel at home in a white area and that there could be relationships that were colour-blind. Over the years, he learned to admire much about the woman across the street, but it was that first spontaneous act of greeting that became, for him, a definitive memory. It broke down a wall of separation and turned strangers into friends.</i>
<i>The young man, Stephen Carter, is now a law professor at Yale, and he eventually wrote a book about what he learned that day. He called it</i> Civility<i>. The name of the woman, he tells us, was Sara Kestenbaum, and she died all too young. He adds that it was no coincidence that she was a religious Jew. “In the Jewish tradition,” he notes, “such civility is called ḥesed – the doing of acts of kindness – which is in turn derived from the understanding that human beings are made in the image of God.” He adds, “Civility itself may be seen as part of ḥesed: it does indeed require kindnesses toward our fellow citizens, including the ones who are strangers, and even when it is hard.”</i>
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. What is the connection between this story and</i> The Core Idea?
<i>2. What lessons do you think can we learn from this story?</i>
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>Hatred of the foreigner is the oldest of passions, going back to tribalism and the prehistory of civilisation. The Greeks called strangers “barbarians” because of their (as it seemed to them) outlandish speech that sounded like the bleating of sheep. The Romans were equally dismissive of non-Hellenistic races. The pages of history are stained with blood spilled in the name of racial or ethnic conflict. It was precisely this to which the Enlightenment, the new “age of reason,” promised an end. It did not happen. In 1789, in revolutionary France, as the Rights of Man were being pronounced, riots broke out against the Jewish community in Alsace. Hatred against English and German immigrant workers persisted throughout the nineteenth century. In 1881 in Marseilles, a crowd of ten thousand went on a rampage, attacking Italians and their property. Dislike of the unlike is as old as mankind.
This fact lies at the very heart of the Jewish experience. It is no coincidence that Judaism was born in two journeys <i>away</i> from the two greatest civilisations of the ancient world: Avraham’s from Mesopotamia, Moshe and the Israelites’ from Pharaonic Egypt. The Torah is the world’s great protest against empires and imperialism. There are many dimensions to this protest. One dimension is the protest against the attempt to justify social hierarchy and the absolute power of rulers in the name of religion. Another is the subordination of the masses to the state – epitomised by the vast building projects, first of Bavel, then of Egypt, and the enslavement they entailed. A third is the brutality of nations in the course of war (the subject of Amos’s oracles against the nations). Undoubtedly, though, the most serious offence – for the prophets as well as the Mosaic books – was the use of power against the powerless: the widow, the orphan and, above all, the stranger.
To be a Jew is to be a stranger. It is hard to avoid the conclusion that this was why Avraham was commanded to leave his land, home, and father’s house; why, long before Yosef was born, Avraham was already told that his descendants would be strangers in a land not their own; why Moshe had to suffer personal exile before assuming leadership of the people; why the Israelites underwent persecution before inheriting their own land; and why the Torah is so insistent that this experience – the retelling of the story on Passover, along with the never-forgotten taste of the bread of affliction and the bitter herbs of slavery – should become a permanent part of their collective memory.
Enlightenment thought was marked by two great attempts to ground ethics in something other than tradition. One belonged to the Scottish enlightenment – David Hume and Adam Smith – who sought it in emotion: the natural sympathy of human beings for one another. The other was constructed by Immanuel Kant on the basis of reason. It was illogical to prescribe one ethical rule for some people and another for others. Reason is universal, argued Kant; therefore an ethic of reason would provide for universal respect (“Treat each person as an end in himself”).
Neither succeeded. In the twentieth century, villages and townships where Jews had lived for almost a thousand years witnessed their mass murder or deportation to the extermination camps with little or no protest. Neither Humean emotion nor Kantian reason were strong enough to inoculate Europe against genocide. Centuries of religiously inspired hate came together with pseudo-scientific theories of race and social Darwinism (“the survival of the fittest” as Herbert Spencer put it) to relegate whole populations – above all, the Jews – to the category of the sub-human.
It is terrifying in retrospect to grasp how seriously the Torah took the phenomenon of xenophobia, hatred of the stranger. It is as if the Torah were saying with the utmost clarity: Reason is insufficient. Sympathy is inadequate. Only the force of history and memory is strong enough to form a counterweight to hate.
The Torah asks, why should you not hate the stranger? Because you once stood where he stands now. You know the heart of the stranger because you were once a stranger in the land of Egypt. If you are human, so is he. If he is less than human, so are you. You must fight the hatred in your heart as I, God, once fought the greatest ruler and the strongest empire in the ancient world on your behalf. I made you into the world’s archetypal strangers so that you would fight for the rights of strangers – for your own and those of others, wherever they are, whoever they are, whatever the colour of their skin or the nature of their culture, because though they are not in your image, says God, they are nonetheless in Mine.
There is only one reply strong enough to answer the question: Why should I not hate the stranger? Because the stranger is me.
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>Nowhere is the singularity of biblical ethics more evident than in its treatment of the issue that has proved to be the most difficult in the history of human interaction, namely <i>the problem of the stranger</i>, the one who is not like us. Most societies at most times have been suspicious of, and aggressive towards, strangers. That is understandable, even natural. Strangers are non-kin. They come from beyond the tribe. They stand outside the network of reciprocity that creates and sustains communities. That is what makes the Mosaic books unusual in the history of moral thought. As the Rabbis noted, the Hebrew Bible in one verse commands, “You shall love your neighbour as yourself,” but in no fewer than thirty-six places commands us to “love the stranger.”

<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>What is the message behind the two great Jewish journeys in the Torah?
What do you think Rabbi Sacks means by the statement “to be a Jew is to be a stranger”?
What is the link between these commandments and the core identity of being a Jew?
<b>EDUCATIONAL COMPANION TO THE QUESTIONS</b>
<b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>Clearly, it is correct ethical behaviour to protect the stranger. However, sometimes “the right thing” based on morality alone is not enough for us to remember how to behave. So the Torah gives us an even more powerful reason – an emotional reason, because with just a little chipping away at the surface, we remember as a nation what it feels like emotionally to be a stranger (both in ancient and more recent times).
All three reasons are convincing. It is interesting to reflect on the fact that both of Ramban’s reasons (a) and (b) focus on the stranger rather than that of <i>Or HaḤayim</i> (c), which focuses on our own moral development.
Perhaps the Torah is intimating here that this is the reason Jewish history began with the experience of enslavement in Egypt (and perhaps this also explains the theme of exile and persecution in Jewish history as a whole) – to create a national memory that will help the Jewish people to be ethical in their treatment of the weak or “the other” in society.
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br>Sara Kestenbaum personified the very Jewish trait of <i>ḥesed</i>, and Stephen Carter describes her example of showing concern for the stranger as intrinsically Jewish behaviour.
Apart from the message of the importance of looking after the stranger, there are many other lessons to be taken from this story, such as how a small act can have a big impact, and a ripple effect (who knows how many people have been affected by Stephen Carter and his career, which was clearly impacted by Sara Kestenbaum and her small act).
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>It is only natural to be suspicious of those who are not within our own network and community, which is normally based on kin, ethnicity, or belief. Man is a tribal creature, forming communities of reciprocity and mutual interest, and it is natural to perceive those on the outside of these groups as a threat.
The Torah is asking us to rise above these natural inclinations and suggests that Jewish history encourages us to do exactly that. The Torah demands that we live our lives according to these values and build a society based on them, in order to model these values as part of the Jewish national mission.
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>Both the journey of Avraham and that of the Israelites at the time of the Exodus were movements away from the world powers of the time. They are protests against imperialist powers that were founded on the oppression of the stranger in society.
The experience of the Jew throughout history has been to be the outsider in society. From our very beginnings in Egypt as an oppressed minority, to a small nation-state surrounded by world powers in biblical times, to a dispersed and wandering people, living the experience of being the stranger in society has been the Jewish way for two thousand years. Judaism as a system of thought also experiences this when it is so often counter-cultural, presenting a philosophical system and ethics which frequently finds itself at odds with the mainstream culture of the time.
The core identity of the Jew is one based on the historical experience of being the stranger in society and the value system of the Torah that is based on the notion that all humans are created in the image of God, and therefore deserve to be treated equally, with respect and dignity. The Jewish national mission is to model these values, ultimately by building a society that reflects them.

Terumah

In a Nutshell

<b><i>IN A NUTSHELL</i></b><br>The Torah’s explanation of the design and building of the <i>Mishkan</i> (the portable Temple) is the longest passage in the whole book of Shemot. It begins in <i>Teruma</i> and continues all the way through to the end of Shemot (only taking a short break to tell the story of the Golden Calf).
The Israelites used their own money to build the <i>Mishkan</i>, and it became the central place to worship God and a way to see and feel God’s presence among the people. The Torah’s description of the building of the <i>Mishkan</i> is long and detailed to teach us how important it was for the Israelites to put all their effort and care into building it.
The sections of the <i>Mishkan</i> discussed in this <i>parasha</i> include the ark for the tablets of stone, the ark’s cover, the table for the showbread, the Menora, the covers and walls of the whole <i>Mishkan</i>, the partition, and the altar.
<b>QUESTION TO PONDER</b>
<i>Why do you think it was important that the Israelites paid for the building of the</i> Mishkan<i> themselves?</i>

I; What Do We Receive When We Give?

<big><strong>I. What Do We Receive When We Give?</strong></big><br><b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>Our <i>parasha</i> begins with these words<i>:</i> The Lord spoke to Moshe, saying, “<i>Tell the Israelites to take an offering for Me; take My offering from all whose heart moves them to give</i>” (Shemot 25:1–2). This instruction marks a turning point in the relationship between the Israelites and God. The first new concept introduced here is the <i>Mishkan</i> (the travelling home for the Divine Presence as the people journeyed through the wilderness). But more than that, we are also introduced to a new value, summed up in the word that gives our <i>parasha</i> its name, <i>Teruma</i>, meaning a gift, a contribution, an offering. The <i>parasha</i> is telling us something very important. The act of giving gives us dignity. Receiving does not.
Until that moment, the Israelites had been receivers. Virtually everything they had experienced had been given to them by God. He had freed them from slavery, taken them out from Egypt, led them through the desert, and created a path for them through the sea. When they were hungry, He gave them food. When they were thirsty, He gave them water. Apart from the battle against the Amalekites (where they themselves fought bravely), they had done almost nothing for themselves.
The Israelites had become dependent, expectant, irresponsible, and immature. The Torah records their repeated complaints. Reading them, we feel that they were an ungrateful, difficult, sulky people.
But being dependent on God up until this point was necessary. They couldn’t have crossed the sea by themselves. They couldn’t have found food or water in the wilderness. Complaining produced results, and so an unhealthy pattern developed. The people complained to Moshe. Moshe turned to God. God performed a miracle. The result was that, from the people’s perspective, complaining worked. Now, however, it was time for a change. God was giving them something else entirely. It had nothing to do with their physical needs and everything to do with psychological, moral, and spiritual needs. <i>God gave them the opportunity to be givers</i>.

<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br><i>Every Friday morning before dawn, the Rebbe of Nemirov would disappear. He could not be found in any of the town’s synagogues, or houses of study, or at home. One winter, a Lithuanian scholar came to Nemirov. Puzzled by the Rebbe’s weekly disappearance he asked the Rebbe’s students, “Where is he?”</i>
<i>“Where is the Rebbe?” they responded. “Where else but in heaven? The people of the town need peace, income, health. The Rebbe is a holy man and therefore he is surely in heaven, pleading our cause.” The Lithuanian, amused by how gullible the townspeople were, decided to find out for himself where the Rebbe disappeared to each week. One Thursday night he hid in the Rebbe’s house. He heard the Rebbe weep and sigh. Then he saw him take out a parcel of clothes and begin to put them on. They were the clothes of a peasant labourer. The Rebbe then reached into a drawer, pulled out an axe, and went out into the still, dark night. Cautiously, keeping out of sight, the Lithuanian followed him all the way through the town and beyond, into the forest. By dawn, the Rebbe was busy chopping down a tree, hewing it into logs, and splitting it into firewood. Then he gathered the wood into a bundle and walked back into the town.</i>
<i>He stopped outside a run-down cottage and knocked on the door. An elderly woman, poor and weak, opened the door. “Who are you?” she asked. “My name is Vassily,” the Rebbe replied. “I have wood to sell, very cheap, next to nothing.” “I have no money,” replied the woman. “You can pay me later,” he said. “I trust you – and do you not trust God? He will find a way of seeing that I am repaid.” The woman was still troubled. She asked, “But who will light the fire? I am too ill.” “I will light the fire,” the Rebbe replied, and he did so, while reciting under his breath the morning prayers. Then he returned home.</i>
<i>The Lithuanian scholar, seeing this, stayed on in the town and became one of the Rebbe’s disciples. From that day, when the people of the town said that the Rebbe had ascended to heaven, he no longer laughed, but instead added: “And maybe even higher.”</i>
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. What mitzva did the Rebbe perform in this story?</i>

<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>One of my early memories, still blazing through the mists of forgotten time, goes back to when I was a child of perhaps six or seven years old. I was blessed to have very caring parents. Life had not given them many chances, and they were determined that we, their four sons, should have some of the opportunities they were denied. My late father, of blessed memory, took immense pride in me, his firstborn son.
It seemed to me very important to show him my gratitude. But what could I possibly give him? Whatever I had, I had received from my mother and him. It was a completely asymmetrical relationship.
Eventually, in some shop I found a plastic model of a silver trophy. Underneath it was a plaque that read, “To the best father in the world.” Today, all these years later, I realise that the plastic trophy was cheap, banal, almost comically absurd. What was unforgettable, though, was what he did after I had given it to him. He placed it on his bedside table, where it remained – humble, trite – for all the years that I was living at home.
My father allowed me to give him something, and then showed that the gift mattered to him. His actions gave me dignity. He let me see that I could give even to someone who had given me all I had.
There is a seemingly strange Jewish law that embodies this idea. As Rambam explains, “Even a poor person who is dependent on <i>tzedaka</i> is obligated to give <i>tzedaka</i> to another person.” On the face of it, this makes no sense at all. Why should a person who depends on charity be obligated to give charity? The principle of <i>tzedaka</i> is surely that one who has more than they need should give to one who has less than they need. By definition, someone who is dependent on <i>tzedaka</i> does not have more than they need.
The truth is, however, that <i>tzedaka</i> is not only directed to people’s physical needs but also their psychological situation. To need and receive <i>tzedaka</i> is, according to one of Judaism’s most profound insights, inherently humiliating. As we say in <i>Birkat HaMazon</i>, “Please, O Lord our God, do not make us dependent on the gifts or loans of other people, but only on Your full, open, holy, and generous hand so that we may suffer neither shame nor humiliation for ever and for all time.”
Many of the laws of <i>tzedaka</i> reflect this fact. For instance, we are taught that it is preferable that the giver does not know to whom they give, and the recipient does not know from whom they receive. According to a famous ruling of Rambam, the highest of all levels of <i>tzedaka</i> is “to fortify a fellow Jew and give them a gift, a loan, form with them a partnership, or find work for them, until they are strong enough so that they do not need to ask others [for sustenance].” This is not charity at all in the conventional sense. It is finding someone employment or helping them start a business. Why then should it be the highest form of <i>tzedaka</i>? Because it is giving someone back their dignity.
Someone who is dependent on <i>tzedaka</i> has physical needs, and these must be met by other people or by the community as a whole. But they also have psychological needs. That is why Jewish law rules that they must give to others. Giving confers dignity, and no one should be deprived of it. Everyone deserves dignity and self-respect.
The entire account of the construction of the <i>Mishkan</i>, the Sanctuary, is very strange indeed. King Shlomo said in his address at the dedication of the Temple in Jerusalem, “But will God really dwell on earth? Even the heavens to their uttermost reaches cannot contain You, how much less this House that I have built!” (I Melakhim 8:27). If that applied to the Temple in all its glory, how much more so of the <i>Mishkan</i>, a tiny, portable shrine made of beams and hangings that could be dismantled every time the people journeyed and reassembled every time they encamped. How could that possibly be a home for the God who created the universe, brought empires to their knees, performed miracles and wonders, and whose presence was almost unbearable in its intensity?
Yet, in its small but human way, I think what my father did when he put my cheap plastic gift by his bedside all those years ago was perhaps the most generous thing he did for me. And <i>lehavdil</i>, please forgive the comparison, this is also what God did for us when He allowed the Israelites to present Him with offerings, and then use them to make a kind of home for the Divine Presence. It was an act of immense if paradoxical generosity.
This tells us something very profound about Judaism. <i>God wants us to have dignity</i>. We are not tainted by original sin. We are not incapable of good without divine grace. Faith is not mere submission. We are God’s image, His children, His ambassadors, His partners, His emissaries. He wants us not merely to receive but also to give. And He is willing to live in the home we build for Him, however humble, however small.
This is hinted at in the word that gives our <i>parasha</i> its name: <i>Teruma</i> is usually translated as an offering, a contribution. It really means something we lift. The paradox of giving is that when we lift something to give to another, it is we ourselves who are lifted.
<b>I believe that what elevates us in life is not what we receive but what we give. The more of ourselves that we give, the greater we become.</b>
<b>QUESTION TO PONDER</b>
<i>How can you implement this ideal into your life?</i>
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>To give and not receive, to act rather than be acted on, to be free and not dependent on other human beings, to be dependent on God alone: these are what give Judaism its distinctive tone of voice. That is what makes <i>tzedaka</i> something other than charity. It is not merely helping those in need. It is enabling the afflicted, where possible, to recover their capacity for independent action. Responsibility lies at the heart of human dignity.

Why does the halakha say that even a poor person must give <i>tzedaka</i>?
What are the physical and psychological benefits to the mitzva of giving <i>tzedaka</i>?
<b>EDUCATIONAL COMPANION TO THE QUESTIONS</b>
<b><i>IN A NUTSHELL</i></b><br>Once the Israelites were financially invested in the <i>Mishkan</i>, they were emotionally and spiritually invested in it also. The people felt responsibility for both the physical structure and the material objects used therein, and ultimately they also cared deeply about the rituals and ceremonies performed there. Up until that point, the Israelites had been completely dependent on God in every way. This was their first opportunity to become equal partners with God and to begin the process of ending their slave mentality in preparation for life in their own land as an independent people.
<b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>When everything is provided for you, there is a danger you may lose any sense of its value. You are discouraged from taking responsibility and will not learn the skills necessary to become independent. “The Israelites became dependent, expectant, irresponsible, and immature.”
As babies we are entirely dependent on others to survive. We cry to demand feeding, changing, burping, etc. Young children continue to need everything a parent can provide for them, but at some point our parents begin to teach us the skills of living independently, preparing us for adulthood. Some might do this by giving the children in the family responsibility for household chores, or by giving out a weekly allowance to teach financial responsibility, or expecting their children to get a job and contribute financially. This is what was happening here with the Israelites on a national scale.
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br>The Rebbe spent his time and effort providing for the needs of the poor woman. He performed the mitzva of <i>tzedaka</i>. Although this mitzva is normally a financial contribution, time is also a financial resource and is valuable, and volunteering time can also fall under this mitzva. This is also an example of the broader mitzva of <i>ḥesed</i> (kindness) or <i>gemilut ḥasadim</i> (acts of loving-kindness). While the message of the <i>Covenant &amp; Conversation</i> essay focuses on the <i>teruma</i> (donation) of the Israelites to building the <i>Mishkan</i>, the value is the same when it is giving of personal time and effort rather than just money.
The Rebbe could have arranged for one of his followers to do this on his behalf. However, he wanted to personally fulfil the mitzva. Despite needing to compromise on other religious values (such as prayer – he had to say the morning prayers while tending to the woman’s fire rather than joining the service in the synagogue) and despite compromising on his status and dignity as the Rebbe of the town (he disguised himself as a labourer and performed manual labour that was not considered befitting of a holy man), he sought a different kind of dignity by fulfilling this mitzva personally. Also, as Rambam teaches us in <i>Hilkhot Mattenot Aniyyim</i>, an anonymous donation is far greater than a public donation, as it protects the dignity of the recipient.
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>This should become an underlying value forming the foundation of the decisions we take in life. The careers we choose, the way we spend our leisure time, and the way we allocate our resources, must all reflect this ideal. It is important also to remember that “the more of ourselves we give” does not only refer to our financial resources, but to our time, energy, and creativity.
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>Up until this point, the Israelites had been dependent on God for everything. When they were hungry, He gave them food. When they were thirsty, He gave them water. And when they were discontented, they complained. The building of the <i>Mishkan</i> was the first time they had been asked to take responsibility for something, much in the same way as a child becomes a young adult and is asked to take some responsibility for their lives in preparation for adulthood.
<i>Tzedaka</i> is not only directed at people’s physical needs. To need and receive <i>tzedaka</i> is inherently humiliating. Someone who is dependent on <i>tzedaka</i> has physical needs, and these must be met by other people or by the community as a whole. But they also have psychological needs. That is why Jewish law rules that they must give to others. Giving confers dignity, and everyone deserves dignity and self-respect.
<i>Tzedaka</i> is a way to address the physical needs of the community, ensuring that those who are in need are taken care of. However, the mitzva of <i>tzedaka</i> also addresses the psychological needs of the giver. We all have the psychological need to feel we are contributing to society and not just taking from others. Giving to society leads to a sense of dignity, which is of critical importance to all human beings. Additionally, a giving society is one that is strong, caring for the weak and helping wherever needed. These laws help us to become a strong community, where every member is cared for and valued.

II; A Portable Home

<big><strong>II. A Portable Home</strong></big><br><b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>The <i>parasha</i> of <i>Teruma</i> describes the construction of the <i>Mishkan</i>, the first collective house of worship in the history of Israel. It was the first but not the last; it was eventually succeeded by the Temple in Jerusalem. It is hard to understand the depth of the crisis experienced after the destruction of the First Temple. The very existence of Jewish people was based on a relationship with God symbolised by the worship that took place daily in Jerusalem. With the Babylonian conquest in 586 BCE, Jews lost not only their land and sovereignty. In losing the Temple, it was as if they had lost hope itself. For their hope lay in God, and how could they turn to God if the very place where they served Him was in ruins?
It was then that an answer began to take shape. The Temple no longer stood, but its memory remained, and this memory was strong enough to bring Jews together in collective worship. In exile, in Babylon, Jews began to gather to teach Torah, talk about a collective hope of return, and remember the Temple and its service.
The prophet Yeḥezkel was one of those who shaped a vision of return and restoration, and it is to him we owe the first indirect reference to a radically new institution that eventually became known as the <i>beit knesset</i>, the synagogue: “This is what the sovereign Lord says: ‘Although I sent them far away among the nations and scattered them among the countries, yet I have become to them a small Sanctuary (<i>Mikdash me’at</i>) in the countries where they have gone’” (Yeḥezkel 11:16). The central Sanctuary had been destroyed, but a small echo, a miniature, remained.
The synagogue is one of the most remarkable examples of an <i>itaruta deletata</i>, “an awakening from below.” It came into being not through words spoken by God to Israel, but by words spoken by Israel to God. There is no synagogue in Tanakh, no command to build local houses of prayer. On the contrary, insofar as the Torah speaks of a “house of God” it refers to a central Sanctuary, a collective focus for the worship of the people as a whole.
We tend to forget how profound the concept of a synagogue was. Professor M. Stern has written that “in establishing the synagogue, Judaism created one of the greatest revolutions in the history of religion and society, for the synagogue was an entirely new environment for divine service, of a type unknown anywhere before.” It became, according to the historian Salo Baron, the institution through which the Diaspora community “completely shifted the emphasis from the place of worship, the Sanctuary, to the gathering of worshippers, the congregation, assembled at any time and any place in God’s wide world.” The synagogue became Jerusalem in exile, the home of the Jewish heart. It is the ultimate expression of monotheism – that wherever we gather to turn our hearts towards heaven, there the Divine Presence can be found, for God is everywhere.

<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br><i>On October 14, 1663, the famous diarist Samuel Pepys paid a visit to the Spanish and Portuguese Synagogue in Creechurch Lane in the city of London. Jews had been exiled from England in 1290 but in 1656, following an intervention by Rabbi Menasseh ben Israel of Amsterdam, Oliver Cromwell concluded that there was in fact no legal barrier to Jews living there. So, for the first time since the thirteenth century, Jews were able to worship openly.</i>
<i>The synagogue Pepys visited was simply a private house belonging to a successful Portuguese Jewish merchant, Antonio Fernandez Carvajal, that had been extended to house the congregation. Pepys had been in the synagogue once before, at the memorial service for Carvajal, who died in 1659. On that occasion the atmosphere was somber and respectful. What he saw on his second visit was something else altogether, a scene of celebration that left him outraged. This is what he wrote in his diary:</i>
<i>“After dinner my wife and I, by Mr. Rawlinson’s conduct, to the Jewish Synagogue: where the men and boys in their vayles (</i>tallitot<i>), and the women behind a lattice out of sight; and some things stand up, which I believe is their Law (</i>sefer Torah<i>), in a press (the ark) to which all coming in do bow; and at the putting on their vayles do say something, to which others that hear him do cry Amen, and the party do kiss his vayle. Their service all in a singing way, and in Hebrew. And anon their Laws that they take out of the press are carried by several men, four or five several burthens in all, and they do relieve one another; and whether it is that everyone desires to have the carrying of it, I cannot tell, thus they carried it round about the room while such a service is singing…. But, Lord! to see the disorder, laughing, sporting, and no attention, but confusion in all their service, more like brutes than people knowing the true God, would make a man forswear ever seeing them more and indeed I never did see so much, or could have imagined there had been any religion in the whole world so absurdly performed as this.”</i>
<i>Poor Pepys. No one told him that the day he chose to come to the synagogue was Simḥat Torah, nor had he ever seen in a house of worship anything like the energetic joy of the day when we dance with the Torah scroll as if the world was a wedding and the book a bride, with the same abandon as King David when he brought the holy ark into Jerusalem.</i>
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. Do you think the</i> beit knesset<i> should be solemn and magnificent or intimate and lively? Which of these descriptions is most like your synagogue?</i>
<i>2. Can it be both of these? Should it be both?</i>
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>Where did this world-changing idea, of the synagogue as the portable home for God wherever we find ourselves, come from? It did not come from the Temple, but rather from the much earlier institution described in this <i>parasha</i>: the <i>Mishkan</i>. Its essence was that it was portable, made up of beams and hangings that could be dismantled and carried by the Levites as the Israelites journeyed through the wilderness. The <i>Mishkan</i>, a temporary structure, turned out to have permanent influence, whereas the Temple, intended to be permanent, proved to be temporary – until, as we pray daily, it is rebuilt.
More significant than the physical structure of the <i>Mishkan</i> was its metaphysical structure. The very idea that one can build a home for God seems absurd. The very concept of making a home in finite space for an infinite presence seems a contradiction in terms.
The answer, still astonishing in its profundity, is contained at the beginning of this <i>parasha</i>: “They shall make a Sanctuary for Me, and I will dwell in them (<i>betokham</i>)” (Shemot 25:8). The Jewish mystics pointed out the linguistic strangeness of this sentence. It should have said, “I will dwell in it,” not “I will dwell in them.” The answer is that the Divine Presence lives not in a building but in its builders; not in a physical place but in the human heart. The Sanctuary was not a place in which the objective existence of God was somehow more concentrated than elsewhere. Rather, it was a place whose holiness had the effect of opening hearts to the One worshipped there. God exists everywhere, but not everywhere do we feel the presence of God in the same way. The essence of “the holy” is that it is a place where we set aside all human devices and desires and enter a domain wholly set aside for God.
If the concept of the <i>Mishkan</i> is that God lives in the human heart whenever it opens itself unreservedly to Heaven, then its physical location is irrelevant. Thus the way was open, seven centuries later, to the synagogue: the supreme statement of the idea that if God is everywhere, He can be reached anywhere. I find it moving that the frail structure described in this <i>parasha</i> became the inspiration of an institution that, more than any other, kept the Jewish people alive through almost two thousand years of dispersion – the longest of all journeys through the wilderness.
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>The Jewish contribution to civilisation did not lie in architecture. There were exceptions. But at most times, Jews built relatively modest places of worship, and one is led to wonder why. Was it that often they were simply poor and few in number? Or that neither Christians nor Muslims allowed them to build houses of worship that might rival their own? Was it simply that experience had taught them that, during the long night of exile, no place of residence was secure? Had they been expelled too often from too many countries to seek permanence in stone? There is a measure of truth in each of these suggestions, but I cannot help feeling that the larger truth lies elsewhere.
After the destruction of the Second Temple Jews lived by an ancient and fundamental insight, that God does not live in buildings but in the human heart. When He commanded the Israelites to construct the Tabernacle, He said, “They shall make Me a Sanctuary that I may dwell in their midst” (Shemot 25:8) – in their midst, not in its midst. The <i>Shekhina</i>, God’s indwelling presence, was in a people, not a place. The traces of His spirit are to be found in human lives. What in other faiths was achieved through architecture – visible symbols of the order and majesty of creation – was achieved in Judaism through the life of the holy community, constructed according to the plans of the Torah. The Rabbis carved, polished, and engraved its teachings as if they were stones of a great edifice, and so they were, but it was a living one built out of words and deeds. A Jewish legend says when the Temple was destroyed splinters from its stones entered the hearts of the Jewish people. When they gathered as <i>Knesset Yisrael</i>, the congregation of Israel united across space and time in the collective service of God, they became a kind of human Temple and in their lives the Divine Presence found its earthly home. So, when they were not trying to imitate their neighbours, Jews rarely put their energies into buildings. They put them into study and worship and acts of social welfare. They constructed synagogues, but what they built was communities of faith.

<i>2. What is the difference between constructing a synagogue and building a community of faith?</i>
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>Why was the reorientation of Judaism from the Temple to the synagogue a “revolution”?
What do you think Rabbi Sacks means when he says the synagogue is “the ultimate expression of monotheism”?
Why is today’s synagogue conceptually closer to the <i>Mishkan</i> than the Temple in Jerusalem?
<b>EDUCATIONAL COMPANION TO THE QUESTIONS</b>
<b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>While the synagogue on some level has come to replace the Temple and there are many similarities between the Temple and the synagogue (in rabbinic literature, the synagogue is sometimes called a <i>Mikdash me’at</i> – a small Sanctuary – like a mini-Temple), it has a different focus, both structurally and conceptually, to the Temple. Judaism in the Temple era was centralised, and worship of God was largely through the priests who represented all Jews in prayer. Once the Temple was destroyed, Judaism had to evolve and develop from this stage in its history. As a result, synagogues became the place all Jews could go to focus their own direct worship of God.
The birth of the local synagogue in post-Temple Judaism signified a rebirth and re-conceptualisation of Judaism, encouraging more focus on individual relationship with and worship of God, and decentralising the process of connecting to God. This was revolutionary in both Judaism and the wider religious world.
Today the synagogue is not only a physical space to come together as a community for individual and communal prayer, but it also serves as a central focus for the community on all levels. So together with the family and the school, the synagogue today is the central institution of Judaism and Jewish life.
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br>There are different models of synagogues throughout the world, and each is a reflection of the particular community that built it and the wider society in which it is found. Often, European synagogues, and those influenced by the wider culture of European places of worship (i.e., churches), are grand and magnificent buildings and the decorum is often formal and solemn. However, the other extreme is also found in Jewish communities: a simple and modest structure where the <i>tefillot</i> are more informal and intimate.
Just as there is a diverse array of types of Jews, each relating to God and building a unique relationship with Him, so there is a diverse variety of synagogues, and no one is more legitimate than another. Each Jew should find the model of synagogue and synagogue worship that most speaks to them. A community that wishes to appeal to most of its members will creatively find ways to be as versatile as possible, catering to as many of its members as it can. The Jewish year also lends itself well to a variety of models of worship. At one end of the spectrum are the most solemn of days in the Jewish calendar, Rosh HaShana and Yom Kippur, and at the other end would be the informal and joyous days of celebration, like Purim and Simḥat Torah.
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>It is hard for us, with our physical as well as spiritual essence, to relate to an incorporeal God with no physical essence at all. A physical space to direct our worship has always been a priority in Judaism. This place can and should also be a focus of community and communal prayer, where we come together in numbers to worship together.
The physical construction of a building in which to worship God has always been less of a priority for Jews than the task of building a community of faith based on values and education and communal love and concern for each other.
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>Until the destruction of the Temple, Judaism had been focused primarily on the worship of God through the priestly sacrificial service in the Temple in Jerusalem, through the agency of the priests. Judaism had to reinvent itself in a post-Temple period when this was no longer possible. The loss of the Temple as the focus of Judaism could have led to a spiritual and political crisis that would threaten the very existence of the Jewish people, but under the leadership of the Rabbis, Judaism evolved into a religion where God dwelled in the heart of each Jew, and Judaism became portable once again (as it was in the wilderness). This can be described as a religious revolution.
Judaism as a monotheistic faith believes in a universal God who could be worshipped by all people in whichever location they found themselves. The concept of a synagogue, which could be built as the focus of each local Jewish community to worship God, is an ultimate expression of this.
The <i>Mishkan</i> that accompanied the Jews in their travels in the wilderness represented a portable, mobile Judaism. The synagogue, which can be built anywhere in the world, is a post-Temple expression of the same idea.

Tetzaveh

In a Nutshell

<b><i>IN A NUTSHELL</i></b><br>In <i>Parashat Tetzaveh</i>, we learn more about the role of the priests. Unusually, Moshe’s name is not mentioned once. Instead, his brother Aharon, the <i>kohen gadol</i> (high priest), is our main focus.
We read about the jobs that the <i>kohanim</i> (priests) had to do in the <i>Mishkan</i> (the portable Temple), the special clothes they had to wear, and the special ceremony for the <i>kohanim</i> (their consecration) when they began their service.
There are also some extra details about the <i>Mishkan</i> itself.
<b>QUESTION TO PONDER</b>
<i>Why do you think the Torah goes into so much detail about the</i> Mishkan<i> and the priests’ role there when we don’t have a</i> Mishkan <i>or a Temple today?</i>

I; Dressing to Impress

<big><strong>I. Dressing to Impress</strong></big><br><b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br><i>Tetzaveh</i> describes in detail the “sacred robes” which the priests and the high priest wore “for glory and for splendour” while they served in the <i>Mishkan</i>. This seems to contradict some fundamental values of Judaism.
The priestly clothes were made to be seen. They were intended to impress the eye. But Judaism is not normally a religion of the eye. Actually, it is a religion of the ear. It emphasises hearing rather than seeing. Our key word is <i>shema</i>, meaning to hear, listen, understand, and obey. The verb <i>sh-m-a</i> is an important theme of the book of Devarim, where it appears ninety-two times. Jewish spirituality is about listening more than looking. That is the reason that we cover our eyes when we say <i>Shema Yisrael</i>. We shut out the world of sight and focus on the world of sound: words, communication, and meaning.
This is all because of the Torah’s battle against idolatry. Others saw gods in the sun, the stars, the river, the sea, the rain, the storm, the animal kingdom, and the earth. They made visual representations of these things. Judaism rejects this whole way of thinking.
God is not in nature; He is beyond it. He created it and He transcends it. Nature is God’s work, but not itself God. God cannot be seen. He reveals Himself through <i>words</i>.
Clearly, the <i>Mishkan</i> (the Tabernacle), and later the <i>Mikdash</i> (the Temple), were exceptions to this. Their emphasis was on the visual, and a key example is the priests’ and high priest’s sacred clothing, the <i>bigdei kodesh</i>. Why?
The clue as to why these were made to be visually beautiful clothes is in the statement that they were to be worn “for glory and for splendour.” They created an atmosphere of awe and reverence because they pointed to a beauty and grandeur beyond themselves, namely God Himself.
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. Why do we need a physical framework like a </i>Mishkan <i>or a Temple (or even a synagogue) to worship God?</i>
<i>2. How can clothes create an atmosphere or emotions in the wearer and in observers? Can you think of any examples?</i>
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br><i>I don’t like packing! Even when it is for camp. I can’t wait for camp, but I still cannot look forward to packing for it! As I sit here staring at all my clothes, deciding which will have the honour of accompanying me to camp, it occurs to me that some of my clothes are more meaningful to me than others.</i>
<i>For example, I am clearly taking my Arsenal shirt. I need everyone to know I am an Arsenal fan! Plus, I will definitely play football at camp, and I play better when I wear it. Of course I also have to take my Bnei Akiva movement shirt. I am proud to wear that too, especially at camp. Hmm…school uniform. Obviously not coming with. I am sometimes proud to wear that also, but definitely not at camp! I am also not taking my Shabbat suit, even though I like the way it makes me feel on Shabbat (I don’t want it to get ruined at camp, and anyway, no one else will be wearing a suit on Shabbat). Now what about T-shirts? I have so many! Some don’t really say anything, but some really do. Take this one for example. It has a picture of my entire extended family surrounding my grandma on her eightieth birthday.</i>
<i>Too embarrassing to wear this in public…but it has to come with me. What can I do?! That’s my whole family! Ah, here is my favourite T-shirts pile. We have my Avengers T-shirt, an IDF T-shirt I got on our last trip to Israel, and my Coldplay tour T-shirt. These will be good for the first week.</i>
<i>You know what I realise? Even though I have never been into fashion or paid too much attention to what people wear, clothes can be really important. They affect how you feel when you wear them, and they can send a message to the world about who you are. Hey world, come look inside my suitcase if you want to know who I am!</i>
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. Why do you think the narrator chose these clothes for camp?</i>
<i>2. How many different kinds of “uniforms” do you have and how do they change the way you feel when you wear them?</i>
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>The Hebrew for “garment,” <i>b-g-d</i>, also means “betrayal,” as in the confession we say on Rosh HaShana and Yom Kippur: “<i>Ashamnu, bagadnu</i>,” “We have been guilty, we have betrayed.” Throughout the book of Bereshit, whenever a garment is a key element in the story, it involves some deception or betrayal.
There were the coverings of fig leaves Adam and Ḥava made for themselves after eating the forbidden fruit. Yaakov wore Esav’s clothes when he took his blessing by deceit. Tamar wore a disguise to deceive her father-in-law Yehuda. The brothers used Yosef’s bloodstained cloak to deceive their father into thinking he had been killed by a wild animal. Potifar’s wife used the cloak Yosef had left behind as evidence for her false accusation to have him imprisoned. Yosef himself took advantage of his viceroy’s clothing to conceal his identity from his brothers when they came to Egypt to buy food. So it is exceptionally unusual that the Torah should now concern itself in a positive way with clothes, garments, vestments.
Clothes have to do with surface, not depth; with the outward, not the inward; with appearance rather than reality. All the more strange, therefore, that they should form a key element of the service of the priests, given the fact that “people look at the outward appearance, but the Lord looks at the heart” (I Shmuel 16:7).
Equally odd is the fact that for the first time we encounter the concept of a uniform, that is, a standardised form of dress worn not because of the individual wearing the clothes but because of the office they hold, as <i>kohen</i> or <i>kohen gadol</i>. In general, Judaism focuses on the person, not the office. Specifically, there was no such thing as a uniform for prophets.
<i>Tetzaveh</i> contains some other new terms. This is the first time we encounter the phrase “for glory and for splendour,” describing the effect and point of the garments. Until now, <i>kavod</i>, “glory,” has been spoken of in relation to God alone. Now human beings are to share some of the same glory.
Our <i>parasha</i> is also the first time the word <i>tiferet</i> appears. The word has the sense of splendour and magnificence, but it also means beauty. It introduces a dimension we have not encountered explicitly in the Torah before: the <i>aesthetic</i>. We have encountered moral beauty, for instance Rivka’s kindness to Avraham’s servant at the well. We have encountered physical beauty: Sara, Rivka, and Raḥel are all described as beautiful. But the Sanctuary and its service bring us for the first time to the aesthetic beauty of craftsmanship and the visual.
This is a continuing theme in relation to the <i>Mishkan,</i> and later, the Temple. We find it already in the story of the binding of Yitzḥak on Mount Moria, which would later become the site of the Temple: “Avraham named the place ‘God will see.’ That is why it is said today, ‘On God’s mountain, He will be seen’” (Bereshit 22:14). The emphasis on the visual is unmistakable. The Temple would be about seeing and being seen. But why is it that specifically in relation to the <i>Mishkan</i> and Temple, the visual prevailed?
The answer is connected to the incident of the Golden Calf. What that sin showed is that the people could not fully relate to a God who gave them no permanent and visible sign of His presence and who could only be communicated with by the greatest of prophets. The Torah was given to ordinary human beings, not angels or unique individuals like Moshe. It is hard to believe in a God of everywhere-in-general-but-nowhere-in-particular. It is hard to sustain a relationship with God who is only evident in miracles and unique events but not in everyday life. It is hard to relate to God when He only manifests Himself as overwhelming power.
So the <i>Mishkan</i> became the visible sign of God’s continual presence in the midst of the people. Those who officiated there did so not because of their personal greatness, like Moshe, but because of birth and office, signalled by their clothing. The <i>Mishkan</i> represents acknowledgement of the fact that human spirituality is about emotions, not just intellect; the heart, not just the mind. Hence aesthetics and the visual as a way of inculcating feelings of awe.
The purpose of the emphasis on the visual elements of the <i>Mishkan,</i> and the grand vestments of those who ministered there, was to create an atmosphere of reverence because they pointed to a beauty and splendour beyond themselves, namely God Himself.
Rambam understood the emotive power of the visual. In his <i>Eight Chapters</i>, the prelude to his commentary on Tractate Avot, he says, “The soul needs to rest and to do what relaxes the senses, such as looking at beautiful decorations and objects, so that weariness be removed from it.” Art and architecture can lift depression and energise the senses.
Rambam’s perspective on the visual allows him to explain an otherwise hard-to-understand law, namely that a <i>kohen</i> with a physical blemish may not officiate in the Temple. This goes against the general principle that “<i>Raḥmana liba ba’i</i>,” “God wants the heart,” the inner spirit. The exclusion, says Rambam, has nothing to do with the nature of prayer or divine service, but rather with popular attitudes. “The multitude does not estimate man by his true form,” he writes, and instead judges by appearances. This may be wrong, but it was a fact that could not be ignored. The Sanctuary’s entire purpose was to bring the experience of God down to earth in a physical structure with regular routines performed by ordinary human beings. Its purpose was to make people sense the invisible Divine Presence in visible phenomena. Visual beauty was key.
Thus there is a place for aesthetics and the visual in the life of the spirit. In modern times, Rabbi Kook in particular looked forward to a renewal of Jewish art in the reborn land of Israel. He himself, as I have written elsewhere, loved Rembrandt’s paintings, and said that they represented the light of the first day of creation. He was also supportive, if guardedly so, of the Bezalel Academy of Art, one of the first signs of this renewal.
The great difference between ancient Israel and ancient Greece is that the Greeks believed in the holiness of beauty whereas Judaism spoke of <i>hadrat kodesh</i>, the beauty of holiness.
<b>I believe that beauty has power, and in Judaism it has always had a spiritual purpose: to make us aware of the universe as a work of art, testifying to the supreme Artist, God Himself.</b>
<b>QUESTION TO PONDER</b>
<i>How can we incorporate aesthetic beauty into our worship of God?</i>
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>Art in Hebrew – <i>omanut</i> – has a semantic connection with emuna, “faith” or “faithfulness.” A true artist is faithful both to his materials and to the task, teaching us, as William Blake wrote: “To see a world in a grain of sand / And a heaven in a wild flower / Hold infinity in the palm of your hand / And eternity in an hour. The name Betzalel means “in the shadow of God.” Art is the shadow cast by the radiance of God that suffuses all things: “The world is charged with the grandeur of God. It will flame out, like shining from shook foil.”
<b>“God’s Shadow,” <i>Covenant &amp; Conversation: Exodus</i>, <i>Vayak’hel</i></b>
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>Why is Judaism wary of the values represented by clothing?
How can the <i>Mishkan</i> and the priestly garments lead to “glory” and “splendour” (<i>kavod</i> and <i>tiferet</i>)?
What is Judaism’s approach to physical beauty?
<b>EDUCATIONAL COMPANION TO THE QUESTIONS</b>
<b><i>IN A NUTSHELL</i></b><br>There are two main approaches to this question. The first is that we believe that when <i>Mashiaḥ</i> comes, the Temple will be rebuilt, and the Temple service will be reinstated. All the details given in the Torah here and in other places will one day become of practical use once again. The second approach is that all these details remind us that God created a home for humanity here on earth, and we as a people spend a lot of time learning the details and putting care into making a home for His Presence, constructing first a <i>Mishkan</i>, then a <i>Beit HaMikdash</i>, and finally, all the synagogues that are painstakingly built by communities around the world today. Everything in the Torah is there to teach us important lessons. This <i>Covenant &amp; Conversation</i> essay is an example of an important lesson learned from the details of the priestly garments.
<b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>Humans are part physical and part spiritual, and we are living in a physical world. We struggle to relate and connect to an incorporeal God with no physical form. The physical aspects of the <i>Mishkan</i>, including the priestly garments, help humans to connect to God through visual and physical aspects of worship. See <i>Thinking More Deeply</i>: “[Its] purpose was to bring the experience of God down to earth in a physical structure with regular routines performed by ordinary human beings. Its purpose was to make people sense the invisible Divine Presence in visible phenomena.”
The way people dress can contribute to, or even create the atmosphere around them. Examples of this can include the formal dress code of a workplace, school uniform, or casualwear. We dress up for a wedding, and feel it is a special occasion. Then we might see the bride in her dress and really feel the importance of the day. The way one dresses can also create emotions and a certain state of mind in the wearer.
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br>The narrator of this piece spends lot of time thinking through which clothes to take to camp. In the end, the clothes chosen were ones that expressed identity, gave confidence, and felt special. The link between this story and the message of the <i>Covenant &amp; Conversation</i> essay is that just as the priestly garments were important for the state of mind of the <i>kohanim</i> who wore them, and for those who watched the service, so too the clothes we choose to wear affect us and send a message, even if it is subconscious and subtle, to those around us.
Most children and teens have several uniforms in their lives, even if they aren’t considered as such. As illustrated in the story, these might include a school uniform, sports shirts, a youth movement shirt, and the norms of dress code on Shabbat. How many and which uniforms do you wear, and how do they make you feel when you wear them?
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>We do this by investing in the physical aspects of our worship, such as our synagogues, the objects we use to perform mitzvot, and the clothes we wear when we do them. However, with Rabbi Kook as our model, we can also find deep spirituality in physical beauty, whether in nature or man-made art. All aesthetic beauty is an expression of the divine, and if seen in this way it can help us to connect to the divine. See also <i>From the Thought of Rabbi Sacks.</i>
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>Judaism is concerned with inner truth. Clothes have to do with surface, not depth; with the outward, not the inward; with appearance rather than truth. The Hebrew for “garment,” <i>b-g-d</i>, also means “betrayal,” and this <i>Covenant &amp; Conversation</i> essay lists several examples of clothing in biblical stories being used for deception and betrayal.
The purpose of the <i>Mishkan</i> and all aspects of the divine worship within it was to bring the experience of the sublime and incorporeal God down to earth in a physical structure. It was important that this structure and service was physically beautiful in order to inspire awe and wonder in those worshipping (the <i>kohanim</i>) and those on whose behalf they were conducting the service (the Israelites). This is the “glory” and “splendour” – these emotions are the manner in which we can connect to God in His worship.
Physical beauty is an expression of God’s sublime spiritual beauty. We can find this in nature and in man-made beauty. (The challenge is to ensure we don’t disassociate physical beauty from spiritual beauty, and overemphasise the aesthetic.) We are encouraged to utilise it in our worship. One example is that at Sukkot time, people take great care in decorating their sukka and ensuring that their etrog is beautiful. This is a prime example of <i>hiddur mitzva</i>.

II; Brothers; A Drama in Five Acts

<big><strong>II. Brothers: A Drama in Five Acts</strong></big><br><b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br><i>Tetzaveh</i> is the only <i>parasha</i> where the name of Moshe is not mentioned at all since the first <i>parasha</i> of the book of Shemot (in which he is born). Here, just this once, Moshe, our hero, the leader, the liberator, the lawgiver, is off-stage. Instead, our focus is on his elder brother Aharon who, elsewhere, is often in the background. Indeed, virtually the whole <i>parasha</i> is devoted to the role Moshe did <i>not</i> occupy – that of priest in general, high priest in particular.
The question is: Why is Moshe removed from the passage entirely? The commentators offered various suggestions. One given in the Talmud refers to an event at the beginning of Moshe’s leadership – his encounter with God at the Burning Bush. Moshe repeatedly expressed reluctance to undertake the mission of leading the people out of Egypt. Finally, we read:
“But Moshe said, ‘O Lord, please send someone else to do it.’ Then the Lord’s anger burned against Moshe and He said, ‘What about your brother, Aharon the Levite? I know he can speak well. He is already on his way to meet you, and his heart will be glad when he sees you. You shall speak to him and put words in his mouth; I will help both of you speak and will teach you what to do’” (Shemot 4:13–15).
There is a debate in the Talmud about the lasting impact of that moment when Moshe, as it were, refused one time too many. To turn down the challenge of leadership once or twice is a sign of humility. To continue to do so, especially when it is God issuing the challenge, may bring about God’s anger, as happened here. According to Rabbi Shimon bar Yoḥai in the Talmud, the lasting effect of Moshe’s reluctance to lead was that one vital leadership role – priesthood – was eventually granted to Aharon rather than to Moshe himself. Rabbi Yaakov ben Asher (1270–1340) suggests that Moshe’s name is missing from <i>Tetzaveh</i>, which deals with the priestly garments, “to spare him distress” upon seeing Aharon acquire the uniform of priesthood that might have been Moshe’s own.
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. Do you think Moshe’s name was removed from this</i> parasha<i> for his benefit, or for Aharon’s benefit?</i>
<i>2. Who do you think is more likely to be jealous of his brother, Aharon or Moshe?</i>
<i>3. Do you have siblings? Are you sometimes jealous of them, or they of you? Why do you think this is?</i>
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br><i>The day the Nazis liquidated the ghetto of Piotrków, the rabbi of the Polish town, Reb Moshe Chaim Lau, grabbed his eldest son Tulek, looked him in the eye with burning passion and love, and said, “You are the eldest of the children. It is your responsibility to ensure they continue to follow in our ways.” Tulek knew exactly what he meant. “Take special care of Lulek,” his father implored. Tulek believed his father had deep faith that Lulek, the youngest of the family, then aged just seven, would somehow survive and continue the legacy of the family. Finally he added, “If you come safely through this hell, you will know how to find your home. Not here, not on any alien hostile soil. Your home is</i> Eretz Yisrael<i>.” This mission gave Tulek an amazing drive to survive. His father’s words gave him extraordinary strength beyond what could possibly have been expected of a boy aged sixteen.</i>
<i>As the Nazis forced the men and women into two separate lines, Lulek held onto his mother tightly. But she understood that he had a greater chance of survival if he was with the men, so she pushed him away from her into the arms of Tulek. Tulek emptied the bag he had with him, wrapped Lulek in a blanket, and placed him in the bag. Their parents were sent directly to Treblinka and perished on that day. Tulek was sent to Buchenwald with Lulek hidden on his back.</i>
<i>Time and time again, Tulek gambled his life to save his younger brother, all the while fighting to survive himself. In the Czestochowa labour camp, he bribed a German officer with a diamond hidden in his teeth to buy Lulek’s life, and again in Buchenwald with his father’s gold watch, hidden in his shoe. This was the last of his resources and after this he had to rely on his wits alone.</i>
<i>As the Allied forces closed in, the Jewish inmates were deported on a train, but Lulek, in hiding, remained in the camp. Tulek managed to jump from the train with two other survivors. “Where do we head now?” they asked. “Back to Buchenwald,” Tulek answered. “I have to go back for the child!”</i>
<i>On April 11, 1945, Buchenwald was liberated by American troops. Against all odds, and against all reason, the two brothers had survived, and after travelling through Europe, they found their way onto a Jewish Agency “illegal immigrant” ship headed for Palestine. They arrived in pre-state Israel in July 1945, less than three years after Tulek had taken his oath to their father, the rabbi of Piotrków.</i>
<i>This story has a postscript. Almost fifty years later, the two brothers stood side by side at the Kotel. The elder brother, Naftali Lau-Lavie, himself a dedicated public servant of many years, beamed with pride as his little brother, Rabbi Yisrael Meir Lau, was inaugurated as the beloved chief rabbi of the State of Israel.</i>
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. Are there any similarities between these two brothers and the brothers in our parasha (Moshe and Aharon)?</i>
<i>2. Do you think the love between these siblings is normal, or something beyond the usual?</i>
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>One of the recurring themes of Bereshit is sibling rivalry, hostility between brothers. This story is told four times: between Kayin and Hevel, Yitzḥak and Yishmael, Yaakov and Esav, and Yosef and his brothers.
There is a noticeable pattern to this set of narratives, best seen in the way each story ends. The tale of Kayin and Hevel ends with murder – fratricide (killing a sibling). Yitzḥak and Yishmael, though they grow up apart, are together at Avraham’s funeral. Evidently there has been a reconciliation between them. Yaakov and Esav meet, embrace, and go their separate ways. Yosef and his brothers are reconciled and live together in peace, Yosef providing them with food, land, and protection.
Bereshit is telling us a story of great consequence. Fraternity – one of the key words of the French revolution – is not simple or straightforward. It is often fraught with conflict and contention. Yet slowly, brothers can learn that there is another way. On this note, Bereshit ends. But it is not the end of the story.
The drama has a fifth act: the relationship between Moshe and Aharon. Here, for the first time, there is no hint of sibling rivalry. The brothers work together from the very outset of their mission to lead the Israelites to freedom. They address the people together. They stand united when confronting Pharaoh. They perform signs and wonders together. They share leadership of the people in the wilderness. At last, we see two brothers functioning as a team, with different gifts, different talents, different roles, but without hostility, each complementing the other.
Their partnership is a constant feature of the narrative. But there are certain moments when it is particularly noteworthy. The first occurs in the passage already cited above. God tells Moshe that Aharon “is already on his way to meet you, and <i>his heart will be glad when he sees you</i>.” How different this is from the tense encounters between brothers in Bereshit!
Aharon, we may have thought, might have many reasons not to rejoice on seeing Moshe return. The brothers had not grown up together. Moshe had been adopted by Pharaoh’s daughter and raised in an Egyptian palace, while Aharon remained with the Israelites. Nor had they been together during the Israelites’ sufferings. Moshe, fearing for his life after his assault on an Egyptian taskmaster, had fled to Midyan.
Besides this, Moshe was Aharon’s younger brother, and yet it was he who was about to become the leader of the people. Always in the past, when the younger had taken something the elder might have believed belonged naturally to him, there was jealousy, animosity. Yet God assures Moshe: “When Aharon sees you, he will rejoice.”
The second fascinating clue is contained in a strange passage that traces the descent of Moshe and Aharon: “Amram married his father’s sister Yokheved, who bore him Aharon and Moshe…. <i>It was this same Aharon and Moshe</i> to whom the Lord said, ‘Bring the Israelites out of Egypt by their divisions.’ They were the ones who spoke to Pharaoh king of Egypt about bringing the Israelites out of Egypt. <i>It was this same Moshe and Aharon</i>” (Shemot 6:20, 26–27). Why the repeated phrase, “It was this same”? There are two other peculiarities in the phrases. The first is that the names of the brothers are placed in a different order: the first says “Aharon and Moshe,” the second, “Moshe and Aharon.” Even stranger is the grammatical oddity of the phrase. Both times, the third-person singular is used, literally translating to “He was Aharon and Moshe”; “He was Moshe and Aharon.” The text should have said “They” – all the more so since the pronoun “they” is used in the middle of the passage: “They were the ones who spoke to Pharaoh.” The unmistakable implication is that they were like a single individual; they were as one. There was no hierarchy between them: sometimes Aharon appears first, sometimes Moshe.
It was precisely the fact that Aharon did not envy his younger brother but instead rejoiced in his greatness that made him worthy to be high priest. So it came to pass – measure for measure – that just as Aharon made space for his younger brother to lead, so the Torah makes space for Aharon to lead. That is why Aharon is the hero of <i>Tetzaveh</i>: for once, not overshadowed by Moshe.
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>Judaism, Christianity, and Islam have been locked in a violent, sometimes fatal embrace for so long. Their relationship is sibling rivalry, fraught with mimetic desire: the desire for the same thing, Avraham’s promise.
…At the heart of all three faiths is the idea that within humanity there is one privileged position – one favoured son, a chosen people, guardian of the truth, gatekeeper of salvation – for which more than one candidate competes. The result is conflict of the most existential kind, for what is at stake is the most precious gift of all: God’s paternal love. One group’s victory means another’s defeat, and since this is a humiliation, a dethronement, it leads to revenge. So the strife is perpetuated.
<b><i> Not in God’s Name,</i> 98–99</b>
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. Do you think we can learn from the sibling rivalries in the Torah to help us understand the world?</i>
<i>2. Do you think God has favourites? Is it possible God loves all nations and people equally?</i>
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>Why do you think Moshe was so desperate to have Aharon help him with this task?
Is it more natural to have a sibling relationship like those characters from the book of Bereshit, or like Moshe and Aharon’s?
Is your relationship with your siblings more like those in the book of Bereshit or like that of Moshe and Aharon?
<b>EDUCATIONAL COMPANION TO THE QUESTIONS</b>
<b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>According to Rabbi Shimon bar Yoḥai in the Talmud, this was a punishment because Moshe refused to trust God and accept the leadership role he was being offered. The punishment, it could be argued, was a lesson to Moshe, and therefore for his benefit. However, Rabbi Yaakov ben Asher takes a different approach and is of the opinion that this signified a sensitivity to Moshe, who could have qualified for the priesthood himself and therefore could have been distressed to witness Aharon receiving the uniform of priesthood. So God disassociated him from the <i>parasha</i> where this is discussed. Finally, perhaps we can argue that this was for the sake of Aharon, so he could have his moment in the limelight, when the Torah discusses his spiritual leadership role. The Torah wishes not to overshadow Aharon at this moment by mentioning his younger brother, who has a larger role.
We often feel that those around us who seem so confident and have such strong self-esteem couldn’t possibly have doubt in themselves. It is therefore a shock to learn that even the strongest personalities, who have achieved so much, also struggle with the very human emotions of jealousy and self-doubt. It would be reasonable to assume that Aharon was jealous of Moshe, even though we see no evidence of that in the Torah. It is also feasible that Moshe could likewise have had some envious thoughts towards his elder brother, the high priest.
Sibling rivalry is a natural emotional response and exists to some extent in all families. Much has been written on this. On the simplest level, the rivalry is about the love available in the family. We must remind ourselves that love is not a zero-sum game. A parent’s love for one child does not preclude them from loving a second child just the same.
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br>Moshe and Aharon have only love and respect for each other, in contrast to the complex sibling relationships we see in the book of Bereshit (see <i>Thinking More Deeply</i> for a more in-depth presentation of this idea). Despite Aharon’s seniority, there is no evidence to suggest that he is jealous or bitter because of his younger brother Moshe’s leadership role. So too in this moving story of the Lau brothers, there is only deep and mutual love, and Naftali only feels pride and love when his younger brother becomes chief rabbi of the State of Israel.
While brotherly love is a natural and beautiful thing that exists everywhere, this particular story is quite extraordinary, taking place as it does during exceptional times. While all people would hope to be able to go to these lengths to save their sibling, this is a particularly inspiring and remarkable story.
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>Rabbi Sacks suggests in <i>Not in God’s Name</i> that we can understand the tension between Judaism and its daughter religions (Christianity and Islam) through the prism of sibling rivalry, and this can be learned from the strained relationships between Yitzḥak and Yishmael, and between Yaakov and Esav. In this <i>Covenant &amp; Conversation</i> essay he also suggests that all the sibling relationships in the book of Bereshit are models for our own relationships. Each one complex and at times difficult, yet each one came to reconciliation in the end. The ultimate sibling relationship is between Moshe and Aharon – no tensions, only love. This is the ideal to strive for.
Rabbi Sacks believes that God loves all His creations, which includes all people and all nations. Just as a parent can love many children equally, so can God.
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>At this stage, Moshe lacked confidence in his abilities, despite God’s assurances. Perhaps he also felt that it was only right that there would be a role for his elder brother.
All models of the sibling relationship are natural, including the models we find in the book of Bereshit, which are often fraught with tension and rivalry. However, this does not mean we should not strive for the ideal that Moshe and Aharon model for us. The Torah presents us with realistic role models (we see both Moshe and Aharon in an authentic light, including their flaws and mistakes) who represent ideals that are worth striving for, and are realistically achievable.
This is a personal question. When considering it, encourage the participants in the discussion to be honest, and remind them that sibling rivalries are natural and common.

Ki Tisa

In a Nutshell

<b><i>IN A NUTSHELL</i></b><br><i>Ki Tisa</i> begins with the final details of the <i>Mishkan</i> (the portable Temple). Each person donated a half-shekel to pay for the materials used to build the <i>Mishkan</i>, and the coins were also used to count the people (the Torah forbids the counting of people directly, so instead the coins were counted). This is called a census.
We then read one of the most dramatic stories in the Torah. Moshe is at the top of Mount Sinai receiving the tablets from God for forty days. The people panic, fearing he is late back and may never return. Desperate for a way to connect to God, they make a Golden Calf as their go-between. God tells Moshe to go down the mountain to see the people, and Moshe goes down with the two tablets and finds them dancing before the Golden Calf. Furiously, he throws the tablets to the ground and they smash into pieces. Then he climbs back up the mountain to beg God to forgive them. Eventually, God accepts Moshe’s plea, and Moshe gets a second set of tablets. The <i>parasha</i> ends with a description of Moshe, his face shining with light from his encounter with God, as he returns to the people.
<b>QUESTION TO PONDER</b>
<i>Why do you think Hashem forgave the people for this terrible sin?</i>

I; Moshe Annuls a Vow

<big><strong>I. Moshe Annuls a Vow</strong></big><br><b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>There is a strong connection between this <i>parasha</i> and Yom Kippur. Less than six weeks after God gave the Torah at Mount Sinai, the Israelites committed what seemed to be the unforgivable sin of making a Golden Calf. Moshe prayed repeatedly for forgiveness on their behalf and eventually God agreed to forgive them. On the tenth of Tishrei, Moshe descended from Mount Sinai with a new set of tablets to replace those he had smashed in anger at their sin. The tenth of Tishrei subsequently became Yom Kippur, the day of atonement, marking that moment when the people saw Moshe with the new tablets and knew they were forgiven.
Moshe’s prayers, as recorded in the Torah, are brave. But the Midrash makes them more courageous still. The text introducing Moshe’s prayer begins with the Hebrew words “<i>Vayeḥal</i> <i>Moshe</i>” (Shemot 32:11). Normally this is translated as “Moshe besought, implored, entreated, pleaded, or attempted to pacify” God. However, <i>the same verb is used in the context of annulling or breaking a vow</i> (Bemidbar 30:3). On this basis the Sages suggest something truly remarkable:
“<i>Vayeḥal</i> <i>Moshe</i>” means “Moshe <i>cleared God of His vow</i>.” When the Israelites made the Golden Calf, Moshe asked God to forgive them, but God said, “I have already taken an oath that <i>whoever sacrifices to any god other than the Lord must be punished</i> (Shemot 22:19). I cannot withdraw what I have said.” Moshe replied, “Lord of the universe, You have given me the power to cancel oaths, for You taught me that one who takes an oath cannot break their word, but a scholar can release them from the promise. I hereby release You from Your vow” (abridged from Shemot Rabba 43:4).
According to the Sages, the original act of divine forgiveness on which Yom Kippur is based came about through this cancellation of a vow. This explains the opening service of Yom Kippur – <i>Kol Nidrei</i>, which is a declaration of the cancellation of our promises.
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. Did the people deserve to be punished? According to the Midrash, why did God decide to forgive them?</i>
<i>2. What themes connect this story to Yom Kippur?</i>
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br><i>Franz Rosenzweig (1886–1929) was a young German-Jewish intellectual from a highly assimilated family. At twenty-seven, his cousins and a close friend persuaded him to officially convert to Christianity. He decided the best way to do this was to act like a religious Jew, and then transition, like the early Christians, from there to Christianity. He travelled to Berlin to spend Yom Kippur in a small Orthodox synagogue as his last Jewish act.</i>
<i>The experience changed his life. A few days later he wrote that “leaving Judaism no longer seems necessary to me and…no longer possible.” He became a celebrated</i> baal teshuva <i>(he returned to the Jewish faith), and one of the greatest Jewish thinkers of the twentieth century. On postcards, in the trenches of the First World War, he wrote a masterpiece of Jewish theology entitled “The Star of Redemption.”</i>
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. What do you think is the power of</i> Kol Nidrei<i> and Yom Kippur and how this experience had such an impact for him?</i>
<i>2. Is this similar to the experience of the “secret Jews” of Spain and Portugal, who came once a year on</i> Kol Nidrei<i> to annul their vows (see</i> Thinking More Deeply<i>)?</i>
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br><i>Kol Nidrei</i> is an enigma wrapped in a mystery, perhaps the strangest text ever to capture the religious imagination. First, it is not a prayer at all. It is not even a confession. It is a dry legal formula for the annulment of vows. It is written in Aramaic. It does not mention God. It is not part of the service. It does not require a <i>shul</i>. And it was disapproved of, or at least questioned, by generations of halakhic authorities. Why then, do we begin every Yom Kippur, our most important day, with <i>Kol Nidrei</i>?
The first time we hear of <i>Kol Nidrei</i>, in the eighth century, it is already being opposed by Rav Natronai Gaon, the first of many Sages who found it problematic. In his view, one cannot annul the vows of an entire congregation this way. Even if one could, one should not, since it may lead people to treat vows lightly. Besides which, there has already been an annulment of vows ten days earlier, on the morning before Rosh HaShana. This is mentioned explicitly in the Talmud (Nedarim 23b). There is no mention of an annulment on Yom Kippur.
Rabbeinu Tam, Rashi’s grandson, was particularly insistent in arguing that the kind of annulment <i>Kol Nidrei</i> represents cannot be retroactive. It cannot apply to vows already taken. It can only be applied to vows made in the future. Accordingly, he insisted on changing its wording, so that <i>Kol Nidrei</i> refers not to vows from last year to this, but from this year to next.
<i>Kol Nidrei</i> also created hostility on the part of non-Jews, who said it showed that Jews did not feel bound to honour their promises since they annulled them on the holiest night of the year. In vain it was repeatedly emphasised that <i>Kol Nidrei</i> applies only to vows between us and God, not those between us and our fellow humans. Throughout the Middle Ages, and in some places until the eighteenth century, in lawsuits with non-Jews, Jews were forced to take a special oath, <i>More Judaica</i>, because of this concern.
So there were communal and halakhic reasons not to say <i>Kol Nidrei</i>, yet it survived all the doubts and misgivings. It remains the quintessential expression of the awe and solemnity of the day. Its power defies all obvious explanations. Somehow it seems to point to something larger than itself, whether in Jewish history or the inner heartbeat of the Jewish soul.
Several historians have argued that it acquired its sadness from the phenomenon of forced conversions, both to Christianity and Islam, that occurred during the Middle Ages, most notably in Spain and Portugal in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. Jews were offered the choice: convert or suffer persecution. Sometimes it was: convert or be expelled. At times it was even: convert or die. Some Jews did convert. They were known in Hebrew as <i>anusim</i> (people who acted under coercion). In Spanish, they were known as <i>conversos</i>, or contemptuously as <i>marranos</i> (swine).
Many people remained practising Jews in private, and once a year on the night of Yom Kippur they would make their way in secret to the synagogue to seek release from the vows they had taken to adopt another faith, on the compelling grounds that they had no other choice. For them, coming to the synagogue was like <i>coming home</i>, the root meaning of <i>teshuva.</i>
There are obvious problems with this hypothesis. Firstly, <i>Kol Nidrei</i> was in existence several centuries <i>before</i> the era of forced conversions. Moreover, the text of <i>Kol Nidrei</i> makes no reference, however oblique, to conversion, return, identity, or atonement. It is simply an annulment of vows.
So the theories as they stand do not satisfy.
However, it may be that <i>Kol Nidrei</i> has a different significance altogether, one that has its origin in the remarkable rabbinic interpretation of this <i>parasha</i>, quoted in <i>The Core Idea</i>.
According to that midrash (Shemot Rabba 43:4), the original act of divine forgiveness on which Yom Kippur is based came about through the annulment of a vow, when Moshe annulled the vow of God. The Sages understood the verse, “Then the Lord <i>relented</i> from the evil He had spoken of doing to His people” (Shemot 32:14) to mean that God expressed regret for the vow He had taken – a precondition for a vow to be annulled.
Why would God regret His determination to punish the people for their sin? On this, another midrash offers an equally radical answer. The opening word of Tehillim 61 is <i>Lamenatze’aḥ</i>. When this word appears in Tehillim it usually means “to the conductor” or “to the choirmaster.” However, the Sages interpreted it to mean “to the victor,” meaning God, and added this stunning commentary:
<i>To the Victor who sought to be defeated</i>, as it is said (Yeshaya 57:16), “I will not accuse them forever, nor will I always be angry, for then they would faint away because of Me – the very people I have created.” Do not read it thus, but rather, “I will accuse in order to be defeated.” How so? Thus said the Holy One, blessed be He: “When I win, I lose, and when I lose, I gain. I defeated the generation of the Flood, but did I not lose thereby, for I destroyed My own creation, as it says (Bereshit 7:23), ‘Every living thing on the face of the earth was wiped out.’ The same happened with the generation of the Tower of Bavel and the people of Sedom. But in the days of Moshe, who defeated Me (by persuading Me to forgive the Israelites whom I had sworn to destroy), I gained for I did not destroy Israel.” <i>God wants His forgiveness to override His justice, because strict justice hurts humanity, and humanity is God’s creation and carries His image</i>. That is why He regretted His vow and allowed Moshe to annul it. That is why <i>Kol Nidrei</i> has the power it has. For it recalls the Israelites’ worst sin, the Golden Calf, and their forgiveness, completed when Moshe descended the mountain with the new tablets on the tenth of Tishrei, the anniversary of which is Yom Kippur. The forgiveness was the result of Moshe’s daring prayer, understood by the Sages as an act of cancellation of vows. Hence <i>Kol Nidrei</i>: a formula for the withdrawal of vows.
The power of <i>Kol Nidrei</i> has less to do with forced conversions than with a recollection of the moment, described in our <i>parasha</i>, when Moshe stood in prayer before God and achieved forgiveness for the people: the first time the whole people was forgiven despite the gravity of their sin. On <i>Kol Nidrei</i> we recall the first Yom Kippur when Moshe annulled the Almighty’s vow, so that His compassion could override His justice. This is the basis of all Divine forgiveness.
<b>I believe we must always strive to fulfil our promises. If we fail to keep our word, eventually we lose our freedom. But given the choice between justice and forgiveness, choose forgiveness. When we forgive and are worthy of being forgiven, we are liberated from a past we regret, to build a better future.</b>
<b>QUESTION TO PONDER</b>
<i>Why are justice and forgiveness opposite values? Why choose forgiveness over justice? Where do we see this in the</i> parasha<i>?</i>
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>Law without love is harsh, but love without law is anarchy and eventually turns to hate. So in the name of the love-of-law and the law-of-love, we ask God to release us from our vows and from our sins for the same reason: that we regret and have remorse for both. The power of <i>Kol Nidrei</i> has less to do with forced conversions, or even music, than with the courtroom drama, unique to Judaism, in which we stand, giving an account of our lives, our fate poised between God’s justice and compassion.
<b><i>Ceremony &amp; Celebration</i>, Yom Kippur, 74</b>
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>Why is the prayer <i>Kol Nidrei</i> “mysterious”?
What is the connection between Yom Kippur and this <i>parasha</i>?
How does “strict justice hurt humanity”? What is the alternative?
<b>EDUCATIONAL COMPANION TO THE QUESTIONS</b>
<b><i>IN A NUTSHELL</i></b><br>Forgiveness is a core value at the heart of our relationship with God. It has to be, because humans are fallible and make mistakes. If God only exercises the value of justice (focusing only on justice and judgement, reward and punishment) then it would be too difficult for humans to live. But of course we need to earn God’s forgiveness, through sincere regret and a commitment to change for the better. This is <i>teshuva</i>.
<b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>Strictly speaking, the people deserved to be punished for worshipping the Golden Calf. If God had executed true justice, He would have killed all those who participated in the worship. However, He also has other attributes and principles that are often in conflict with the attribute of justice, such as mercy and forgiveness. The midrash describes Moshe convincing God to give these attributes primacy in this instance, and gives God a legal precedent, a loophole to cancel His previous promise to punish those who worship idols.
According to tradition, this story took place on the tenth of Tishrei, the day of Yom Kippur. This is the day in history when God first placed the value of forgiveness above justice, when He forgave the Israelites for a sin that deserved punishment. This is the basis for Yom Kippur, when we pray to God to forgive us, despite our many flaws and sins. We ask Him to give the values of mercy and forgiveness prominence over justice.
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br>We can’t know for sure what Rosenzweig felt on Yom Kippur in the small simple <i>shul</i> in Berlin in 1913. But we do know that on Yom Kippur more than any other day of the year, we feel a powerful intimacy with God as we stand before Him and plead for forgiveness. Perhaps Rosenzweig felt the deep contrast between this and the intimidating experience of standing in a large and grand church trying to connect to a distant and impersonal version of God.
The <i>anusim</i> (crypto-Jews of Spain and Portugal in the Middle Ages who practised their Judaism in secret, for fear of torture and death at the hands of the Inquisition) would approach God in a similar intimate way once a year on <i>Kol Nidrei</i>, in order to annul their own vows to the church. The difference is that Franz did not intend to have a religious experience that would connect him back to his Jewish roots (although that was the result), whereas the <i>anusim</i> desperately wanted this experience; it was their one time a year when they would risk their lives to congregate together and pray.
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>Justice and forgiveness are by definition opposite values. In a case where justice determines someone is at fault and therefore liable, forgiveness ignores this and wipes the slate clean. It has to be one or the other. Rabbi Sacks urges us to choose forgiveness in our relationships, just as God chooses this in our <i>parasha</i> when He forgives the Israelites for their sin of worshipping the Golden Calf. Forgiveness allows us to leave the past behind and to be released from the chains of our previous mistakes. “When we forgive and are worthy of being forgiven, we are liberated from a past we regret, to build a better future”.
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>No one is quite sure where the text for this service came from or how it became an integral part of the holiest day of the year. Many Sages were opposed to its inclusion, yet it has passed the test of time. It is not really a prayer at all, rather a dry legal formula for the annulment of vows. It is written in Aramaic and not Hebrew. It does not mention God. It is not part of the actual Yom Kippur service. And it was disapproved of, or at least questioned, by generations of halakhic authorities. And yet it begins our Yom Kippur service. Often the tunes used are beautiful. Millions of Jews, of many levels of observance, attend <i>Kol Nidrei</i> each year, and feel inspired by their attendance. So both its roots, and its power, are mysterious.
The story of the Golden Calf, including God’s forgiveness of this sin, gives us an archetypal example of when God first placed the value of forgiveness above justice, when He forgave the Israelites for a sin that deserved punishment. This is the basis for Yom Kippur, when we pray to God to forgive us, despite our many flaws and sins. We ask Him to give the values of mercy and forgiveness prominence over justice. According to tradition, this story took place on the tenth of Tishrei, the day of Yom Kippur, and acts as a precedent for all future Yom Kippurs.
Humans make mistakes. They are imperfect. If the world (both governments and judicial systems, as well as God) functioned only according to strict justice, it would be too difficult to live there. We all fall short sometimes, and we need to be given the chance to learn from our mistakes and try again. Justice needs to be implemented within a framework of compassion and mercy. Judaism’s version of that is repentance (<i>teshuva</i>) and forgiveness.

II; A Stiff Necked People

<big><strong>II. A Stiff-Necked People</strong></big><br><b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>It is a moment of the very highest drama. The Israelites, a mere forty days after God revealed Himself to them at Sinai, have made an idol: a Golden Calf. God threatens to destroy them: “I have seen these people,” the Lord said to Moshe, “and they are a <i>stiff-necked people</i>. Now leave Me alone so that My anger may burn against them and that I may destroy them. Then I will make you into a great nation” (Shemot 32:9).
Moshe, demonstrating a perfect example of the character of Israel as one who “wrestles with God and man” (Bereshit 32:29), confronts both Israel and God. To God, he prays for mercy for the people. Coming down the mountain and facing Israel, he smashes the tablets, the symbol of the covenant. He grinds the calf to dust, mixes it with water, and makes the Israelites drink it. He tells the Levites to punish the wrongdoers.
Then he climbs the mountain once again and tries to reestablish the shattered relationship between God and the people. God accepts Moshe’s request and tells him to carve two new tablets of stone. At this point, however, Moshe makes a strange demand:
“And Moshe hurried and knelt to the ground and bowed, and he said, ‘If I have found favour in Your eyes, my Lord, may my Lord go among us, because (<i>ki</i>) it is a stiff-necked people, and forgive our wickedness and our sin, and take us as Your inheritance’” (Shemot 34:8–9).
The difficulty in the verse is obvious. The reason Moshe gives to God for forgiving the Israelites is the very trait that God had previously given as a reason to abandon them. How can Moshe use the people’s stubbornness as the very reason for God to continue His presence among them? What is the meaning of Moshe’s “because” – “may my Lord go among us, <i>because</i> it is a stiff-necked people”?
The commentators offer a variety of interpretations. Rashi reads the word <i>ki</i> as “if” – “If they are stiff-necked, then forgive them.” Ibn Ezra and Ḥizkuni read it as “although” or “despite the fact that” (<i>af al pi</i>). These are straightforward readings, though they assign to the word <i>ki</i> a meaning it does not normally have. Ramban takes a different approach. Precisely because of the rebelliousness of Israel, this requires the close attention of a forgiving God – like a rebellious child for whom the kindest cure is the attention and concern of a loving parent.
There is, however, another far more striking interpretation that can be traced across the centuries. In the twentieth century it was voiced by Rabbi Yitzchak Nissenbaum. The fact that Rabbi Nissenbaum lived and died in the Warsaw Ghetto makes his words all the more powerful:
“Almighty God, be patient with this people, because what is now their greatest flaw will one day be their most heroic quality. They are indeed a stubborn people. When they have everything to thank You for, they complain. Mere weeks after hearing Your voice they make a Golden Calf. But just as now they are stiff-necked in their disobedience, so one day they will be equally stiff-necked in their loyalty. Nations will call on them to assimilate, but they will refuse. Mightier religions will urge them to convert, but they will resist. They will suffer humiliation, persecution, even torture and death just because of the people they belong to and the faith they have, but they will stay true to the covenant their ancestors made with You. They will go to their deaths saying ‘<i>Ani maamin</i>,’ ‘I believe.’ This is a people awesome in its obstinacy – and though now it is their failing, there will be times far into the future when it will be their noblest strength.”
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. Do you think Jews are a stubborn people? Can you give examples?</i>
<i>2. When a parent describes their child as stubborn, is that a good thing or a bad thing? How is this similar to God and His relationship to the Jewish people?</i>
<i>3. How does the context of who Rabbi Yitzchak Nissenbaum was and where he lived make his words particularly powerful?</i>
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br>The following story was told by the Jewish historian Shlomo ibn Verga in the fifteenth century, whilst discussing the Jews’ expulsion from Spain:
<i>I heard from some of the elders who came out of Spain that one of the boats was infested with the plague, and the captain of the boat forced the passengers to disembark at some uninhabited place. Most of them died there of starvation, while some gathered up all their strength to set out on foot in search of a settlement. There was one Jew among them who struggled on foot together with his wife and two children. The wife grew faint and died from the challenging journey. The husband continued on, carrying his children until both he and they fainted from hunger. When he regained consciousness, he found that his two children had died.</i>
<i>In deep grief, he rose to his feet and cried out: “O Lord of all the universe, You are trying hard to give me reason to lose my faith. But know this, my Lord – even against the will of Heaven – a Jew I am and a Jew I will always be. Nothing that You have already done to me, nor anything that You will in the future cause to happen to me, will change that.” He then buried his children and continued on, in search of a settlement.</i>
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. Do you find this story depressing, or inspiring and heroic? Can it be both?</i>
<i>2. How is this story connected to</i> The Core Idea<i>?</i>
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>One is awestruck by the faith described in <i>The Core Idea</i> and <i>It Once Happened</i>. Such faith – such obstinate faith. Almost certainly it was this idea that lies behind a famous talmudic passage about the giving of the Torah at Mount Sinai:
<i>“And they stood under the mountain – R. Avdimi b. Ḥama b. Ḥasa said: ‘This teaches that the Holy One, blessed be He, overturned the mountain above them like a barrel and said, “If you accept the Torah, it will be well. If not, this will be your burial place.” R. Aḥa b. Yaakov observed: ‘This constitutes a strong protest against the Torah.’ Said Rava: ‘Even so, they re-accepted it in the days of Aḥashverosh, for it is written, “The Jews confirmed and took upon them,” meaning, “They confirmed what they had accepted before’”</i> (Shabbat 88a)<i>.</i>
The meaning of this strange text seems to be this: At Sinai (according to R. Avdimi), the Jewish people had no choice but to accept the covenant. They had just been rescued from Egypt. God had divided the sea for them; He had sent them manna from heaven and water from the rock. Acceptance of a covenant under such conditions cannot be called free.
The real test of faith came when God was hidden. Rava’s quotation from the book of Esther is pointed and precise. <i>Megillat Esther</i> does not contain the name of God. The Rabbis suggested that the name Esther is an allusion to the phrase, <i>“Haster astir et panai</i>,” “I will surely hide My face.” The book relates the first warrant for genocide against the Jewish people. That Jews remained Jews under such conditions was proof positive that they did indeed reaffirm the covenant. Obstinate in their disbelief during much of the biblical era, they became obstinate in their belief ever afterwards. Faced with God’s presence, they disobeyed Him. Confronted with His absence, they stayed faithful to Him. That is the paradox of the stiff-necked people.
Not by accident does the main narrative of the book of Esther begin with the words “And Mordekhai would not bow down” (Esther 3:1). His refusal to defer to Haman sets the story in motion. Mordekhai is also obstinate, and if there is one thing that is hard to do with a stiff neck, it is bowing. At times, Jews found it hard to bow down to God – but they were certainly never willing to bow down to anything less. That is why, alone of all the many peoples who have entered the arena of history, Jews – even in exile, dispersed, and everywhere a minority – neither assimilated to the dominant culture nor converted to the majority faith.
“Forgive them because they are a stiff-necked people,” said Moshe, because the time will come when that stubbornness will be not a tragic failing but a noble and defiant loyalty. And so it came to be.
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>After the Holocaust, a ravaged, devastated people came back to the land of Israel and built there one of the great states of the modern world. Out in the wilderness they built farms and planted forests. In place of the totalitarian states from which many of them came, they framed a democracy. From a small population they created an army of invincible courage. In place of Jerusalem “in mourning and in ruins” they created a Jerusalem built “as a city that is closely joined together.” They made the Hebrew language, the language of the Bible, live again. They built <i>yeshivot</i>, citadels of Jewish education, so that the streets of Jerusalem would once again echo with the sound of ancient learning. They brought Jewish communities, threatened by persecution, to safety. Together they brought about the collective resurrection of the Jewish people from the shadow of death to the land of life. Today when Jews sing of Israel they say “<i>Od lo avda tikvatenu</i>,” “Our hope is not destroyed.”
If you were to ask what our response to the Holocaust should be, I would say this: Marry and have children, bring new Jewish life into the world, build schools, make communities, have faith in God who had faith in man, and make sure that His voice is heard wherever evil threatens. Pursue justice, defend the defenceless, have the courage to be different, and fight for the dignity of difference. Recognise the image of God in others and defeat hate with love. Twice a year, on Yom HaShoah and the Ninth of Av, sit and mourn for those who died and remember them in your prayers. But most of all, continue to live as Jews.
When I stand today in Jerusalem, or in a Jewish school, or see a Jewish couple under the wedding canopy, or observe parents at the Shabbat table blessing their children, there are times when I am overcome with tears, not in sadness nor in joy, but in awe at this people who came face to face with the angel of death and refused to give it a final victory. The Jewish people lives, and still bears witness to the living God.
<b><i>A Letter in the Scroll,</i> 191–192</b>
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. According to Rabbi Sacks, what is the most important response to the Holocaust?</i>
<i>2. How is this text connected to the ideas in the rest of the </i>Covenant &amp; Conversation <i>essay?</i>
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>What do you think the message is behind the midrash that says God held Mount Sinai over the heads of the Israelites and threatened to drop it unless they accepted the Torah?
Why did the midrash suggest that the Purim story was the time when the Jews finally accepted the Torah with free will?
How do the stories of Purim and modern Jewish history illustrate the main idea of this <i>Covenant &amp; Conversation</i> essay (as expressed by Rabbi Yitzchak Nissenbaum)?
<b>EDUCATIONAL COMPANION TO THE QUESTIONS</b>
<b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>Jews are sometimes described as stubborn (including in the Torah!) and this is not necessarily a negative thing. Other words expressing the same idea are driven, committed, loyal, strong, passionate, and having an unquenchable desire to survive and continue the legacy of the Jewish people. This drive to survive and thrive, often under very hostile conditions, has led to Jews often becoming known as ambitious and successful in all sorts of realms, such as economics and education, morality and activism, and public service. The survival of the Jewish people over centuries of persecution and homelessness is itself the ultimate example of a stubborn will for survival.
While it can be infuriating to have a child who knows their own mind and displays independence and a strong will at an early age, ultimately most parents will be proud and satisfied that this bodes well for the future of the child, who they hope will become successful and secure in their future lives. This is the gist of Rabbi Yitzchak Nissenbaum’s interpretation of Moshe’s words to God.
The fact that he said these words during the worst travails of Jewish history, yet could so eloquently describe the Jews’ stubborn loyalty to their people and their God, and their indomitable will to survive, makes his words deeply inspiring and powerful.
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br>It certainly is depressing and deeply sad, and is just one story from one tragic period of Jewish history. But the man’s refusal to lose his faith under unbearable conditions reminds us of the biblical character Iyov who does the same. In this respect the story is inspiring and heroic.
This story fulfils the words of Rabbi Yitzchak Nissenbaum that describe the Jews’ refusal to lose their faith in the face of unbearable challenges to it. This, according to Rabbi Nissenbaum, is what Moshe means when he says God should forgive the Israelites because they are stubborn.
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>To continue to be Jewish. To live as a Jew. To continue the legacy of the Jewish people by marrying and having children and bringing them up as proud Jews. For Rabbi Sacks, being Jewish means: “Pursue justice, defend the defenceless, have the courage to be different, and fight for the dignity of difference. Recognise the image of God in others and defeat hate with love.”
The examples that Rabbi Sacks brings from modern Jewish history (the continuation of the Jewish people and the creation of a thriving Jewish state just years after the darkest period of Jewish history) are illustrations of the stubborn Jewish people refusing to give up, to lose their faith, or to surrender to their enemies.
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>This midrash suggests that the Israelites did not accept the Torah out of free will. This is a very problematic theological position to take. Rabbi Sacks interprets the midrash in the following way: “At Sinai (according to R. Avdimi) the Jewish people had no choice but to accept the covenant. They had just been rescued from Egypt. God had divided the sea for them; He had sent them manna from heaven and water from the rock. Acceptance of a covenant under such conditions cannot be called free.”
God hid His face during this story (His name is not mentioned once in the whole <i>Megilla</i> and the name Esther means hidden). The real test of faith is to accept the Torah when God is hidden, during a traumatic and turbulent period of Jewish history, like the Purim story.
The characteristic of being stiff-necked has served the Jewish people well throughout their history. Jews have refused to give up on their faith, on their people, and on their God.

Vayakhel

In a Nutshell

<b><i>IN A NUTSHELL</i></b><br>After the sin of the Golden Calf, Moshe gathers the people together and teaches them two mitzvot. First, he tells them about Shabbat, and then about the making of the <i>Mishkan</i> (the portable Temple).
Previously, in <i>Parashat Teruma</i>, we read the instructions for building the <i>Mishkan</i>, and now in <i>Parashat</i> <i>Vayak’hel</i> the people follow the instructions and the <i>Mishkan</i> is actually built. The people give generous donations for the making of it, and we read about Betzalel and Oholiav, the chief architects and craftsmen, creating its various parts and making them beautiful.

I; Communities and Crowds

<big><strong>I. Communities and Crowds</strong></big><br><b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br><i>Vayak’hel</i> is the Torah’s guidebook on how to build a community. It does so in a subtle way. The Torah uses a single verb, <i>k-h-l</i>, to describe two very different activities. The first appears in the last <i>parasha</i> at the beginning of the story of the Golden Calf: “When the people saw that Moshe was long delayed in coming down the mountain, they gathered (<i>vayikahel</i>) around Aharon and they said to him, ‘Get up; make us gods to go before us. This man Moshe who brought us out of Egypt – we have no idea what has become of him’” (Shemot 32:1). The second time this verb is used is in the opening verse of this <i>parasha</i>: “Moshe assembled (<i>Vayak’hel</i>) all the community of Israel and said to them, ‘These are the things the Lord has commanded you to do’” (Shemot 35:1).
These sound similar. Both verbs could be translated as “gathered” or “assembled.” But there is a fundamental difference between them. The first gathering was leaderless; the second had a leader, Moshe. The first was a <i>crowd</i>, the second a <i>community</i>. In a crowd, individuals lose their individuality. A kind of collective mentality takes over, and people find themselves doing what they would never consider doing on their own.
Charles Mackay was a Scottish poet, journalist, author, anthologist, novelist, and songwriter from the 1800s. He famously spoke of the madness of crowds. People, he said, “go mad in herds, while they only recover their senses slowly, one by one.” Together, they act in a frenzy. Normal rational thought is suspended. Sometimes this results in violence, at other times in impulsive economic behaviour giving rise to unsustainable financial booms and subsequent crashes. Crowds lack the inhibitions and restraints that form our inner controls as individuals.
It was a crowd that demanded a Golden Calf to worship God, but it was a community that came together to build the <i>Mishkan</i> and worship God there.

<i>1. Why do humans need leaders?</i>
<i>2. Have you ever experienced a “crowd” or a “community” as described here?</i>
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br><i>Melanie Reid is a journalist who writes a regular column for The (London) Times. On January 4, 2020, she wrote the story of how she, her husband, and most of their Scottish village clubbed together to buy an ancient inn and convert it into a pub.</i>
<i>She describes an extraordinary atmosphere of community spirit that developed. A large number of locals began volunteering their services to help open and run it. “We’ve got well-known classical musicians cleaning the toilets and sanding down tables. Behind the bar there are sculptors, building workers, humanist ministers, Merchant Navy officers, grandmothers, HR executives and estate agents…. Retired CEOs chop wood for the fires; septuagenarians wait at tables; surveyors eye up internal walls to be knocked down and can-doers fix blocked gutters.”</i>
<i>It has become more than a community centre; it has dramatically energised the local community. People of all ages come there to regularly play games, drink, eat, and attend special events together. A rich variety of communal facilities and activities are building up.</i>
<i>She describes what happened as “the alchemy of what can be achieved in a village when everyone comes together for a common aim.” This is the magic of “I” becoming “we.” When you build a home together you create something far greater than anything anyone could do alone.</i>
<i>It’s “one of the most crazy, left-field, heartwarming ventures I’ve ever been involved in,” Melanie wrote, and it seems all of their community members, and visitors, agree.</i>
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. Is there anything similar to this in your Jewish community?</i>
<i>2. How is this story connected to the</i> parasha<i>?</i>
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>Elias Cannetti, whose book <i>Crowds and Power</i> is a classic on the subject, writes that “the crowd is the same everywhere, in all periods and cultures; it remains essentially the same among men of the most diverse origin, education and language. Once in being, it spreads with the utmost violence. Few can resist its contagion; it always wants to go on growing and there are no inherent limits to its growth. It can arise wherever people are together, and its spontaneity and suddenness are uncanny.”
The crowd that gathered around Aharon was in the grip of panic. Moshe was their one contact with God, and thus he was the one who taught them, guided them, and led them to see God’s miracle and power. Now he was no longer there and they did not know what had happened to him. Their request for “gods to go before us” was ill-considered and regressive. Their behaviour once the Calf was made – “the people sat down to eat and drink and then stood up to engage in revelry” – was undisciplined and dissolute. When Moshe came down the mountain at God’s command, he “saw that the people were running wild, for Aharon had let them run beyond control and become a laughingstock to their enemies.” What Moshe saw exemplified Carl Jung’s description: “The psychology of a large crowd inevitably sinks to the level of mob psychology.” Moshe saw a crowd.
The <i>Vayak’hel</i> of our <i>parasha</i> was quite different. Moshe sought to create a community by getting the people to make personal contributions to a collective project, the <i>Mishkan</i>. In a community, individuals remain individuals. Their participation is essentially voluntary: “Let everyone whose heart moves them bring an offering.” Their differences are valued because they mean that each has something distinctive to contribute. Some gave gold, others silver, others bronze. Some brought wool or animal skins. Others gave precious stones. Yet others gave their labour and skills.
What united them was not the dynamic of the crowd, where we may become caught up in a collective frenzy, but rather a sense of common purpose, of helping to bring something into being that is greater than anyone could achieve alone. Communities build; they do not destroy. They bring out the best in us, not the worst. They speak not to our baser emotions such as fear but to higher aspirations, like this common goal of building a symbolic home for the Divine Presence in their midst.
By its subtle use of the verb <i>k-h-l</i>, the Torah focuses our attention not only on the product but also the process, not only on what the people made but on what they became through making it. This is how I put it in <i>The Home We Build Together</i>:
A nation – at least, the kind of nation the Israelites were called on to become – is <i>created through the act of creation itself</i>. Not all the miracles of Exodus combined, not the plagues, the division of the sea, manna from heaven, or water from a rock, not even the revelation at Sinai itself, turned the Israelites into a nation. In commanding Moshe to get the people to make the <i>Mishkan</i>, God was in effect saying: <i>To turn a group of individuals into a covenantal nation, they must build something together</i>.
Freedom cannot be conferred by an outside force, not even by God Himself. It can be achieved only by collective, collaborative effort on the part of the people themselves. Hence the construction of the Tabernacle. A people is made by making. A nation is built by building (137).
This distinction between community and crowd has become ever more significant in the twenty-first century. The classic example is the Arab Spring of 2011. Massive protests took place throughout much of the Arab world, in Tunisia, Algeria, Jordan, Oman, Egypt, Yemen, Sudan, Iraq, Bahrain, Libya, Kuwait, Syria, and elsewhere. Yet it turned rapidly into what has been called the Arab Winter. The protests still continue in a number of these countries, yet only in Tunisia has it led to constitutional democracy. Protests, in and of themselves, are never enough to generate free societies. They belong to the logic of crowd, not community.
The same is true of social media, even in free societies. They are great enhancements of existing communities, but they do not in and of themselves create communities. That takes face-to-face interaction and a willingness to make sacrifices for the sake of the group. Without this, however, as Mark Zuckerberg said in 2017, “Social media can contribute to divisiveness and isolation.” Indeed, when used for virtue signalling, shaming, or aggressive confrontation, they can create a new form of crowd behaviour: the electronic herd.
In his new book <i>A Time to Build</i>, Yuval Levin argues that social media have undermined our social lives. “They plainly encourage the vices most dangerous to a free society. They drive us to speak without listening, to approach others confrontationally rather than graciously, to spread conspiracies and rumours, to dismiss and ignore what we would rather not hear, to make the private public, to oversimplify a complex world, to react to one another much too quickly and curtly. They eat away at our capacity for patient toleration, our decorum, our forbearance, our restraint.” These are crowd behaviours, not community ones.
The downsides of crowds are still with us. So too are the upsides of community, as Melanie Reid’s Scottish pub demonstrates.
<b>I believe that creating community takes hard work, and that few things in life are more worthwhile. Building something with others, we discover the joy of becoming part of something greater than we could ever achieve alone.</b>
<b>QUESTION TO PONDER</b>
<i>What communities have you experienced through being part of a team that builds something together?</i>
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>A covenantal society is a moral community, future-oriented, goal-directed, whose citizens are on a journey towards a destination. That does not mean that people must always agree. On the contrary.... What they share, though, is their emphasis on responsibility, personal, mutual, reciprocal, and collective.
It is this combination of personal and collective responsibility that gives covenantal societies their energy. They enlist citizens. They generate ideals. They see us all as co-builders.... Covenant democratises responsibility. It creates active citizens. It is a politics of empowerment. It sees society as the home we build together.

<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>Where do Jews go to “build together” and become a community? What do they build?
Are crowds always negative and communities always positive?
Why do you think these two phenomena have the same Hebrew root (<i>k-h-l</i>)? Is there a message in that?
<b>EDUCATIONAL COMPANION TO THE QUESTIONS</b>
<b><i>IN A NUTSHELL</i></b><br>In the next <i>parasha</i>, <i>Pekudei</i>, Rabbi Sacks connects Shabbat and the <i>Mishkan</i> as holy time (Shabbat) and holy space (the <i>Mishkan,</i> or the synagogue today); both are institutions where we can rest and take respite from the chaos of the world and connect to Hashem. The Rabbis in the Talmud connect Shabbat and the <i>Mishkan</i> and learn the categories of “work” (<i>melakha</i>) forbidden on Shabbat from the creative acts of work that contributed to the building of the <i>Mishkan</i>. But in this <i>Covenant &amp; Conversation</i> essay, Rabbi Sacks speaks about community and working as a team. The <i>Mishkan</i> was a project that brought the people together in teamwork, and Shabbat brings families and communities together each week also.
<b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>Without leadership, humans are prone to herd-like behaviour. In a large crowd they may suspend their own independent thought. Therefore, if crowds are not led by strong and virtuous leaders, their behaviour can lead to negative outcomes (such as violence or mob-like actions).
Crowds can be experienced in everyday life at music concerts, and at sporting or other cultural events, for example. They are not negative by definition, but can lead to negative outcomes if not managed. (For example, football crowds in England in the 1980s had a disturbing reputation for violence). The same group of people coming together for a values-based initiative (for example, a gathering for worship or social activism) can be considered a community. The best example of community most people have experienced is a community of worship such as a synagogue, where people come together for a shared ideal or value.
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br>Every Jewish community (and equally, other faith communities) operates in a similar way (even if they aren’t renovating and running a pub or a community centre). A Jewish community has a whole army of volunteers who make things happen, week in and week out. They give of their free time (while often having very demanding professional and family lives) to make sure all aspects of their <i>shul</i> and their community run smoothly (a Jewish community is far more than just prayer services after, all).
In the <i>parasha</i> we see the list of all the people’s contributions to the <i>Mishkan</i>. Rabbi Sacks suggests: “Moshe sought to create community by getting the people to make personal contributions to a collective project, the <i>Mishkan</i>.” Each person brought something different and each person’s contribution was valued individually. Through these efforts they became united in a positive way, for a common purpose.
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>A community based around a building project of some sort for young people could include being a counsellor at a youth movement or camp, or being part of a sports team, school club, youth service, play or group performance, band, or even a school project.
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>The most common example of this would be a synagogue community. Many different things are “built” in a synagogue community, such as educational projects, social programmes, welfare, and social activism initiatives. A school community is another example of a group of people (lay leaders/parents as well as professionals) who come together to build something (a school) and develop a community as a by-product of their endeavours.
Crowds are not necessarily negative groups, although they are more likely to descend into negative behaviour than a community. A crowd found at a sporting or music event does not usually become negative and destructive (although it can), but it normally does not transition into a community with leadership, either. A community that comes together to build something based on values and ideals can also become destructive in its vision (humans are a tribal species and this can result in communities that are inward-looking and do not work for the betterment of humanity). It certainly helps to have the right leaders, guiding us towards positive actions.
The similar root of these words tells us they are two sides of the same phenomenon. When people come together, it can become a force for good (with the right leadership and values) or a force for bad (with no leadership, or the wrong leadership, and the wrong values). Like everything in this world, it can be used for the good or for the bad, and only we can determine the ultimate result.

II; The Beauty of Holiness or the Holiness of Beauty

<big><strong>II. The Beauty of Holiness or the Holiness of Beauty</strong></big><br><b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br><i>“Then Moshe said to the Israelites, ‘See, the Lord has chosen Betzalel, son of Uri, the son of Ḥur, of the tribe of Yehuda, and He has filled him with the spirit of God, with wisdom, understanding, and knowledge in all kinds of crafts – to make artistic designs for work in gold, silver, and bronze, to cut and set stones, to work in wood and to engage in all kinds of artistic craftsmanship’”</i> (Shemot 35:30–33).
In both the last <i>parasha</i>, <i>Ki Tisa,</i> and in this <i>parasha</i>, <i>Vayak’hel</i>, we meet Betzalel, the builder of the <i>Mishkan</i>. He is a rare character type in the Hebrew Bible – the artist, the craftsman, the maker of beauty in the service of God, the man who, together with Oholiav, created the <i>Mishkan</i> and the objects used in it. Judaism – in sharp contrast to ancient Greece – was always a little uncomfortable with the visual arts. The reason is clear: we have a biblical ban against sculptured images because of idolatry. Historically, images, charms, icons, and statues were linked in the ancient world with pagan religious practices. The idea that one could worship “the work of men’s hands” was opposite to the message of biblical Judaism.
The key to understanding Betzalel and his artistic role lies in his name. It means “In the shadow of God.” Betzalel’s gift lay in his ability to communicate, through his work, that art is the shadow cast by God. Religious art is never “art for art’s sake.” Unlike secular art, it points to something beyond itself. The <i>Mishkan</i> itself was a kind of microcosm of the universe, with a unique function: that in it you felt the presence of something beyond – what the Torah calls “the glory of God” that  “filled the <i>Mishkan</i>” (Shemot 40:35).
Art in Judaism always has a spiritual purpose: to make us aware of the universe as a work of art, testifying to the supreme Artist, God Himself.

<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. Why do you think this poem is entitled “God the Artist”?</i>
<i>2. What similarities do you think art and nature have? Can you find God in both?</i>
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>Judaism is a culture of the ear, not the eye. As a religion of the invisible God, it attaches sanctity to words heard, rather than objects seen. Hence there is a generally negative attitude within Judaism towards representational art.
Art is not forbidden as such; there is a difference between three-dimensional and two-dimensional representation. As Rabbi Meir of Rothenburg (c. 1215–1293) made clear, “[An illustrated book] does not infringe the biblical prohibition…[illustrations] are merely flat patches of colour lacking sufficient materiality [to constitute a graven image].” Indeed several ancient synagogues in Israel had quite elaborate mosaics. In general, however, art was less emphasised in Judaism than in Christian cultures in which the Hellenistic (ancient Greece) influence was strong.
Positive references to art in the rabbinic literature are rare. One exception is Rambam, who recommends as a cure for depression enjoying things that “delight the soul” such as listening to music, walking in gardens and fine buildings, and by sitting before beautiful forms. The very terms in which Rambam describes the aesthetic experience make it clear, however, that he sees art in strictly instrumental terms, as a way of relieving depression. There is no suggestion that it has value in its own right.
It was Samson Raphael Hirsch who distinguished ancient Greece from ancient Israel in terms of the contrast between aesthetics (the philosophy of beauty) and ethics. In his comment on the verse, “May God enlarge Yefet and let him dwell in the tents of Shem” (Bereshit 9:27), he observes: “The stem of Yefet reached its fullest blossoming in the Greeks; that of Shem in the Hebrews…Yefet has ennobled the world aesthetically. Shem has enlightened it spiritually and morally.”
Yet as we see from the case of Betzalel, Judaism is not uninterested in aesthetics. The concept of <i>hiddur mitzva</i>, “beautifying the commandment,” meant, for the Sages, that we should strive to fulfil the commands in the most visually pleasing way. The priestly garments were meant to be “for honour and adornment” (Shemot 28:2). The very terms applied to Betzalel – wisdom, understanding, and knowledge – are applied by the book of Mishlei to God Himself as Creator of the universe: “The Lord founded the earth by wisdom; He established the heavens by understanding; by His knowledge the depths burst apart, and the skies distilled dew” (Mishlei 3:19–20).
The strongest positive statement on art of which I am aware was made by Rabbi Avraham HaKohen Kook, the first Ashkenazi chief rabbi of (pre-State) Israel, describing his time in London during the First World War:
<i>When I lived in London, I used to visit the National Gallery, and my favourite pictures were those of Rembrandt. I really think that Rembrandt was a tzaddik. Do you know that when I first saw Rembrandt’s works, they reminded me of the legend about the creation of light? We are told that when God created the light [on the first day], it was so strong and pellucid, that one could see from one end of the world to the other, but God was afraid that the wicked might abuse it. What did He do? He reserved that light for the righteous when the Messiah should come. But now and then there are great men who are blessed and privileged to see it. I think that Rembrandt was one of them, and the light in his pictures is the very light that was originally created by God Almighty.</i>
Rembrandt is known to have had a special affection for Jews. He visited them in his hometown of Amsterdam, and painted them as well as many scenes from the Hebrew Bible. I suspect that what Rabbi Kook saw in his paintings, though, was Rembrandt’s ability to convey the beauty of ordinary people. He makes no attempt (most notably in his self-portraits) to beautify or idealise his subjects. The light that shines from them is, simply, their humanity.
The Greeks, and many in the Western world who inherited their tradition, believed in the holiness of beauty. Jews believed in the opposite: <i>hadrat kodesh</i>, the beauty of holiness. “Give to the Lord the glory due to His name; worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness” (Tehillim 29:2).
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>Judaism also recognises a dual epistemology. There are two ways of knowing. One is called<i> ḥokhma</i>, “wisdom,” the other is Torah, “teaching, instruction, law, guidance.” The difference was stated clearly by the Sages: “If you are told that there is wisdom among the nations, believe it. If you are told there is Torah among the nations, do not believe it” (Eikha Rabba 17).
We can now state the difference between the two modes of knowledge. <i>Ḥokhma</i> is the truth we discover; Torah is the truth we inherit. <i>Ḥokhma</i> is the universal heritage of humankind; Torah is the specific heritage of Israel. <i>Ḥokhma</i> is what we attain by being in the image of God; Torah is what guides Jews as the people of God. <i>Ḥokhma</i> is acquired by seeing and reasoning; Torah is received by listening and responding. <i>Ḥokhma</i> tells us what is; Torah tells us what ought to be. <i>Ḥokhma</i> is about facts; Torah is about commands. <i>Ḥokhma</i> yields descriptive, scientific laws; Torah yields prescriptive, behavioural laws. <i>Ḥokhma</i> is about creation; Torah is about revelation…. We can now state the following. <i>Ḥokhma</i> has an honourable place within the Jewish worldview. It has religious dignity. It is the gift of God. It is available to everyone, because everyone is in the image of God.
We can also hazard the following definition: <i>ḥokhma</i> is what allows us to understand the world as God’s work (science) and the human person as His image (the humanities).

<b>EDUCATIONAL COMPANION TO THE QUESTIONS</b>
<b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>The core value of Judaism is ethical monotheism – the belief in one God who guides humanity in morality and ethical behaviour. Therefore, one of the central prohibitions of Judaism is the worship of other “gods.” Historically, idolatry (the general term for polytheism – worshipping multiple gods) often took the form of the worship of graven images that had been created by man. Because of this, Judaism has a distrust of all graven images, even those that were not created for this purpose. Historically, this discomfort was sometimes even extended to other visual arts such as paintings and mosaics.
The world around us is a reflection of God’s greatness. It is an expression of God’s spiritual truth and the beauty of the holiness of God, which can be accessed through exploring the natural sciences. So too with the social sciences, which aim to understand humanity (which is in itself an integral part of God’s creation). The arts are similarly a cultural expression of the spiritual goodness contained in human beings. The message of Betzalel’s name, “in the shadow of God,” is that just as the sciences are a reflection of God, so too can the arts be.
For some people, art may be a difficult medium through which to connect to God. However, if we widen the definition of art to its broadest sense, it could include contemporary popular culture. (For some this could even include sports as an expression of the creativity and beauty of humans and their endeavours!) All of these are examples of culture in its broadest sense, offering people the opportunity to find a spiritual connection to God and the world through whichever mode of art and culture best speaks to them. If visual art doesn’t do it for you, there could well be another mode of culture that does.
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br>This poem describes the beauty of nature and reflects on God as the Creator of nature. By describing God as an artist in the title of the poem, the poet is comparing an artist who uses paint on canvas to create beauty to God creating beauty when He created the world.
Apart from the beauty in both art and nature, just as nature is created by God and is a path to be inspired by and connect to God, so art is also indirectly created by God (because it is created by humans who are themselves created in the image of God), and therefore art can also be a path to becoming inspired by and connecting to God. Nature and art are just two examples of things in the world that could potentially be a route to connecting to God.
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>Art fits into the area of knowledge that Rabbi Sacks terms <i>ḥokhma</i>. <i>Ḥokhma</i> includes the natural sciences and the social sciences, as well as cultural expressions of humanity, such as the visual arts and literature. They are all ways of exploring and understanding the world that God created, and the living creations that exist in this world, including humans.
Science, art, and Torah are all ways to understand God and the world He created. They are each created by God Himself, whether directly or indirectly, and therefore each one is a path to understanding and connecting to God, and the world that He created. Science helps us to understand the world God created, and art, as an expression of humanity, helps us to understand humanity and experience the creative spark that humans were given by God. Torah is also a creation of God, and this is a direct path to understanding and connecting to God.
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>While Rambam admits that art could be a source of spiritual healing and calm for a soul that is “melancholy,” according to Rabbi Sacks, Rambam sees art only as a means to an end – as a solution to a spiritual problem. Rabbi Kook, on the other hand, sees the possibility that art could contain spiritual beauty in and of itself, and therefore he speaks of its intrinsic spiritual value.
The name Betzalel means “in the shadow of God.” Betzalel’s gift as an artist was his ability to reflect God in his artistic work. The message in his name is that art can be an expression of the spiritual beauty of the world and a means to connect to God.
In the description of creation in the first chapter of Bereshit, light is created on the first day, yet the sun and the constellations were only created on the fourth. Rabbinic tradition sees this as a contradiction in the text and interprets the light created on the first day as a spiritual light that was from that point on, hidden until the end of days (<i>or ganuz</i>), with only the very righteous able to perceive it until then. Rabbi Kook believed that Rembrandt could see this light and had found a way to represent it in his paintings. This must have made Rembrandt one of the very righteous (and therefore he describes him as a <i>tzaddik</i>). Rabbi Kook enjoyed visiting the National Gallery to experience this light in Rembrandt’s paintings.
According to Rabbi Sacks, the spiritual light that Rembrandt managed to express in his paintings seems to emanate from the people themselves, who are in every other way ordinary. He suggests that the source of the light is their very humanity.
This explains how art is an expression of our humanity, and can be a means for connecting to God and to the spiritual dimension of the universe. This is why Rabbi Sacks describes art as “the shadow of God” (the meaning of Betzalel’s name).

Pekudei

In a Nutshell

<b><i>IN A NUTSHELL</i></b><br>In <i>Parashat Pekudei</i>, we complete the reading of the book of Shemot, but the story doesn’t come to an end. Moshe says that all the donations given should be counted, and the people should record, in detail, how these contributions are each used. The priestly garments are made and Moshe finally sets up the <i>Mishkan</i> (the portable Temple). Once this is completed, the <i>Mishkan</i> becomes filled with the glory of Hashem.
<b>QUESTION TO PONDER</b>
<i>Why do you think the Torah goes into such detail about the contributions of the people to the</i> Mishkan<i>?</i>

I; The Blessed Power of Order

<big><strong>I. The Blessed Power of Order</strong></big><br><b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br><b>The Question:</b> <i>Pekudei</i> – in fact, the whole series of chapters beginning with <i>Teruma</i> and <i>Tetzaveh</i> and finishing with <i>Vayak’hel</i> and <i>Pekudei</i> – is an extraordinary way for the book of Shemot to end. The rest of the book is a stormy story of the Israelites’ exile and enslavement and the confrontation between the ruler of Egypt and the man he may have grown up with in the palace, Moshe, now the leader of the Hebrew slaves. It is about the most dramatic divine intervention in history, a story of signs and wonders, miracles and deliverances. Nature itself is overturned as a people fleeing from persecution cross a sea on dry land while the chariots of Pharaoh’s army are stuck fast in the mud. It is the world’s most famous story of freedom. Films have been made of it. Many oppressed people have based their hopes on it.
Its natural culmination should surely have been chapters 19–24: the revelation of God at Mount Sinai, the covenant between God and the people, the Ten Commandments, and the civil laws that followed. This is surely where the story has been heading all along: the formalisation of a relationship that would bind God to a people and a people to God, bringing heaven down to earth and lifting a people from earth to heaven.
How can this long story of the construction of the <i>Mishkan</i> possibly be relevant, told first in <i>Teruma</i> and <i>Tetzaveh</i> as God’s command to Moshe, and in <i>Vayak’hel</i> and <i>Pekudei</i> as Moshe’s command to the people and a description of how they carried it out? It has nothing to do with miracles. It seems to have nothing to do with freedom. The chief actor in these chapters is not God but the people who bring the contributions and Betzalel, the master craftsman, and those who work with him, including the women who spun goats’ hair into cloth, brought gifts, and gave their mirrors for the bronze washbasin. Most of the narrative reads as if it belongs to Vayikra, the book of holiness, rather than Shemot, the book of freedom.

<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br><i>Michael was learning about the Ten Commandments with his class in school when his teacher Miss Sharon explained that just as Hashem gave us special rules to live our life by, so we have rules in school and in other places in our lives.</i>
<i>“Can you think of any rules in our class?” asked Miss Sharon. A few of Michael’s friends put up their hands to answer, but Michael just sat there looking grumpy.</i>
<i>“You shouldn’t hit anyone,” Julie answered. “You have to help at clean-up time,” said Rachel. “You mustn’t stand on the furniture,” added Sam.</i>
<i>Miss Sharon turned to Michael and asked him if everything was okay. “I don’t like rules,” Michael replied with a frown. “It would be so much more fun in school if there were no rules!”</i>
<i>“Okay then, Michael, let’s try it tomorrow with no rules!” said Miss Sharon with a smile and with a cheer from the children.</i>
<i>The next morning, Michael ran into class with a big smile, excited for the day ahead, until he tripped over Julie’s backpack that was lying on the floor. “Sorry,” called Julie from across the room, “but there are no rules today!”</i>
<i>Michael shrugged and went to the puzzle table to begin playing, but Rachel grabbed one of the pieces before he could finish the puzzle. “Hey, I need that!” cried Michael, but Rachel ran away, calling over her shoulder, “No rules today, remember!”</i>
<i>Then for show and tell, Michael tried to show his friends his new toy dinosaur, but none of his friends would listen. “It’s my turn now! You have to be quiet,” Michael demanded. “No, we don’t,” said David, “because there are no rules today!”</i>
<i>At snack time, Jonah playfully grabbed some of Michael’s crackers without asking. Michael didn’t say anything, because there were no rules that day…but he was sad.</i>
<i>“What’s wrong, Michael?” asked Miss Sharon gently. “I thought having no rules would be fun and mean I could do whatever I want,” said Michael, “but I haven’t been able to do anything I wanted to today. I guess rules are important. Rules show people how to care about each other.”</i>
<i>“You’re absolutely right,” said Miss Sharon with a kind smile. “That’s why Hashem gave us the Torah and that’s why we have rules here at school.”</i>
<i>“Can we go back to having rules tomorrow, Miss Sharon?” asked Michael. “How about right now?” replied Miss Sharon.</i>

<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. What would life be like without rules?</i>
<i>2. Why can’t people just know how to treat each other and not need rules to show them?</i>
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br><b>The answer:</b> The Torah is telling us something profound and still relevant today, but to understand it we must approach it in stages. The first fascinating fact is that the Torah uses very similar language to describe the Israelites’ creation of the <i>Mishkan</i> and God’s creation of the universe. This is how the Torah describes the completion of the <i>Mishkan</i>:
“So all the <i>work</i> on the <i>Mishkan</i>, the Tent of Meeting, was <i>completed</i>. The Israelites did everything just as the Lord commanded Moshe.... Moshe inspected the <i>work</i> and saw that they had done it just as the Lord had commanded. So Moshe <i>blessed</i> them” (Shemot 39:32, 43).
And this is how the Torah describes the conclusion of the creation of the universe:
“The heavens and the earth were <i>completed</i> in all their vast array. On the seventh day God finished the <i>work</i> He had been doing; so on the seventh day He rested from all His <i>work</i>. Then God <i>blessed</i> the seventh day and made it holy, because on it He rested from all the <i>work</i> of creating that He had done” (Bereshit 2:1–3).
Three key words appear in both passages: “work,” “completed,” and “blessed.” These verbal echoes are not accidental. They are how the Torah signals intertextuality, that is, hinting that one law or story is to be read in the context of another. In this case the Torah is emphasising that Shemot ends as Bereshit began, with a work of creation. Note the difference as well as the similarity. Bereshit began with an act of <i>divine</i> creation. Shemot ends with an act of <i>human</i> creation.
The closer we examine the two texts, the more we see how intricately the parallel has been constructed. The creation account in Bereshit is tightly organised around a series of sevens. There are seven days of creation. The word “good” appears seven times, the word “God” thirty-five times, and the word “earth” twenty-one times. The opening verse of Bereshit contains seven words, the second fourteen, and the three concluding verses thirty-five words. The complete text is 469 (7×67) words.
The account of the construction of the <i>Mishkan</i> in <i>Vayak’hel-Pekudei</i> is similarly built around the number seven. The word “heart” appears seven times in Shemot 35:5–29, as Moshe specifies the materials to be used in the construction, and seven times again in 35:34–36:8, the description of how the craftsmen Betzalel and Oholiav were to carry out the work. The word <i>teruma</i>, “contribution,” appears seven times in this section. In chapter 39, describing the making of the priestly vestments, the phrase “as God commanded Moshe” occurs seven times. It occurs again seven times in chapter 40.
So, first conclusion: The language and construction of the two passages is meant to direct us to a comparison. <i>The Israelites’ creation of the Mishkan was a counterpart of God’s creation of the universe.</i> But how? How can we compare a tiny building with the entire universe? And how can we compare the assembly of pre-existing materials with the divine creation of something from nothing?
We need another step. The first chapter of Bereshit describes God creating a universe of order. “God said, ‘Let there be…’ and there was…and God saw that it was good.” For the first three days, He created domains: day and night, upper and lower waters, and sea and dry land. On the next three days, He placed the appropriate objects or life forms in each domain: the sun, moon, and stars; birds and fish; animals and humans. At the end of the sixth day we read, “God saw all that He had made, and it was very good,” meaning, each element was good in itself and they were in a balanced relationship with one another. The entire account exudes harmony. In the beginning, God created order.
Then He created humans and they created chaos: first Adam and Ḥava, then Kayin, then the generation of the Flood, to the point at which the Torah tells us that God regretted that He had created humanity on earth (Bereshit 6). The story of the opening chapters of Bereshit is thus the descent from order to chaos.
We now begin to see what the <i>Mishkan</i> really was. It was a <i>tikkun</i>, a mending, of the sin of the Golden Calf. The Torah says relatively little about the calf but a great deal about the Israelites’ behaviour. First, they gathered menacingly against Aharon, who seems to have been fearing for his life. Then, once the calf had been made, they ate and drank and rose “to engage in revelry.” When Moshe came down the mountain he saw the people “running wild, for Aharon had let them run beyond control and become a laughingstock to their enemies.” This is a portrait of chaos. Order had completely broken down. The people had allowed themselves to be swept up, first by fear, then by frenzied celebration.
The <i>tikkun</i> for chaos is order. The <i>Mishkan</i>, with its precisely delineated dimensions and materials, put together from the voluntary contributions of the people, fashioned by a craftsman under divine inspiration, was just that: a microcosm of pure order.
So the end of Shemot is not quite an echo of the beginning of Bereshit: it is an antidote to it. If humanity can reduce God’s order to chaos, then humanity must show that it can rescue order from chaos. That is the journey the Israelites must take from the Golden Calf to the making of the <i>Mishkan</i>. We can travel from chaos to order.
The Golden Calf was the ill-judged, unplanned, chaotic answer to the genuine question the Israelites were asking: what shall we do, here in the middle of the wilderness, without Moshe to act as our intermediary with God? The <i>Mishkan</i> was the real answer. It was the enduring sign that the Divine Presence was in their midst, even without a prophet like Moshe. In fact, once the <i>Mishkan</i> was completed and dedicated, Moshe had no further role within it. Its service was led not by prophets but by priests. Priests are masters of order.
The <i>Mishkan</i>, the Temple, and the synagogue, different though they are, were in place what Shabbat is in time. They all represent an ideal realm of order, the way God wanted our world to be. Entering them we step out of the social world with its conflicts and strife, hostilities and injustices, and find ourselves under the wings of the Divine Presence, sensing the harmony of the heavens and the cleansing of the spirit when we come to atone for our sins or offer thanks for our blessings. This is where we can always find God’s indwelling spirit. This is the antidote to the travesty we so often make of God’s world.
There is another reality. <b>I believe that sacred time, Shabbat, and sacred space, the <i>Mishkan</i>/Temple/synagogue, are where the restless soul finds rest; where hearts open and minds soar; where we know we are part of something larger than this time, this place; where if we listen, we can hear the song creation sings to its Creator; where we bring our sins and failings to God and are cleansed; where we sense that life has an order we must learn to honour; and where God is close – not at the top of a mountain but here in our midst.</b> There must be a time and place where we recognise that not all is chaos. That is why Shemot ends with the <i>Mishkan</i>. Freedom exists where order rules.
<b>QUESTION TO PONDER</b>
<i>What do Shabbat and the</i> Mishkan<i> have in common here?</i>
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>The world is a place in which God creates order, but humanity has a tendency to create chaos. That is why we need law, lawyers, police, courts, and judges. Central to the biblical vision is an ordered universe where everything has its integrity and place. Hence the significance of (moral) boundaries. The reason why God tells Adam and Ḥava not to eat from one of the trees in the Garden of Eden is to establish that even in paradise there are boundaries.
<b><i>The Power of Ideas,</i> 269</b>
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>Where else in Judaism can we see a focus on order?
Is there also room for spontaneity in Judaism?
How can we make order from chaos in our lives and in the world as a whole?
<b>EDUCATIONAL COMPANION TO THE QUESTIONS</b>
<b><i>IN A NUTSHELL</i></b><br>The Torah cares about our contributions. It focuses on the details to show the people in a good light, noting how generously they gave and how committed to this national project they were – it was important to them to actively help to build a Sanctuary for the worship of God. This was clearly in contrast with their behaviour surrounding the Golden Calf incident. God is interested in a partnership in redeeming the world, and if the <i>Mishkan</i> represents order in the world as an antidote to the chaos created by humankind (as Rabbi Sacks argues in this <i>Covenant &amp; Conversation</i> essay) then it is important that the people partner in its creation, and this was their contribution.
<b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>The question here is, why does the Torah pause the narrative (which should continue with the Israelites travelling to the Promised Land) and spend chapters describing the building of the <i>Mishkan</i>? The classic answer is that this is the <i>tikkun</i> (antidote or fix) to the story of the Golden Calf. There are other ways of finding meaning in these chapters and the place we find them, including the idea Rabbi Sacks shares here.
The fact that God is not the main actor in this section of the Torah makes sense if the <i>Mishkan</i> is a <i>tikkun</i> for the Golden Calf (the people need to fix the mess they have created) and this also is an appropriate approach in the context of the message of this <i>Covenant &amp; Conversation</i> essay, which suggests that it is humankind who creates chaos, and the <i>Mishkan</i> represents the order necessary to fix this. It is fitting that it is the people who create the order that is a response to the chaos they have created.
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br>As we saw in the story, the answer to this question is chaos! But can we expect anything more from grown-ups in adult society? The Torah describes the chaos of society with no rules in the story of the Flood as the reason God wanted to destroy the entire world.
The early stories of Bereshit illustrate that humankind cannot be relied on to create a just society based on fairness, where the weak have the same rights as the strong. This is why every society has some sort of rules and legal system to ensure that its members are moral and everyone has freedom and is protected.
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>Both Shabbat and the <i>Mishkan</i> have many intricate laws associated with them. They both parallel the original creation, and are ways that people can create their own order from the chaos of the outside world. They are both a calm oasis protecting us from the chaos of the everyday outside world (the synagogue as an outgrowth of the <i>Mishkan</i>/Temple can function in this way and also has a focus on details and order).
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>Judaism is a religion of details. It is a religion of practice and law. The system of halakha is highly detail oriented, providing a clear and ordered framework for moral and spiritual living. There is also a clear weekly and annual rhythm of Jewish living in the form of Shabbat and the <i>ḥagim</i>. The prayerbook itself is called a Siddur, which means “order,” giving Jews an order through which to channel their devotion and service of God. Judaism as a whole gives Jews an ordered framework in which to experience a world that can often be full of disorder.
At the same time, Judaism is a religion of love and spirituality, and these often need to be given space for individual expression. So even within a highly structured approach to prayer (with many intricate laws and a well-ordered prayer service and prayerbook), there are opportunities for spontaneous spirituality. There are also schools of Jewish philosophy that focus more on spiritual spontaneity, such as Hasidism. Judaism tries to provide a balance between the two approaches.
Judaism as a belief system and as a practical way of life creates order for us in a world of disorder. Judaism also expects of us to show responsibility in redeeming the world, by making order from the chaos through working to build just societies where everyone has equal rights to a life of freedom.

II; On Jewish Character

<big><strong>II. On Jewish Character</strong></big><br><b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>This <i>parasha</i> could almost be mistaken for a mathematics lesson in school. It begins with calculations of all the money and materials that were donated by the people to make the Tabernacle. But if you look past all the sums and numbers, there is a deep message here that follows on from two extraordinary stories. One is told in the last <i>parasha</i>, the other in the one before. Together, these teach us something deep about Jewish nature that is still true today.
The first incident is when God told Moshe to ask the people to contribute materials to the building of the <i>Mishkan</i>. They brought gold, silver, and copper. They also brought wool, linen, animal skins, acacia wood, oil, spices, and incense. Some even gave precious stones for the high priest’s breastplate. What was remarkable was how willing the people were to give. In fact, they brought so much that Moshe had to tell them to stop!
We often see the Israelites argue and complain, but here we see a people with a deep wish to give.
One <i>parasha</i> earlier, we read a very different story. Moshe had been up the mountain for a long time and the people had become worried. Was he still alive? If not, how would they receive the divine word telling them what to do and where to go? So they asked Aharon to make them a golden calf, to be an oracle, an object through which God could speak to them.
Aharon, according to many commentators, realised that he could not stop the people by simply refusing, so he tried to slow them down instead. He asked them to bring him their precious jewellery. According to the Midrash, he thought this would create arguments within families and the project would be delayed.
Instead, immediately thereafter, without a pause, we read: “So all the people took off their earrings and brought them to Aharon” (Shemot 32:3). Here again is the same generosity we saw with the <i>Mishkan</i>.
These two projects could not be less alike. One, the <i>Mishkan</i>, was holy. The other, the making of the Golden Calf, was close to creating an idol. Building the <i>Mishkan</i> was a supreme mitzva; making the calf was a terrible sin. Yet the people’s response was the same in both cases.
That is why the Sages said, “One cannot understand the nature of this people. If they are asked to give for a calf, they give. If they are asked to give for the <i>Mishkan</i>, they give!”
The common factor was the people’s characteristic of generosity. Jews may not always make the right choices in what they give to, but they <i>give</i>.
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. Why do you think the people were so generous when they contributed to the</i> Mishkan?

<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br><i>On February 24, 2017, at two o’clock in the morning, arsonists broke into a mosque in Tampa, Florida, and torched the building. Police soon concluded that this was a hate crime, shocking the local community. Later that day Adeel Karim, a worshipper at the mosque, set up a crowdfunding page called Stand With New Tampa Muslims Against Hate, in order to raise funds to rebuild the mosque. The community rallied, and within less than a week the campaign had reached $60,000, surpassing his original goal of $40,000.</i>
<i>But Adeel noticed something strange about many of the donations they had received. “I couldn’t understand why people were donating in what seemed like weird amounts to the cause,” he wrote on Facebook later that week. “There are sums of $18, $36, $72, etc. Then I figured out after clicking on the names Avi, Cohen, Goldstein, Rubin…. Jews donate in multiples of 18 as a form of what is called ‘</i>chai<i>.’ It wishes the recipient a long life.”</i>
<i>“The Jewish faith has shown up in force to support our New Tampa Islamic community. I’m floored,” the post continued. It concluded with the hashtag #chaidelivered.</i>
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. What is the symbolism behind giving charity in multiples of eighteen?</i>
<i>2. Why do you think so many Jews gave to this cause?</i>
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>In the twelfth century, Rambam twice interrupts his customary calm legal prose in his law code, the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, to make the same point. Speaking about <i>tzedaka</i>, charity, he says: <i>“We have never seen or heard about a Jewish community which does not have a charity fund”</i> (<i>Hilkhot Mattenot Aniyim</i> 9:3).
The idea that a Jewish community could exist without a network of charitable provisions was almost inconceivable. Later in the same book, Rambam says:
<i>“We are obligated to be more scrupulous in fulfilling the commandment of</i> tzedaka<i> than any other positive commandment because</i> tzedaka<i> is the sign of the righteous person, a descendant of Avraham our father, as it is said, ‘For I know him, that he will command his children…to do</i> tzedaka<i>’…. If someone is cruel and does not show mercy, there are sufficient grounds to suspect his lineage…. Whoever refuses to give charity is called ‘</i>belial<i>,’ the same term which is applied to idol worshippers</i> (<i>Hilkhot Mattenot Aniyim</i> 10:1–3).
Rambam is here saying more than simply “Jews give charity.” He is saying that the characteristic of being charitable is written into Jewish genes, part of our inherited DNA. It is one of the signs of being a child of Avraham, so much so that if someone does not give charity there are “grounds to suspect his lineage.” Whether this is nature or nurture or both, to be Jewish is to give.
There is a fascinating feature of the geography of the land of Israel. It contains two seas: the Sea of Galilee and the Dead Sea. The Sea of Galilee is full of life. The Dead Sea, as its name implies, is not. Yet they are fed by the same river, the Jordan. The difference is that the Sea of Galilee receives water and also gives water. The Dead Sea receives but does not give. To receive but not to give is, in Jewish geography as well as Jewish psychology, simply not life.
So it was in the time of Moshe. So it is today. In virtually every country in which Jews live, their charitable giving is out of all proportion to their numbers. In Judaism, to live is to give.
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br><i>Tzedaka</i> means both justice and charity, because we believe that they go hand in hand. Justice is impersonal, charity is personal. We call God <i>Avinu Malkeinu</i>, “Our Father, our King.” A king dispenses justice, a parent gives a child a gift out of love. That is the meaning of <i>tzedaka</i>, an act that combines both justice and love. Giving to others is one of the most beautiful things we can do, and one of the most creative. We create possibilities for other people. We soften some of the rough edges of the world. We help alleviate poverty and pain. We give God the sacrifice He most desires of us: that we honour His image in other people.
Nothing more marks Judaism as a religion of love than its emphasis on <i>tzedaka</i>. We do not accept poverty, hunger, homelessness, or disease as God’s will. To the contrary, God’s will is that we heal these fractures in His world. As God feeds the hungry, so must we. As God heals the sick, so must we. We become good by doing good. We walk in God’s ways by acting out of love.

What do you think Rabbi Sacks means by “the characteristic of being charitable is written into Jewish genes, part of our inherited DNA”?
Can you give any examples from your experience of the Jewish character trait of giving?
<b>EDUCATIONAL COMPANION TO THE QUESTIONS</b>
<b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>We can only speculate as to the motivation behind the generosity shown by the Israelites when they contributed to the building of the <i>Mishkan</i>. Perhaps it was the people’s eagerness to perform this historic mitzva – simply carrying out the word and instruction of God. Or maybe the importance of this particular commandment – the building of the <i>Mishkan</i>, the focus of the divine service – was the motivating factor. Possibly more than that, the people wanted to feel a part of this mitzva, to feel ownership, so they could feel they had a role in the worship of God through the sacrificial service (which was largely performed centrally, on behalf of the people, by the priests). However, Rabbi Sacks is also suggesting that it is an inherent character trait of Jews to be generous, and this is the overarching motivating factor behind the generosity seen in this story.
Despite the clearly problematic methods the people chose, they were desperate to have an intermediary between them and God. Moshe had served in this role, and in his absence they forced Aharon to create a replacement. Their underlying motivation was their connection to and service of God. The second positive aspect to the story is the unhesitatingly generous response to Aharon’s call for jewellery to create the Golden Calf. The Midrash suggests that Aharon requested this from the people assuming they would hesitate and this would delay the process long enough for Moshe to return. Or perhaps it would put the people off entirely. But because generosity was a core value of the people, his plan did not work.
It is hard to imagine that there is a generosity gene that can be found in the DNA of the Jewish people, and certainly science has not yet discovered one if it exists. So then we must assume it is nurture. This core value of giving is at the centre of Judaism’s philosophy, and it can be found both in the narrative of its classical texts, and at the heart of its ethical code. Therefore, it comes as second nature to every Jew to be generous.
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br>The numerical value of the Hebrew word for life – <i>ḥai</i> – is eighteen. This explains why so many Jews give charity in multiples of eighteen. It symbolises the will to life, and is a statement of intent – the wish that this contribution should create and sustain life.
Although the message of <i>The Core Idea</i> is that generosity is an inherently Jewish value and character trait, it is natural that people give charity to their immediate community before looking to give beyond. (“Charity begins at home” is in fact a halakhic concept expressed clearly in Rambam’s <i>Mishneh Torah</i>.) However, in this case, it seems that many Jews were inspired to give charity to a community that was not their own. It could be that this was to engender a feeling of peace and goodwill between the two communities, or perhaps this was also a case of Jews saying, “We know what it is like to be persecuted and attacked, and we have your back.”
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>Charity can be defined as an act of generosity to aid the poor, ill, or helpless. The root of the Hebrew word <i>tzedaka</i> is <i>tz</i>-<i>d</i>-<i>k</i> – which means justice. Charity is focused more on the individual (whether the giver or the recipient) and the individual act, as opposed to <i>tzedaka,</i> which is focused on healing society and redressing the injustices of poverty and helplessness that inflict a wound on society.
The focus of charity is the giver – it is his/her generosity. However, the focus of <i>tzedaka</i> is the recipient – that the injustice of his/her life should be redressed through the act of <i>tzedaka</i>. <i>Tzedaka</i> then also takes into account the dignity of the recipient more than charity. This is expressed in the laws of <i>tzedaka</i> that demand that the dignity of the recipient be of paramount importance in the manner in which the act of <i>tzedaka</i> is carried out.
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>The people were desperate to have an intermediary between them and God. Moshe had served in this role, and in his absence they urged Aharon to create a replacement. Their underlying motivation was connection to and service of God. The unhesitatingly generous response to Aharon’s call for jewellery to create the Golden Calf could also be the same core value that drove the people to give to the <i>Mishkan</i>. The Midrash states that Aharon suggested the people donate jewellery for the creation of the Golden Calf in order to delay or put the people off the plan, but because generosity was a core value of the people, his plan did not work. The Midrash seems to suggest that the underlying explanation to this story is the same core value of generosity that we see in the story of the <i>Mishkan</i>.
It is hard to imagine that there is a generosity gene that can be found in the DNA of the Jewish people, and certainly science has not yet discovered one. So this is not what Rabbi Sacks is implying. Generosity is a core value at the centre of Judaism, featuring prominently both in the narrative parts of its classical texts and within its ethical code. Therefore, it comes as second nature to every Jew to be generous. We can thus say that it is written into our “spiritual DNA” through the culture and values inherited by every generation, transmitted from parent to child, and teacher to student. As a core value, generosity plays a prominent role in Judaism’s classical texts, including the narrative parts of the Torah, as well as being a central value found within Jewish legal texts, such as the Talmud, legal codes, and responsa. It is a core value of practical Jewish law to this day. This is how it has become central and second nature to every Jew.
Encourage the people around your Shabbat table to think of examples they have experienced or heard about of Jews demonstrating the character trait of giving, the fulfilment of the mitzva of <i>tzedaka</i>, and perhaps also general <i>ḥesed</i> (kindness). Generosity and giving do not just involve financial help, but can also be donating time and effort.

Vayikra

In a Nutshell

<b><i>IN A NUTSHELL</i></b><br>Vayikra is the third book of the Torah. This one is quite different from the previous two books. The book of Vayikra does not really tell a story or describe a journey like the other books of the Torah. Everything in it takes place at Mount Sinai, over the course of just one month! There is almost no tale being told, but a lot of mitzvot are introduced.
Vayikra is placed at the centre of the <i>Ḥumash</i>, and it contains the key to understanding Israel’s mission in the world – to be “a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.” This is the first time in history a group of people have ever been given a collective mission, and every time we read Vayikra we are reminded of this mission.
The <i>parasha</i> of <i>Vayikra</i> describes the various kinds of sacrifices the Israelites brought in the <i>Mishkan</i> (the portable Temple). There were five: the burnt offering (<i>ola</i>), the grain offering (<i>minḥa</i>), the peace offering (<i>shelamim</i>), the sin offering (<i>ḥatat</i>), and the guilt offering (<i>asham</i>).
<b>QUESTION TO PONDER</b>
<i>Why do you think the Torah asks us to give sacrifices to God? Does God really need them?</i>

I; The Prophetic View of Sacrifice

<big><strong>I. The Prophetic View of Sacrifice</strong></big><br><b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>Sacrifices were very important in the religious life of biblical Israel. This is seen by how much space in the Torah is given to talking about them. But the later prophets, during the time of the First Temple, seemed to be quite critical of sacrifices. For example, the prophet Shmuel gave one of the first speeches warning of the religious dangers of sacrifices: “Does the Lord delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices as much as in obedience to the Lord’s command? Surely, obedience is better than sacrifice, compliance than the fat of rams” (I Sam. 15:22).
Amos said in the name of God: “If you offer Me burnt offerings – or your meal offerings – I will not accept them; I will pay no heed to your gifts of fatlings…. But let justice well up like water, righteousness like a never-ending stream” (Amos 5:21–24). Hoshea had a similar message: “For I desire goodness, not sacrifice; obedience to God rather than burnt offerings” (Hos. 6:6).
Yirmeyahu seems to suggest that the sacrificial order was not God’s initial intention: “For when I freed your fathers from the land of Egypt, I did not speak with them or command them concerning burnt offerings or sacrifice. But this is what I commanded them: Do My bidding, that I may be your God and you may be My people; walk only in the way that I enjoin upon you, that it may go well with you” (Yirmeya 7:22–23).
The strongest of all the messages against sacrifices is the passage found at the beginning of the book of Yeshaya that we read on <i>Shabbat Ḥazon</i> (before Tisha B’Av): “‘What need have I of all your sacrifices?’ says the Lord. ‘I have more than enough of burnt offerings, of rams and the fat of fattened animals; I have no pleasure in the blood of bulls and lambs and goats. When you come to appear before Me, who has asked this of you, this trampling of My courts? Stop bringing meaningless offerings! Your incense is detestable to Me’” (Yeshaya 1:11–13).
This passage is quite extraordinary. The people are being criticised not for disobeying God’s law but for obeying it. Sacrifices were commanded. Their offering was a sacred act performed in a holy place. What made these prophets so angry?
It was not that they were against sacrifices as such. Yirmeyahu foresaw the day when “people shall come from the towns of Yehuda and from the surroundings [to Jerusalem]…bringing burnt offerings and sacrifices, meal offerings and frankincense, and bringing offerings of thanksgiving to the House of the Lord” (Yirmeya 17:26).
Yeshayahu also saw sacrifices as part of the worship of Hashem in a future Messianic time: “I will bring them to My sacred mount and let them rejoice in My house of prayer. Their burnt offerings and sacrifices shall be welcome on My altar, for My house shall be called a house of prayer for all peoples” (Yeshaya 56:7).
They were not criticising the institution of sacrifices. They were criticising something else, something that still exists today.
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. How do you think people who keep all the laws carefully but are not nice to others justify their behaviour?</i>
<i>2. Have you ever experienced this kind of behaviour?</i>
<i>What distressed them so deeply was the idea that you could serve God and at the same time act disrespectfully, cruelly, unjustly, insensitively, or heartlessly towards other people.</i> It was the attitude that “so long as I am in God’s good graces, that is all that matters” that made the Prophets burn with anger. If you think this, they seem to be telling us, then you haven’t understood either God or Torah.
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br><i>Aaron Feuerstein owned a textile mill in a small town called Lawrence in Massachusetts, at a time when most of the textile mills had closed down because it was cheaper to have fabrics imported from other countries such as India and Mexico. Then the mill suffered a devastating fire, and most people assumed Aaron, by then seventy years old, would take this opportunity to take the insurance money and close the mill down. But the business was a major employer in the local town, providing employment for 1,800 people. These people would all lose their jobs and their families would struggle if the mill closed. Aaron felt a responsibility towards them and refused to close the mill. Not only did he rebuild the mill, ensuring their jobs would be safe, but he also paid them full salaries while the mill was being rebuilt and they couldn’t work.</i>
<i>When asked why he made this decision, he answered that as a religious Jew, he was following the rule: “You are not permitted to oppress the working man because he’s poor and needy amongst your brethren and amongst the non-Jews in your community.” However, he went far beyond what the</i> halakha<i> required of him (and in fact this decision led to business difficulties for this textile mill) and in so doing he made a tremendous</i> kiddush Hashem <i>(sanctifying God’s name). Aaron from then on became known as “the mensch of Malden Mills.”</i>
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. How did Aaron Feuerstein make a</i> kiddush Hashem<i>?</i>
<i>2. Does this story show that he understood the message of the prophets during the First Temple period?</i>
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>The first thing the Torah tells us about humanity is that we are each in the image and likeness of God Himself. Therefore, if you wrong a human being, you are abusing the only creation in the universe on which God has set His image. A sin against any person is a sin against God.
In the first mission statement of the Jewish people, God said about Avraham, “For I have chosen him that he may instruct his children and his household after him to keep the way of the Lord by doing what is just and right” (Bereshit 18:19). The way of the Lord is to act justly and righteously towards your fellow human beings. In context, this meant that God was inviting Avraham to pray on behalf of the people of Sedom, even though He knew that they were wicked and sinners.
It is specifically in the book of sacrifices, Vayikra, that we find the twin commands to love your neighbour as yourself, and to also love the stranger (Vayikra 19:18, 33–34). The sacrifices that express our love and awe of God should lead to love of the neighbour and the stranger. There should be a seamless transition from commands between us and God to commands between us and our fellow humans.
Amos, Hoshea, Yeshayahu, Mikha, and Yirmeyahu all witnessed societies in which people were punctilious in bringing their offerings to the Temple, but in which there was bribery, corruption, perversion of justice, abuse of power, and the exploitation of the powerless by the powerful. The prophets saw in this a profound and dangerous contradiction.
The very act of bringing a sacrifice was fraught with ambiguity. Jews were not the only people in ancient times to have temples, priests, and sacrifices. Almost everyone did. It was precisely here that the religion of ancient Israel came closest, outwardly, to the practices of their pagan neighbours. But the sacrificial systems of other cultures were based on totally different beliefs. In many religions, sacrifices were seen as a way of placating or appeasing the gods. The Aztecs believed that sacrificial offerings fed the gods who sustained the universe. Walter Burkert speculated that the ancient Greeks experienced guilt when they killed animals for food, so they offered sacrifices as a way of appeasing their consciences.
All these ideas are alien to Judaism. God cannot be bribed or appeased. Nor can we bring Him anything that is not His. God sustains the universe; the universe does not sustain Him. And wrongs righted by sacrifice do not excuse other wrongs. So intention and mindset were essential in the sacrificial system. The thought that “if I bring a sacrifice to God, He will overlook my other faults” – in effect, the idea that I can bribe the Judge of all the earth – turns a sacred act into a pagan one, and produces precisely the opposite result than the one intended by the Torah. It turns religious worship from a way towards the right and the good into a way of easing the conscience of those who practise the wrong and the bad.
To serve God is to serve humanity. That was the point made memorably by Mikha: “He has told you, O man, what is good, and what the Lord requires of you: to do justice, to love goodness, and to walk humbly with your God” (Mikha 6:6–8). Yirmeyahu said of King Yoshiyahu: “‘He judged the cause of the poor and needy; then it was well with him. Was not this to know Me?’ says the Lord” (Yirmeya 22:16). Knowing God, said Yirmeyahu, means caring for those in need.
Rambam said essentially the same at the end of <i>The</i> <i>Guide for the Perplexed</i> (III:54). He quotes Yirmeyahu: “‘Only in this should one glory: that they have the understanding to know Me, that I am the Lord, who exercises kindness, justice, and righteousness on earth, for in these I delight,’ says the Lord” (Yirmeya 9:23). To know God is to know what it is to act with kindness, justice, and righteousness.
The danger of the sacrificial system, said the prophets, is that it can lead people to believe that there are two domains, the Temple and the world, serving God and caring for one’s fellow humans, and that these are disconnected. Judaism rejects the concept of two disconnected domains. Halakhically they are distinct, but psychologically, ethically, and spiritually they are part of a single indivisible system.
<b>I believe that to love God is to love our fellow humans. To honour God is to honour our fellow humans. We may not ask God to listen to us if we are unwilling to listen to others. We may not ask God to forgive us if we are unwilling to forgive others</b>. To know God is to seek to imitate Him, which means, said Yirmeyahu and Rambam, to exercise kindness, justice, and righteousness on earth.
<b>QUESTION TO PONDER</b>
<i>According to these ideas, which laws are more important, those between us and God or those between us and other people?</i>
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>It is precisely in our day-to-day relationships, at work or among friends, in our dealings with people and the integrity, sensitivity and generosity we bring to bear on them, that we most add or subtract to the respect those around us have for the values by which we live. Here, the greatest of biblical commands – to sanctify and not desecrate God’s name – have their arena, their impact and influence. There is no greater religious achievement than to have sanctified God’s name, and no greater a sin than to have lessened the respect in which it is held.... “Sanctifying the name” is no mere marginal addendum to the script of Jewish life but its very point: to bring God’s presence into the world by making others aware that God’s word sanctifies life.
<b><i>To Heal a Fractured World</i>, 68</b>
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>What is the rationale behind sacrificial worship of God?
What are the dangers of this form of worship (as highlighted by the prophets)?
What should be the focus of our worship of God (according to this <i>Covenant &amp; Conversation</i> essay)?
<b>EDUCATIONAL COMPANION TO THE QUESTIONS</b>
<b><i>IN A NUTSHELL</i></b><br>God does not need our sacrifices. God is infinite and “needs” nothing. The sacrifices are for us, not for Him. They are a way for us to show that we are willing to give Him everything we have. Sacrifices are a way for us to feel close to Him (the root of the Hebrew word for sacrifice is <i>k-r-b,</i> which means “close”). When we give a gift to a friend this brings us closer to them. So too with sacrifices given for God.
<b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>There is the law (halakha) and then there is the spirit of the law. One can be one hundred per cent committed to keeping all the details of the halakha, but forget about the spirit of the law – the core values that the laws are aimed at upholding. Sometimes one can lose sight of the larger picture when one becomes passionate and zealous in one’s service of God. The prophets warned against this very phenomenon.
Sadly, there are often examples of deeply religious people who fall in this way, failing to see the godliness in all human beings and then mistreating them. All humans are imperfect and fallible, and it is our challenge to listen to the message of the prophets and the Torah and not make the same mistakes.
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br>He was not required or even expected to rebuild the mill and ensure job security for his 1,800 employees. He went beyond the letter of the law in order to protect these people for whom he felt responsible. This caused people to think positively about him, Jews in general, and God (because he provided a model of the behaviour of a religious Jew who keeps the Torah). This is called sanctifying God’s name (making a <i>kiddush Hashem</i>).
While the halakha (and civil law) did not require him to go to these lengths, he did so because he clearly understood the message of the prophets: To serve God is to serve humanity. Knowing God means caring for those in need. To love and honour God is to love and honour our fellow humans.
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>We are reluctant to answer this question and to elevate one type of mitzva above another. However, the message of this <i>Covenant &amp; Conversation</i> essay is that loving and honouring our fellow humans is in fact loving and honouring God. Interpersonal mitzvot have an added dimension of being a service of God as well.
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>Sacrifices were the language of religious worship in biblical times. Humans at that time would have found it difficult to approach and connect to God in any other way. Sacrifices are a way for humans to connect to and draw close to God. The root of the Hebrew word for sacrifice is <i>k-r-b,</i> which means “close.” Just as when we give a gift to a friend this brings us closer to them, giving God something we own brings us closer to Him.
The danger to be wary of is that we may focus only on our relationship with God, and neglect our moral behaviour towards other human beings. God cannot be bribed or appeased by sacrifices, and wrongs righted by sacrifice do not excuse other wrongs. Religious worship must not be a way of easing the conscience of those who behave in an immoral way in their everyday activities. The prophets said that the danger of the sacrificial system is that it can lead people to think that “there are two domains, the Temple and the world, serving God and caring for one’s fellow humans, and they are disconnected. Judaism rejects the concept of two disconnected domains. Halakhically they are distinct, but psychologically, ethically, and spiritually they are part of a single indivisible system.”
“To serve God is to serve humanity.” That was the point made memorably by Mikha: “He has told you, O man, what is good, and what the Lord requires of you: to do justice, to love goodness, and to walk humbly with your God” (Mikha 6:6–8). Yirmeyahu said of King Yoshiyahu: “‘He judged the cause of the poor and needy; then it was well with him. Was not this to know Me?’ says the Lord” (Yirmeya 22:16). Knowing God, said Yirmeyahu, means caring for those in need.

II; The Pursuit of Meaning

<big><strong>II. The Pursuit of Meaning</strong></big><br><b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>The precise meaning of the opening verse of our <i>parasha</i> is difficult to understand. Literally translated, it reads: “And He called (<i>Vayikra</i>) to Moshe, and God spoke (<i>vayedaber</i>) to him from the Tent of Meeting, saying…” The first phrase seems to be unnecessary. If we are told that God spoke to Moshe, why also say, “And He called”?
Rashi explains as follows: “Every [time God communicated with Moshe, whether using the words] ‘and He spoke,’ or ‘and He said,’ or ‘and He commanded,’ God called [to Moshe by name] first. ‘Calling’ is an expression of love.”
<i>Vayikra</i>, Rashi is telling us, means <i>to be called to a mission in love</i>. This is the source of one of the key ideas of Western thought, the concept of a <i>vocation</i> or a <i>calling</i>, i.e., choosing a career or way of life not just because you want to do it, nor because it offers certain benefits, but because you feel <i>summoned</i> to it. You feel this is your meaning and mission in life. This is what you were placed on earth to do.
When we see a wrong to be righted, a sickness to be healed, a need to be met, and we feel it speaking to us, that is when we come as close as we can, in an age with no prophecy, to hearing <i>Vayikra</i>, God’s call.
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>

<i>2. What was Moshe’s vocation/calling?</i>
<i>3. Do you know what your “calling” might be?</i>
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br><i>The best teachers are not necessarily those with a gift for instruction. They are people who value their students, identify their potential, and get them to believe in themselves. Sometimes this has extraordinary results. Chava Lehman is an example of such an educator.</i>
<i>With encouragement from the late Lord and Lady Jakobovits, in 1976 Chava Lehman created a school for Jewish children with educational challenges called Kisharon, the only one of its kind in the United Kingdom. She begged and borrowed desks so that Kisharon could open its doors with just two rented rooms. Today Kisharon is a thriving family of institutions and programmes serving many hundreds of children and adults with varying degrees of learning disabilities.</i>
<i>The name Kisharon means ability, capacity, skill. This name was deliberately chosen to create a paradigm shift in our understanding of children with special needs. Most people see what they lack. She wanted everyone associated with the school to see what they have and what, with the right training and love, they are capable of giving. Her educational philosophy flowed directly from her religious faith: she believed that all of us are created for a purpose, and if we lack some abilities, we still have others. The children blossomed under her care.</i>
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. Where in this story can you see the message contained in </i>The Core Idea?
<i>2. In </i>Thinking More Deeply<i> below, we see the idea that “each of us is unique.... There are things only we can
do.... For each of us God has a task.” How did Chava Lehman incorporate this idea into her work?</i>
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>The American Declaration of Independence speaks of the inalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. There have been hundreds of books written on happiness and how to achieve it. Yet there is something more fundamental still to the sense of a life well-lived, namely, <i>meaning</i>. The two seem similar. It’s easy to suppose that people who find meaning are happy, and people who are happy have found meaning. But the two are not the same, nor do they always overlap.
Happiness is largely a matter of satisfying needs and wants. Meaning, by contrast, is about a sense of purpose in life, especially by making positive contributions to the lives of others. Happiness is largely about how you feel in the present. Meaning is about how you judge your life as a whole: past, present, and future. Happiness is associated with <i>taking</i>, meaning with <i>giving</i>. Individuals who suffer stress, worry, or anxiety are not happy, but they may be living lives rich with meaning. Past misfortunes reduce present happiness, but people often connect such moments with the discovery of meaning. Happiness is not unique to humans. Animals also experience contentment when their wants and needs are satisfied. But meaning is a distinctively human phenomenon. There can be happiness without meaning, and there can be meaning in the absence of happiness, even in the midst of darkness and pain. The pursuit of meaning is about the search for something larger than the self.
No one did more to bring the question of meaning to our attention than the late Viktor Frankl. In the three years he spent in Auschwitz, Frankl survived and helped others to survive by inspiring them to discover a purpose in life even in the midst of hell on earth. It was there that he formulated the ideas he later turned into a new type of psychotherapy based on what he called “man’s search for meaning.” His book of that title, written in the course of nine days in 1946, has sold more than ten million copies throughout the world, and ranks as one of the most influential works of the twentieth century.
Frankl knew that in the camps, those who lost the will to live died. He tells of how he helped two individuals to find a reason to survive. One had a child waiting for her in another country. Another had written the first volumes of a series of travel books, and there were others yet to write. Both therefore had a reason to live.
Frankl used to say that the way to find meaning was not to ask what we want from life. Instead we should ask what life wants from us. We are each, he said, unique: in our gifts, our abilities, our skills and talents, and in the circumstances of our life. For each of us, then, there is a task only we can do. This does not mean that we are better than others. But if we believe we are here for a reason, then there is a <i>tikkun</i>, a mending, only we can perform, a fragment of light only we can redeem, an act of kindness or courage or generosity or hospitality, even a word of encouragement or a smile, only we can perform, because we are here, in this place, at this time, facing this person at this moment in their lives.
“Life is a task,” he used to say, and added, “the religious man differs from the apparently irreligious man only by experiencing his existence not simply as a task, but as a mission.” He or she is aware of being summoned, called, by a Source. “For thousands of years that source has been called God.”
That is the significance of the word that gives our <i>parasha</i>, and the third book of the Torah, its name: <i>Vayikra</i>, “And He called.” Why does the word “<i>vayikra”</i> appear here, at the beginning of the third and central book of the Torah? Because the book of Vayikra is about sacrifices, and a vocation is about sacrifices. <i>We are willing to make sacrifices when we feel they are part of the mission we are called upon to do</i>.
From the perspective of eternity we may sometimes be overwhelmed by a sense of our own insignificance. We are no more than a wave in the ocean, a grain of sand on the seashore, dust on the surface of infinity. <i>Yet we are here because God wanted us to be, because there is a task He wants us to perform</i>. The search for meaning is the quest for this task.
Each of us is unique. Even genetically identical twins are different. There are things only we can do, we who are what we are, in this time, this place, and these circumstances. For each of us God has a task: work to perform, a kindness to show, a gift to give, love to share, loneliness to ease, pain to heal, or broken lives to help mend. Determining what that task is, hearing <i>vayikra</i>, God’s call, is one of the great spiritual challenges for each of us.
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>I have spent much of my life thinking about life, observing people, reading books, searching for teachers and exemplars, trying to distinguish between what ultimately matters and what merely seems to matter at the time. I make no claims to wisdom, but this I have learned:
Each of us is here for a purpose.
Discerning that purpose takes time and honesty, knowledge of ourselves, and knowledge of the world, but it is there to be discovered. Each of us has a unique constellation of gifts, an unreplicated radius of influence, and within that radius, be it as small as a family or as large as a state, we can be a transformative presence.
Where <i>what we want to do</i> meets <i>what needs to be done</i>, that is where God wants us to be.
Even the smallest good deed can change someone’s life.
Those who spend at least part of their lives in service of others are the most fulfilled and happiest people I know.
A word of praise can give meaning to someone’s life.
The world is a book in which our life is a chapter, and the question is whether others, reading it, will be inspired.
Each day is a question asked by God to us.
Few are the days when we cannot make some difference to the lives of others.
We can make a difference, and it is only by making a difference that we redeem a life, lifting it from mere existence and endowing it with glory.
Each situation in which we find ourselves did not happen by accident: we are here, now, in this place, among these people, in these circumstances, so that we can do the act or say the word that will heal one of the fractures of the world.

<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. Which lesson from this list can help you discover what your “calling” is?</i>
<i>2. Which lesson do you find most inspiring?</i>
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>What makes you happy, what makes your life meaningful, and what is the difference between these?
How can you make your life more meaningful?
Do you have a sense of what your calling in life is?
<b>EDUCATIONAL COMPANION TO THE QUESTIONS</b>
<b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>The term “calling” suggests that something or someone is calling on a person to become or achieve something. One’s calling could be your own natural skills, abilities, and personality that lead you to your vocation. If you are a naturally talented athlete with the appropriate temperament for success, then this can be described as your calling. Perhaps it is “wrong” to squander these talents, as they will benefit the world (in this case bringing enjoyment to many). Destiny or history could be calling on you, suggesting that humanity needs something specific at a specific moment in history, and you are the person to achieve it. In the case of our <i>parasha</i>, it is God who is literally calling on Moshe to achieve his destiny.
Although the context of the first verse of the book of Vayikra is God commanding Moshe to deliver a message about the sacrificial service to the Israelites, Rabbi Sacks, quoting Rashi, suggests that the text is intimating that God was calling on Moshe to his vocation – to be the leader of the Jewish people at that moment in history.
While we are sometimes critical of our educational systems that demand that our children consider their future careers at a very young age, this question is asking about vocation rather than career. It is never too young to start considering this, even though we must also encourage a young person to realise they are only at the beginning of a lifetime journey of self-discovery and actualisation.
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br>The most obvious connection between the story and <i>The Core Idea</i> is how Chava Lehman discovered and acted on her calling in life, and how this has made an impact on the lives of so many people. However, a subtext in the story is how she saw the unique potential in everyone, including the children and adults who benefitted from her work with Kisharon.
Chava Lehman could see the potential in everyone. She believed that despite the difficulties and differences that some have, they still possess a tremendous amount to contribute to humanity. She encouraged each person she came into contact with to explore their own calling and the unique contribution they could make.
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>The journey of discovery to find one’s calling is a personal and unique process for each person. But inspiring people who have wisdom to share can help us with that process. While every one of these can become a catalyst for this process, the first three and the final one are particularly relevant. Rabbi Sacks himself decided to use the third one, “That where what we want to do meets what needs to be done, that is where God wants us to be,” as the conclusion to this <i>Covenant &amp; Conversation</i> essay.
These are taken from a longer list found at the end of the book <i>To Heal a Fractured World</i>. There is much to be inspired by here.
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>Happiness is about satisfying needs and wants, while meaning, by contrast, is about having a sense of purpose in life. This of course contributes to mental health and happiness, but is significantly different from the more general, looser term “happiness.” The following quote from Rabbi Sacks deepens this point: “Happiness is about how you feel in the present. Meaning is about how you judge your life as a whole: past, present, and future. Happiness is associated with taking, meaning with giving. Happiness is not unique to humans. Animals also experience contentment when their wants and needs are satisfied. But meaning is a distinctively human phenomenon.”
This must be approached in an individual way, different for each of us. Factors that may contribute could include skills, abilities, values, and outlook. Although participants in this discussion may well be very young, if they are old enough to understand what might give life meaning, they are old enough to think of ways to make their life more meaningful, both in the short and long term.
Again, this will depend on many of the same factors. The interesting question to also consider here is the relationship between calling and vocation, and having a sense of meaning in life.

Tzav

In a Nutshell

<b><i>IN A NUTSHELL</i></b><br><i>Parashat Tzav</i> continues the laws of sacrifices that we began to learn about in the last <i>parasha</i>, but this time we learn about the requirements of the <i>kohanim</i> who will be the ones actually performing the rituals.
The laws of the burnt and grain offerings, sin and guilt offerings, and peace offerings, are all discussed, and each one has special details of how to bring the offering. Then we learn how Aharon (the <i>kohen gadol</i>) and his sons will be initiated into their roles as priests. Finally, the opening ceremony of the service of the <i>Mishkan</i> (the portable Temple) is described.
<b>QUESTION TO PONDER</b>
<i>The root of the word for sacrifice</i> (korban)<i> means “to come close.” How do you think bringing God a sacrifice brings us closer to Him?</i>

I; Left and Right Brain Judaism

<big><strong>I. Left- and Right-Brain Judaism</strong></big><br><b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>The idea of reading the <i>haftara</i> – connecting a passage from the prophetic literature to read alongside the Torah portion of the week – is an ancient one, dating back at least two thousand years. Scholars are not sure when, where, and why it was instituted. Some say that it began when Antiochus IV’s attempt to eliminate Jewish practice in the second century BCE sparked the revolt we celebrate on Ḥanukka. At that time, so the tradition goes, public reading from the Torah was forbidden. So the Sages ruled that we should read a prophetic passage whose theme would <i>remind</i> people of the subject of the weekly Torah portion.
Another view is that it began in protest of the Samaritans, and later the Sadducees, who denied the authority of all the prophetic books except the book of Yehoshua.
Often the connection between the <i>parasha</i> and the <i>haftara</i> is straightforward and obvious. Sometimes, though, the choice of prophetic passage is instructive, teaching us something deeper about what the Sages understood as the key message of the <i>parasha</i>.
But there are some <i>haftarot</i> that are so strange that they deserve to be called paradoxical, since their message seems to challenge rather than reinforce that of the <i>parasha</i>. Our <i>parasha</i> is a good example of this. <i>Tzav</i> is focused on the various kinds of sacrifices. Then comes the <i>haftara</i>, with Yirmeyahu’s almost incomprehensible remark:
<i>“For when I brought your ancestors out of Egypt and spoke to them, I did not give them commands about burnt offerings and sacrifices, but I gave them this command: ‘Obey Me, and I will be your God and you will be My people. Walk in all the ways that I command you, that it may go well with you’”</i> (Yirmeya 7:22–23).
This seems to suggest that sacrifices were not part of God’s original intention for the Israelites. It seems to minimise the importance of the very substance of the <i>parasha</i>.
What does it mean? The simplest interpretation is that it means, “I did not <i>only</i> give them commands about burnt offerings and sacrifices.” Perhaps God is saying: Yes, I commanded these, but they were not the whole of the law, nor were they even its primary purpose.
A second interpretation is the famously controversial view of Rambam that the sacrifices were not what God would have wanted in an ideal world. What He wanted was <i>avoda</i>: He wanted the Israelites to worship Him. But they, accustomed to religious practices in the ancient world, could not yet conceive of <i>avoda shebalev</i>, the “service of the heart,” namely prayer. They were accustomed to the way things were done in Egypt (and virtually everywhere else at that time), where worship meant sacrifice. On this reading, Yirmeyahu meant that from a divine perspective sacrifices were <i>bediavad</i>, not <i>lekhatḥilla</i>, an after-the-fact concession, not something desired at the outset.
A third interpretation is that the entire sequence of events from Shemot 25 to Vayikra 25 was a response to the episode of the Golden Calf. This mistake, I believe, represented a passionate need on the part of the people to have God close, not distant; in the camp, not at the top of the mountain; accessible to everyone, not just Moshe; and near to them on a daily basis, not just at rare moments of miracle. That is what the <i>Mishkan</i>, with all its service and its sacrifices, represented. It was the home of the <i>Shekhina</i>, the Divine Presence, from the same root as <i>sh-kh-n</i>, “neighbour.” Every sacrifice – in Hebrew, <i>korban</i>, meaning “that which is brought near” – was an act of coming close. So in the <i>Mishkan</i>, God came close to the people, and in bringing sacrifices, the people came close to God.
The Torah contains the details of <i>how</i> to do this, but only the <i>haftara</i> tells us <i>why</i> – to help us stay connected to God and remind us to walk in His way.
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br>From the screenplay of the film of<b></b> <i>Dead Poets Society:</i>
<b><i>Mr. Keating</i></b><i>: Gentlemen, open your texts to page 21 of the introduction. Mr. Perry, will you read the opening paragraph of the preface, entitled “Understanding Poetry”?<b></b></i>
<b><i>Perry</i></b><i>: “‘Understanding Poetry,’ by Dr. J. Evans Pritchard, Ph.D. To fully understand poetry, we must first be fluent with its meter, rhyme, and figures of speech. Then ask two questions: one, how artfully has the objective of the poem been rendered, and two, how important is that objective? Question one rates the poem’s perfection; question two rates its importance. And once these questions have been answered, determining a poem’s greatness becomes a relatively simple matter.<b></b></i>
<i>“As you proceed through the poetry in this book, practise this rating method. As your ability to evaluate poems in this matter grows, so will your enjoyment and understanding of poetry.”</i>
<b><i>Mr. Keating</i></b><i>: Now I want you to rip out that page. Go on, rip out the entire page. You heard me, rip it out. Rip it out! Rip! Be gone, J. Evans Pritchard, Ph.D. Rip. Shred. Tear. Rip it out!<b></b></i>

Medicine, law, business, engineering, these are all noble pursuits, and necessary to sustain life. But poetry, beauty, romance, love, these are what we stay alive for.</i>
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. What is the value in analysing poetry through rules? Why are rules important in general?</i>
<i>2. What does Pritchard’s approach to poetry overlook?</i>
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>Daily sacrifices were not in God’s original plan, and as we discussed earlier, they could be problematic. In Shemot verses 19–24, we see the original plan was that God would be the people’s sovereign and lawmaker. He would be their king, not their neighbour. He would be distant, not close (see Shemot 33:3; see also the <i>haftara</i> for <i>Tzav</i>, from Yirmeya). The people would obey His laws; they would not bring Him sacrifices on a regular basis. God does not need sacrifices. But God responded to the people’s wish, much as He did when they said they could not continue to hear His overwhelming voice at Sinai: “I have heard what this people said to you. Everything they said was good” (Devarim 5:25). <i>What brings people close to God has to do with people, not God</i>. That is why sacrifices were not God’s initial intent but rather the Israelites’ spiritual-psychological need: a need for closeness to the Divine at regular times.
Now let’s look at the <i>haftara</i> for the morning of Yom Kippur, from the fifty-eighth chapter of Yeshaya, one of the most astonishing passages in the prophetic literature:
“Is this the fast I have chosen – a day when a man will oppress himself?…Is this what you call a fast, ‘a day for the Lord’s favour’? No: this is the fast I choose. Loosen the bindings of evil and break the slavery chain. Those who were crushed, release to freedom; shatter every yoke of slavery. Break your bread for the starving and bring dispossessed wanderers home. When you see a person without clothes, clothe them. Do not avert your eyes from your own flesh” (Yeshaya 58:5–7).
The message is unmistakable. We spoke of it in the last <i>Covenant and Conversation</i> essay. The commands between us and God and those between us and our fellows are inseparable. Fasting is of no use if at the same time you do not act justly and compassionately to your fellow human beings. You cannot expect God to love you if you do not act lovingly to others. That much is clear.
But to read this in public on Yom Kippur, immediately after having read the Torah portion describing the service of the high priest on that day, together with the command to “afflict yourselves,” seems jarring, even illogical. In fact, the sudden shift of focus reinforces a crucial teaching. First we read the Torah commands to fast, atone, and purify ourselves, and then suddenly the prophet is telling us that none of this will work unless we engage in some kind of social action, or at the very least behave honourably towards others. Our Torah and <i>haftara</i> seem in conflict here. But they are actually two voices singing in harmony.
What connects these two <i>haftarot</i> is their insistence on the moral dimension of Judaism. As Yirmeyahu puts it in the closing verse of the <i>haftara</i>, “I am the Lord, who exercises kindness, justice, and righteousness on earth, for in these I delight” (Yirmeya 9:23). What is genuinely unexpected is that the Sages joined together sections of the Torah and passages from the prophetic literature so different from one another that they sound as if they are coming from different universes with different laws of gravity.
That is the greatness of Judaism. It is a choral symphony scored for many voices. It is an ongoing argument between different points of view. Without detailed laws, no sacrifices. Without sacrifices in the biblical age, no coming close to God. But if there are only sacrifices with no prophetic voice, then people may serve God while abusing their fellow humans. They may think themselves righteous while they are, in fact, merely self-righteous.
The priestly voice we hear in the Torah readings for Yom Kippur and <i>Tzav</i> tells us <i>what</i> and <i>how</i>. The prophetic voice tells us <i>why</i>. They are like the left and right hemispheres of the brain, or like hearing in stereo, or seeing in 3D. That is the complexity and richness of Judaism.
Put priestly and prophetic voices together and we see that ritual is a training in ethics. Repeated performance of sacred acts reconfigures the brain, reconstitutes the personality, reshapes our sensibilities. The commandments were given, said the Sages, to refine people. The external act influences inner feeling. “The heart follows the deed,” as the <i>Sefer HaḤinnukh</i> puts it.
<b>I believe that this tension between Torah and <i>haftara</i>, priestly and prophetic voices, is one of Judaism’s great glories. We hear both how to act and why. Without the how, action is lame; without the why, behaviour is blind. Combine priestly detail and prophetic vision and you have spiritual greatness.</b>
<b>QUESTION TO PONDER</b>
<i>What is the difference between left-brain and right-brain thinking, and what does this have to do with the priestly voice in the</i> parasha<i> and the prophetic voice in the</i> haftara<i>?</i>
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>Science takes things apart to see how they work. Religion puts things together to see what they mean. Without going into neuroscientific detail, the first is a predominantly left-brain activity, the second is associated with the right hemisphere…. Science is about explanation. Religion is about meaning. Science analyses, religion integrates. Science breaks things down to their component parts. Religion binds people together in relationships of trust. Science tells us what is. Religion tells us what ought to be. Science describes. Religion beckons, summons, calls. Science sees objects. Religion speaks to us as subjects. Science practises detachment. Religion is the art of attachment, self to self, soul to soul. Science sees the underlying order of the physical world. Religion hears the music beneath the noise. Science is the conquest of ignorance. Religion is the redemption of solitude.

<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>Which of the reasons given do you think best explains the institution of the <i>haftara</i>?
What do you think the <i>haftara</i> achieves today?
What is the message of the <i>haftara</i> of this <i>parasha</i>?
<b>EDUCATIONAL COMPANION TO THE QUESTIONS</b>
<b><i>IN A NUTSHELL</i></b><br>The root of the Hebrew word for sacrifice is <i>k-r-b,</i> which means “close.” When we give a gift to a friend, this brings us closer to them and them closer to us. The giver feels good that they have given something they have (an object of monetary value, time, creativity, care) to another person, and this makes them feel closer and more connected. In the case of God, we feel closer and more connected when we give up something for God. It could be a sacrifice in Temple times, or our time and passion today in the form of praying or carrying out mitzvot.
<b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>The details of the <i>Mishkan</i> and the sacrificial service are the “how” to worship God in this <i>parasha</i>.
The <i>haftara</i> says: “For when I brought your ancestors out of Egypt and spoke to them, I did not give them commands about burnt offerings and sacrifices, but I gave them this command: ‘Obey Me, and I will be your God and you will be My people. Walk in all the ways that I command you, that it may go well with you’” (Yirmeya 7:22–23). This suggests that these laws are ultimately to encourage a closeness to and connection with God. The <i>Mishkan</i> addressed a passionate need on the part of the people to have God close not distant; in the camp, not at the top of the mountain; accessible to everyone, not just Moshe; and near to them on a daily basis, not just at rare moments of miracle.
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br>Rules give life structure. Rules to analyse poetry help us find the literary techniques, patterns, and structure contained within poems (and all other forms of art).
If you only use rules to write and analyse poetry you may well miss the passion, emotions, and spirit of poetry. This is the equivalent of the prophetic message found in the <i>haftara</i> that helps us understand the priestly rules found in the Torah.
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>Our brain has two hemispheres, and they are used for different types of thinking. The left-hand side of the brain is used for mostly analytical and methodical thinking, and the right-hand side is for more creative and artistic thinking. Rabbi Sacks is suggesting that the former corresponds to the priestly approach (found in the Torah), which uses detail-orientated ritual to approach God, while the prophetic voice (found in the <i>haftara</i> of our <i>parasha</i>) is more focused on the emotional and spiritual needs that underlie our service of God.
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>The first theory mentioned is that the <i>haftara</i> was instituted when Antiochus IV attempted to eliminate Jewish practice in the second century BCE, specifically the public reading from the Torah. The Sages instituted that we should read a prophetic passage whose theme would remind people of the subject of the weekly Torah portion. Another view is that it was introduced to protest the views of the Samaritans, and later the Sadducees, who denied the authority of all the prophetic books except the book of Yehoshua. Finally, there is the theory that the <i>haftara</i> contains a message from the Rabbis to help us understand what they think is the core important message from the Torah portion.
Perhaps the most important goal today for reading the <i>haftara</i> is to expose us to the books of the Prophets. We are generally very Torah-centric (for obvious reasons) and sometimes we might neglect to study and teach the rest of Tanakh, so the <i>haftara</i> ensures we have some familiarity with the prophetic books.
Sacrifices are an important part of how we serve God, and Vayikra is very focused on the details of this service. The preferred interpretation of why this <i>haftara</i> was chosen to accompany <i>Parashat Tzav</i> is that the entire sequence of events from Shemot 25 to Vayikra 25 was a response to the episode of the Golden Calf. The <i>Mishkan</i> represented a passionate need on the part of the people to feel God’s closeness, to have a way for His Presence to be accessible to everyone, not just Moshe, and on a daily basis, not just at rare moments of miracle. Every sacrifice – in Hebrew, <i>korban</i>, meaning “that which is brought near” – was an act of coming close. So in the <i>Mishkan</i>, God came close to the people, and in bringing sacrifices, the people came close to God. The <i>haftara</i> gives the details of the ritual aspects of the <i>Mishkan</i> some much-needed perspective, shifting our focus from these details to the truest ways to serve God and achieve spiritual greatness.

II; Blood, Idolatry, and War

<big><strong>II. Blood, Idolatry, and War</strong></big><br><b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>This <i>parasha</i>, speaking about sacrifices, prohibits the eating of blood: “Wherever you live, you must not eat the blood of any bird or animal. If anyone eats blood, that person must be cut off from their people” (Vayikra 7:26–27). This is not just one prohibition among others. The ban on eating blood is fundamental to the Torah. For example, it occupies a central place in the covenant God makes with Noaḥ – and through him, all humanity – after the Flood: “But you must not eat meat that has its lifeblood still in it” (Bereshit 9:4), and Moshe even re-emphasises this command in his great closing address in the book of Devarim (12:23–25).
What is so wrong with eating blood? Rambam and Ramban each offer a different interpretation. For Rambam this is part of the Torah’s continuous battle against idolatry. He compares the language the Torah uses for the prohibitions of idolatry and eating blood, and notices that identical words are used: “I will set My face against that person who eats blood and will cut him off from his people” (Vayikra 17:10) and “I will set My face against that man [who engages in Molekh worship] and his family and will cut him off from his people” (Vayikra 20:5).
The expression “set My face against” is only found in the Torah when it speaks of blood and idolatry. Idolaters, says Rambam, believed that blood was the food of the spirits, and that by eating it, they would have “something in common with the spirits.” Eating blood is forbidden because it is a form of idolatry.
Ramban, however, says that the ban has to do with human nature. We are affected by what we eat: “If one were to eat the life of all flesh [blood]…the result would be a hardening of the human soul and it would become similar to the nature of the animal soul.” Eating blood, Ramban believes, makes us cruel and violent, like an animal.
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. Which approach makes more sense to you, that of Rambam or Ramban? Why?</i>
<i>2. Is it strange that the Torah allows us to eat meat, but not blood? Maybe we should just be vegetarian?</i>
<i>3. Do you think our behaviour is influenced by our environment, such as the people we surround ourselves with, the places we visit, and the food we eat?</i>
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br>In late 1990 Dr. George Carey had been elected, but not yet taken up office, as archbishop of Canterbury. I had been elected, but not yet taken up office, as chief rabbi. Someone discovered that we were both Arsenal (football club) supporters. He asked whether we would like our first ecumenical gathering to take place at Highbury Stadium – a midweek match for obvious religious reasons. We both replied enthusiastically that we would.
The great day arrived. We were taken down to meet the players. We went out, beneath the floodlights, onto the sacred turf, to present a cheque to charity. The loudspeakers announced our presence. You could hear the buzz go around the ground. Whichever way one chose in the theological wager, that night Arsenal had friends in high places. They could not possibly lose.
A <i>nachtiger tog</i>, as my grandmother used to say: would that it were so. Arsenal went down to their worst home defeat in sixty-three years. They lost 6–2 to Manchester United. The archbishop was beside himself in agony. The next day, one of the national newspapers ran the story and came to the conclusion that if, between them, the archbishop of Canterbury and the chief rabbi could not bring about a win for Arsenal, did this not prove that God does not exist? “On the contrary,” I said, “it proves that God exists. It’s just that He supports Manchester United!”
For further analysis of this story by Rabbi Sacks, see <i>From the Thought of Rabbi Sacks</i> below.
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. Can you see any similarities between a football match and religious worship?</i>
<i>2. In</i> From the Thought of Rabbi Sacks <i>below, football as a substitute for war is discussed. How could this be, and what does this idea have to do with this</i> parasha<i>?</i>
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>Which of the two explanations we saw in <i>The Core Idea</i> is correct? There is evidence, from archaeology and anthropology, that <i>both</i> are. Rambam was quite right to see the eating of blood as an idolatrous rite. Human sacrifice was widespread in the ancient world.
Barbara Ehrenreich argues in her book <i>Blood Rites: Origins and History of the Passions of War</i> that one of the most formative experiences of the first human beings must have been the terror of being attacked by an animal predator. They knew that the likely outcome was that one of the group, usually an outsider, an invalid, a child, or perhaps an animal, would fall as prey, giving the others a chance to escape. It was this embedded memory that became the basis of subsequent sacrificial rites.
Ehrenreich’s point is that “the sacrificial ritual in many ways mimics the crisis of a predator’s attack. Someone is singled out for slaughter, often in a spectacularly bloody manner.” That is why blood is offered to the gods, and why the gods who play a part in these ceremonies are usually imagined as beasts of prey.
Ehrenreich does not end there, however. Her view is that this emotional reaction – fear and guilt – survives to the present as part of our genetic inheritance. It leaves two legacies: one, the human tendency to band together in the face of an external threat; the other, the willingness to risk self-sacrifice for the sake of the group. These emotions appear at times of war. They help explain why it is so easy to mobilise people for war by conjuring up the threat of an external enemy.
War is a destructive and self-destructive activity. Why then does it persist? Ehrenreich’s insight suggests an answer. It is the dysfunctional survival of instincts, profoundly necessary in an age of hunter-gatherers, into an era in which such responses are no longer necessary. Human beings still thrill at the prospect of shedding blood.
Ramban was equally correct to see eating blood as a symptom of human cruelty. We now sense the profound wisdom of the law forbidding the eating of blood. Only thus could human beings be gradually cured of the deeply ingrained instinct, deriving from a world of predators and prey, in which the key choice is to kill or be killed.
Evolutionary psychology has taught us about these genetic residues from earlier times which – because they are not rational – cannot be cured by reason alone, but only by ritual, strict prohibition, and habituation. The world continues to be scarred by violence and terror. Sadly, the ban against blood sacrifice is still relevant. The instinct against which it is a protest – sacrificing life to exorcise fear – still lives on.
Where there is fear, it is easy to turn against those we see as “the other” and learn to hate them. Which is why each of us must take a stand against the instinct to fear, and against the corrosive power of hate. All it takes for evil to flourish is for good people to do nothing.
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>(This analysis follows the story above in <i>It Once Happened</i>.)
Football is a ritualised substitute for war, a way of channelling emotions that would otherwise lead to violence. The passions football evokes – loyalty, identification with one side against the other, jubilation, heartbreak – are precisely those that once led nations into battle. Not just nations: religions as well.
Homo sapiens is a violent animal, the Bible and socio-biologists agree. Without the capacity to fight, our ancestors would not have survived. For centuries, however, that genetic instinct has been dysfunctional, increasingly so as our technologies grow more powerful.
But the emotions that once led to war remain today, and even in the twenty-first century still seek expression. I weep at the descent of Afghanistan and Iraq into what Hobbes called “the war of every man against every man” in which life is “nasty, brutish, and short.” We still witness the sacrifice of human life on the altar of someone else’s desire to win, sometimes even in the name of God Himself.
Which brings me back to football. I learnt that night that the game is bigger than the team. And the game only exists by both sides playing by the same rules. If you try to win by practising violence against your opponents, you don’t win. You merely destroy the game.
The same applies to every form of human conflict, including religion. If you try to demonstrate your faith by violence – as, for instance, the Crusaders did to the Jews and Muslims in Jerusalem in 1099 – you destroy truth and faith. Only madness could lead us to believe otherwise.
My joke about God supporting Manchester United has a serious point. What if the God of my side were also the God of the game? Might that not give us pause before imposing our views on others by force? Might it not lead us to seek less destructive, more rule-governed ways of expressing our violent instincts? Like football.
<b>“Credo,”<i> The Times</i>, June 10, 2006</b>
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. Why does Rabbi Sacks say, “Homo sapiens is a violent animal”? Does it have to be this way?</i>
<i>2. What lesson can we learn from the idea that “God might not just be the God of Arsenal or Manchester United, but rather the ‘God of the game’”?</i>
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>Why do you think the Torah prohibits the eating of blood (besides the reasons given by Rambam and Ramban)?
If it is argued that eating blood can make us animalistic, do you think there is an argument to be made for vegetarianism?
Why is ritual (repetition that leads to habituation) more effective than reasoned rational thought for understanding values and incorporating them into our behaviour?
<b>EDUCATIONAL COMPANION TO THE QUESTIONS</b>
<b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>Rambam’s approach to many of the mitzvot in the Torah is that they were designed to wean the people away from the conventions of worship at the time, which was idolatry. In an age where polytheism and idolatry no longer exist in a significant way, at least in the Western world, it may be hard to relate to this approach to mitzvot. Ramban takes an approach that is based on human nature. There is little evidence that this aspect of human nature – the propensity to violence – has changed at all since the biblical period, and so perhaps we can argue that his approach is still relevant.
The Torah clearly permits the eating of meat, yet at the same time has a deeply developed ethical-legal approach to how we eat meat, where the rights and experience of the animal is central. However, vegetarianism is a legitimate approach in Judaism and some Jewish thinkers would even suggest that while it is not mandatory, it is a higher ethical way of living. However, Jewish law makes it clear that consuming blood, the life force of an animal, is prohibited. Further to the two opinions presented here, there is the overall symbolism of consuming the very essence of the life of an animal, and this prohibition has a deep significance and educational value in that respect.
Are we impervious to our environment? Do our surroundings, the people we mix with, or even the food we eat influence our behavior and who we become? The ideas discussed here suggest the Torah believes we are affected by our environment. The Torah and Jewish law try to ensure that even while eating animals, we do so in a moral and ethical way, so that we are not impacted in a negative way by the act of eating a living being. In this way we are sanctifying the physical.
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br>While some may think that football fandom is dangerously close to idolatry (in that it is worship of something that is not God), there are many other similarities to religious worship that can even make a positive contribution to one’s life. The sense of community and belonging, the passion and dreams for a common destiny, the rituals of fandom, and the moral code that governs the game are all similar to religious worship.
However, football (and any team sport) also has many similarities with war, and some sociologists suggest it is a safe proxy for man’s need for conflict. Uniforms, war cries, combative battle (on the pitch, but sadly sometimes in the stands also) make sport a benign substitute for what some believe is the human need to have enemies and wage war with them. However, what is interesting is that built into the structure of international football is that at periodic times during the season opposing fans are forced to be on the same side as they support their national team. This is an effective way to remind us that ultimately we all have much more in common with each other than that which is different and separates us. What an important message for “real life”!
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>This comment reflects on the evolution of humankind. Written into the DNA of every human is the need to survive and guarantee the continuation of their species. This often leads to violence when we or our progeny are threatened. This has caused humans to become tribal, and often ends in violence against those outside of the tribe (even in cases where there is no real threat). A higher form of existence is to conquer the need for violence (in cases where there is no real threat) and create a society where difference is celebrated.
Rabbi Sacks is using football as a metaphor for life. It is too easy to feel that God embraces, loves, and protects only our “tribe,” whether that be my religion, my nation, or my community (which could include my football tribe!). If we take a moment to realise that God is big enough to be the God of my tribe as well as yours, that He is “the God of the game,” then we are more likely to embrace and respect our differences, and be aware that we are all loved by God.
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>Blood symbolises the source of life itself. While it is permissible to eat God’s creations, not eating blood ensures we have a sensitivity to the essence of life and the status of animals as God’s creations that also received life from God in the same way as humans.
The Torah clearly permits the eating of meat, yet at the same time has a deeply developed ethical legal approach to how we eat meat, where the rights and experience of the animal is central. However, vegetarianism is a legitimate approach in Judaism and some Jewish thinkers would even suggest that while it is not mandatory, it is a higher ethical way of living. But it should be noted that Ramban’s approach is not that the act of eating an animal makes a human bloodthirsty, but rather the act of consuming the animals’ blood, which he feels has some kind of impact on our own soul, as it will take on the characteristics of the animal (because we have consumed specifically the blood).
Sometimes it takes repeated action to absorb an idea as a value. Rational thought cannot be guaranteed in every situation. Sometimes our reason deserts us, but ritual becomes second nature. Practice makes certain responses immediate and intuitive, bypassing the slow, deliberative circuits in the brain.

Shmini

In a Nutshell

<b><i>IN A NUTSHELL</i></b><br><i>Parashat Shemini</i> is the last chapter of the long section that we began in the twenty-fifth chapter of Shemot. We started with the command to build the <i>Mishkan</i> (the portable Temple) and in <i>Shemini</i>, the building and preparations are all finished. It is finally time to start using the <i>Mishkan</i>. Special priestly celebrations took place to mark the services beginning.
But the happy moment soon turned to sadness. Tragically, two of Aharon’s sons brought a “strange fire” as a sacrifice to God, and as punishment, both sons died.
Next, the <i>parasha</i> defines some more laws for the <i>kohanim</i> (priests), such as not serving in the Sanctuary while drunk, and when and where the <i>kohanim</i> can eat the sacrifices. Lastly, the <i>parasha</i> describes the dietary laws (<i>kashrut</i>), specifically mentioning which animals, fish, and birds we can eat.
<b>QUESTION TO PONDER</b>
<i>Why do you think Aharon’s sons Nadav and Avihu were punished for bringing a “strange fire”?</i>

I; Limits

<big><strong>I. Limits</strong></big><br><b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>The story of Nadav and Avihu, Aharon’s two eldest sons who died on the day the <i>Mishkan</i> was dedicated, is one of the most tragic in the Torah. It turned a day that should have been a national celebration into one of deep grief and sadness. Aharon’s pain was so great he could not speak. A sense of mourning fell over the camp and the people. God had told Moshe that it was dangerous to have the Divine Presence within the camp (Shemot 33:3), but even Moshe could not have predicted something as serious as this.
But what exactly did Nadav and Avihu do wrong? There are many explanations given by the Sages. Some say that they wanted to lead the people and were impatiently waiting for Moshe and Aharon to die. Others say that their sin was that they never married because they thought no women were good enough for them. Others say their sin was that they were drunk. Others say that they did not ask for guidance as to what they should do and what they were not allowed to do on this day. Yet another explanation is that they entered the Holy of Holies, where only the high priest was permitted to go.
The simplest answer, though, is actually the one found in the Torah’s description of the story. They offered “<i>strange fire that was not commanded</i>.” Why should they have done such a thing? And why was it so serious an error?
It is likely that in this time of great celebration, they were carried away by the mood of the moment. They acted in a kind of ecstasy (from such deep joy and passion) and perhaps they lost control. They were caught up by the sheer excitement of the opening of the first collective house of worship in the history of Avraham’s children. Their behaviour was spontaneous. They wanted to do something extra, uncommanded, to express their religious fervour. But they went too far. They should have followed the instructions that were given to them.
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. Why is it dangerous to be creative and to seek new ways to worship God?</i>
<i>2. How do our laws prevent this from happening?</i>
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br><i>Sometimes it takes a terrible trauma to bring what is important to the forefront of our minds. During the Covid pandemic, the world was ravaged by a terrible disease, with millions affected directly and millions more finding themselves trapped in their homes, glued to the terrible news unfolding around the world. Governments around the world desperately tried to keep them safe, while a vibrant humanity who would normally wake up every day and rush to live their lives was suddenly forced to stop and stay home.</i>
<i>Abruptly, with no warning, the things that had only the previous week seemed important, like money and possessions, jobs and school grades, travel plans and shopping trips, became insignificant. Instead we realised what was most important: our health, our family, and the friends and family we couldn’t be with at that time. Then we really understood the true value of those things: the things that are really critical in life.</i>
<i>Now we have a new appreciation for the people who make our lives possible. The everyday heroes in our lives. The doctors and nurses, the first responders and key workers, such as shop workers, farmers, teachers, delivery people, and refuse collectors. Our lives would not be possible without these people.</i>
<i>Let’s hope that this new sense of appreciation and gratitude will not be lost as our lives return to normal. A new normal. Changed forever. We pray for the better.</i>
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. How has the Coronavirus pandemic forced us to take a step back and recover a sense of our limitations?</i>
<i>2. Can we find ways to thrive under such strict limitations?</i>
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>What was wrong with Nadav and Avihu acting spontaneously? Moshe had acted spontaneously when he broke the tablets after the sin of the Golden Calf. Centuries later, David would act spontaneously when he danced as the Ark was brought into Jerusalem. Neither of them was punished for their behaviour (although Mikhal did reprimand her husband David after his dance). What made Nadav and Avihu deserve so severe a punishment?
The difference was that Moshe was a prophet. David was a king. But Nadav and Avihu were priests. Prophets and kings sometimes act spontaneously, because they both inhabit the world of time. To fulfil their functions, they need a sense of history. They develop an intuitive grasp of time. They understand the mood of the moment, and what it calls for. For them, today is not yesterday, and tomorrow will be different again. That leads them, from time to time, to act spontaneously because that is what the moment requires.
Moshe knew that only something as dramatic as shattering the tablets would bring the people to their senses and convey to them how grave was their sin. David knew that by dancing alongside the Ark, he would express to the people a sense of the significance of what was happening, that Jerusalem was about to become not just the political capital but also the spiritual centre of the nation. These acts of precisely judged spontaneity were essential in shaping the destiny of the people.
But priests have a different role altogether. They inhabit a world that is timeless, ahistorical, in which nothing significant changes. The daily, weekly, and yearly sacrifices were always the same. Every element of the service of the <i>Mishkan</i> was bound by its own detailed rules, and nothing of significance was left to the discretion of the priest.
<i>The priest was the guardian of order</i>. It was his job to maintain boundaries, between sacred and secular, pure and impure, perfect and blemished, permitted and forbidden. His domain was that of <i>the holy</i>, the points at which the infinite and eternal enter the world of the finite and mortal. As God tells Aharon in our <i>parasha</i>: “You must distinguish between the sacred and the profane, and between the unclean and the clean; and you must teach the Israelites all the laws which the Lord has imparted to them through Moshe.” The key verbs for the priest were <i>lehavdil</i>, to distinguish, and <i>lehorot</i>, to teach. The priest made distinctions and taught the people to do likewise.
<i>The priestly vocation was to remind the people that there are limits</i>. There is an order to the universe and we must respect it. Spontaneity has no place in the life of the priest or the service of the Sanctuary. That is what Nadav and Avihu failed to honour. It might have seemed like a minor transgression, but it was in fact a negation of everything the <i>Mishkan</i> and the priesthood stood for.
There are limits. That is also what the story of Adam and Ḥava in the Garden of Eden is about. Why did God go to the trouble of creating two trees, the Tree of Life and the Tree of Knowledge, from which human beings are forbidden to eat? Why did He tell the humans what the trees were and what their fruit could do? Why expose them to temptation? Who would not wish to have knowledge and eternal life if they could acquire them by merely eating a fruit? Why plant these trees in a garden where the humans could not help but see them? Why put Adam and Ḥava to a test they were unlikely to pass?
God did this to teach them, and us, that even in Eden, in a world of paradise, there are limits. There are certain things we can do, and would like to do, that we must not do.
Today, the classic example is the environment. As Jared Diamond has documented in his books, <i>Guns, Germs and Steel</i>, and <i>Collapse</i>, almost wherever human beings have set foot, they have left a trail of destruction in their wake. They have farmed lands to exhaustion and hunted animals to extinction. They have done so because they have not had, embedded in their minds and habits, the notion of limits. Hence the concept, key to environmental ethics, of sustainability, meaning limiting your exploitation of the earth’s resources to the point where they can renew themselves. A failure to observe those limits causes human beings to be exiled from their own garden of Eden.
In <i>The True and Only Heaven</i>, Christopher Lasch argued that the scientific revolution and the Enlightenment endowed us with the belief that there are no limits, that science and technology will solve every problem they create and the earth will continue indefinitely to yield its bounty. Forget limits and eventually we lose paradise. That is the warning for all of us within the story of Adam and Ḥava.
In a remarkable passage in his 1976 book on inflation, <i>The Reigning Error,</i> William Rees-Mogg waxed eloquent about the role of Jewish law in securing Jewish survival. It did so by containing the energies of the people – Jews are, he said, “a people of an electric energy, both of personality and of mind.” Nuclear energy, he says, is immensely powerful but at the same time needs to be contained. He then says this:
“In the same way, the energy of the Jewish people has been enclosed in a different type of container, the law. That has acted as a bottle inside which the spiritual and intellectual energy could be held; only because it could be held has it been possible to make use of it. It has not merely exploded or been dispersed; it has been harnessed as a continuous power…. Contained energy can be a driving force over an indefinite period; uncontrolled energy is merely a big and usually destructive bang. In human nature only disciplined energy is effective.”
That was the role of the priest, and it is the continuing role of halakha. Both are expressions of limits: rules, laws, and distinctions. Without limits, civilisations can be as thrilling and short-lived as fireworks. To survive they need to find a way of containing energy so that it lasts, undiminished. That was the priest’s role and what Nadav and Avihu betrayed by introducing spontaneity where it does not belong. As Rees-Mogg said, “Uncontrolled energy is merely a big and usually destructive bang.”
<b>I believe that we need to recover a sense of limits because, in our uncontrolled search for ever greater affluence, we are endangering the future of the planet and betraying our responsibility to generations not yet born</b>. There are such things as fruit we should not eat and fire we should not bring.
<b>QUESTION TO PONDER</b>
<i>What do you think has caused the human race to lose its perspective on the importance of having limits in the world?</i>
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>One of the greatest challenges in free societies is to maintain a balance between the “I” of self-interest and the “We” of the common good. We must be able to compete but also to cooperate. There is within each of us an “I” that asks: “What’s in it for me?” But there is also a “We” that knows that “we are all in this together.”
I would hope that we emerge from this long dark night with an enhanced sense of “We.” Never in my lifetime have we lived through a period in which people in every country throughout the world are suffering the same fears, the same dangers, the same risks. When it comes to real fundamentals like life and health, what unites us is greater than what divides us. Despite all our affluence and technological powers, one tiny virus has brought humanity to its knees. From here on, we should never underestimate our vulnerability.
<b><i>The Mail on Sunday</i>, March 29, 2020</b>
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>Why do you think there are so many different explanations for what the sin of Nadav and Avihu was?
Why must we be cautious with religious spontaneity? How do religious rules and laws help?
How can we apply this message about the importance of limits to our own lives?
<b>EDUCATIONAL COMPANION TO THE QUESTIONS</b>
<b><i>IN A NUTSHELL</i></b><br>There are many rabbinic explanations to explain what their sin was. The text states that they brought “a strange fire” to the <i>Mishkan</i>. As Aharon’s sons, they were <i>kohanim</i>, with important responsibilities. But they didn’t follow the rules that Hashem had given them. Although there was a clear way that Hashem had asked the <i>kohanim</i> to behave when conducting the rituals in the <i>Mishkan</i>, Aharon’s sons Nadav and Avihu had ignored this and decided to instead do their own thing.
<b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>Although their intentions may have been pure, it is dangerous to use emotional spontaneity to worship Hashem. This could (and has often in history) led to destructive and impure results. An example from the Torah is the Golden Calf (where the people seemingly were trying to use the idol to connect to God in the absence of Moshe, their spiritual leader).
The complex laws of Judaism are designed to prevent this from happening, and Nadav and Avihu ignored them, and allowed themselves to get carried away by their own passion. Although passion and emotion are definitely encouraged in worship of God, the laws are the receptacle through which this passion is channelled. The laws protect us from becoming overwhelmed with emotion and passion for God.
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br>Rabbi Sacks concludes this<i> Covenant &amp; Conversation</i> essay with the belief that we need to recover a sense of our limits. Humanity has lost their perspective on what is important in life, in our constant drive to build and develop our world and create more wealth. We have been arrogant and demonstrated hubris, as we progressed as a human race, believing technology and science could solve every problem and challenge. Our progress as a species has been magnificent, but it has sometimes been at the expense of our core values and we have lost a sense of the important things in life. The pandemic forced us to withdraw from the relentless race and helped us to take stock. In many ways, the world is healing itself (less pollution, for example), as humanity withdraws from it to some degree. While this may be temporary, we hope that the lessons we are learning will not be.
Sometimes limitations force us to reconsider, to be creative, and to try harder. Many people in quarantine are connecting positively with one another using digital platforms such as video calls. Many have changed the way they work, started exercising innovatively, or learned new hobbies. Exciting initiatives have started through social media, with strangers teaming up to fundraise and volunteer together. We have found new appreciation for our key workers. We have even found ways to show support for key workers while confined to our homes, like country-wide claps for national medical teams. Dave Stutman once wrote, “Complacency is the enemy of progress.” The new limits and rules in place right now may seem severe, but we can always find ways to connect with each other, and sometimes under duress, we can thrive.
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>The magnificent progress and achievements of humankind in a relatively short space of time have led to arrogance and overconfidence. Humanity has placed too much faith in science and technology, and lost its sense of perspective and responsibility. We hope that humanity will grow and regain a sense of perspective from the challenges it currently faces. Nadav and Avihu demonstrated some of the arrogance and hubris humans are often prone to. They believed they knew better how to connect to and worship God. We must learn their lesson. We need to remember that we are limited as a species and we need to follow the guidance of God.
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>The fact that there are so many explanations for why they were punished is a reflection on the ambiguity of their sin found in the verses in the Torah. The most obvious explanation, found in the verse and explained more fully by Rabbi Sacks, is that they demonstrated spontaneity in their worship, but this is not easily understood at a superficial level.
In the words of William Rees-Mogg, as quoted above, “Uncontrolled energy is merely a big and usually destructive bang.” Religious spontaneity can lead and has led to destructive forces if not harnessed and controlled. Jewish history has many examples of this, from the Golden Calf to the various false messiahs we have encountered. Religious law contains and channels this energy safely.
Rabbi Sacks uses the environment as an example of an important area where we can apply this message to our contemporary lives. Without limits, humanity has put the well-being of the planet and future generations at risk. We have been learning similar lessons during these challenging times of living in a world with the Covid virus. The pandemic forced us to withdraw and to recognise our limitations as a species. We pray we have learned some important lessons from this time.

II; Between Hope and Humanity

<big><strong>II. Between Hope and Humanity</strong></big><br><b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>It should have been a day of happiness and celebration. The <i>Mishkan</i>, the children of Israel’s first house of worship, was finished. For seven days, Moshe had performed the ceremony that declared the <i>Mishkan</i> open for business. Now, the eighth day had finally arrived on the first of Nisan. The priests, led by Aharon, were ready to begin their service.
It was just then that tragedy occurred. Two of Aharon’s sons, Nadav and Avihu, brought a “strange fire, which [God] had not commanded them.” Fire then “came from God” and they died. We then follow two conversations between Moshe and Aharon. The first:
“Moshe then said to Aharon, ‘This is what the Lord spoke of when He said, “Among those who are near to Me, I will show Myself holy; in the sight of all the people I will be honoured.”’ Aharon remained silent” (Vayikra 10:3).
Moshe then commanded their bodies to be removed, and Aharon and his remaining sons not to perform the usual customs of mourning. He also gave them more instructions to prevent such tragedies from happening again in the future, and then checked whether the sacrifices of the day had been performed. He discovered that Aharon and his sons had burned the sin offering, instead of eating it. This led to the second conversation:
“[Moshe] was angry with Elazar and Itamar, Aharon’s remaining sons, and asked, ‘Why didn’t you eat the sin offering in the Sanctuary area? It is most holy and was given to you to gain forgiveness for the community before God. Since its blood was not taken into the holy place, you should have eaten the goat in the Sanctuary area, as I commanded.’
“Aharon replied to Moshe, ‘Today they sacrificed their sin offering and their burnt offering before the Lord, but now that this has happened to me today, would God have been pleased if I had eaten the sin offering?’ When Moshe heard this, he approved” (Vayikra 10:16–20).
The psychology behind these two conversations is fascinating. Moshe tries to comfort his brother, who has lost two of his sons. He tells him that God has said, “Among those who are near to Me, I will show Myself holy.” According to Rashi, this means, “Now I see that they [Nadav and Avihu] were greater than you and me.” The holier the person, the more God demands of them.
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. Were the words of Moshe to Aharon (regarding the death of his sons) inappropriate? If not, then was 
Aharon wrong to refuse to be consoled by them?</i>
<i>2. Is it fair to expect Aharon to ignore his pain and continue to perform his role as a spiritual leader for the people?</i>
<i>3. What can we learn from the two conversations together?</i>
It is as if Moshe said to Aharon: “My brother, do not give up now. We have come so far. We have climbed so high. I know your heart is broken. We thought that our troubles were behind us, that after all we suffered in Egypt, and at the Red Sea, and in the battle against Amalek, and in the sin of the Golden Calf, we were finally safe and free. And now this has happened. But Aharon, don’t give up, don’t lose faith, don’t despair. Your children died not because they were evil but because they were holy. Their act was wrong but their intentions were good. They just tried too hard.” But despite Moshe’s words of consolation, “Aharon remained silent,” because his pain was too great at that moment.
In the second conversation, Moshe is concerned with something else – the community, whose sins should have been forgiven through the sin offering. It is as if he had said to Aharon: “My brother, I know you are in pain. But you are not just a private person. You are also the high priest. The people need you to perform your duties, whatever you feel inside.” But Aharon replies: “Would God have been pleased if I had eaten the sin offering today?” Perhaps Aharon is saying: “I know that in general, a high priest is forbidden to mourn as if he were an ordinary person. That is the law, and I accept it. But had I acted today as if nothing had happened, as if my sons had not died, would this not seem to the people as if I were heartless, as if human life and death meant nothing, as if service of God meant denying my humanity?” This time, Moshe is silent. Aharon is right, and Moshe knows it.
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br>Rabbi Yekutiel Halberstam, the Klausenberger Rebbe, lived through the Warsaw Ghetto, the work camps, the death march to Dachau, and then Auschwitz itself. He survived, but his wife and eleven children did not. In Auschwitz, he vowed that if he survived he would dedicate himself to life. He resolved to build a hospital that would honour the image of God in every human being. It took him fifteen years to raise the money, but eventually he built the Laniado Hospital in Netanya, Israel, dedicated to treating everyone alike, Jew and Arab, Israeli and Palestinian. This is what he taught his followers after the Holocaust:
<i>The biggest miracle of all is the one that we, the survivors of the Holocaust, after all that we witnessed and lived through, still believe and have faith in the Almighty God, may His name be blessed. This, my friends, is the miracle of miracles, the greatest miracle ever to have taken place.</i>
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. Why do you think the Klausenberger Rebbe chose a hospital to be his legacy?</i>
<i>2. Would you describe faith after the Holocaust as a miracle?</i>
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>In the two exchanges between two brothers we saw in <i>The Core Idea</i> above, a momentous courage is born: the courage of an Aharon who has the strength to grieve and not accept any easy consolation, and the courage of a Moshe who has the strength to keep going in spite of grief. It is almost as if we are present at the birth of an emotional configuration that will characterise the Jewish people in centuries to come. Jews are a people who have had more than their share of suffering. Like Aharon, they did not lose their humanity. They did not allow their sense of grief to be dulled, deadened, desensitised. But neither did they lose their capacity to continue, to carry on, to hope. Like Moshe, they never lost faith in God. But like Aharon, they never allowed that faith to anaesthetise their feelings, their human vulnerability. That, it seems to me, is what happened to the Jewish people after the Holocaust. There were, and are, no words to silence the grief or end the tears. We may say – as Moshe said to Aharon – that the victims were innocent, holy, that they died <i>al kiddush Hashem</i>, “in sanctification of God’s name.” Surely that is true. Yet nonetheless, “Aharon remained silent.” When all the explanations and consolations have been given, grief remains, refusing to be pacified. We would not be human were it otherwise. That, surely, is also the message of the book of Iyov. Iyov’s comforters were pious in their intentions, but God preferred Iyov’s grief to their justification of tragedy. Yet, like Moshe, the Jewish people found the strength to continue, to reaffirm hope in the face of despair, life in the presence of death. A mere three years after coming eye to eye with the Angel of Death, the Jewish people, by establishing the State of Israel, made the single most powerful affirmation in two thousand years that <i>am Yisrael ḥai</i>, the Jewish people lives. Moshe and Aharon were like the two hemispheres of the Jewish brain: human emotion on the one hand, faith in God, the covenant, and the future on the other. Without the second, we would have lost our hope. Without the first, we would have lost our humanity. It is not easy to keep that balance, that tension. Yet it is essential. Faith does not render us invulnerable to tragedy but it gives us the strength to mourn and then, despite everything, to carry on.
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>The survivors I came to know in the past twenty years were astonishing in their tenacious hold on life. Perhaps it’s how they survived. Some believed in God, others didn’t, but they all believed in life – not life as most of us understand it, something taken for granted, part of the background, a fact that rarely holds our attention, but life as something to fight for, as a consciously articulated value, as something of whose fragility you are constantly aware. They had, in Paul Tillich’s phrase, the courage to be. Slowly I began to think about a phrase, not one that exists in the traditional literature, but one that was articulated in fateful circumstances and constituted a kind of turning point in modern Jewish history: <i>kiddush haḥayim</i>, the sanctification of life.
I had expected that trauma would turn the survivors inward, making them suspicious of, even hostile to, the wider world. It didn’t, at least not those I knew, and by the time I came to know them. Many of them had undertaken, fifty or more years after the event, to visit schools, talking to children, especially non-Jewish children. What amazed me as I listened to them telling their stories was what they wanted to say. Cherish freedom. Understand what a gift it is to be able to walk in the open, to see a flower, open a window, breathe free air. Love others. Never hate. Practise tolerance. Stand up for others if they are being picked on, bullied, ostracised. Live each day as if it might be your last. They taught the children to have faith in life. The children loved these elderly strangers from another world. I read some of their letters to them; they made me cry. Their courage kept me going through tough times. I count myself blessed to have known them.
<b><i>Future Tense</i>, 253–254</b>
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. How does this passage sum up the message contained in this</i> Covenant &amp; Conversation <i>essay?</i>
<i>2. How can we continue the faith and courage of the survivors?</i>
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>What are the two examples of courage found in the <i>parasha</i>? Which do you think shows more strength?
Where can we find the message of the bravery of Aharon and Moshe in recent Jewish history?
According to Rabbi Sacks, what can be found in “the two hemispheres of the human brain” and in whom are these embodied in the <i>parasha</i>?
<b>EDUCATIONAL COMPANION TO THE QUESTIONS</b>
<b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>Moshe was right to try and console Aharon by explaining the context of the deaths of his sons – that they were holy, but they made a human error. Moshe tried to give Aharon the strength to continue on, despite this tragedy and his grief. However, Aharon could not hear the words, because of his pain. Perhaps it was just a little too early for him to consider moving on and he needed at this moment to be in a place of pain.
Aharon is functioning on two levels – as a human being, who is grieving the loss of his sons, and as the spiritual priestly leader of the Jewish people. The people are relying on him, and Moshe was reminding him of this responsibility. While it is not fair to disregard or dismiss his grief, and while Moshe needed to allow him to mourn, Moshe was correct to remind Aharon that he also had responsibilities to the people.
The message of the two conversations taken together is that we need to find a balance. Judaism always takes this approach to joy and grief. Sometimes, at the height of our happiness we still find room to grieve. Examples of this include saying <i>Yizkor</i> on Yom Tov, breaking a glass to remember the destruction of the Temple under the <i>ḥuppa</i>, and the transition from Yom HaZikaron to Yom HaAtzma’ut. In the <i>Thinking More Deeply</i> section, Rabbi Sacks suggests this message was actualised in recent Jewish history as the generation that suffered the Holocaust went on to build the fledgling State of Israel. To ignore the suffering of Jewish history completely is to deny ourselves our very humanity. However, to become crippled by grief is inherently un-Jewish. We must move on with courage.
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br>A hospital represents healing and life, the opposite of the darkness of the Holocaust. This particular hospital was founded on the principles of honouring the image of God in every human being, no matter their religion or race. This was a deeply fitting response to the Holocaust which was perpetrated by people who believed in a political philosophy based on opposite values.
The Klausenberger Rebbe saw the worst of humanity in the Holocaust, enough to shake any person’s belief in God. Many people who lived through the Holocaust lost their faith and no one is in a position to judge them for this. For the Rebbe, it goes against reason that anyone should maintain their faith in God after experiencing that. However, he and many thousands of other survivors did keep their faith, and he describes this as a miracle (an act that goes against rational reason). Rabbi Eliezer Berkovits in his book <i>Faith After the Holocaust</i> suggests that because of these survivors who managed to keep their faith intact, we, the generations that follow, cannot use the Holocaust as a reason to lose faith. However, this period of Jewish history is a difficult one to reflect on and understandably it does raise questions for many. Perhaps the miracle is the rebirth of the Jewish people in the years that followed the Holocaust, a testament to that generation’s faith (see <i>From the Thought of Rabbi Sacks</i>).
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>For some things, true consolation will never come. But that does not mean there is no way to move on, and debilitating grief must be avoided. However, to not grieve at all, to ignore or dismiss tragedy, lacks humanity. This is an important lesson on an individual and national level. As a people we put aside specific days for our grief (such as Yom HaShoah) but taking the lead of these survivors, we refuse to be crippled by our grief. The survivors and the nation as a whole have shown tremendous courage and drive for continuity and rebirth.
Sadly, the number of survivors in our midst is dwindling and it is more important than ever to continue their legacy. We can do that by never forgetting what happened to our people in their generation. But equally we must continue to live and build and make a <i>kiddush haḥayim.</i>
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>Two examples of courage are the courage of Aharon, who has the strength to grieve and not accept an easy consolation, and the courage of Moshe, who has the strength to keep going in spite of grief. Sometimes, facing grief and not finding a way to explain it away (for example, “It is God’s will”), is as brave as moving past grief and building a brighter future. The grief may never disappear – living with grief is what takes courage.
The response of the Jewish people in the post-Holocaust era is a model of these two types of courage. “There were, and are, no words to silence the grief or end the tears” – there can be no explanation for the Holocaust. Yet, like Moshe, the Jewish people found the strength to continue, to reaffirm hope in the face of despair, life in the presence of death. A mere three years after coming eye to eye with the Angel of Death, the Jewish people, by establishing the State of Israel, made the single most powerful affirmation in two thousand years that <i>am Yisrael ḥai</i>, the Jewish people lives.
Human emotion can be found in one hemisphere, and faith in God, the covenant, and the future, in the other. Without the second, we would have lost our hope. Without the first, we would have lost our humanity. Aharon represents the courage to embrace human emotion and what it means to be human, and Moshe represents faith in God and the future, and the need to build and progress despite grief and pain.

Tazria

In a Nutshell

<b><i>IN A NUTSHELL</i></b><br><i>Parashat Tazria</i> continues to discuss the laws of purity (<i>tahara</i>) and impurity (<i>tum’a</i>) and the key role that the priest plays to distinguish between them. If you were impure, you were forbidden from entering the holy space of the Sanctuary.
These categories show us the difference between God and human beings. God is immortal (exists forever); humans are mortal (will all die one day). God is spiritual; humans are also physical. The things that make a person <i>tamei</i> are connected to our mortality (that we die) and physicality (that we have a physical body and not just a soul).
The <i>parasha</i> begins with the laws relating to childbirth – the impurity it brings, and also the command to circumcise a male child on the eighth day. It continues with laws relating to <i>tzaraat</i>, often translated as leprosy, but which refers to something larger than a disease, because it affects not only people but also clothes and houses. It was the job of the priest to examine the symptoms, and to declare the person clean or unclean or to be separated until a clearer decision could be made. The Sages said that <i>tzaraat</i> is a punishment for the sin of <i>lashon hara</i> (evil speech).
<b>QUESTION TO PONDER</b>
<i>Why do you think these laws want us to remember always that we are physical and mortal (and can therefore become ill and die)?</i>

I; Othello, Twitter, and Mildewed Walls

<big><strong>I. Othello, Twitter, and Mildewed Walls</strong></big><br><b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>It was the Septuagint, the early Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible, that translated <i>tzaraat</i>, the condition whose identification and cleansing occupies much of <i>Tazria</i> and <i>Metzora</i>, as “<i>lepra</i>,” giving rise to a long tradition identifying it with leprosy.
That tradition is now widely acknowledged to be incorrect. First, the condition described in the Torah simply does not fit the symptoms of leprosy. Second, the Torah applies it not only to various skin conditions but also to mildew (mould or fungus) on clothes and the walls of houses, which certainly rules out any known disease. The Rambam puts it best: “<i>Tzaraat</i> is a comprehensive term covering a number of dissimilar conditions. Thus whiteness in a person’s skin is called <i>tzaraat</i>. The falling off of some of his hair on the head or the chin is called <i>tzaraat</i>. A change of colour in garments or in houses is called <i>tzaraat</i>” (<i>Hilkhot Tumat Tzaraat</i> 16:10).
Seeking to identify the nature of the phenomenon, the Sages looked for clues elsewhere in the Torah and found them readily available. Miriam was afflicted with <i>tzaraat</i> for speaking badly about her brother Moshe (Bemidbar 12:10). The Torah later gives special emphasis to this event, seeing it as a warning for all generations: “Be careful with regard to the plague of <i>tzaraat….</i> Remember what the Lord your God did to Miriam along the way after you came out of Egypt” (Devarim 24:8–9).
It was, in other words, not a normal phenomenon in nature, but rather a specific divine punishment for <i>lashon hara</i>, evil speech. The Rabbis drew attention to the similarity between the words <i>metzora</i>, a person afflicted by the condition, and <i>motzi shem ra</i>, someone guilty of slander.
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. How do we know that tzaraat is a punishment?</i>
<i>2. Why do you think the Rabbis made a word play, connecting the Hebrew words for someone suffering with tzaraat and someone guilty of slander?</i>
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br><i>Close your eyes.</i>
<i>Imagine yourself in your friend’s house hanging out. Their parents are out of town for the day and you have the house to yourselves. Take a look at who is there. What are you doing? What are you talking about? Spend a few moments imagining what the conversation is about.</i>
<i>Now imagine that you hear a knock on the door, and it is your parents, who walk straight in and sit at the side of the room (awkward…have they lost their minds?!). “You kids carry on as if we weren’t here,” they say to you all. Do you? How does your behaviour or your conversation change?</i>
<i>You usher them out (enough is enough!) and they go back home. But next, your friend’s grandparents knock on the door and join the party. “We just wanted to check in on you all,” they say. “You kids carry on as if we weren’t here,” they mumble as they sit down on the couch. (What is it with all these old people? FOMO?!) How does their presence in the room change everyone’s behaviour and conversation?</i>
<i>As your friend’s grandparents suddenly realise they have a bridge game to get to, inexplicably, your local rabbi turns up at the door. “I just came to borrow a book from your father,” he says to your friend as he sits down in the middle of the room (this guided imagination exercise has gotten out of hand now!). “You kids carry on as if I weren’t here,” he says. Do you? How does your behaviour or your conversation change?</i>
<i>Now open your eyes, and reflect on the relief that this has all been a bizarre daydream!</i>
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. Why do we sometimes behave differently depending on who is watching?</i>
<i>2. Imagine if someone was always watching (check out the movie</i> The Truman Show<i>!). Is Someone always watching?</i>
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>Rambam, on the basis of rabbinic traditions, gives a brilliant account of why <i>tzaraat</i> afflicted both inanimate objects like walls and clothes, and human beings:
<i>“It</i> [tzaraat]<i> was a sign and wonder among the Israelites to warn them against slanderous speaking. For if a man uttered slander, the walls of his house would suffer a change. If he repented, the house would again become clean. But if he continued in his wickedness until the house was torn down, leather objects in his house on which he sat or laid would suffer a change. If he repented, they would again become clean. But if he continued in his wickedness until they were burned, the garments which he wore would suffer a change. If he repented, they would again become clean. But if he continued in his wickedness until they were burned, his skin would suffer a change and he would become infected by</i> tzaraat<i> and be set apart and alone until he no more engaged in the conversation of the wicked which is scoffing and slander”</i> (<i>Hilkhot Tumat Tzaraat</i> 16:10).
The most compelling illustration of what the tradition is speaking about when it talks of the gravity of <i>motzi shem ra</i>, slander, and <i>lashon hara</i>, evil speech, is Shakespeare’s tragedy <i>Othello</i>. Iago, a high-ranking soldier, is bitterly resentful of Othello, a Moorish general in the army of Venice. Othello has promoted a younger man, Cassio, over the more experienced Iago, who is determined to take revenge. He does so in a prolonged and vicious campaign, which involves, among other things, tricking Othello into the suspicion that his wife, Desdemona, is having an adulterous affair with Cassio. Othello asks Iago to kill Cassio, and he himself kills Desdemona, smothering her in her bed. Emilia, Iago’s wife and Desdemona’s attendant, discovers her mistress dead and as Othello explains why he has killed her, realises the nature of her husband’s plot and exposes it. Othello, in guilt and grief, commits suicide, while Iago is arrested and taken to be tortured and possibly executed.
It is a play entirely about the evil of slander and suspicion, and portrays literally what the Sages said figuratively, that “evil speech kills three people: the one who says it, the one who listens to it, and the one about whom it is said” (Arakhin 15b).
Shakespeare’s tragedy makes it painfully clear how much evil speech lives in the dark corners of suspicion. Had the others known what Iago was saying to stir up fear and distrust, the facts might have become known and the tragedy averted. As it was, he was able to mislead the various characters, playing on their emotional weaknesses and envy, getting each to believe the worst about one another. It ends in serial bloodshed and disaster.
Hence the poetic justice Jewish tradition attributes to one of the least poetic of biblical passages, the laws relating to skin diseases and mildew. The slanderer spreads his lies in private, but his evil is exposed in public. First the walls of his house proclaim his sin, then the leather objects on which he sits, then his clothes, and eventually his skin itself. He is condemned to the humiliation of isolation:
<i>“‘Unclean! Unclean!’ he must call out.... Since he is unclean, he must remain alone, and his place shall be outside the camp”</i> (Vayikra 13:45–46).
<i>“Said the Rabbis: ‘Because his words separated husband from wife and brother from brother, his punishment is that he is separated from human contact and made an outcast from society’”</i> (Arakhin 16b).
WikiLeaks and other examples of whistleblowers often in the news aim at being today’s functional equivalent of the law of the <i>metzora</i>: an attempt to make public the discreditable things people do and say in private. The Sages said about evil speech that it was as bad as idolatry, incest, and murder combined, and it was Shakespeare’s genius to show us one dramatic way in which it can contaminate human relationships, turning people against one another with tragic consequences.
<b>I believe that the message of <i>tzaraat</i>, updated for today, is never say or do in private what you would be ashamed to read about on the front page of tomorrow’s newspapers.</b>
<b>QUESTION TO PONDER</b>
<i>What can we learn from this message for our world, where social media is so ever-present (see</i> From the Thought of Rabbi Sacks<i> below)?</i>
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>[Social media is] a new chapter in the world’s oldest story, the use of words as weapons by people seeking to inflict pain. New – because in the past most communications were face to face and set in some kind of social context, in which parents, teachers, or friends were aware of what was going on and could intervene. There were the occasional anonymous letter writers, but at least the pain they caused was private, not public the way social networking messages often are. By allowing people facelessly to make threats or be offensive or spread false rumours, the new sites are offering the demons of our nature the maximum of temptation combined with the maximum of opportunity.…
The technology is new, but the moral challenge is old. Judaism’s Sages were eloquent on the dangers of what they called evil speech, by which they meant derogatory, demeaning, or offensive words. They called this a cardinal sin and said that it destroys three people: the one who says it, the one he says it against, and the one who listens in. Words injure; they hurt; they wound. And every new technology that allows us to share words more widely calls for a renewed insistence on the ethics of communication. Free speech does not mean speech that costs nothing. It means speech that respects the freedom and dignity of others. Forget this and free speech will prove to be very expensive indeed.
<b><i>The Power of Ideas,</i> 27<i>–</i>28</b>
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>Why do you think people often speak <i>lashon hara</i>?
What is the impact of <i>lashon hara</i> on society?
Why is <i>tzaraat</i> an appropriate punishment for <i>lashon hara</i>?
<b>EDUCATIONAL COMPANION TO THE QUESTIONS</b>
<b><i>IN A NUTSHELL</i></b><br>A person who always remembers this is less likely to be arrogant. They are more likely to realise that life is short, and our actions have an impact on others. The connection between <i>tzaraat</i> and this idea is clear. Our words can be powerful (for the good and the bad) and although we may only live here on earth fleetingly, our words (and actions) can outlive us. So we have to make sure they are positive and for the good – words and actions that we can be proud of.
<b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>As the diverse types of occurrences of <i>tzaraat</i> cannot be connected to each other scientifically (in the words of Rambam, “<i>Tzaraat</i> is a comprehensive term covering a number of dissimilar conditions”), we must conclude that these unrelated phenomena are punishments for sins. But for which sin? The Rabbis looked for clues in the Torah. Miriam was afflicted with <i>tzaraat</i> for speaking badly about her brother Moshe (Bemidbar 12:10) and from this they conclude that <i>tzaraat</i> is a punishment for <i>lashon hara</i>.
The word play is for educational pedagogic reasons only. There is no etymological connection between the words. But because they sound similar, the Rabbis connected them to help us remember the theological connection between them – <i>tzaraat</i> is the punishment for slander and evil speech.
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br>There are people in our lives who remind us of who we are and how we should be behaving. Whether they be our parents, teachers, or other people we look up to, when we are around them we try to be our best selves, and when we are not, we sometimes forget to. People who we do not want to think badly of us inspire us to be better.
<i>The Truman Show</i> is a movie about a TV show that follows the life of a man who does not realise that the world around him is manufactured (for the show) and all the people in his life are actors. There are cameras following him everywhere he goes (unbeknownst to him) and millions of people around the world watching him on television. He does not know he is being watched (although he eventually realises and escapes), but if he did, can you imagine how this would impact his behaviour? How would you act if you knew there was always someone watching you? We do believe there is always someone, and that someone is God. But it is a constant effort to remember this and ensure our behaviour is befitting.
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>According to Rabbi Sacks, the message behind <i>tzaraat</i> being the punishment for <i>lashon hara</i> is “Never say or do in private what you would be ashamed to read about on the front page of tomorrow’s newspapers.” In <i>From the Thought of Rabbi Sacks</i>, he explores the dangers of social media as a semi-anonymous form of communication so often used for destructive communication. It can be argued that this is the message of <i>tzaraat</i> for our age – we must be careful of the way we use social media as a medium for communication. We have to ensure not to hide behind its anonymity and forget about the impact of our words and our moral responsibility when using them.
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>While it may be a part of human nature to use words for destructive means, this urge is something that we have a moral obligation to overcome, and this is what God demands of us. <i>Lashon hara</i> could be motivated by jealousy, insecurity, or pain of some other sort. These emotions are all normal and natural, but as the Rabbis said, this hateful language can destroy the lives of the person speaking, listening, and the subject of the evil speech.
Destructive speech can destroy lives and lead to a cycle of hate and devastation. This is why all societies have legislation protecting citizens from slanderous speech. But the Rabbis noted that <i>lashon hara</i> doesn’t just impact the subject of the evil speech. The people speaking and listening are also impacted negatively.
<i>Tzaraat</i> is an example of a <i>midda kenegged midda</i> (measure for measure) approach to punishment. <i>Lashon</i> <i>hara</i> is spoken in whispers behind backs, but the punishment for it is highly public and impossible to cover up.

II; The Sacrifices of Childbirth

<big><strong>II. The Sacrifices of Childbirth</strong></big><br><b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>At the start of this <i>parasha</i> is a cluster of laws that challenged and puzzled the commentators. A woman who has just given birth is unclean for seven or fourteen days (depending on the gender of the baby), and then she must wait for a further period of thirty-three or sixty-six days before coming into contact with holy objects or appearing at the Temple. She then has to bring two sacrifices, a sheep for a burnt offering and a dove for a sin offering.
The question is, why does she need to bring these sacrifices? We could understand if she had to bring a thanksgiving offering, to give thanks for the safe delivery of the baby, but that is not what she is commanded. Instead she must bring a burnt offering – normally brought for a serious wrongdoing – together with a sin offering. What, though, is her wrongdoing? What is her sin?
There is a fascinating story in the Talmud (Sanhedrin 38b) that can help us answer the question of the sin offering:
<i>“When the Holy One, blessed be He, came to create man, He created a group of angels first and asked them, ‘Should we make man in Our image?’</i>
<i>“They replied, ‘Master of the universe, what will be his actions?’ So God showed them the history of mankind. The angels replied, ‘Why would You be interested in creating such a creature?’ [We say no!]</i>
<i>“So God destroyed the angels. He created a second group, and asked them the same question, and they gave the same answer.</i>
<i>“And God destroyed them also. He created a third group of angels, and they replied, ‘Master of the universe, the first and second group of angels told You not to create man, and look what happened to them! You did not listen. All we can say is this: The universe is Yours. Do whatever You wish!’</i>
<i>“So God created man.</i>
<i>“But when it came to the generation of the Flood, and then to the generation of those who built the Tower of Bavel, the angels said to God, ‘See! The first angels were right! Look at how evil man is!’ God replied to them, ‘And until old age I will not change, and until you have grey hair, I will still be patient’” (Yeshaya 46:4).</i>
The angels were against the creation of humankind because they knew what humans were capable of – sinning and destroying the work of God. The story implies that God knew that humans would sin and yet still created us. This could explain the sin offering brought when a child is born. The child will one day sin. All people do. So a mother brings a sin offering in advance for any sin the child may commit while still a child, as if to say: “God, You knew humans would sin, and You still created us and commanded us to bring new lives into the world. Therefore, please accept this sin offering in advance for any wrong my child may do.”
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. Why did God ignore the first two groups of angels, and why did He ask them in the first place if He wasn’t going to listen to them?</i>
<i>2. Do all people sin? Why do you think this is?</i>
<i>3. Should parents be responsible for the future sins of their children?</i>
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br><i>Early on in his medical career, the Polish-Jewish doctor Janusz Korczak became concerned with caring for underprivileged children. He wrote books about what happens when they are not cared for and in 1911 he founded an orphanage for Jewish children in Warsaw. It became so successful that he was asked to create one for Catholic children as well, which he did.</i>
<i>He had his own radio programme which made him famous throughout Poland. He was known as the “old doctor” across the country. But he had revolutionary views about the young. He believed in trusting them and giving them responsibility. He got them to produce their own newspaper, the first children’s paper in Poland. He turned schools into self-governing communities. He wrote some of the great works of child psychology, including one called The Child’s Right to Respect. He believed that in every child’s soul there burns a moral flame that can be nurtured to brighten and defeat the darkness that can also be found in human nature.</i>
<i>In 1940 he and his orphans were driven into the Warsaw Ghetto. In 1942 the order came to transport all the children to Treblinka. Because he was a famous author, Korczak was offered the chance to escape, but he refused to abandon the children. In one of the most powerful moments of the Holocaust years, he walked with his two hundred orphans through the streets of Warsaw to the train that took them to the gates of death, inseparable from them to the end.</i>
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. Why were the ideas of Janusz Korczak so revolutionary in that generation?</i>
<i>2. Can you find the message of both</i> The Core Idea<i> and</i> Thinking More Deeply<i> in this story?</i>
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>Two questions remain about the laws following childbirth found in the <i>parasha</i>. Why is the mother of a newborn considered <i>tamei</i>, and why must she bring a burnt offering (in addition to the sin offering we have already discussed)?
The words <i>tamei</i> and <i>tahor</i>, normally translated as (ritually) “unclean/clean,” or “defiled/pure,” refer to a spiritual status relating purely to whether one is in a condition that prevents him/her from entering the <i>Mishkan</i> or Temple. The <i>Mishkan</i>, and at a later date, the Temple, were symbols of the presence of God within the human domain. But they were only symbols, because in monotheism, God is everywhere equally. The very concepts of place and time in relation to God are metaphorical. It is not that God is here rather than elsewhere but that we, as humans, feel His presence here rather than elsewhere.
God is eternal. God is spiritual. We and the universe are physical and whatever is physical is subject to birth, growth, decline, decay, and death. It is these things that must be excluded from the Sanctuary if we are to have the experience of standing in the presence of eternity.
Therefore, anything that reminds us or others of our mortality prevents us from entering the holy: the fact that we are born and will one day die. Contact with death or even birth has this effect. Both therefore exclude the person who has had such contact from the domain of the holy. These include those who had come into contact with the dead (Bemidbar 19:1–22) and a mother who had given birth.
As for the burnt offering, this is a reminder of the binding of Yitzḥak, and of the animal sacrificed as a burnt offering in Yitzḥak’s place (Bereshit 22:13). The binding of Yitzḥak was intended as a protest against the absolute power that parents had over children in the ancient world – <i>patria potestas</i>, as it was called in Roman law. Essentially, the child was regarded as the property of his/her parents. A father had total legal power over a child, even to the extent of life and death. That was one reason why child sacrifice was so widely practised in the ancient world.
The Torah makes an implicit comment on this in its account of the name given to the first human child. Ḥava called him Kayin – from the Hebrew meaning “ownership” – saying, “I have acquired a child through God” (Bereshit 4:1). Treat your child as a possession and you may turn him into a murderer: that is what the text implies.
The narrative of the binding of Yitzḥak is a statement for all time that parents do not own their children. The whole story of the birth of Yitzḥak points in that direction. He was born when Sara’s childbearing years were already over and she was incapable of having a child naturally (Bereshit 18:11). Yitzḥak was clearly the special gift of God. As the first Jewish child, he became the precedent for all subsequent generations. The binding was intended to establish that children belong to God. Parents are merely their guardians.
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>The story of the binding of Yitzḥak is opaque to us because we take it for granted that children have their own legal identity and rights. But this is a very modern proposition indeed. In Roman law, the principle of <i>patria potestas</i> meant that children were the property of their fathers, who had the legal right to do with them what they chose, including kill them. In the Victorian era, social activists had to work hard to lessen the brutalities of child labour such as children being sent down mines or working long hours in factories.
Only when we take this background into account can we begin to understand that the binding of Yitzḥak is God’s way of teaching Avraham that <i>patria potestas</i> has no place in Judaism. The Bible is saying to the people of the covenant: <i>Just as you do not own your land, you do not own your children</i>. Thus is born the biblical idea of parent-as-educator as opposed to parent-as-owner.
This is also what the Bible means when it speaks of God as a parent. God is a non-interventionist parent. During the early years of His people’s history He intervened to deliver them from slavery, but increasingly as they matured He too moved from parent-as-owner to parent-as-educator. God does not do our work for us. He teaches us how to do it for Him. For God Himself abides by the laws He gives us.

<i>1. How does this passage sum up the message contained in this</i> Covenant &amp; Conversation<i> essay?</i>
<i>2. Do you think Western society has been influenced by the message of this story and Judaism’s approach to children?</i>
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>According to the explanation Rabbi Sacks gives about the laws of ritual impurity, why is a woman <i>tamei</i> after giving birth?
Why do you think the Torah has to go out of its way to teach that children have their own rights and are not the property of their parents?
How does the Torah teach this message?
<b>EDUCATIONAL COMPANION TO THE QUESTIONS</b>
<b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>This midrashic story of the angels comes to teach us Judaism’s approach to humanity. Humanity is flawed, and God knows and understands this. If God had wanted to create a perfect creature to inhabit this world, He could have – angels are perfect servants of God, but God chose to limit them to a purely spiritual existence in heaven and not place them in the world. Perhaps the Midrash is highlighting this, and while the angels cannot understand the worth and potential of humankind, God does. He understands with compassion.
All people sin. No one is perfect. Life is complex and humans are complex, and despite the best efforts of people to strive for perfection, no one can actually achieve that. The story in the Talmud suggests that God is understanding and shows compassion to humankind in this light. If God can show understanding of human failings and imperfections, then we should strive to do so also, both with ourselves and when relating to those around us.
Parents have a responsibility to educate their children in the values that will help them to become good people living meaningful lives based on those values. However, all people are flawed and fail, no matter how well their parents prepare them for life. Judaism does consider parents responsible for the sins of their pre-bar/bat mitzva children. However, this approach to the post-birth sin offering perhaps gives the mother a channel to express her concern for protecting her child in the future.
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br>In previous generations adults believed that a child was their property until they became adults in their own right. Therefore, parents would often force their children to work to earn money for the family, and would not consider that their children had any rights of their own. Korczak believed that all children have rights of their own, and adults have a responsibility to children in this respect. Judaism speaks in similar terms, demanding certain responsibilities from parents towards their children, such as providing them with an education, protection, and care.
One message in <i>The Core Idea</i> is that all people are flawed and that is why the mother brings a sin offering on behalf of her child. Korczak saw that in every child there existed the potential for good or for evil and it is the responsibility of parents and teachers to nurture the inclination for good. In <i>Thinking More Deeply</i> we see that the burnt offering the mother brings reminds us of the binding of Yitzḥak and its message that children are not the property of parents, but have rights of their own.
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>The burnt offering the mother brings after her child is born reminds us of the binding of Yitzḥak, where Avraham was asked to bring Yitzḥak as a burnt offering. Rabbi Sacks says here that the message of the story of the binding of Yitzḥak is that children are not the property of parents.
There is no question that our society’s eventual arrival at this idea has been influenced by the ideas found in the Torah and Judaism in general. Judaism has a very clear approach to the rights of the child and the responsibility of parents to the child.
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>The terms <i>tamei</i> and <i>tahor</i> are technical terms referring to the condition that prevents one from entering the <i>Mishkan</i> or Temple. The Temple is a symbol of the presence of God within the human domain. It is essential that the experience of being in the domain of the holy was an experience of pure transcendence. What therefore bars us from entering the holy is anything that reminds us or others of our mortality: the fact that we are born and will one day die. Contact with death or even birth has this effect.
This was far from a given in ancient societies, and in fact in all societies until the Victorian period in England (see <i>From the Thought of Rabbi Sacks</i>). The Torah’s ideas on this were revolutionary and no doubt have influenced society’s approach to this in our day.
Rabbi Sacks mentions several examples of how this message is expressed in the biblical narrative. The name given to the first child born – Kayin (from the Hebrew meaning “ownership”), because “I have acquired a child through God” (Bereshit 4:1) – implies that if you treat your child as a possession, then you may turn him into a murderer. The story of the binding of Yitzḥak teaches that parents do not own their children. This message is also contained in the tenth plague – the death of the firstborn. All firstborn Israelites were to have been priests in the service of God. Only after the sin of the Golden Calf did this role devolve to the tribe of Levi. The same idea lies behind the ritual of the redemption of the firstborn. Parents’ responsibility to their child is also a concept developed in the halakhic literature.

Metzora

In a Nutshell

<b><i>IN A NUTSHELL</i></b><br><i>Parashat Metzora</i> continues with the themes from <i>Tazria</i>, including the process of purification for <i>tzaraat</i>, the decay that causes skin disease in humans and discolouration in garments and the walls of houses. It concludes with the process of purifying after various types of bodily discharges.
<b>QUESTION TO PONDER</b>
<i>The phenomenon of</i> tzaraat<i> no longer exists as far as we know. Why is it still important to learn about it in the Torah?</i>

I; Words That Heal

<big><strong>I. Words That Heal</strong></big><br><b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>According to the Sages, <i>Tazria</i> and <i>Metzora</i> are about the power of speech to heal or harm. These <i>parashot</i> deal at length with <i>tzaraat</i>, the skin condition that was a punishment for <i>lashon hara</i>, evil speech. The Sages said that the word <i>metzora</i>, meaning one who was suffering from this condition, was a shortened version of the phrase <i>motzi shem ra</i>, one who says bad things about another person (slander). They proved this from the case of Miriam, who spoke badly about Moshe and then suffered <i>tzaraat</i> as a result (Bemidbar 12). Moshe mentions this incident many years later, urging the Israelites to take it to heart: “Remember what the Lord your God did to Miriam along the way after you came out of Egypt” (Devarim 24:9).
The Rabbis said some powerful things about <i>lashon hara</i>. They said that it is worse than the three cardinal sins – idolatry, adultery, and bloodshed – combined. It harms three people: the one who speaks it, the one about whom it is spoken, and the one who listens to it. The story of Yosef began when he spoke negatively about some of his brothers and their relationship turned bitter. The entire generation that left Egypt was not allowed to enter the Promised Land because they had spoken badly about it. The Sages said that one who speaks <i>lashon hara</i> is like someone who does not believe in God.
In our day and age, social media has become a place overflowing with hateful speech, and we need the laws of <i>lashon hara</i> more than ever.
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>

<i>2. Have you ever seen hateful speech on social media? How did it make you feel?</i>

<i>2. During the Coronavirus pandemic period, why is it even more important than ever to be mindful of our speech?</i>
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>At the risk of disclosing a spoiler, I would like to now discuss the 2019 film <i>A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood</i>. Tom Hanks plays the beloved American children’s television presenter Mister Rogers, a legendary figure to several generations of young Americans, famous for his gentle, warm manner, and his musical invitation, “Won’t You Be My Neighbor?”
What makes the film unusual is that it is an unabashed celebration of the power of human goodness to heal broken hearts. Today such straightforward moral messages tend to be limited only to children’s films (some of them, as it happens, works of genius). Such is the power and subtlety of this film, however, that one is not tempted to dismiss it as simplistic or naïve.
The plot is based on a true story. A magazine had decided to run a series of short profiles around the theme of heroes. It assigned one of its most gifted journalists to write the piece about Fred Rogers.
The journalist was, however, a troubled soul. He had a badly broken relationship with his father. The father sought reconciliation, but the journalist refused even to see him. The jagged edges of his character showed in his writing. Every piece had a critical undercurrent, as if he relished destroying people’s reputations. Given his style of journalism, he wondered why the famous children’s television star had agreed to be interviewed by him. Had Rogers not read any of his writings? Did he not know the obvious risk that the profile would be negative, perhaps devastatingly so? It turned out that not only had Rogers read every article of his that he could find, he was also the only figure who had agreed to be interviewed by him. All the other “heroes” had said no.
The journalist goes to meet Rogers, first sitting through the production of an episode of his show, complete with puppets, toy trains, and a miniature townscape. It is a moment ripe for big-city cynicism. Yet Rogers, when they meet and talk, defies any conventional stereotype. He turns the questions away from himself and towards the journalist. Almost immediately sensing the core of unhappiness within him, Rogers then turns every negative question into a positive affirmation, and exudes the calmness and quiet, the listening silence, that allows and encourages the journalist to talk about himself.
It is a remarkable experience to watch as Hanks’s gentleness, immovable even under pressure, slowly allows the journalist – who had, after all, merely come to write a four-hundred-word profile – to acknowledge his own failings with his father and to give him the emotional strength to forgive him and be reconciled with him. Here is a fragment of their conversation, to give you a feel for the tone of the relationship:
<b><i>Journalist</i>:</b> You love people like me.
<b><i>Fred Rogers</i>:</b> What are people like you? I’ve never met anyone like you in my entire life.
<b><i>Journalist</i>:</b> Broken people.
<b><i>Fred Rogers</i>:</b> I don’t think you are broken. I know you are a man of conviction. A person who knows the difference between what is wrong and what is right. Try to remember that your relationship with your father also helped to shape those parts. He helped you become what you are.
Note how in a few brief sentences, Rogers helps reframe the journalist’s self-image, as well as his relationship with his father. The very argumentativeness that led him to fight with his father was something he owed to his father. The film reflects the true story of when the real Fred Rogers met the journalist Tom Junod. Junod, like his character Lloyd Vogel in the film, came to mock but stayed to be inspired. He said about the experience, “My heart felt like a spike, and then, in that room, it opened and felt like an umbrella.”
This film is a rare and compelling illustration of the power of speech to heal or harm.
Judaism is a religion of words and silences, speaking and listening, communicating and attending. God created the universe by words – “And He said…and there was” – and we create the social universe by words, by the promises with which we bind ourselves to meet our obligations to others. God’s revelation at Sinai was of words – “<i>You heard the sound of words but saw no form; there was only a Voice</i>” (Devarim 4:12). Every other ancient religion had its monuments of brick and stone; Jews, exiled, had only words, the Torah they carried with them wherever they went. The supreme mitzva in Judaism is <i>Shema Yisrael</i>, “Listen, Israel.” For God is invisible and we make no icons. We can’t see God; we can’t smell God; we can’t touch God; we can’t taste God. All we can do is listen in the hope of hearing God. In Judaism, listening is high religious art.
Or it should be. What Tom Hanks shows us in his portrayal of Fred Rogers is a man who is capable of <i>attending</i> to other people, listening to them, talking gently to them in a way that is powerfully affirming without for a moment being bland or assuming that all is well with the world or with them. The reason this is both interesting and important is that it is hard to know how to listen to God if we do not know how to listen to other people. And how can we expect God to listen to us if we are incapable of listening to others?
This entire issue of speech and its impact on people has become massively amplified by the spread of smartphones and social media and their impact, especially on young people and on the entire tone of the public conversation. Online abuse is the plague of our age. It has happened because of the ease and impersonality of communication. It gives rise to what has been called the disinhibition effect: people feel freer to be cruel and crude than they would be in a face-to-face situation. When you are in the physical presence of someone, it is hard to forget that the other is a living, breathing human being just as you are, with feelings like yours and vulnerabilities like yours. But when you are not, all the poison within you can leak out, with sometimes devastating effects. The number of teenage suicides and attempted suicides has doubled in the past ten years, and most attribute the rise to the effects of social media. Rarely have the laws of <i>lashon hara</i> been more timely or necessary.
<i>A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood</i> offers a fascinating commentary on an ancient debate in Judaism, one discussed by Rambam in the sixth of his <i>Eight Chapters</i>, as to which is greater, the<i> ḥasid</i>, the saint, the person who is naturally good, or <i>hamoshel benafsho</i>, one who is not naturally saintly at all but who practises self-restraint and suppresses the negative elements in their character. It is precisely this question, whose answer is not obvious, that gives the film its edge.
<b>I believe we need the laws of <i>lashon hara</i> now more than almost ever before.</b> Social media is awash with hate. The language of politics has become <i>ad hominem</i> and vile. We seem to have forgotten the messages that <i>Tazria</i> and <i>Metzora</i> teach: that<b> evil speech is a plague. It destroys relationships, rides roughshod over people’s feelings, debases the public square, turns politics into a jousting match between competing egos, and defiles all that is sacred about our common life. It need not be like this.</b>
<i>A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood</i> shows how good speech can heal where evil speech harms.
<b>QUESTION TO PONDER</b>
<i>Why is the message of</i> tzaraat<i> more relevant than ever today?</i>
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>This is an extraordinary moment for the world, when a virus is sweeping across humanity, bringing it to its knees in a way that the world hasn’t known to quite this extent for a hundred years. And who knows whether this new technology of allowing us to be close mentally, yet physically distant, was not created for just such a moment as this?
<b>An online <i>shiur</i> on<i> Vayak’hel-Pekudei,</i> 5780</b>
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>What can we learn from Fred Rogers and the way he utilised the power of speech?
Do you think the technology and social media of our age is a positive addition to our lives or mainly destructive?
Do you agree with Rabbi Sacks when he says that we need the laws of <i>lashon hara</i> more now than ever before?
<b>EDUCATIONAL COMPANION TO THE QUESTIONS</b>
<b><i>IN A NUTSHELL</i></b><br>The Torah has messages for us that are timeless and relevant for every generation. Even if the exact details of the phenomena that is being described no longer apply to our generation, the lessons we can learn from them certainly do.
<b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br><i>Lashon hara</i> can destroy lives, not just the life of the subject of the hateful speech. The person who speaks it and the person who listens are also both negatively impacted by engaging in <i>lashon hara</i>. Their reputations may well be affected too, and the way they perceive the subject will change from discussing them. There is no such thing as a passive, innocent bystander when it comes to <i>lashon hara</i>.
Anyone who has been on social media has witnessed hateful speech. Researchers believe an extraordinarily high percentage of young people have suffered from this first-hand, even those who haven’t have witnessed it in some form. Perhaps the saddest occurrences are when young people witness adults using this kind of language in their social media posts. Children learn from the model provided by the adults in their lives.
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br>Our words have immense power for good and for bad. Although the message of <i>tzaraat</i> about <i>lashon hara</i> focuses on the destructive power of our words for the negative, the flipside is how much good they can do. This letter is an example of the power of words for good. They express gratitude for someone and the role they are playing during a difficult time for all of us. We should all be thinking in these times about how we can use our words to strengthen and connect to the people around us.
During this period, when we were forced to implement social distancing in order to save lives, we needed to be mindful of those who were feeling lonely, sad, or depressed. A simple kind word, or gesture of reaching out to connect, could have a powerful impact for the good in the life of someone, whether a friend, relative, or stranger.
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>The nature of social media (more anonymous, and more removed than in-person discourse) has led to an intensification of hateful speech. The political discourse has also become hateful as personalities are attacked far more often instead of core issues discussed. Remembering the power of our words is more important now than ever before.
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>Fred Rogers was a “rare and compelling illustration of the power of speech to heal or harm.” He was a man capable of attending to other people, listening to them, seeing them without judgement, able to talk to them gently in a way that was powerfully affirming without for a moment being bland or assuming that all is well with the world or with them.
Like everything in our lives, it has the potential for good and for bad. “Online abuse is the plague of our age. It has happened because of the ease and impersonality of communication. It gives rise to what has been called the disinhibition effect: people feel freer to be cruel and crude than they would be in a face-to-face situation. However, Rabbi Sacks also highlights the potential for good that social media presents, especially in times of crisis like the Covid pandemic” (see <i>From the Thought of Rabbi Sacks</i>).
Due to the rise of social media (see answer 2) and the direction that political discourse has taken in the United Kingdom, United States, and beyond, an awareness of the power of our words, for bad but even more for good, is more important now than ever before.

II; The Power of Speech

<big><strong>II. The Power of Speech</strong></big><br><b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>The Sages identify <i>tzaraat</i> – the condition that affects human skin, the cloth of clothes, and the walls of a house – not as an illness but as a punishment for the specific sin of <i>lashon hara</i>, evil speech.
The question is: Why is this harsh condition a punishment for evil speech and not some other sin? Why is speaking evil worse than, say, physical violence? There is an old English saying: “Sticks and stones may break my bones/but words will never harm me.” It is certainly upsetting to hear bad things said about you, but is it really that terrible?
There is no direct prohibition against evil speech in the Torah but there <i>is</i> a command against gossip: “Do not go around as a gossiper among your people” (Vayikra 19:16). <i>Lashon hara</i> is an example of this command. The Sages go to remarkable lengths to emphasise its seriousness. <i>Lashon hara</i> is, they say, as bad as all three cardinal sins together – idol worship, bloodshed, and forbidden sexual relations. Whoever speaks with an evil tongue, they say, it is as if he or she denied God. They also say: It is forbidden to live near someone who has an evil tongue, and all the more to sit with them and listen to their words. Why are mere words treated with such seriousness in Judaism?
The answer to this question touches on one of the most basic principles of Jewish belief. Ancient peoples worshipped “the gods” because they saw them as powerful: lightning, thunder, the rain and sun, the sea and ocean, and sometimes wild animals. However, Judaism is not a religion that worshipped power, even though God is more powerful than all of these “gods.”
Judaism, like other religions, has holy places, holy people, holy times, and holy rituals. What makes Judaism different, however, is that it is first and foremost a religion of holy <i>words</i>. With words, God created the universe: “And God said, ‘Let there be…and there was.’” Through words He communicated with humankind. In Judaism, language itself is holy. That is why <i>lashon hara</i>, the use of language to harm, is not merely a minor offence. It involves taking something that is holy and using it for purposes that are unholy.

<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br><i>There once was an old man who loved to gossip. He would often be found shuffling around town whispering gossip to his friends.</i>
<i>One day, he just couldn’t resist telling the rabbi the latest news he had just heard. The rabbi ran into his house and brought out a feather pillow. He told the old man to rip open the pillow. Puzzled, he did as the rabbi asked.</i>
<i>As the wind picked up the feathers and blew them all over the village, a smile crossed the man’s face as he began to enjoy the spectacle. “Right. Now go and collect all the feathers from my pillow!” said the rabbi. “But Rabbi, that is impossible! I can’t get them all back. They are spread all across the village and beyond!” the man exclaimed.</i>
<i>The rabbi looked him in the eye and with a satisfied look said, “It is exactly the same with your gossip. Once it has crossed your lips it cannot be controlled or taken back. The words are out of your grasp forever and spread across the world. Think carefully about that the next time you are tempted to gossip about a neighbour!”</i>
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. What do you think is the message of this story?</i>
<i>2. Have you ever experienced the power of words (for good or for bad) personally?</i>
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>After creating the universe, God’s first gift to the first man was the power to use words to name the animals. This was the start of the intellectual process that is the distinguishing mark of Homo sapiens. The <i>Targum</i> translates the phrase, “And man became a living creature” (Bereshit 2:7) as “a speaking spirit.” Evolutionary biologists nowadays take the view that it was the demands of language, and the advantage this gave humans over every other life form, that led to the massive expansion of the human brain.
When God sought to halt the plan of the people of Bavel to build a tower that would reach heaven, He simply “confused their language” so they were unable to communicate.
Language remains basic to the existence of human groups. God created the natural universe with words. We create – and sometimes destroy – the social universe with words.
The first principle of language in Judaism is that it is creative. We create worlds with words.
The second principle is no less fundamental. Avraham’s belief in one God introduced into the world the idea of a God who transcends the universe, and who therefore cannot be identified with any phenomenon within the universe.
God is invisible. This is why in Judaism all religious icons are a sign of idolatry. How then does an invisible God reveal Himself? The answer is: in words. God spoke. He spoke to Adam, Noaḥ, Avraham, Moshe. At the revelation at Mount Sinai, as Moshe reminded the Israelites, “The Lord spoke to you out of the fire. You heard the sound of words but saw no form; there was only a voice” (Devarim 4:12). In Judaism, words are the vehicle of revelation. The prophet is the man or woman who hears and speaks the word of God.
That was the phenomenon that science struggles to understand. Some scientists accept the idea of a God who created heaven and earth, the force of forces and cause of causes, the originator of, as we call it nowadays, the Big Bang, the God who was the architect of matter and the composer of order. Indeed, it is ultimately faith in the universe as the product of a single creative intelligence that underlies the scientific mindset from the outset. Judaism calls this aspect of God “<i>Elokim</i>.” But we believe in another aspect of God also, which we call “<i>Hashem</i>,” the God of relationships – and relationships exist by virtue of speech. Speech allows us to communicate with others and share with them our fears, hopes, loves, plans, feelings, and intentions. Speech helps us to convey our inwardness to others. It is at the very heart of the human bond. A god who could create universes but not speak or listen would be an impersonal god – a god incapable of understanding what makes us human. Worshipping such a god would be like bowing down to the sun or to a giant computer. We might care about it but it could not care about us. That is not the God of Avraham.
Hence the idea at the heart of Judaism: <i>brit</i>, covenant, which is nothing other than a mutually binding promise between God and human beings. Covenant is the word that joins heaven and earth, the word spoken, the word heard, the word affirmed and honoured in trust. The Torah, in the most profound sense, is the word of God, and Judaism is the religion of holy words. It follows that to misuse or abuse language to sow suspicion and conflict is not just destructive. It is sacrilege. It is a kind of desecration. It takes something holy, the human ability to communicate and thus join soul to soul, and uses it for the lowest of purposes, to divide soul from soul and destroy the trust on which non-coercive relationships depend.
Judaism emerged as an answer to a series of questions: How can finite human beings be connected to an infinite God? How can they be connected to one another? How can there be cooperation, collaboration, collective action, families, communities, and a nation, without the coercive use of power? How can we form relationships of trust? How can we redeem the human person from his or her solitude? How can we create collective liberty such that my freedom is not bought at the cost of yours?
The answer is: through words, words that communicate, words that bind, words that honour the Divine Other and the human other. <i>Lashon</i> <i>hara</i>, “evil speech,” by poisoning language, destroys the very basis of the Judaic vision. When we speak disparagingly of others, we diminish them, we diminish ourselves, and we damage the very ecology of freedom.
Never take language lightly, implies the Torah. For it was through language that God created the natural world, and through language that we create and sustain our social world. It is as essential to our survival as the air we breathe.
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>Words are holy. In Judaism the holiest object is a Torah scroll, for it contains God’s word, His greatest gift to humankind. Judaism is a religion of holy words, because it believes in a transcendental God, a God who cannot be seen, felt, touched, represented in images or icons, a God beyond the universe unlike anything within the universe. The only ultimate connection between an infinite God and finite human beings is <i>language</i>.
In revelation God speaks to us. In prayer we speak to God. Language is the narrow bridge across the abyss between soul and soul, whether the relationship is between two people, or between myself and the Self of the universe. Language is the redemption of solitude.

<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. Why is the Torah scroll the holiest object in Judaism? What is the message behind that?</i>
<i>2. Why does God choose to interact with humanity through words? How do we use words to interact with God?</i>
<b>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</b>
1. Why are words important to God? Why are words important to humankind?
2. Can you think of an example from history or from your life where words have “created worlds” and where words have “destroyed worlds”?
3. Do you think that the punishment of<i>tzaraat</i> is a fitting one for the sin of <i>lashon hara</i>?
<b>EDUCATIONAL COMPANION TO THE QUESTIONS</b>
<b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>The message behind this familiar phrase is that we should ignore words because they are insubstantial, as opposed to physical violence (“Sticks and stones may break my bones”) which can cause real and lasting pain. This is a classic expression of the British trait of showing a “stiff upper lip,” encouraging us to “keep calm and carry on.” However, in reality, we know that words carry tremendous power, for good and for bad. In fact, negative or evil words can cause real and devastating emotional damage that can impact someone for a lifetime.
Words can be holy when used by God to create worlds, communicate with mankind, and develop relationships with human beings. This is why we consider the words of the Torah to be holy. Words can also be considered holy when used by humans for the greater good, just like actions for the greater good can be considered holy.
“Creating worlds” is not to be taken literally, in the way that God created the world with words. However, words can be used creatively for tremendous good. Sometimes just a small, positive word to someone can change a life, which is what we mean by “creating worlds.” The world can be changed (recreated) by positive and inspiring words. Conversely, worlds can be destroyed with negative and evil words. People’s lives can be destroyed through negative or careless speech.
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br>Words are powerful and can have a lasting impact on the lives of people. Do not be careless with them. The rabbi taught the old man that once careless words have been let loose, they cannot be gathered back. There is no “undo” or “delete” function on speech. This lesson is equally relevant to spoken and written words (and has special relevance in our generation with regard to the media and social media!), and whether or not there is truth behind the words does not change the devastating impact they can have (so saying, “But it’s true” is not a good defence when gossiping or speaking badly about another person).
Everyone has experienced pain from the words of others, whether from a sibling or friend, teacher or parent, spouse or boss. Conversely, if we try hard enough, we can all recall when a kind word made all the difference (and there are many inspiring stories of how a kind word from a stranger can prevent a person who was considering taking their own life from doing so).
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>Words, like any object or resource in the world, are neutral in value, moral worth, and holiness, until used for good or bad. Words that emanate from God are by definition holy, because they are the vehicle through which God interacts with and creates the world, and builds relationships with His creations. The Torah scroll is a record of these words, the words God chose to give to the Jewish people, and a record of the words He chose to give the world in order to create and maintain it, and to form and develop a relationship with humanity.
God is infinite and beyond the finite abilities of computation of any human mind. There is no common ground through which to interact with God, except words. God chose words and language to be the bridge through which we can build a “connection between an infinite God and finite human beings.” We use words to fulfil our side of this relationship. Sometimes it is hard to find the words we need, and that is why we have a liturgy of prayers written long ago by rabbis who had the spirit of prophecy and deep knowledge of our traditions, and therefore found words to give us in the form of the prayers written in the Siddur. However, any human being can find words for themselves in order to build a relationship with God.
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>Words are the way that God chose to create the world and create relationships with humans, including formal covenants. God chose words and language to be the medium through which we can build a connection between an infinite God and finite human beings. We may use words to fulfil our side of our relationship with God, through prayer. Furthermore, we can also use words to create and sustain relationships with our fellow man, and create (and have the potential to destroy) society with words: “We create – and sometimes destroy – the social universe with words.”
“Creating worlds” is not to be taken literally, in the way that God created the world with words. However, words can be used creatively for tremendous good. Sometimes just a small positive word to someone can change a life, which is what we mean by creating worlds. The world can be changed (recreated) by positive and inspiring words. And conversely, worlds can be destroyed with negative and evil words. People’s lives can be destroyed with negative or careless speech. Examples from history can be inspiring leaders who have changed the world with their words, such as Martin Luther King Jr. or Mahatma Ghandi. And of course there are many examples of people from history who have used speech and language to incite hate and destroy worlds, such as Hitler or Stalin.
The phenomenon of <i>tzaraat</i>, leprosy in people, mildew in clothes and houses, was God’s way of making evil speech public and stigmatised. According to the Sages, this is why the speaker of <i>lashon hara</i> was smitten by leprosy and forced to live as a pariah outside the camp. The punishment for using evil speech – designed to marginalise and ostracise your victim from the community and society – is to do exactly that to the perpetrator: <i>tzaraat</i> is a punishment <i>midda kenegged midda</i> (measure for measure), a punishment that fits the crime.

Achrei Mot

In a Nutshell

<b><i>IN A NUTSHELL</i></b><br><i>Aḥarei Mot</i> describes the service of the high priest on Yom Kippur. It was a dramatic and powerful ceremony during which he cast lots on two identical goats, one of which was offered as a sacrifice and the other sent into the wilderness. This is where the idea of a “scapegoat” comes from. Then the high priest entered the Holy of Holies, which was the spiritual high point of the Jewish year. The <i>parasha</i> also details more of the laws of holiness, such as the prohibition against eating blood and the laws of forbidden relationships<i>.</i>
<b>QUESTION TO PONDER</b>
<i>How is this ritual connected to the concept of a “scapegoat”?</i>

I; Holy People, Holy Land

<big><strong>I. Holy People, Holy Land</strong></big><br><b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br><b>The Question:</b> I had been engaged in dialogue for two years with an imam from the Middle East, a gentle and seemingly moderate man. One day, in the middle of our conversation, he turned to me and asked, “Why do you Jews need a land? After all, Judaism is a religion, not a country or a nation.”
I decided at that point to discontinue the dialogue. There are fifty- six Islamic states and more than a hundred nations in which Christians form the majority of the population. There is only one Jewish state, 1/25th the size of France, roughly the same size as the Kruger National Park in South Africa. With those who believe that Jews, alone among the nations of the world, are not entitled to their own land, it is hard to hold a conversation.
Yet the question is worth exploring. There is no doubt, as D. J. Clines explains in his book <i>The Theme of the Pentateuch</i>, that the central narrative of the Torah is the promise of and journey to the land of Israel. Yet why is this so? Why did the people of the covenant need their own land? Why was Judaism not, on the one hand, a religion that can be practised by individuals wherever they happen to be, or on the other, a religion like Christianity or Islam whose ultimate purpose is to convert the world so that everyone can practise the one true faith?
The best way of approaching an answer is through an important comment of the Ramban on this <i>parasha</i>. Chapter 18 contains a list of forbidden sexual practices. It ends with this solemn warning:
<i>“Do not defile yourselves in any of these ways, because this is how the nations that I am going to drive out before you became defiled. The land was defiled; so I punished it for its sin, and the land vomited out its inhabitants. But you must keep My decrees and My laws…. If you defile the land, it will vomit you out as it vomited out the nations that were before you”</i> (Vayikra 18:24–28).
Ramban asks the obvious question: Reward and punishment in the Torah are based on the principle of <i>midda kenegged midda</i>, measure for measure. The punishment must fit the sin or crime. It makes sense to say that if the Israelites neglected or broke <i>mitzvot hateluyot baaretz</i>, the commands relating to the land of Israel, the punishment would be exile from the land of Israel. So the Torah says in the curses in <i>Beḥukotai</i>, “All the time that it lies desolate, the land will have the rest it did not have during the sabbaths you lived in it” (Vayikra 26:35), meaning: This will be the punishment for not observing the laws of <i>Shemitta</i>, the Sabbatical Year. <i>Shemitta</i> is a command relating to the land. Therefore, the punishment for its non-observance is exile from the land.
But sexual offences have nothing to do with the land. They are <i>mitzvot hateluyot baguf</i>, commands relating to person, not place. Why is the Torah’s punishment for their transgression exile from the land?
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. Why do you think the world struggles to understand why Jews need a land?</i>
<i>2. What is the basis of Ramban’s question?</i>
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br><i>President Yitzchak Herzog began serving as Israel’s eleventh president on July 7, 2021. His service of the State of Israel followed in the footsteps of both his father, Chaim Herzog, who was Israel’s sixth president (1983–1993), and his grandfather, Rabbi Yitzchak Halevi Herzog, who was Israel’s Ashkenazi chief rabbi between 1936 and 1959.</i>
<i>After the passing of Rabbi Sacks, President Herzog spoke often of how Rabbi Sacks had been an inspiration to him, reading many of his books (he was especially fond of</i> Lessons in Leadership: A Weekly Reading of the Jewish Bible<i>, from which he drew weekly inspiration for his own leadership from the week’s</i> parasha<i>).</i>
<i>In his message to mark the first</i> yahrtzeit<i> of Rabbi Lord Sacks, President Herzog said, “Few figures in our history have shaped our global Jewish conversation as much as Rabbi Lord Jonathan Sacks,</i> zt”l<i>. His call for a Judaism engaged with the world, his appeal to respect the dignity of difference, his cry to heal the fractured world, all these have inspired me personally and so many Jews all around the world.”</i>
<i>In his comments upon presenting the Genesis Lifetime Achievement Award posthumously to Rabbi Sacks, President Herzog said that “Rabbi Sacks became a masterful articulator of the Jewish foundation of universal values, while unapologetically verbalising a proud, dignified Jewish identity. His innate, God-given power of expression gave voice to the contribution of Judaism and the State of Israel to humanity at large” and that he “represented the history, the moral code, and the spirit of Judaism with dignity and adoration” and “valiantly advocated for the State of Israel.”</i>
<i>How fitting a tribute, from the president of the Jewish state, for which Rabbi Sacks was such an adamant supporter and advocate, and which he saw as central to his philosophy and critical to the fulfilment of the Jewish national mission.</i>
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. Why do you think Rabbi Sacks was so proud of “the contribution of Judaism and the State of Israel to humanity”?</i>
<i>2. Why is it important that the values of Rabbi Sacks that President Herzog mentioned (a Judaism engaged with the world, respecting the dignity of difference, and the responsibility to heal the fractured world) are implemented in Israeli society?</i>
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br><b>The Answer:</b> Ramban answers by stating that all the commands are intrinsically related to the land of Israel. It is simply not the same to put on tefillin or keep <i>kashrut</i> or observe Shabbat in the Diaspora as in Israel. In support of his position he quotes the Talmud (Ketubbot 110b), which says, “Whoever lives outside the land is as if he had no God,” and the <i>Sifrei</i>, that states, “Living in the land of Israel is of equal importance to all the commandments of the Torah.” The Torah is the constitution of a holy people in the Holy Land.
Ramban explains this mystically but we can understand it non-mystically by reflecting on the opening chapters of the Torah and the story they tell about the human condition and about God’s disappointment with the only species – us – He created in His image. God sought a humanity that would freely choose to do the will of its Creator. Humanity chose otherwise. Adam and Ḥava sinned. Kayin murdered his brother Hevel. Within a short time “the earth was filled with violence” and God “regretted that He had made human beings on earth.” He brought a flood and began again, this time with the righteous Noaḥ, but again humans disappointed Him by building a city with a tower on which they sought to reach heaven, and God chose another way of bringing humanity to recognise Him – this time not by universal rules (though these remained, namely the covenant with all humanity through Noaḥ), but by a living example: Avraham, Sara, and their children.
In Bereshit chapter 18 the Torah makes clear what God sought from Avraham: that he would teach his children and his household after him “to keep the way of the Lord by doing what is right and just.” Homo sapiens is, as both Aristotle and Rambam said, a social animal, and righteousness and justice are features of a good society. We know from the story of Noaḥ and the ark that a righteous individual can save themselves but not the society in which they live, unless they transform the society in which they live.
Taken collectively, the commands of the Torah are a prescription for the construction of a society with the consciousness of God at its centre. God asks the Jewish people to become a role model for humanity by the shape and texture of the society they build, a society characterised by justice and the rule of law, welfare, and concern for the poor, the marginal, the vulnerable, and the weak, a society in which all would have equal dignity under the sovereignty of God. Such a society would win the admiration, and eventually the emulation, of others:
<i>“See, I have taught you decrees and laws...so that you may follow them in the land you are entering to take possession of it. Observe them carefully, for this will be your wisdom and understanding to the nations, who will hear about all these decrees and say, ‘Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people.’... What other nation is so great as to have such righteous decrees and laws as this body of laws I am setting before you today?”</i> (Devarim 4:5–8).
A society needs a land, a home, a location in space, where a nation can shape its own destiny in accord with its deepest aspirations and ideals. Jews have been around for a long time, almost four thousand years since Avraham began his journey. During that period they have lived in every country on the face of the earth, under good conditions and bad, freedom and persecution. Yet in all that time there was only one place where they formed a majority and exercised sovereignty, the land of Israel, a tiny country of difficult terrain and all too little rainfall, surrounded by enemies and empires. Only in Israel is the fulfilment of the commands a society-building exercise, shaping the contours of a culture as a whole. Only in Israel can we fulfil the commands in a land, a landscape, and a language saturated with Jewish memories and hopes. Only in Israel does the calendar track the rhythms of the Jewish year. In Israel, Judaism is part of the public square, not just the private, sequestered space of synagogue, school, and home.
Jews need a land because they are a nation charged with bringing the Divine Presence down to earth in the shared spaces of our collective life, not least – as the last chapter of <i>Aḥarei Mot</i> makes clear – by the way we conduct our most intimate relationships, a society in which marriage is sacrosanct and sexual fidelity the norm.
That contains a message for Jews, Christians, and Muslims alike. To Christians and Muslims it says: If you believe in the God of Avraham, grant that the children of Avraham have a right to the land that the God in whom you believe promised them, and to which He promised that after exile they would return.
<b>I believe to Jews it says: That very right comes hand in hand with a duty to live individually and collectively by the standards of justice and compassion, fidelity and generosity, love of neighbour and of stranger, that alone constitute our mission and destiny: a holy people in the Holy Land.</b>
<b>QUESTION TO PONDER</b>
<i>Do you think the modern State of Israel fulfils this role today?</i>
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>Let us renew our attachment to the land and State of Israel. For there, in the land where we were born as a people, we have been reborn as a people. Because of Israel, after two thousand years Jews have taken up their destiny once again as a sovereign people. Because of Israel, there is some place that every Jew whose life or liberty is threatened can call home. Because of Israel, Jewish learning flourishes as never before and as nowhere else. Without sidestepping any of the dilemmas Israel faces, let our love for it be unequivocal and our attachment to its people unbreakable.
<b><i>The Power of Ideas,</i> 27–28</b>
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>How are the mitzvot “a prescription for the construction of a society with the consciousness of God at its centre”?
Why can Jews only build this society in their own homeland?
Can Jews fulfil the national mission of the Jewish people while living in the Diaspora?
<b>EDUCATIONAL COMPANION TO THE QUESTIONS</b>
<b><i>IN A NUTSHELL</i></b><br>The symbolism of this ritual is that the sins of the Jewish people are “placed on the goat” which was then sent away into the wilderness as a kind of sacrifice. As the goat is sent away, the sins “go with it” and are absolved and disappear. A scapegoat is someone (or a group of people) who are blamed for something that is not their fault, in much the same way as the goat did not actually commit the sins it is being sent away for.
<b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>Religions that are purely a belief system, even if they have a normative and practical element to them, can be practised by anyone anywhere. Christianity is an example of this. Although there are many Christian countries, where the dominant faith is Christianity, the Christian faith of the inhabitants is not dependent on them living in those countries. The faith of the people practising Christianity there is no different from a Christian living in a Muslim country as part of a minority community. However, Judaism is a religion for one specific people (it is not a private faith like other religions), and is designed to be practised by that nation in a nation-state. In its fullest version, Judaism must be practised in a Jewish state.
The basis of the Ramban’s question is the understanding that punishments in the Torah are always connected to the sin. He is expecting this punishment to be <i>midda kenegged midda</i>, measure for measure, and fitting for the sin. But in this case there seems no connection between sexual immorality and exile from the land.
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br>Rabbi Sacks believed that God gave the Jewish people a national mission, to improve the world through national modelling of the core values of the Torah. When Jews model these values, and especially the State of Israel (as a true national expression of the values of the Jewish people), making a contribution to humanity, Rabbi Sacks felt deeply proud of this. He believed it was a fulfilment of the Jewish national mission.
If these values can be integrated into Israeli society, then Israel will be the light unto the nations as a nation that models the values of the Torah and a fulfilment of the Jewish national mission.
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>The State of Israel is by no means perfect. There is much hard work to do to perfect Israeli society and ensure it becomes a “light unto the nations” in fulfilment of the Jewish national mission. But we can be proud, as Rabbi Sacks was, that on the whole the values of justice, compassion, fidelity, generosity, and love are at the heart of Israel as a society.
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>Judaism’s genius was to take high ideals and translate them into everyday life by simple daily deeds, through mitzvot. Performing mitzvot, we come close to God, becoming His “partner in the work of creation.” Judaism is a series of truths that only become true by virtue of the fact that we have lived them. By living them we turn the “ought” into the “is.” We make a fragment of perfection in an imperfect world and create a living truth, a life of faith. By keeping mitzvot, we help transform the world that “is” into the world that “ought to be.” Judaism is the code of a self-governing society. Because Judaism is the code of a society, it is also about the social virtues: righteousness, justice, loving-kindness, and compassion. These structure the template of biblical law, which covers all aspects of the life of society, its economy, its welfare systems, its education, family life, employer-employee relations, the protection of the environment, and so on. (These ideas are based on <i>Future Tense</i>, 135–136.)
The building of a society based on these values is not possible without a land. Judaism is the constitution of a self-governing nation, the architectonics of a society dedicated to the service of God in freedom and dignity. Without a land and state, Judaism is a shadow of itself. In exile, God might still live in the hearts of Jews but not in the public square, in the justice of the courts, the morality of the economy, and the humanitarianism of everyday life. Jews have lived in almost every country under the sun. In four thousand years, only in Israel have they been a free, self-governing people. Only in Israel are they able, if they so choose, to construct an agriculture, a medical system, an economic infrastructure in the spirit of the Torah and its concern for freedom, justice, and the sanctity of life. Only in Israel can Jews live Judaism in anything other than an edited edition. (These ideas are based on <i>Future Tense</i>, 135–136.)
They can as individuals, modelling in an individual and personal way the values and ideals of the Torah. But as a nation, building a society based on these values, this can only happen in Israel. “Without a land and state, Judaism is a shadow of itself. In exile, God might still live in the hearts of Jews but not in the public square, in the justice of the courts, the morality of the economy, and the humanitarianism of everyday life” (<i>Future Tense</i>, 136).

II; Thinking Fast and Slow

<big><strong>II. Thinking Fast and Slow</strong></big><br><b><i> THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>The central element of the Yom Kippur service, described in this <i>parasha</i>, is quite a mystery. There are two goats, identical in appearance, over which the high priest cast lots, sacrificing one as a sin offering and sending the other, the “scapegoat,” into the wilderness to die. Why must they be identical? And why cast lots (<i>goralot</i>) over them? Presumably, these elements were designed to inspire feelings of awe and repentance in the crowds that packed the Temple on the holiest day of the year, but how and in what way?
Over the centuries, the Sages sought to decode the mystery. Two animals, alike in appearance but different in fate, suggests the idea of twins. This and other hints led the Midrash and some commentators like Ramban and Abarbanel to conclude that the two goats symbolised the most famous of the Torah’s twins: Yaakov and Esav.
There are other clues: The word <i>se’ir</i>, “goat,” is also associated in the Torah with Esav. He and his descendants lived in the land of Se’ir. The word <i>se’ir</i> is related to <i>sei’ar</i>, “hairy,” which is how Esav was born: “His whole body was like a hairy garment” (Bereshit 25:25). According to the Mishna, a red thread was tied to the scapegoat, and “red” (Edom) was Esav’s other name. So there was a tradition that the scapegoat symbolised Esav. In particular, the phrase “two kids of the goats,” <i>shenei se’irei izim</i>, mentioned in the high priest’s rites, reminds us of the very similar expression, “two kids of the goats,” <i>shenei gedayei izim</i>, mentioned in Bereshit 27, when Rivka shares with Yaakov a plan to deceive Yitzḥak into giving him Esav’s blessing: “<i>Go out to the flock and bring me two choice kids of the goats, so I can prepare some tasty food for your father…so that he may give you his blessing before he dies,</i>” instructs Rivka. Such verbal parallels are not coincidental in the Torah. They are examples of complex web of interconnected words and themes in which one verse sheds light on another.
Who then were Esav and Yaakov? What did they represent and how is this relevant to Yom Kippur and atonement? Midrashic tradition tends to show Yaakov as perfect and Esav as an evildoer. However, the Torah itself is not so black and white, or quick to judge. The Sages say that in one respect – honouring his father – Esav was a supreme role model.
Esav in the Torah is not a prime example of evil. Rather, he is the man of impulse. We see this in the scene in which he sells his birthright to Yaakov. Coming in one day exhausted from hunting, he sees Yaakov making lentil broth and immediately agrees to sell his birthright for the sake of a bowl of soup. This is an impulsive man, always driven by the emotion of the moment, be it hunger, family devotion, a desire for revenge or, at last, generosity of spirit.
Yaakov is the opposite. He does not give way to his feelings. He acts and thinks long-term. That is what he does when he works for seven years for Raḥel, and when his son Yosef’s dreams evoke immediate jealousy from the brothers, with Yaakov we are told, “His father kept the matter in mind.” He never acts impulsively. He thinks long and hard before acting.
Who am I? That is the question Yom Kippur forces us to ask. To be Yaakov, we have to release and relinquish the Esav within us, the impulsiveness that can lead us to sell our birthright for a bowl of soup, losing eternity in the pursuit of desire.

<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br><i>Rivka was experiencing a particularly difficult pregnancy, with the twin babies often struggling within her womb. Whenever she passed a place of Torah learning such as a</i> beit midrash<i>, or a holy place such as a synagogue, one of the twins (Yaakov) would struggle and fight to try and get out. But when she walked past a house of idol worship, the other twin (Esav) would struggle and fight to try to get out.</i>
<i>The prophet explained to Rivka, “There are two nations (</i>goyim<i>) inside of you, and two kingdoms shall derive from you. One kingdom will constantly try to overcome the other....”</i>

<i>1. What do you think the message of this midrash is? How is it connected to the message of this</i> Covenant &amp; Conversation<i> essay?</i>

<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>Recent years have seen a revolution in our understanding of the human brain, and with it, the human mind. We used to think that we are, first and foremost, rational animals (see Descartes and Kant). But it has recently been shown that we are primarily emotional beings who make decisions on the basis of feelings, desires, and drives of which we may be barely conscious (see Hume). We justify our choices, but brain scans show that we may have made those choices before being aware that we had done so.
We are more driven by emotion and less by reason than Enlightenment thinkers believed. This discovery has led to new fields of study like behavioural economics (examining what people actually do rather than what theory says they do) and interdisciplinary studies linking neuroscience to morality and politics.
We have, in fact, a dual-system or twin-track brain. This is what Daniel Kahneman is referring to in the title of his famous book <i>Thinking, Fast and Slow</i>. One track is rapid, instinctive, emotional, and subconscious. The other is slower, conscious, deliberative, and careful. The former allows us to react quickly to situations of immediate potential danger. Without it, we and our ancestors would not have survived. Many of our instinctive reactions are benign. It is natural to have empathy, and with it the tendency to feel other people’s pain and come to their aid. We develop a strong sense of attachment that leads us to defend members of our family or community. But not all instincts are benign. Anger, envy, jealousy, fear, hate, and the desire for revenge may once have been functional, but they are often deeply destructive in social situations. That is why the ability to “think slow,” to pause and reflect, matters so much. All animals have desires. Only human beings are capable of passing judgement on desires – of asking, should I or should I not satisfy this desire?
We cannot live, choose, or love without emotion. But one of the fundamental themes that we learned in Bereshit is that not all emotion is benign. Instinctive, impulsive behaviour can lead to violence. What is needed to be a carrier of God’s covenant is the ability to “think slow” and act deliberatively. That is the contrast between Yitzḥak and Yishmael (of whom it was said, “He will be a wild donkey of a man; his hand will be against everyone and everyone’s hand against him,” Bereshit 16:12). Even more so, it is the contrast between Yaakov and Esav.
Which brings us to Bereshit 27 and the moment when Yaakov dressed up in Esav’s clothes and said to his father, “I am Esav your firstborn.” The two goats of the high priest’s service and the two goats prepared by Rivka symbolise the duality within each of us: “The hands are the hands of Esav but the voice is the voice of Yaakov.” We each have an Esav and Yaakov within us, the impulsive, emotional brain and the reflective, deliberative one. We can think fast or slow. Our fate, our <i>goral</i>, our life script, will be determined by which we choose. Will our life be lived “to the Lord” or “to Azazel,” to the random deviations of chance?
This is the moral drama symbolised by the two goats, one dedicated “to the Lord,” the other “to Azazel” and released into the wilderness. The power of ritual is that it does not speak in abstractions – reason versus emotion, instinctual deferral rather than gratification. It is gripping and visceral, all the more so when it evokes, consciously or otherwise, the memory of the twins, Yaakov and Esav, together at birth yet utterly divergent in their character and fate. This may be why the Yom Kippur Temple service includes this ritual of the two goats. It is encouraging us to consider who we will be this year. Will we have the strength to release our inner Esav and live instead like Yaakov?
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>We have two patterns of reaction in the brain, one focusing on potential danger to us as individuals, the other, located in the prefrontal cortex, taking a more considered view of the consequences of our actions for us and others. The first is immediate, instinctive, and emotive. The second is reflective and rational. We are caught, in the psychologist Daniel Kahneman’s phrase, between “thinking fast and slow.”
The fast track helps us to survive, but it can also lead us to actions that are impulsive and destructive. The slow track leads us to more considered behaviour, but it is often overridden in the heat of the moment. We are each both sinners and saints, egotists and altruists, exactly as the prophets and philosophers have long maintained.
If this is so, we are in a position to understand why religion helped us to survive in the past – and why we will need it in the future. It strengthens and speeds up the slow track. It reconfigures our neural pathways, turning altruism into instinct, through the rituals we perform, the texts we read, and the prayers we pray. It remains the most powerful community-builder the world has known. Religion binds individuals into groups through habits of altruism, creating relationships of trust strong enough to defeat destructive emotions.

<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>What is the connection between the two goats in this <i>parasha</i> and Yaakov and Esav?
Do you think Esav was evil?
What is the connection between Yaakov and Esav, the two types of thinking, and Yom Kippur?
<b>EDUCATIONAL COMPANION TO THE QUESTIONS</b>
<b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>Rabbinic texts often present Esav as an evil person. Perhaps the socio-historic reason behind this is because we connect Esav genealogically with the biblical nation of Edom, and then later Rome, and Rome represented the arch-enemy of the Jews during the rabbinic period. However, on a closer reading of the Torah text itself, Esav is not necessarily evil, just impulsive. The end of the Yaakov and Esav narrative is in fact reconciliation, not rivalry (see Bereshit 33). We all know impulsive people. But impulsiveness is not an indication of evil, although they may regret an action taken in anger or high emotion when they did not make the best decision.
While procrastination can paralyse decision- making, it is obvious how beneficial it can be to think through decisions and actions, including speech, before acting. This is true for adults and children alike, and in discussing this with children, it is important to focus the conversation on the lives of the children themselves, using concrete examples from their experience.
While every person is no doubt more like one or the other of these two personalities (and if the child is struggling with self-awareness in this respect, help from parents and teachers will no doubt be forthcoming), there is a Yaakov and an Esav in each of us (see <i>Thinking More Deeply</i>).
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br>This famous midrash (quoted by Rashi on Bereshit 25:22) suggests that Yaakov and his descendants are inherently good, and holy, and interested in the Torah, and deeply inclined to connect to God through study and prayer, whereas Esav and his descendants have an inclination towards idolatry and, perhaps it even implies, evildoing (which is often central to pagan religions). The message of the <i>Covenant &amp; Conversation</i> essay also suggests that Yaakov and Esav have inherent inclinations within their personalities, but less related to good and evil and more related to the way they think and approach the world.
This is a fascinating discussion with no definitive answer. Science tells us that we are influenced by our genes, and religion and philosophy tell us we have free choice to decide beyond our nature and biology. While we should encourage our children and students to grapple with this debate themselves, a fair conclusion for those who believe in science and religion is that we are impacted by our genetics and yet at the same time we have free will.
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>Fast thinking is our rapid, instinctive, emotional, and subconscious response. This allows us to react quickly to situations of immediate potential danger. Slow thinking is reflective, conscious, deliberative, and careful. Both types of thinking have their place. Without the first, our ancestors would never have survived in hostile environments, and in fact this type of thinking helps us all to survive in our day-to day-lives. But it is the latter, slow, deliberate, conscious reflection, that separates us from the rest of the animal kingdom and makes us human beings. Both kinds of thinking have their place in our experience and survival as human beings.
Religion impacts both modes of thinking for the positive. It slows down our fast thinking, our impulses, ensuring that we act within a framework of ethics and morality. And it makes our slow thinking faster, by ensuring that the core values of religion, such as altruism and kindness, become second nature (rather than a lengthier process of deep thought) through rituals that “reconfigure our neural pathways.”
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>There are many hidden clues suggesting the goats may represent Yaakov and Esav. These include: two animals, alike in appearance but different in fate; the word <i>se’ir</i>, “goat,” is associated with Esav (he and his descendants lived in the land of Se’ir and the word <i>se’ir</i> is related to <i>sei’ar,</i> “hairy”); a red thread was tied to the scapegoat, and “red” (Edom) was Esav’s other name; and finally, “two kids of the goats,” <i>shenei se’irei izim</i>, mentioned in the high priest’s rites, reminds us of the very similar expression, “two kids of the goats,” <i>shenei gedayei izim</i>, mentioned in Bereshit 27, the scene of Yaakov’s deception.
Rabbinic texts often present Esav as an evil person. Perhaps the socio-historic reason behind this is because we connect Esav genealogically with Edom and Rome, the arch-enemies of the Jews during the rabbinic period (and on through Christianity in the Middle Ages). However, on a closer reading of the Torah text itself, Esav is not necessarily evil, just impulsive. Esav is known as a model for the mitzva of parental respect, and the end of the Yaakov and Esav narrative is in fact reconciliation, not rivalry (see Bereshit 33). We often find ourselves heavily influenced by the rabbinic approach to Esav, but if we take his character at face value from the Torah text alone we see a complex picture that allows room for a more compassionate approach to Esav as a personality.
This can be summed up in the last paragraph of this <i>Covenant &amp; Conversation</i> essay: “Who am I? That is the question Yom Kippur forces us to ask. To be Yaakov, we have to release and relinquish the Esav within us, the impulsiveness that can lead us to sell our birthright for a bowl of soup, losing eternity in the pursuit of desire.”

Kedoshim

In a Nutshell

<b><i>IN A NUTSHELL</i></b><br><i>Kedoshim</i> continues the discussion of the holiness laws that began in the previous <i>parasha</i>, changing focus from the world of the <i>Mishkan</i> (the portable Temple) and the <i>kohanim</i> (priests) to the Israelites as a whole. The people of Israel are commanded to be holy because “I, the Lord your God, am holy.” These laws include the commands to “love your neighbour and the stranger” as well as other ritual laws. The second half of the <i>parasha</i> deals with forbidden relationships and prohibited pagan practices.
<b>QUESTION TO PONDER</b>
<i>What is the difference between loving your neighbour and loving the stranger? Which is easier and which is harder?</i>

I; Made with Love

<big><strong>I. Made with Love</strong></big><br><b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br><i>Kedoshim</i> contains the two great love commands of the Torah. The first is: “<i>Love your neighbour as yourself</i>. I am the Lord” (Vayikra 19:18). Rabbi Akiva called this “the great principle of the Torah.” The second command is just as challenging: “The strangers living among you must be treated as your native-born. <i>Love them as yourself, for you were strangers in Egypt</i>. I am the Lord your God” (19:34).
These are extraordinary commands. Many civilisations contain variants of the Golden Rule, which states: “Do unto others as you would have them do to you,” or in the reverse attributed to Hillel (sometimes called the Silver Rule): “What is hateful to you, do not do to your neighbour.” But these are rules of reciprocity, not love. They encourage a fair society. They are the basic ground rules of life in a group.
Love is something altogether different and more demanding. Rarely would you find them written into a law. That makes these two commandments a revolution in the moral life. Judaism was the first civilisation to ever put love at the heart of morality.
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>

<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. Can we love the earth in the same way we love a person?</i>
<i>2. Does the Torah command us to love the earth?</i>
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>Judaism was the first civilisation to put love at the heart of morality. As Harry Redner writes in <i>Ethical Life</i>, “Morality is the ethic of love. The initial and most basic principle of morality is clearly stated in the Torah: ‘Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.’” He also writes: “The biblical ‘love of one’s neighbour’ is a very special form of love, a unique development of the Judaic religion and unlike any to be encountered outside it.”
<i>But why is it specifically here, in Kedoshim, in a chapter dedicated to the concept of holiness, that the command appears?</i>
Nowhere else in all of Tanakh are we commanded to love our neighbour. And only in one other place (Devarim 10:19) are we commanded to love the stranger.
And why does the command to love your neighbour as yourself appear in a chapter containing such laws as “Do not plant your field with two kinds of seed. Do not breed different kinds of animals. Do not wear clothing woven of two kinds of material”? These are <i>ḥukim</i>, the kind of commands whose reasoning we cannot logically understand. What have they to do with the self-evidently <i>moral</i> commands of loving the neighbour and stranger? Is the chapter simply a list of disconnected commands, or is there a single unifying strand here?
The answer goes deep. Almost every ethical system ever devised has sought to reduce the moral life to a single principle or perspective. Some connect it to reason, others to emotion, yet others to consequences: do whatever creates the greatest happiness for the greatest number. Judaism is different. It is more complex and subtle. It contains not one perspective but three. There is the <i>prophetic</i> understanding of morality, the <i>priestly</i> perspective, and the <i>wisdom</i> point of view.
<i>Prophetic</i> morality looks at <i>the quality of relationships within a society</i>, between us and God and between us and our fellow humans. The key prophetic words found in Tanakh are: righteousness, justice, kindness, and compassion (but not love).
When the prophets talk about love it is about God’s love for Israel and the love we should show for God. The prophetic voice is about how people conduct themselves in society. Are they faithful to God and to one another? Are they acting honestly, justly, and with due concern for the vulnerable in society? Do the political and religious leaders have integrity? Does society have the high morale that comes from treating citizens well and calling forth the best in them? A moral society will succeed; an immoral or amoral one will fail. That is the key prophetic insight. The prophets did not make the demand that people love each other, because society requires justice, not love.
The <i>wisdom</i> voice in Torah and Tanakh looks at character and consequence. If you live virtuously, then by and large things will go well for you. Those who do well, fare well. They find happiness (<i>ashrei</i>). Good people love God, family, friends, and virtue. But the wisdom literature does not speak of loving your neighbour or the stranger.
The <i>priest</i> is different from the prophet and sage, because he must be not just moral, but also “holy.” Someone or something that is holy is set apart, distinctive, different. The priests were set apart from the rest of the nation. They had no share in the land. They did not work as labourers in the field. Their sphere was the <i>Mishkan</i> or Temple. They lived at the epicentre of the Divine Presence. As God’s ministers they had to stay pure and avoid any form of defilement. They were holy.
Until now, holiness has been seen as a special attribute of the priest. But there was a hint at Mount Sinai that the Torah intended not only the children of Aharon to be holy: “You shall be to Me <i>a kingdom of priests</i> and a <i>holy nation</i>” (Shemot 19:6). Our chapter now spells this out for the first time. “The Lord said to Moshe, ‘Speak to <i>the entire assembly of Israel</i> and say to them: “Be holy because I, the Lord your God, am holy”’” (Vayikra 19:1–2). This tells us that the ethic of holiness applies not just to priests but to the entire nation. We must all be distinctive, set apart, held to a higher standard.
What in practice does this mean? A decisive clue is provided by another key word used throughout Tanakh in relation to the priest, namely the verb <i>b-d-l</i>: to divide, set apart, separate, distinguish. That is what a priest does. His task is “to <i>distinguish</i> between the sacred and the secular” (Vayikra 10:10) and “to <i>distinguish</i> between the unclean and the clean” (Vayikra 11:47). This is what God does for His people: “You shall be holy to Me, for I the Lord am holy, and I have <i>distinguished</i> you (<i>va’avdil</i>) from other peoples to be Mine” (Vayikra 20:26).
There is one other place in which <i>b-d-l</i> is a key word, namely the story of creation in Bereshit 1, where it occurs <i>five</i> times. God <i>separates</i> light and dark, day and night, upper and lower waters. For three days God demarcates different domains, then for the next three days He places in each its appropriate objects or life forms. God fashions order out of the <i>tohu vavohu</i> of chaos. As His last act of creation, He makes man in His “image and likeness.” This was clearly an act of love. “Beloved is man,” said Rabbi Akiva, “because he was created in [God’s] image” (Mishna Avot 3:14).
Bereshit 1 defines the priestly moral imagination. Unlike the prophet, the priest is not looking at society. He is not, like the wisdom figure, looking for happiness. He is looking at creation as the work of God. He knows that everything has its place: sacred and profane, permitted and forbidden. It is his task to make these distinctions and teach them to others. He knows that each life form has its own role in the environment. That is why the ethic of holiness includes rules like: Don’t plant a field with different kinds of seed, don’t breed different kinds of animals, and don’t wear clothing woven of two kinds of fabric.
Above all, the ethic of holiness tells us that every human being is made in the image and likeness of God. God made each of us in love. <i>Therefore, if we seek to imitate God</i> – “Be holy, because I, the Lord your God, am holy” – <i>we too must love humanity</i>, and not in the abstract but in the concrete form of the neighbour and the stranger. The ethic of holiness is based on the vision of creation-as-God’s-work-of-love. This vision sees all human beings – ourselves, our neighbour, and the stranger – as being in the image of God, and that is why we are to love our neighbour and the stranger as ourselves.
<b>I believe that there is something unique and contemporary about the ethic of holiness. It tells us that morality and ecology are closely related. They are both about creation: about the world as God’s work and humanity as God’s image. The integrity of humanity and the natural environment go together. The natural universe and humanity were both created by God, and we are charged to protect the first and love the second.</b>
<b>QUESTION TO PONDER</b>
<i>How are the concepts of holiness, love, morality, and ecology all connected?</i>
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>Love your neighbour. Love the stranger. Hear the cry of the otherwise unheard. Liberate the poor from their poverty. Care for the dignity of all. Let those who have more than they need share their blessings with those who have less. Feed the hungry, house the homeless, and heal the sick in body and mind. Fight injustice, whoever it is done by and whoever it is done against. And do these things because, being human, we are bound by a covenant of human solidarity, whatever our colour or culture, class or creed. These are moral principles, not economic or political ones. They have to do with conscience, not wealth or power. But without them, freedom will not survive.

Why is the priestly voice the one that commands us to love humanity and protect the natural universe?
<b>EDUCATIONAL COMPANION TO THE QUESTIONS</b>
<b><i>IN A NUTSHELL</i></b><br>It is always easier to show love and friendship to someone with whom you have more in common. The Hebrew word for “your neighbour” here is “<i>re’ekha</i>,” which is literally “friend” or “companion.” These are the people we form relationships with. It is highly likely that we have much in common with our friends, which makes it easier to feel love for them than for the stranger, who is likely to be somebody with obvious differences to us. But the Torah tells us that all people, even those strange and distant to us, are created in the image of God and are deserving of our love.
<b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>The “Golden Rule,” found in many cultures including Judaism, is to treat others as you would wish to be treated. It is easy to see how this benefits us as individuals and as a society. If you are nice to others, they will be nice to you. But the Torah asks us to go further. The Torah expects us to love unconditionally, because it is the right way to live. It is rare to find the expectation to love within law.
The love the Torah speaks of is not the emotion that is felt, sometimes passionate but fleeting or short-term. The Torah is speaking of loving-kindness, the love which is at the heart of the way we see and treat other humans. This is a choice and can be commanded.
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br>If the love the Torah talks about is action and behaviour, love based on acts of loving-kindness, then we can also love the earth in the same way. Being kind and loving to the earth would be looking after it and working hard to protect it.
The Torah does command us to love the earth, though it doesn’t use the word love. We are commanded to protect the world and ensure its sustainability (see Bereshit 2:15). There are also various laws that protect the integrity of the natural world, found in these <i>parashot</i> in the book of Vayikra. Rabbi Sacks is suggesting that the reason this <i>parasha</i> contains both the commands about the environment as well as the commands to love the neighbour and the stranger is because they all deal with holiness. The message is that love is central to being holy, and central to the way we must relate to humans and nature.
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>Someone or something that is holy is set apart, distinctive, different. The priest is the central character in understanding holiness. He sees that everything has its place: sacred and profane, permitted and forbidden. The priest is tasked with making these distinctions and teaching them to others. The Torah also tells us that different life forms have their own niche in the environment, and that every human being is made in the image and likeness of God. God made each of us in love. Therefore, if we seek to imitate God – “Be holy because I, the Lord your God, am holy” – we too must love humanity, and not in the abstract but in the concrete form of the neighbour and the stranger. The ethic of holiness is also based on the vision of creation-as-God’s-work-of-love. The connection between these concepts is that holiness teaches us to place love at the centre of how we relate to our fellow humans and to the natural world.
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>The commands to love are found in the book of Vayikra, which teaches us all about holiness. Love as the central value of morality, to guide us in how we relate to fellow humans, is a holy way to live.
Prophetic morality looks at the quality of relationships within a society, between us and God, and between us and our fellow humans. The wisdom voice in Torah and Tanakh looks at character and consequence. If you live virtuously, then by and large things will go well for you. The moral vision of the priest focuses on the key word <i>kadosh</i>, “holy.” This is what makes him different from the prophet and the sage. Holy is someone or something that is set apart, distinctive, different. The priest looks beyond the basic functions of society and consequences. He leads us to a higher level of behaviour.
Unlike the prophet, the priest is not looking at society. Unlike the wisdom figure, he is not looking for happiness. He is looking at creation as the work of God. He knows that everything has its place: sacred and profane, permitted and forbidden. The ethic of holiness and the priestly voice in the Torah is based on the vision of creation-as-God’s-work-of-love. This vision sees all human beings – ourselves, our neighbour, and the stranger – as in the image of God, and that is why we are to love our neighbour and the stranger as we love ourselves.

II; From Priest to People

<big><strong>II. From Priest to People</strong></big><br><b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>Until now, the book of Vayikra has been largely about sacrifices, the laws of purity, the Sanctuary, and the priesthood. It has been, in short, about a holy place, holy offerings, and the elite and holy people – Aharon and his descendants – who are the priests. Suddenly, in chapter 19, the Torah shifts its focus to the whole of the people and the whole of life:
The Lord said to Moshe: “Speak to the entire assembly of Israel and say to them, ‘Be holy because I the Lord your God am holy’” (Vayikra 19:1–2).
This is the first and only time in the book of Vayikra that the entire people are included in a command concerning holiness. The Sages say that it means that the contents of this chapter were declared by Moshe to a formal gathering of the entire nation (<i>Hak’hel</i>). It is the people as a whole who are commanded to “be holy,” not just an elite, such as the priests. In fact, it is life itself that is to be sanctified. Holiness is to be achieved in the way the nation makes its clothes and plants its fields, in the justice of its law courts, the way workers are paid, and the way business is conducted. The vulnerable – the deaf, the blind, the elderly, and the stranger – are to be protected. The whole of society is to be governed by love, without anger or revenge.
This is a radical idea. It is the democratisation of holiness. Just as in a democracy, all people have equal rights, the Torah tells us here that all people have and can achieve holiness. All ancient societies had priests. We have several examples in the Torah of non-Israelite priests (for example, Yitro, Moshe’s father-in-law, was a Midianite priest). The priesthood was not unique to Israel, and in all places it was an elite group. However, here for the first time we find a code of holiness directed to the people as a whole. This is a radical and new idea that the Torah brings to the world – we are <i>all</i> called on to be holy.

<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br><i>One Yom Kippur, a young boy who could not read came to the synagogue of the Baal Shem Tov with his father. They were desperately poor and his father could not afford to send the boy to school. He could not even read the siddur or follow the prayers. But the boy had a deep desire to join the community in their prayers and so accompanied his father to</i> shul<i> anyway. He sat down next to his father and closed his eyes tight, and whispered to Hashem, “I don’t know the prayers. All I know is the letters of the</i> Alef-Beit <i>that my father taught me. Please take the letters and turn them into the right words, to say what I feel in my heart.”</i>
<i>He then began to sing the</i> Alef-Beit <i>over and over again. His father became embarrassed and began to shush him, but the Baal Shem Tov stopped him, and asked him to allow the boy to continue to pray. At the conclusion of the final service of the day,</i> Ne’ila<i>, the Baal Shem Tov announced to the community that not only were the boy’s prayers accepted by the Master of the universe, but they broke through the gates of heaven, helping the prayers of the rest of the community to enter as well!</i>

<i>1. What do you think the message of this story is? How is it connected to the message of this</i> Covenant &amp; Conversation<i> essay?</i>
<i>2. Do you feel you can approach God and talk to Him? Do you think there are more “holy” or scholarly people who find this easier?</i>
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>This radical idea, the <i>democratisation of holiness</i>, that <i>all</i> people have and can achieve holiness, should come as no surprise to us. The idea, if not the details, had already been hinted at in the Torah. The most explicit instance comes in the prelude to the great covenant-making ceremony at Mount Sinai when God describes the potential of His people to be a “kingdom of priests and a holy nation” (Shemot 19:5–6), that is, a kingdom <i>all</i> of whose members are to be in some sense priests, and a nation that is, in its entirety, holy.
The first indication is much earlier still, in the first chapter of Bereshit, with its monumental statement, “God created mankind in His own image” (Bereshit 1:27). What is revolutionary in this declaration is not that a human being could be in the image of God. That is precisely how kings of Mesopotamian city-states and pharaohs of Egypt were regarded. They were seen as the representatives, the living images, of the gods. That is how they derived their authority. The Torah’s revolution is the statement that not some, but <i>all</i>, humans share this dignity. Regardless of class, colour, culture, or creed, we are all in the image and likeness of God.
Thus was born the cluster of ideas that, though they took many millennia to be realised, led to the distinctive culture of the West: the non-negotiable dignity of the human person, the idea of human rights, and eventually, the political and economic expressions of these ideas – liberal democracy on the one hand, and the free market on the other.
The point is not that these ideas were fully formed in the minds of human beings during the period of biblical history. This is clearly not so. The concept of human rights is a product of the seventeenth century. Democracy was not fully implemented until the twentieth. But already at the beginning of Bereshit, the seed was planted.
The concept of equality we find in the Torah specifically and Judaism generally is not an equality of wealth: Judaism is not communism. Nor is it an equality of power: Judaism is not anarchy. It is fundamentally an equality of dignity. We are all equal citizens in the nation whose sovereign is God. Hence the elaborate political and economic structure set out in Shemot, organised around the number seven, the sign of the holy. Every seventh day is free time. Every seventh year, the produce of the field belongs to all, Israelite slaves are to be liberated, and debts released. Every fiftieth year, ancestral land is to return to its original owners. Thus the inequalities that are the inevitable result of freedom are mitigated. The logic of all these provisions is the priestly insight that God, Creator of all, is the ultimate owner of all: “The land must not be sold permanently, because the land is Mine and you reside in My land as strangers and temporary residents” (Shemot 25:23).
God therefore has the right, not just the power, to set limits to inequality. No one should be robbed of dignity by total poverty, endless servitude, or unrelieved indebtedness.
What is truly remarkable, however, is what happened after the biblical era and the destruction of the Second Temple. Faced with the loss of the entire infrastructure of the holy, the Temple, its priests, and sacrifices, Judaism translated the entire system of <i>avoda</i>, divine service, into the everyday life of ordinary Jews. In prayer, every Jew became a priest offering a sacrifice. In repentance, he or she became a high priest, atoning for his sins and those of his or her people. Every synagogue, in Israel or elsewhere, became a fragment of the Temple in Jerusalem. Every table became an altar, every act of charity or hospitality, a kind of sacrifice.
Torah study, once the speciality of the priesthood, became the right and obligation of everyone. Not everyone could wear the official crown of priesthood, but everyone could wear the crown of Torah. A <i>mamzer talmid ḥakham</i>, a Torah scholar of illegitimate birth, say the Sages, is greater than an<i> am haaretz kohen gadol,</i> an ignorant high priest. Out of the devastating tragedy of the loss of the Temple, the Sages created a religious and social order that came closer to the ideal of the people as “a kingdom of priests and a holy nation” than had ever previously been realised. But the first clue is to be found much earlier, in the opening of Vayikra 19: “Speak to the entire assembly of Israel and say to them, ‘Be holy because I, the Lord, your God, am holy.’”
Holiness belongs to all of us when we turn our lives into the service of God, and society into a home for the Divine Presence.
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>Judaism represents a highly distinctive approach to the idea of equality, namely that it is best served not by equality of income or wealth, nor even of opportunity. Nor is it sufficient that we each have equal standing before God at times of prayer, and before the law (in cases of dispute). A society must ensure equal dignity – the Hebrew phrase is <i>kevod habriyot</i>, “human honour” – to each of its members.

<i>2. How does Judaism try to ensure that all members of society are treated with</i> kevod habriyot <i>and have equal dignity?</i>

Do you think that to be equal, everyone needs to have equal wealth?
<b>EDUCATIONAL COMPANION TO THE QUESTIONS</b>
<b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>Holiness means to be separated and elevated. The root of the Hebrew word <i>k-d-sh</i> literally means “separated.” The message of this <i>Covenant &amp; Conversation</i> essay is that all people can be holy in their everyday lives, through separating themselves and their actions, elevating them to a higher good, connecting them to the Divine. Our lives can be holy in the way we dress, plant our fields, carry out justice, conduct our business, and the way we protect and care for the weak in our community and society at large. We can also be holy in the way we interact with our friends and family, conduct ourselves at work or in school, and how we behave when we walk down the street or when we play sports.
The tribe of Levi (the priests, including the <i>kohanim</i>) were chosen to serve on behalf of the people in the Temple (today we remember this by calling up <i>kohanim</i> and <i>Levi’im</i> first when we call people to the Torah). In fact, the original plan was that the firstborn of every family would be their representative in the Temple service (showing that this role is not intrinsic to the tribe of Levi but in fact is available to all Israelites). However, God gave this merit to the tribe of Levi in reward for their loyalty and obedience during the episode of the sin of the Golden Calf (they refrained from participating, unlike the rest of the people).
Just as the political system we call democracy ensures that all people have equal rights (and votes), the Torah’s approach to holiness is that all Jews (and in fact, all human beings) have equal potential to become holy and connected to God. This is radical because ancient civilisation (like some societies still today) was hierarchical, believing only the elite classes can be holy and can have an intimate relationship with the Divine.
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br>Despite this little boy being very young, uneducated, and unfamiliar with the prayer service, he was able to stand in front of God and open his soul in communication and love, showing us that all people can have a meaningful relationship with God. The context of the story, the Baal Shem Tov’s synagogue on the holiest day of the year, emphasises this message. The Baal Shem Tov was the founder of <i>Ḥasidut</i>, and is revered as a holy man who had a deep and powerful relationship with God. However, he also saw the holiness in all people, and in fact this is a core message of hasidic thought – all Jews are holy and can approach God, not just rabbis and scholars, priests and prophets.
The answer to this question should be yes. The message of the <i>Covenant &amp; Conversation</i> essay, and the story, is that every single person, no matter their age or education or experience, can approach and connect to God, and regular Torah study and daily prayers are one important way to practise and strengthen our connection to Him. Also see <i>Around the Shabbat Table</i>, answer 2.
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>Socialism (especially communism as a political system based on the values of socialism) tried to ensure economic equality for all people in society. But as history shows, it was rarely concerned also with ensuring equality of dignity of all people. Much evil and suffering has often resulted from societies based on socialist political thought, when the dignity of their citizens was compromised. Even liberal democracy unchecked, while ensuring legal and civic equality, has often failed to ensure dignity and social equality for all of society.
Judaism approaches this in both philosophical and practical ways. The message of this <i>Covenant &amp; Conversation</i> essay is an example – all people are considered equal when it comes to holiness and standing in the eyes of God. All humans are created in the image of God, and this is the source of the “inalienable rights” they have to dignity in society. However, philosophies and ideas are never enough to protect values in society in a practical way. So Judaism protects this core value in its ethical code on which society must be built – such as the laws of charity and business, as well as other civil and social laws, such as the laws of slander and the protection of the weak in society.
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>See <i>The Core Idea</i>, answer 2. While rabbis (both ancient and contemporary) are in a position to achieve holiness, and perhaps have an advantage from their dedication to Torah scholarship (and have a responsibility to be holy as the spiritual leaders of the people), there is nothing intrinsically holy about them to begin with. Hence there is no reason why any Jewish person could not achieve the position of spiritual leader – because each and every one of us can achieve holiness. This is what the term “the democratisation of holiness” means.
Societies and religions that predated the Torah were hierarchical. There was a ruler on top, surrounded by a royal court, beneath which was an administrative elite, and at the bottom, an illiterate mass seen as a labour force for the economy and military. Hierarchy is also seen in the religions of these societies with the polytheistic belief in many gods, each one more powerful than the previous one. Judaism is a political and religious statement against hierarchy. (This is the message of the two great migrations in the Torah, away from the ultimate hierarchical and polytheistic societies in ancient times in search of the one true God – when Avraham left Mesopotamia and the Israelites left Egypt). When Judaism says that everyone can be holy, this is a radical idea that was first introduced to the world with the revelation at Sinai.
Equality is not about wealth but about dignity and value in society. See <i>From the Thought of Rabbi Sacks</i>, answer 1.

Emor

In a Nutshell

<b><i>IN A NUTSHELL</i></b><br><i>Emor</i> focuses on two kinds of holiness: that of people and of time. Chapter 21 relates to holy people: priests, and above them, the high priest. Because the priests serve in the <i>Mishkan</i> (the portable Temple), there are certain things they are forbidden from doing. For example, they are not allowed to come into contact with a dead body, and they cannot marry whomever they like.
Chapter 22 reminds us of similar laws relating to ordinary Israelites when they wish to enter the <i>Mishkan</i>, and then lists which imperfections would prevent an animal from being offered as a sacrifice.
Chapter 23 is all about holy time, and discusses the festivals of the year, including the three pilgrimage festivals (the <i>shalosh regalim</i>) of Pesaḥ, Shavuot, and Sukkot.
Chapter 24 speaks about the Menora, which was lit every day, and the show bread, which was renewed every week. The <i>parasha</i> ends with a story – one of the only two stories in the book of Vayikra – about a man who cursed during a fight.
<b>QUESTION TO PONDER</b>
<i>What are we celebrating on each of the three pilgrimage festivals?</i>

I; Radical Uncertainty

<big><strong>I. Radical Uncertainty</strong></big><br><b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>There is something very strange about the festival of Sukkot, of which our <i>parasha</i> is the main source. On the one hand, it is the <i>ḥag</i> most connected with joy. It is the only <i>ḥag</i> in our <i>parasha</i> that even mentions rejoicing: “And you shall <i>rejoice</i> before the Lord your God for seven days” (Vayikra 23:40). In the Torah as a whole, joy is not mentioned at all in relation to Rosh HaShana, Yom Kippur, or Pesaḥ, only once in connection with Shavuot, and <i>three times</i> in connection with Sukkot. Hence its name<i>: zeman simḥatenu</i>, the festival of our joy.
Yet the sukka actually replicates one of the more challenging aspects of the wilderness years: “You shall live in booths for seven days; all citizens in Israel shall live in booths, so that future generations may know that I made the Israelites live in booths when I brought them out of the land of Egypt, I the Lord your God” (Vayikra 23:42–43).
For forty years, the Israelites lived without permanent homes, often on the move. They were out in the wilderness, in no-man’s-land, where it is hard to know what to expect and what dangers lie in wait along the way. To be sure, the people lived under divine protection. But they could never be certain in advance whether it would be forthcoming and what form this protection might take. They were experiencing a prolonged period of insecurity.
How then are we to understand the fact that Sukkot, of all festivals, is called <i>zeman simḥatenu</i>, the festival of our joy? It would have made sense to call Pesaḥ – freedom’s birthday – the festival of joy. It would have made sense to call Shavuot – the day of revelation at Sinai – the festival of joy. Why do we give that title to a festival that commemorates forty years of exposure to the heat, cold, wind, and rain? Remembering all that, why should we feel joy?
The sukka symbolises living with unpredictability. Sukkot teaches us that <i>faith is not certainty. Faith is the courage to live with uncertainty</i>. And despite the uncertainty, we can still rejoice!
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. Why does it take courage to live with uncertainty?</i>
<i>2. How do we find joy when things are uncertain?</i>
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br><i>As the Coronavirus outbreak disrupted life for millions of people around the world, weddings have been among the many casualties of lockdowns, self-isolation, and official bans on large public gatherings. In Israel, as gatherings of more than ten people were banned, many couples had to make quick decisions to either delay their wedding celebrations, or forgo their dream wedding with all their friends and families in attendance.</i>
<i>Itamar Yekutieli, manager of the Ein Hemed Forest wedding venue, had an idea to help couples make this difficult decision. He launched a special service, offering free, small-scale weddings for young couples whose weddings could not take place as planned.</i>
<i>One such couple, Roni Ben-Ari and Yonatan Meushar, decided to take up Yekutieli’s offer, and went ahead with a tiny, intimate celebration. “It is different than what we had imagined...but it’s perfect, I think,” said Roni, turning to Yonatan and laughing.</i>
<i>“It’s a different and unique way [to get married],” he added, “But we are getting used to the situation.” A handful of close relatives attended, and many other “guests” celebrated and participated virtually via Zoom.</i>
<i>What could be a more powerful statement of the faith and hope that we would beat Coronavirus than getting married and planning for a brighter future!</i>
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. How is getting married during a time of crisis an act of deep faith?</i>
<i>2. What acts of faith have you carried out during difficult times?</i>
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>As well as the question of why Sukkot is associated with joy, we might also ask what was the miracle to be celebrated here? Pesaḥ and Shavuot recall miracles. But travelling through the wilderness with only temporary homes was neither miraculous nor unique. That is what people who travel through the wilderness do. They must. They are on a journey. They can only have a temporary dwelling. In this respect there was nothing special about the Israelites’ experience.
It was this consideration that led Rabbi Eliezer in the Talmud (Sukka 11b) to suggest that the sukka represents the Clouds of Glory, <i>Ananei HaKavod</i>, that accompanied the Israelites during those years, sheltering them from heat and cold, protecting them from their enemies, and guiding them on the way. This is a beautiful and imaginative solution to the problem. It identifies a miracle and explains why a festival should be dedicated to remembering it. That is why Rashi and Ramban take it as the plain sense of the verse.
But it is difficult nonetheless. A sukka looks nothing like the Clouds of Glory. It would be hard to imagine anything <i>less</i> like the Clouds of Glory.
Rabbi Akiva dissents from Rabbi Eliezer’s view and says that a sukka is what it says it is: a hut, a booth, a temporary dwelling. What, according to Rabbi Akiva, was the miracle? There is no way of knowing the answer. But we can guess.
If a sukka represents the Clouds of Glory – the view of Rabbi Eliezer – then it celebrates God’s miracle. If it represents nothing other than a sukka itself – Rabbi Akiva’s view – then it celebrates the <i>human</i> <i>miracle of faith</i>.
The Israelites may have complained and rebelled. But they followed God. They kept going. Like Avraham and Sara, they were prepared to journey into the unknown.
If we understand this to be the miracle, we can realise a deep truth about faith itself. <i>Faith is not certainty. Faith is the courage to live with uncertainty</i>. Almost every phase of the Exodus was fraught with difficulties, real or imagined. That is what makes the Torah so powerful. It does not pretend that life is any easier than it is. The road is not straight and the journey is long. Unexpected things happen. Crises suddenly appear. It becomes important to embed in a people’s memory the knowledge that we can handle the unknown. God is with us, giving us the courage we need.
It is as if on Sukkot God were reminding us: Don’t think you need solid walls to make you feel safe. I led your ancestors through the desert so that they would never forget the journey they had to make and the obstacles they had to overcome to get to this land. “I made the Israelites live in booths when I brought them out of the land of Egypt.” In those booths, fragile and open to the elements, the Israelites learned the courage to live with uncertainty.
Other nations told stories that celebrated their strength. They built palaces and castles as expressions of invincibility. The Jewish people was different. They carried with them a story about the uncertainties and hazards of history. They spoke of their ancestors’ journey through the wilderness without homes, addresses, or protection against the elements. It is a story of spiritual strength, not military strength.
Sukkot is a testament to the Jewish people’s survival. Even if it loses its land and is cast again into the wilderness, it will lose neither heart nor hope. It will remember that it spent its early years as a nation living in a sukka, a temporary dwelling exposed to the elements. It will know that in the wilderness, no encampment is permanent. It will keep travelling until once again it reaches the Promised Land: Israel, home.
It is no accident that the Jewish people is the only one to have survived two thousand years of exile and dispersion, its identity intact and energy unabated. It is the only people who can live in a shack with leaves as a roof and yet feel surrounded by Clouds of Glory. It is the only people who can live in a temporary dwelling and yet rejoice.
Economist John Kay and former governor of the Bank of England Mervyn King published a book called <i>Radical Uncertainty</i>. In it, they make the distinction between <i>risk</i>, which is calculable, and <i>uncertainty</i>, which is not. They argue that people have relied too much on calculations of probability while neglecting the fact that danger may appear from a completely unexpected source. The sudden appearance of the Coronavirus just as their book appeared proved their point. People knew there was a possibility of a pandemic. But no one knew what it would be like, where it would come from, how rapidly it would spread, and what toll it would take.
More important than the calculation of probabilities, they say, is <i>understanding the situation</i>, answering the question, “What is going on?” This, they say, is never answered by statistics or predictions but rather by narrative, by telling a story.
<i>That is exactly what Sukkot is about</i>. It is a story about uncertainty. It tells us that we can know everything else, but we will never know what tomorrow will bring. Time is a journey across a wilderness.
On Rosh HaShana and Yom Kippur we pray to be written into the Book of Life. On Sukkot we rejoice because we believe we have received a positive answer to our prayer. But as we turn to face the coming year, we acknowledge at its outset that life is fragile, vulnerable in a dozen different ways. We do not know what our health will be, what our career or livelihood will be, or what will happen to society and to the world. We cannot escape exposure to risk. That is what life is.
The sukka symbolises living with unpredictability. Sukkot is the festival of radical uncertainty. But it places it within the framework of a narrative, exactly as Kay and King suggest. It tells us that though we journey through a wilderness, we as a people will reach our destination. If we see life through the eyes of faith, we will know we are surrounded by Clouds of Glory. Amid uncertainty we will find ourselves able to rejoice. We need no castles for protection or palaces for glory. A humble sukka will do, for when we sit within it, we sit beneath what the Zohar calls “the shade of faith.”
<b>I believe that the experience of leaving the protection of a house and entering the exposure of the sukka is a way of taming our fear of the unknown. It says: We have been here before. We are all travellers on a journey. The Divine Presence is with us. We need not be afraid. That is a source of the resilience we need in our interconnected, hazardous, radically uncertain world.</b>
<b>QUESTION TO PONDER</b>
<i>What statement of faith are we making when we leave our houses to sit in the sukka?</i>
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>Faith is not certainty. It is the courage to live with uncertainty. It is not knowing all the answers. It is often the strength to live with the questions. It is not a sense of invulnerability. It is the knowledge that we are utterly vulnerable, but that it is precisely in our vulnerability that we reach out to God, and through this we learn to reach out to others, able to understand their fears and doubts. We learn to share, and in sharing we discover the road to freedom. It is only because we are not gods that we are able to discover God.
<b>Ten Paths to God<i> – Faith: Love as Loyalty,</i> 3</b>
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>Why is Sukkot described as <i>zeman simḥatenu</i>, the festival of our joy, if it recalls a difficult period in Jewish history?
What is miraculous about human faith in a time of uncertainty (as represented by the sukka)?
What message do you think the festival of Sukkot has for us, now, in uncertain times?
<b>EDUCATIONAL COMPANION TO THE QUESTIONS</b>
<b><i>IN A NUTSHELL</i></b><br>Pesaḥ commemorates the Exodus from Egypt and the barley harvest. Shavuot celebrates the giving of the Torah and the wheat harvest. Sukkot recalls the forty years spent dwelling in booths in the wilderness, and the ingathering of the crops at the end of the harvest season. Sukkot is the odd one out here because it is not linked to a miracle-based event in history. This is explored further in this <i>Covenant &amp; Conversation</i> essay.
<b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>For those who believe they have all the answers, there is no uncertainty in their world, and no courage is needed to live. For those who are a hundred percent certain they know what God’s plan is, it is easy to live with faith. But this is not true faith, because no one can truly know what God’s plan is. True faith takes courage to believe that despite the uncertainty of living in a world without clear answers, we still believe that God will be there for us.
This deep faith, in the face of uncertainty, allows us to focus on the joy of life despite not knowing the exact path our lives will take. It should encourage us to stop worrying about the bigger picture, and have the courage of faith that things will work out because God has a plan for us. This allows us to focus on the here and now, take pleasure and joy in the small moments of life, and have gratitude for what we have now, rather than worrying about what the future holds.
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br>When the world is turned upside-down and chaos seems to reign supreme, it is hard to think about and plan for the future. To get married, to build the foundations for a family, and to look towards the future by bringing children into this world is a profound statement of faith that the future will be better than the present. It is predicated on the belief that it is worth continuing humanity, and deciding to play an active part in that continuity.
These could be acts of kindness and volunteering, the planning of future programmes in the community, or even in your own private life. Even a student doing their schoolwork is an important act, because it makes a statement of belief that tomorrow is worth working for and fighting for.
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>The sukka symbolises living with uncertainty. Sitting, eating, dwelling in it says that though we journey through a wilderness, we as a people will reach our destination. If we see life through the eyes of faith, we will know we are surrounded by Clouds of Glory. Amid uncertainty we will find ourselves able to rejoice. The experience of leaving the protection of a house and entering an exposed sukka says: We have been here before. We are all travellers on a journey. The Divine Presence is with us. We need not be afraid.
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>We may each experience a life of uncertainty but we can find strength and comfort in our faith in God that He will protect us. That is the source of our joy. On Sukkot, we dwell in a sukka, a physical representation of the unknown, and still we find we are protected. This faith brings us great joy.
If we are looking for a miracle to commemorate on Sukkot (like the other two pilgrimage festivals do) then this is the act of courage that is faith in the face of uncertainty. That Jews felt the presence and protection of God despite all the uncertainties of the wilderness was super-human and miraculous.
In recent times, humanity has experienced a deep sense of uncertainty and vulnerability, much the same as the generation that lived through the wilderness years did. Every year we sit in the sukka to remember what that generation felt, and we reignite our faith in God’s protection. These days, we need our faith in God more than ever, to carry us through this difficult time.

II; Three Versions of Shabbat

<big><strong>II. Three Versions of Shabbat</strong></big><br><b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>There is something unique about the way <i>Parashat Emor</i> speaks about Shabbat. It calls it a <i>mo’ed</i> and a <i>mikra kodesh</i> although, in the regular meaning of these words, it is neither. <i>Mo’ed</i> means a specific time with a fixed date on the calendar. <i>Mikra kodesh</i> means either a sacred assembly, a time at which the nation gathered at the central Sanctuary, or a day made holy by the human court’s fixing of the calendar.
Shabbat is none of these things. It has no fixed date on the calendar. It is not a time of national assembly. And it is not a day made holy by the declaration of the human court. Shabbat was the day made holy by God Himself at the beginning of time.
This strange way of describing Shabbat can be understood better if we look at the context in which it appears, in the chapters of the Torah that speak about holiness (Vayikra 18–27). The radical claim made in these chapters is that holiness, a term normally reserved for God, can be acquired by human beings when they act like God. The festivals are to Shabbat like the Sanctuary is to the universe. Both are humanly constructed versions of something holy created by God. By inviting human beings to create a Sanctuary and fix the monthly and yearly calendar, God gives us the dignity of a holiness we can acquire actively as co-creators with God, not just receive passively as a gift. When they appear in Vayikra,<i> mikra kodesh</i> and<i> mo’ed</i> have an extra meaning that they do not have in other places because they hint at the opening verse of the book: “He called (<i>Vayikra</i>) to Moshe, and the Lord spoke to him in the Tent of Meeting (<i>Ohel Mo’ed</i>), saying…” (Vayikra 1:1). The focus is on <i>mikra</i> as “call” and <i>mo’ed</i> as “meeting.” When the Torah uses these words uniquely in this chapter to apply to Shabbat as well as the festivals, it is focusing on the encounter between God and humanity in the arena of time. Whether it is God’s call to us or ours to Him, whether God initiates the meeting or we do, holy time becomes a still point in the turning world when lover and beloved, Creator and creation, “make time” for one another and know one another in the special form of knowledge we call love.
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. In what way do we create Yom Tov like God created Shabbat?</i>
<i>2. How do we know that it’s not just God who can be holy, but that we can too?</i>
<i>3. How can Shabbat be a point in time when “Creator and creation make time for one another in love”?</i>
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br><i>Rabbi Joseph D. Soloveitchik once said: On Yom Tov each Jew was commanded to come close to the</i> Shekhina<i> (Divine Presence); this is the mitzva of</i> aliya laregel<i>, the festival pilgrimage. A Jew would step out from his home and walk to Jerusalem in search of the</i> Shekhina<i>. But Yom Tov is not the home of the</i> Shekhina<i>. The Torah did not tell a Jew to make a pilgrimage to Jerusalem on Shabbat, because there is no need. On Shabbat the</i> Shekhina<i> knocks on our door. All we have to do is let Her in!</i>
<i>The Kotzker Rebbe once asked his students where God was to be found; they answered that “He fills all the world with His glory.” He shook his head and said, “No, I asked where is He to be found, not where He is.” The students looked at the Rebbe with confusion and exasperation. “Did we not already say that He is everywhere?” “No, no,” the Kotzker smiled at them. “You must understand that God is to be found in the place that you open up your hearts and let Him in!”</i>
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. How is Yom Tov different from Shabbat according to Rabbi Soloveitchik?</i>
<i>2. How does the story of the Kotzker Rebbe help us understand how to “let the</i> Shekhina<i>” in on Shabbat?</i>
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>Is this aspect of Shabbat, presented in <i>The Core Idea</i>, new and different from the Shabbat we find in other places in the Torah? Let’s take a look at the two versions of the Ten Commandments, as they appear in Shemot and Devarim. Famously, the wording of the two versions is different. The Shemot account begins with the word “<i>zakhor</i>,” “remember.” The Devarim account begins with “<i>shamor</i>,” “keep, guard, protect.” But they differ more profoundly in their very understanding of the nature and significance of the day. In Shemot (20:7–9), Shabbat is a reminder of creation. In Devarim (5:11–14) there is no reference to creation. Instead the Torah speaks about a historical event: the Exodus. We keep Shabbat not because God rested on the seventh day but because He took our ancestors out of Egypt, from slavery to freedom. Therefore, Shabbat is a day of freedom even for servants, and even for domestic animals. One day in seven, no one is a slave.
Of course, both are true, and we integrate both accounts into the text of the Kiddush we make on Friday night. We call Shabbat a remembrance of creation (<i>zikaron lemaase bereshit</i>) as well as a reminder of the Exodus (<i>zekher liyetziat Mitzrayim</i>). However, once we set the Vayikra account in the context of these other two, a richer pattern emerges. There are three primary voices in the Torah: those of <i>kingship</i>, <i>priesthood</i>, and <i>prophecy</i>.
These are the three fundamental leadership roles and they have distinctive modes of knowledge. Priests, prophets, and the governing elite (the wise, the elders, kings and their courts) each have their own ways of thinking and speaking. Kings and courts use the language of <i>ḥokhma</i>, “wisdom.” Priests teach Torah, the word of God for all time. Prophets have visions. They have “the word” of God not for all time but for this time. Prophecy is about history as the interaction between God and humanity. It is no coincidence that there are three voices because fundamental to Jewish faith is the belief that God is encountered in three ways: in <i>creation</i>, <i>revelation</i>, and <i>redemption</i>.
<i>Wisdom</i> is the ability to see God in creation, in the intricate complexity of the natural universe and the human mind. In contemporary terms, <i>ḥokhma</i> is a combination of the sciences and humanities: all that allows us to see the universe as the work of God and human beings as the image of God. <i>Revelation</i>, Torah, the speciality of the priest, is the ability to hear God in the form of the commanding voice, most characteristically in the form of law. Revelation is a matter not of seeing but of listening, in the deep sense of hearing and heeding, attending and responding. Wisdom tells us how things are. Revelation tells us how we should live. Prophetic consciousness is always focused on <i>redemption</i>, the long and winding road towards a society based on justice and compassion, love and forgiveness, peace and human dignity. The prophetic word is always related to history, to the present in relation to the past and the future: not history as a mere succession of events, but as an approach to or digression from the good society, the Promised Land, and the Messianic Age.
Creation, revelation, and redemption represent the three basic relationships within which Judaism and human life are set. <i>Creation</i> is God’s relationship to the world. <i>Revelation</i> is God’s relationship with us. When we apply revelation to creation, the result is <i>redemption</i>: the world in which God’s will and ours coincide.
We now understand why the Torah contains three distinct accounts of Shabbat. The account in the first version of the Ten Commandments, “For in six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth,” is the Shabbat of creation. The account in the second version, “Remember that you were slaves in Egypt and that the Lord your God brought you out,” is the Shabbat of redemption. The <i>Parashat Emor</i> account, spoken in the priestly voice, is the Shabbat of revelation.
In revelation, God calls to the people. That is why the middle book of the Torah, which more than any other represents <i>Torat Kohanim</i>, “the law of the priests,” begins with the word “<i>Vayikra</i>,” “And He called.” It is also why Shabbat is, uniquely here, included in the days “which you shall proclaim (<i>tikre’u</i>) as sacred convocations (<i>mikra’ei</i> <i>kodesh</i>),” with the double emphasis on the verb <i>k-r-a,</i> “to call.” Shabbat is the day in which, in the stillness of rest and the silence of the soul, we hear the <i>Vayikra</i> of God.
Hence too, the word <i>mo’ed</i>, which in general means “appointed times,” but here means “meeting.” Judah Halevi, the eleventh-century poet and philosopher, said that on Shabbat, it is as if God had personally invited us to be dinner guests at His table. The Shabbat of revelation does not look back to the birth of the universe or forwards to the future redemption. It celebrates the present moment as our private time with God. It represents “the power of now.”
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>The Sabbath (in Hebrew, Shabbat) is a religious institution, a memorial to creation, the day on which God Himself rested. But it is also and essentially a political institution. Shabbat is the greatest tutorial in liberty ever devised. Passover tells us how the Israelites won their freedom. Shabbat tells us how they kept it. One day in seven, Jews create a Messianic society. It is the day on which everyone, master and slave, employer and employee, even animals, experience unconditional freedom. We neither work nor get others to work, manipulate nor allow ourselves to be manipulated. We may neither buy nor be bought. It is the day on which all hierarchies, all relationships of power are suspended.

<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>Is your Shabbat where “Creator and creation make time for one another in love”? How can you make your Shabbat more like that?

What does Rabbi Sacks mean when he says that Shabbat has “three dimensions, of science, religion, and political ideology, united in the transforming experience” of Shabbat?
<b>EDUCATIONAL COMPANION TO THE QUESTIONS</b>
<b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>The cycle of the week, culminating with Shabbat, was something created by God during the first seven days of creation. Shabbat is holy independently of humankind. However, the date of the festivals is fixed by us, starting with the first day of each month which we originally confirmed through the testimony of witnesses who spotted the new moon each month. Since the exile from the land of Israel, the system was changed and the rabbis fixed the calendar, and in this way the festivals have still been fixed by the people and not God.
This radical idea (discussed in “From Priest to People,” the <i>Covenant &amp; Conversation</i> essay for <i>Parashat Kedoshim</i>) is the message of the book of Vayikra and the Torah as a whole. We can be holy by acting in a manner similar to God. We achieve this by observing the mitzvot. In fact, the Torah tells us that all of humankind are created in the image of God (Bereshit 1:26–27) and have the potential for holiness.
On Shabbat we cease to function as masters of creation, and step back to reflect on being a part of creation. Keeping Shabbat gives us the time and space to have a relationship with the Creator. We do this in a practical sense by refraining from <i>melakha</i> (“work”) on Shabbat, and instead focusing on the more spiritual aspects of our life.
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br>Yom Tov is a time when we approach God (in Temple times) by making a pilgrimage to Jerusalem to celebrate the festivals (Pesaḥ, Shavuot, and Sukkot each have a specific mitzva of <i>aliya laregel</i> – pilgrimage to Jerusalem). Conversely, each week, on Shabbat, God makes His own pilgrimage to meet us where we are.
The message of the Kotzker Rebbe is that the <i>Shekhina</i> is ready to enter our lives if we only let Her in. If we are open to seeing Hashem in our lives, and making space for Hashem in our lives, then we will find the <i>Shekhina</i> there and available for an intimate relationship. For Rabbi Soloveitchik, Shabbat is a day that especially lends itself to this, if we only open our hearts to it.
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>Shabbat is a day where we apply the core values of the Torah (revelation), such as the dignity and rights of all people, to our real-life world (creation) to arrive at a twenty-five-hour period of “Messianic society” (redemption). We do this by ensuring that “everyone, master and slave, employer and employee, even animals, experience unconditional freedom.... It is the day on which all hierarchies, all relationships of power are suspended.”
The three accounts of Shabbat referred to are:
The first version of the Ten Commandments is the Shabbat of creation.
The account in the second version is the Shabbat of redemption.
The <i>Parashat Emor</i> account, spoken in the priestly voice, is the Shabbat of revelation. The Shabbat described in this quote is the Shabbat of redemption.
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>See <i>The Core Idea</i>, answer 3, and <i>It Once Happened</i>. Shabbat is a day we mindfully step back from our everyday lives as masters of creation and make room for our relationship with God. If we find practical ways to do that, whether that be synagogue attendance, Torah learning experiences, or just time to breathe and think, our Shabbat can be this, and we can make space for God both on Shabbat and in the rest of our lives.
From the three versions of Shabbat presented by Rabbi Sacks, the Shabbat found in this <i>parasha</i> is of revelation – where God speaks/calls to us (and this <i>parasha</i> is in the book of the Torah called <i>Vayikra</i> – “And He called”). Here are some possible ways “Shabbat calls to us”: Perhaps we can hear the voice of God calling on us to enjoy and protect the creation (and thereby refrain from showing mastery over it for twenty-five hours). Or Shabbat could be the call to reconnect to friends and family in a way we cannot during the week. Maybe we can hear the voice of God in the socio-moral aspects of Shabbat whereby “everyone, master and slave, employer and employee, even animals, experience unconditional freedom...the day on which all hierarchies, all relationships of power are suspended” and the call to create a society where this can be the case even during the week. Or maybe we just hear the call of God to connect and form a stronger relationship.
These are the three dimensions of Shabbat found in the three accounts of Shabbat mentioned here: Shabbat of creation (science), Shabbat of revelation (religion), and Shabbat of redemption (political ideology that should heal the problems in society). While secular society fragments and compartmentalises them, Shabbat can be a model whereby they are united in a “transforming experience,” helping us to build a world where these three can work together to achieve a redeemed society.

Behar

In a Nutshell

<b><i>IN A NUTSHELL</i></b><br><i>Behar</i> is just a single chapter, but this short <i>parasha</i> has a very important message – it teaches us how to build a fair society where everyone is free but also equal.
Sometimes you can have freedom without equality, such as in a country where everyone is free to do whatever job they wish, and spend their money however they wish, but some people are poor and some are rich, so not everyone is equal (this is called a capitalist free economy). And sometimes you can have equality without freedom, where everyone has the same possessions but the government takes away a lot of choices (for example, Communism or socialism). Rarely do we see both.
The powerful insight of the Torah is that you can have both, but not at the same time. Therefore, time itself has to become part of the solution, in the form of the seventh year (the <i>Shemitta</i> year) and, after seven Sabbatical cycles, the fiftieth year – the Jubilee (<i>Yovel</i>). These work as corrections to the inequalities caused by the free market that allow some to become rich while others suffer the loss of land, home, and even freedom.

I; Real Responsibilities

<big><strong>I. Real Responsibilities</strong></big><br><b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>Underlying many of the laws contained in <i>Parashat Behar</i> is a revolutionary concept (to this day) about property and ownership. Ultimately, all things belong to God. This is a theological equivalent of the legal concept of “eminent domain,” that the king has ultimate ownership and power over all lands within his kingdom. In the case of Israel, eminent domain – both in relation to persons and to land – relates to God. This is stated explicitly in our <i>parasha</i>:
In relation to land: “The land must not be sold permanently, because the land is Mine and you are but aliens and My tenants” (Vayikra 25:23).
In relation to persons: “Because the Israelites are My servants, whom I brought out of Egypt, they must not be sold as slaves. Do not rule over them ruthlessly, but fear your God” (Vayikra 25:42–43).
Because ultimately, true ownership belongs only to God, everything we possess we merely hold as God’s trustees. One of the conditions of that trust is that we do not use wealth or power in ways incompatible with human dignity.
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. Why is it fair that God owns all of our possessions, even if we worked hard for them?</i>
<i>2. On what conditions does God allow us to have possessions, even if they really belong to Him?</i>
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br><i>When Eliana was preparing for her bat mitzva she told her parents she wanted to do something really meaningful. She knew she was very lucky to live the comfortable life her parents had worked hard to give her, and didn’t need all the presents her friends and family were bound to give her. So she sat with her parents and decided that she would do something for the families of her hometown who struggled to afford school supplies for their children, and even hot meals sometimes.</i>
<i>Instead of accepting presents, she would encourage her guests to donate to her fundraising campaign, and she raised more than $20,000! With the help of a local charity they distributed the money to families in need and also took her friends to volunteer in a soup kitchen to help feed the hungry, and give out school supplies to those who needed them.</i>
<i>Eliana made her family very proud of her, as she demonstrated how grateful she was for the material comfort she lived with. She showed sensitivity to those who had less than her, and how lucky she was to have all that she did. And above all, how we only deserve our wealth if we use it in a way that makes the world a better place!</i>

<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br><i>“And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof: it shall be a jubilee unto you; and ye shall return every man unto his possession, and ye shall return every man unto his family”</i> (Vayikra 25:10)<i>.</i>
These words, taken from the <i>parasha</i> of <i>Behar</i>, are inscribed on the Liberty Bell in Philadelphia. It was the chiming of this bell, from the tower of Independence Hall on July 8, 1776, that summoned citizens to hear the very first public reading of the American Declaration of Independence. Biblical freedom inspired American freedom.
They are also the opening words of the book on international debt relief, <i>I.O.U.: The Debt Threat and Why We Must Defuse It</i> by economist Noreena Hertz. The verse inspired one of the major economic initiatives of the twenty-first century: Jubilee 2000, an international programme by governments and monetary institutions to reduce, or in some cases cancel, the burden of debt borne by many developing countries (34 billion dollars of debt repayment were cancelled, affecting twenty-two countries, eighteen of them in Africa). Launching the initiative in Britain, the Treasury invited not just economists, but religious leaders also. Jubilee 2000 was explicitly based on the principle of the biblical Jubilee, the fiftieth year, during which slaves were freed and land was returned to its ancestral owners. Seldom has an ancient idea more effectively proved its relevance to the contemporary world. The social programme of <i>Behar</i>, with its concern for economic justice, debt relief, welfare, and humane working conditions, speaks with undiminished power to the problems of a global economy.
To be sure, there is no direct inference to be made from the Torah to contemporary politics. Jews have identified with all shades of the political spectrum: from Trotsky to Milton Friedman, from socialism and communism to laissez-faire capitalism. The Torah is not an economic theory or a party-political programme. It is about eternity, whereas politics is about the here and now: the mediation of competing claims and the management of change. The Torah – especially Vayikra chapter 25 – sets out the parameters of a society based on equality and liberty. These are eternal values. But they conflict. It is hard to pursue both fully at the same time. Communism favours equality at the cost of liberty. Free market capitalism favours liberty at the cost of equality. How we construct the balance varies from age to age and place to place.
The State of Israel, for example, was heavily influenced in its early years by socialism (and in the case of the kibbutz, communism). More recently it has moved closer to Reaganomics and Thatcherism. The conditions are not yet in place for a restoration of the biblical Jubilee. According to some authorities, it requires the presence of all or most of the Jewish people – i.e., the absence of a Diaspora. According to others, it only applies when the original twelve tribes occupy the land allocated to them in the days of Moshe and Yehoshua. Despite all these limitations, we can infer certain general parameters of a Torah approach to politics and economics.
Property rights are important to the biblical vision. Psalm 128 says, “When you eat the fruit of your labour, you shall be happy and you shall prosper.” The prophet Mikha foresaw the day when “every man will sit under his own vine and his own fig tree and no one will make them afraid” (Mikha 4:4). The classic critique of “big government” is contained in Shmuel’s warning against the dangers of corrupt power. Speaking about the risk of appointing a king, he says:
<i>“This is what the king who will reign over you will do: He will take your sons and make them serve with his chariots and horses, and they will run in front of his chariots. Some he will assign to be commanders of thousands and commanders of fifties, and others to plough his ground and reap his harvest, and still others to make weapons of war and equipment for his chariots. He will take your daughters to be perfumers and cooks and bakers. He will take the best of your fields and vineyards and olive groves and give them to his attendants”</i> (I Sam. 8:11–14).
And so on. This becomes high drama in the time of King Aḥav, the prophet Eliyahu, and the vineyard of Navot. The queen, Izevel, arranges for Navot to be killed so that his land can be seized.
Governments tend to appropriate property. Sadly, there continue to be too many parts of the world today where corruption disfigures the exercise of power. Hence private property rights are an essential defence of personal liberty. Within limits, free trade and limited government (albeit with due provision for publicly funded education and welfare) are consistent with a biblical vision whose key concerns are freedom, justice, and personal independence. In Judaism, the state exists to serve the individual, not the individual the state.
What the twenty-fifth chapter of Vayikra addresses, however, are the long-term inequities of the market. Poverty creates the need for loans, and the burden of debt can become cumulative and crippling. It can lead people to sell their land and even their freedom: in ancient times this meant selling oneself into slavery. Today it means “sweatshop” labour at less than subsistence wages. Hence the need for periodic redistribution: the cancellation of debts, the liberation of slaves, and the return of ancestral property (other than that within walled cities). That is the logic of the Sabbatical and Jubilee years.
It was a gloriously humane structure, the proof of which lies in the fact that even today it inspires politicians, economists, and religious leaders far beyond the Jewish community. Its key insight is that the governance of society must be based on moral considerations, above all, the dignity of the individual. No one must suffer humiliating poverty. No member of the covenant community must be condemned to perennial slavery, or debt, or the burden of interest repayments. No one must lose their share in the land. Beyond the specific halakhic parameters of these laws is the larger ethical vision of what a decent society should look like. This has not ceased to be compelling in an age of international corporations, instantaneous communications, and the global economy.
In an age of vast inequalities of income within and between societies – in which a billion people lack adequate food and shelter, clean water, and medical facilities, and thirty thousand children die each day from preventable diseases, the vision of <i>Behar</i> still challenges us with its ideals. <b>I believe wealth and power are not privileges but responsibilities, and we are summoned to become God’s partners in building a world less random and capricious, more equitable and humane</b>.
<b>QUESTION TO PONDER</b>
<i>Which political and economic system do you think is most compatible with Torah ethics?</i>
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>Judaism has a high regard for private property as an institution governing the relations between human beings. At the same time, though, governing the relationship between humanity and God, there has been an equal insistence that what we have, we do not unconditionally own. Ultimately everything belongs to God. What we have, we hold in trust. And there are conditions to that trust – or as the great Victorian Jew Sir Moses Montefiore put it, “We are worth what we are willing to share with others.”

<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>Who do you think should get the credit for the creation of the things that we own?

How can we partner with God in building a “less random and more equitable and humane world”?
<b>EDUCATIONAL COMPANION TO THE QUESTIONS</b>
<b><i>IN A NUTSHELL</i></b><br>Mitzvot are not only personal commandments to make individuals better people, but also the law code of a good society. The mitzvot found in this <i>parasha</i> are geared towards building a fair society.
<b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>Judaism believes in a partnership with God in all things, including the acquisition of wealth and possessions. While it is true that we work hard to create wealth, we must always realise that God created the world, and all physical things originate with Him. He has provided the favourable conditions necessary for the creation of our wealth. This includes our natural talents, and the other factors necessary in the natural world (for example, while a farmer can be talented and hardworking, he also needs fertile soil and favourable weather for his plants to grow).
God allows us (and even encourages us) to work hard and have and enjoy possessions, as long as we are aware of His role in their creation, and also that we use them for moral purposes, especially for improving the world and making it a better place to live for its inhabitants.
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br>Of course Eliana deserved her presents on this important milestone in her life. But she was lucky enough to have many material blessings that her parents had worked hard to give to her. So she decided she could forgo more possessions and take the opportunity instead to give to those in need who were less privileged than her. (No need to worry about Eliana…she did get some presents, as some of her friends and family both donated and gave her presents!).
Eliana gave her friends and family an opportunity to use their wealth to make the world a better place. This is a great example of how we can use our resources, which God has given us and helped us create, to partner with Him in His work by making the world a better place!
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>This is a fascinating question perhaps without any definitive answers. Rabbi Sacks wrote often how the democratic political systems and capitalist economies of the West were to some extent founded on Torah values, although this is not to say that there are not the same values found in other systems also. While Torah values can be the foundation of a system and the motivating factors of those who establish it, ultimately political and economic systems are morally neutral, and need actors within them to input values and morality.
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>Possessions can be thought of as an example of a partnership between us and God. While we work hard to create wealth, we could not do this without the help of God, who gives us the necessary conditions, including our own talents and abilities. However, unless we work hard to create material wealth we will remain without it. So the answer is really both ourselves and God.
These laws, which include agricultural tithes, the Sabbatical and Jubilee years, and the laws of charity, remind us always that our material wealth belongs first and foremost to God and that we must show gratitude to Him for it and use it for the greater good. These laws also demonstrate the value of the dignity of humankind, <i>ḥesed</i>, and equality and liberty.
We can partner with God to create a fairer and more just world through social action and small acts of kindness, as well as working hard at a national level to create a society based on these values. Every person can make a difference, however small or great.

II; Evolution or Revolution?

<big><strong>II. Evolution or Revolution?</strong></big><br><b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br><i>Behar</i> sets out a revolutionary model for a society of justice, freedom, and human dignity. At its core is the idea of the Jubilee (the fiftieth year). One aspect of the Jubilee is the release of slaves (Vayikra 25:39–42). The Torah’s message there is clear. Slavery is wrong. To be “in the image of God” means to have the right to a life of freedom. The very idea of the sovereignty of God means that He alone has claim to the service of humankind. Those who are God’s servants may not be slaves to anyone else.
This is a radical idea that overturned the very foundations of religion in ancient times. The early civilisations – Mesopotamia, Egypt – were based on hierarchies of power which seemed to be seen in the very nature of the cosmos. Just as there were (so it was believed) ranks among the heavenly bodies, so there were on earth. The great religious rituals and monuments were designed to mirror and support these hierarchies.
At the heart of the Jewish story was an idea almost unthinkable to the ancient mind: that God acts in history to liberate slaves – that the supreme Power is on the side of the powerless. It is no accident that Israel was born as a nation under conditions of slavery. It has carried throughout history the memory of those years – the bread of affliction and the bitter herbs of servitude – because the people of Israel serves as an eternal reminder to itself and the world of the moral need for all people to be free in society. The free God desires the free worship of free human beings.
<i>Yet the Torah does not abolish slavery.</i> That is the paradox at the heart of <i>Behar</i>. It was limited and humanised. Every Shabbat, slaves were granted rest and a taste of freedom. In the seventh year, Israelite slaves were set free, and if they chose to remain, then they had to be released in the Jubilee year. While they were slaves, they had to be treated like employees, with no back-breaking or spirit-crushing labour. Everything dehumanising about slavery was forbidden. Yet slavery itself was not banned. Why not? If it was wrong, it should have been outlawed. Why did the Torah allow slavery to exist in any form? Rambam in <i>The Guide for the Perplexed</i> explains the need for <i>time</i> in social transformation. All processes in nature, he argues, are gradual. The foetus develops slowly in the womb. Stage by stage, a child becomes mature. And what applies to individuals applies to nations and civilisations: “It is impossible to go suddenly from one extreme to the other. It is therefore, according to the nature of man, impossible for him suddenly to discontinue everything to which he has been accustomed.”
But surely God can do anything, including changing human nature. Why then did He not simply transform the Israelites, making them capable immediately of the highest values? Rambam gives a simple answer. In miracles, God changes physical nature but never <i>human</i> nature. Were He to do so, the entire project of the Torah – the free worship of free human beings – would have been pointless. There is no greatness in programming a million computers to obey instructions. God’s greatness is in taking the risk of creating a being, humans, capable of choice and responsibility and therefore of freely obeying God.

<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>The modern world has been shaped by four revolutions: the English (1642–1651), the American (1776), the French (1789), and the Russian (1917). Their outcomes were radically different. In England and America, revolution brought war, but led to a gradual growth of civil liberties, human rights, representative government, and eventually, democracy. On the other hand, the French Revolution gave rise to the “Reign of Terror” between September 5, 1793 and July 28, 1794, in which more than forty thousand enemies of the revolution were summarily executed. The Russian Revolution led to one of the most repressive totalitarianism regimes in history. As many as twenty million people are estimated to have died unnatural deaths under Stalin between 1924 and 1953. In revolutionary France and the Soviet Union, the dream of utopia ended in a nightmare of hell.
What was the difference between them? There are multiple explanations. History is complex and it is wrong to simplify, but one in particular stands out. The English and American revolutions were inspired by the Hebrew Bible as read and interpreted by the Puritans. This happened because of the convergence of a number of factors in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries: the Reformation, the invention of printing, the rise of literacy and the spread of books, and the availability of the Hebrew Bible in vernacular translations. For the first time, people could read the Bible for themselves.
The French and Russian revolutions, by contrast, were hostile to religion and were inspired instead by philosophy: that of Jean-Jacques Rousseau in the case of France, and of Karl Marx in the case of Russia. There are obvious differences between Torah and philosophy. The most well known is that one is based on revelation, the other on reason. Yet I suspect it was not this that made the difference to the course of revolutionary politics. Rather, it lay in their respective understandings of time.
God wanted mankind to abolish slavery, but <i>by its own choice, in its own time</i>. Ancient economies were dependent on slavery. Slavery as such was not abolished in Britain and America until the nineteenth century, and in America, not without a civil war. The challenge was: how can one create a social structure in which people will eventually come to see slavery as wrong and freely choose to abandon it?
The answer lay in the Torah and its legislation, which, in a single deft stroke, changed slavery from an <i>ontological condition</i> (what I am) to a <i>temporary circumstance</i> (a situation in which I find myself, now but not forever). No Israelite was allowed to be treated or to see himself as a slave. He might be reduced to slavery for a period of time, but this was a passing plight, not an identity.
In ancient thought, for example in Aristotle’s philosophy, slavery is an ontological condition, a fact of birth. Some are born to rule, others to be ruled. This is precisely the worldview to which the Torah is opposed. Biblical law is designed to ensure that neither the slave nor his owner should ever see slavery as a permanent condition. A slave should be treated “like an employee or a resident,” in other words, with the same respect as is due a free human being. In this way the Torah ensured that, although slavery could not be abolished overnight, it would eventually be. And so it happened.
That is why we are commanded to hand on the story of the Exodus to our children every Pesaḥ, so that they too taste the unleavened bread of affliction and the bitter herbs of slavery. It is why we are instructed to ensure that every seventh day, all those who work for us are able to rest and breathe the expansive air of freedom. It is why, even when there were Israelite slaves, they had to be released in the seventh year, or failing that, in the Jubilee year. This is the way of <i>evolution</i>, not <i>revolution</i>, gradually educating every member of Israelite society that it is wrong to enslave others, so that eventually the entire institution will be abolished, not by divine command but by human consent. The end result is a freedom that is secure, as opposed to the freedom of the philosophers that is all too often another form of tyranny.
Revolutions based on philosophical systems fail because change in human affairs takes time, and philosophy has rarely given an adequate account of the human dimension of time. Revolutions based on Tanakh succeed, because they go with the grain of human nature, recognising that it takes time for people to change. The Torah did not abolish slavery, but it set in motion a process that would lead people to come of their own accord to the conclusion that it was wrong. That it did so, albeit slowly, is one of the wonders of history.
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>The supreme expression of the American faith was the Declaration of Independence (1776), largely drafted by Jefferson. In one of the most famous of all political affirmations, it stated: “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.” The striking thing about this sentence is that “these truths” are anything but self-evident. Most societies at most times have held as self-evidently true that we are created unequal. Some are born to rule, others to be ruled. Every ancient myth, dogma, and creed with the exception of the Hebrew Bible was a justification for inequality and hierarchy, a canonisation of the status quo. Plato held that society was stratified into three classes: guardians (philosopher-kings), auxiliaries (soldiers), and the rest; and that whether or not these distinctions were given by birth, people should be taught that they were. Aristotle believed that some people were born to be slaves. Gradations of class were written into the structure of reality. The strong, powerful, wealthy, and highborn were meant (whether by nature or by God) to exercise supremacy over others. Jefferson’s “truths” were self-evident only to a culture steeped in the Hebrew Bible, from its opening declaration that the human individual is “the image of God,” to its enactment in history in the Exodus and the covenant at Mount Sinai.

How does the Torah make slavery more humane?
The Torah had zero tolerance for idolatry. Why not for slavery also?
<b>EDUCATIONAL COMPANION TO THE QUESTIONS</b>
<b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>The language Rabbi Sacks uses in the <i>Covenant &amp; Conversation</i> essay leaves us with no doubt. “Slavery is wrong. It is an assault on the human condition. To be ‘in the image of God’ means to be summoned to a life of freedom. The very idea of the sovereignty of God means that He alone has claim to the service of humankind. Those who are God’s servants may not be slaves to anyone else.” This leaves us with the question, which he explores here, why does the Torah not abolish slavery completely?
History seems to support Rambam’s approach. Take American society as an example. While America was founded in 1776 on the lofty goals of dignity and freedom for all men (see <i>From the</i> <i>Thought of Rabbi Sacks</i>), slavery was only abolished after the Civil War (1861–1865), women were only granted the right to vote in 1920, Native Americans were only granted citizenship and voting rights in 1924, and protection of voter registration and voting for racial minorities (allowing non-whites full voting rights) was only legislated in 1965. Many would argue that to this day, there is still unacceptable racism in American society.
Modern slavery in various forms still exists, with estimates ranging between 21–70 million people enslaved in some form. These include people in forced labour (including children in sweatshops), forced marriages (including child brides), and forced sexual exploitation. It would seem that humanity as a whole has still not fully learned this lesson, and we must continue to fight against slavery until it is eradicated from the world.
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br>It would seem reasonable that a slave owner (or even a regular employer) could provide reasonable protection and care for his slaves, servants, or employees, feeding and clothing them, and maintaining their rights and dignity, while still keeping the better food for him/herself. However, Rabbi Yoḥanan refused to distinguish between his slave and himself, and fed him the same food from his table.
The verse from Iyov highlights the shared humanity between Rabbi Yoḥanan and his slave (and any employer/employee, and ultimately all human beings) and this testifies to the equal rights and dignity of all human beings.
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>If society dehumanises a race or ethnic group, then it can exclude that group from the moral and civil rights granted to all other citizens. This is what happened in America until the Civil War and even later (and of course what happened to Jews in Nazi Germany). This seems to prove Rambam’s perspective on why the Torah does not abolish slavery – the need for time in social transformation. See also <i>The Core Idea,</i> answer no. 2.
If all people are created in the image of God, and all have equal value in the eyes of God, then they must also be equal in the eyes of man, and have equal rights in society. Slavery and racism can only exist when an ethnic group is excluded from this moral category (as people who have equal value in the eyes of God and therefore must have equal rights, both civil and social, in society). Both slavery and racism are an anathema to the Torah and Torah Jews should be actively involved in abolishing them from society.
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>In the words of Rambam, “It is impossible to go suddenly from one extreme to the other.” It is therefore, according to our nature, impossible for us to abruptly discontinue everything to which we have been accustomed. Social transformation takes time, and so, rather than abolish slavery in an instant, the Torah regulates and humanises it, and waits for humanity to develop and evolve morally to the point where it learns that slavery is morally wrong.
Every seventh day, slaves were granted rest and a taste of freedom. In the seventh year (or, if they refused, in the fiftieth), Israelite slaves were set free. During their years of service, they were to be treated like employees. They were not to be subjected to back-breaking or spirit-crushing labour. Everything dehumanising about slavery was forbidden. The Torah also introduced the narrative to the world that “God intervenes in history to liberate slaves – that the supreme Power is on the side of the powerless.”
Idolatry is one of the three cardinal sins in Judaism, for which one must even sacrifice one’s life rather than transgress. It is considered to be something that cannot be tolerated in any form in society. However, even idolatry was not completely eradicated, in that much of the culture of idolatrous worship (such as sacrificial worship) was maintained because this was the language of worship in biblical times. Rambam suggests that many mitzvot in the Torah were designed to wean the Jewish people away from idol worship (in a similar way to how he explains the Torah weans Jews off slavery).

Bechukotai

In a Nutshell

<b><i>IN A NUTSHELL</i></b><br><i>Beḥukotai</i> is mainly about God speaking about the blessings that the Israelites will receive if they keep the Torah, and the curses/bad things that will happen to them if they do not. If we believe that God acts in history, rewards the good and punishes the bad, then we can have hope – this is an idea that was given to the world by the Torah. The remarkable statement at the end of the curses, that whatever happens, God will not reject His people, provides us with eternal hope throughout Jewish history.
<b>QUESTION TO PONDER</b>
<i>How can this</i> parasha<i> give us hope?</i>

I; The Power of a Curse

<big><strong>I. The Power of a Curse</strong></big><br><b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>The book of Vayikra ends with blessings and curses. The blessings will be the result if the people keep their covenant with God. The curses will happen to them if they break their promises. The general principle is clear. If people behave well, the nation will do well. If they behave badly, eventually bad things will happen.
It is the custom to read the <i>Tokheḥa</i>, the curses section (both here and also in the parallel passage in Devarim 28), in a low voice in the synagogue, which makes them a little less terrifying than if they were said out loud. But they are awful enough however they are read. And both here and in Devarim, the section on curses is longer and far more graphic than the section on blessings.
This seems to contradict a basic principle of Judaism, that God’s generosity to those who are faithful to Him is far greater than His punishment of those who are not.
The whole idea contained in the Thirteen Attributes of Mercy (Shemot 34:6–7) is that God’s love and forgiveness are stronger than His justice and punishment. Why, therefore, are the curses in this <i>parasha</i> so much longer and so much more emphasised than the blessings?
The answer is that God loves and forgives, but on the condition that, when we do wrong, we admit it, show we regret the act, make it up to those we have harmed, and repent. In the middle of the Thirteen Attributes of Mercy is the statement, “Yet He does not leave the guilty unpunished” (Shemot 34:7). God does not forgive the sinner who doesn’t repent, because were He to do so, it would make the world a worse place, not a better one. More people would sin if there were no downside to doing so.
The reason the curses are so dramatic is not because God seeks to punish, but the exact opposite. The Talmud tells us that God weeps when He allows disaster to strike His people: “Woe to Me, that due to their sins I destroyed My house, burned My Temple and exiled them [My children] among the nations of the world” (Berakhot 3a). The curses were meant as a warning. They were intended to put off, scare, discourage. They are like a parent warning a young child not to play with electricity because it is dangerous. The parent may deliberately intend to scare the child, but they do so out of love, not severity.

<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br><i>LouAnne Johnson was a retired U.S. Marine who decided to become a teacher as a second career. But she soon found the job was more of a challenge than she could have ever imagined. When she arrived on her first day, she found she would be teaching of a group of tough, hostile teenagers from underprivileged backgrounds. Many of her students were involved in gang warfare and drug dealing. Not one was motivated to learn, and they all refused to cooperate or listen to her at all.</i>
<i>LouAnne was desperate to reach the students and make a difference in their lives, and tried to persuade them to learn in numerous ways, including using contemporary music, teaching them karate, and using themes and language of the street, helping her students to connect their reality to the subjects they were studying. She even rewarded their efforts with candy bars, reward incentives, and a trip to a theme park (much to the anger of the school authorities!).</i>
<i>These creative approaches had various degrees of success, but she finally found the secret to motivate her students when she had the idea to give each of them an A grade for the whole year at the beginning of the semester! She told them that she believed deep down that each of them deserved the A, and had the potential to achieve it, and it was there for the taking. Now all they had to do was maintain it by working hard throughout the year!</i>
<i>Sometimes being given something in reward is less effective at motivating us than the threat of losing something!</i>
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. How is this story related to the parasha?</i>
<i>2. What lesson can we learn from it for our everyday life?</i>
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>Martin Luther King would say, “The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends towards justice.” Not always immediately but ultimately, good is rewarded with good, bad with bad.
Our <i>parasha</i> starkly sets out the terms of that equation: If you obey God, there will be rain in its season, the ground will yield its crops and the trees their fruit; there will be peace. But if you ignore God, things will not flourish. The curses are almost three times as long and much more dramatic in the language they use:
<i>“But if you will not listen to Me…then I will do this to you: I will bring upon you sudden terror, wasting diseases and fever that will destroy your sight and sap your strength….</i>
<i>“I will break your stubborn pride and make the sky above you like iron and the ground beneath you like bronze…. I will send wild animals against you, and they will rob you of your children, destroy your cattle, and make you so few in number that your roads will be deserted…. Your land will be laid waste, and your cities will lie in ruins…</i>
<i>“As for those of you who are left, I will make their hearts so fearful in the lands of their enemies that the sound of a windblown leaf will put them to flight. They will run as though fleeing from the sword, and they will fall, even though no one is pursuing them”</i> (Vayikra 26:14–37).
There is a savage eloquence here. The images are vivid. There is a pulsing rhythm to the verses, as if the harsh fate that would overtake the nation is inevitable, cumulative, and accelerating. The effect is intensified by the repeated hammer blows: “If after all this…if you remain hostile…if in spite of these things…if in spite of this.” The word <i>keri</i>, key to the whole passage, is repeated seven times. It appears nowhere else in the whole of Tanakh. Its meaning is uncertain. It may mean rebelliousness, obstinacy, indifference, hard-heartedness, reluctance, or being-left-to-chance. But the basic principle is clear. If you act towards Me with <i>keri</i>, says God, I will turn that same attribute against you, and you will be devastated.
The classic example is the book of Yona. God tells Yona the prophet to go to Nineveh and warn the people, “In forty days Nineveh will be destroyed.” He does so. The people take him seriously. They repent. God then relents from His threat to destroy the city. Yona complains to God that He has made him look ridiculous. His prophecy has not come true. Yona has failed to understand the difference between a prophecy and a prediction. If a prediction comes true, it has succeeded. If a prophecy comes true, it has failed. The prophet tells the people what will happen <i>if</i> they fail to change. A prophecy is not a prediction but a warning. It describes a fearful future in order to persuade the people to avert it. That is what the <i>Tokheḥa</i> is.
In their new book, <i>The Power of Bad,</i> John Tierney and Roy Baumeister argue on the basis of substantial scientific evidence, that bad has far more impact on us than good. We pay more attention to bad news than good news. Bad health makes more difference to us than good health. Criticism affects us more than praise. A bad reputation is easier to acquire and harder to lose than a good one.
Humans are designed – “hardwired” – to take notice of and rapidly react to threat. Failing to notice a lion is more dangerous than failing to notice a ripened fruit on a tree. Recognising the kindness of a friend is good and virtuous, but not as significant as ignoring the animosity of an enemy. One traitor can betray an entire nation.
It follows that the stick is a more powerful motivator than the carrot. Fear of the curse is more likely to affect behaviour than desire for the blessing. Threat of punishment is more effective than promise of reward. Tierney and Baumeister document this over a wide range of cases from education to crime rates. Where there is a clear threat of punishment for bad behaviour, people behave better.
Judaism is a religion of love and forgiveness. But it is also a religion of justice. The punishments in the Torah are there not because God loves to punish, but because He wants us to act well. Imagine a country that had laws but no punishments. Would people keep the law? No. Everyone would choose to take advantage of the efforts of others without contributing themselves. Without punishment, there is no effective law, and without law there is no society. The more powerfully one can present the bad, the more likely people are to choose the good. That is why the <i>Tokheḥa</i> is so powerful, dramatic, and fear-inducing. The fear of bad is the most powerful motivator of good.
<b>I believe that being warned of the bad helps us to choose the good. Too often we make the wrong choices because we don’t think of the consequences.</b> That’s how global warming happened. That’s how financial crashes happen. That’s how societies lose their solidarity. Too often, people think of today, not the day after tomorrow. The Torah, painting in the most graphic detail what can happen to a nation when it loses its moral and spiritual bearings, is speaking to us in every generation, saying: Beware. Take note. Don’t function on autopilot. Once a society begins to fall apart, it is already too late. Avoid the bad. Choose the good. Think long and choose the road that leads to blessings.
<b>QUESTION TO PONDER</b>
<i>Why do you think are we often too quick to make bad decisions without thinking through the consequences?</i>
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>There is nothing inevitable about the division, fragmentation, extremism, isolation, the economics of inequality, or the politics of anger that have been the mood of Britain and America in recent years. They have been the legacy of the misplaced belief that societies can function without a moral bond. They cannot, or at least not for long. That is why we are where we are. But we can change. Societies have moved from “I” to “We” in the past. They did so in the nineteenth century. They did so in the twentieth century. They can do so in the future. And it begins with us.
<b><i>Morality,</i> 336</b>
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>Do you think that in the larger picture, over time, there is justice in the world (as the quote from Martin Luther King suggests)?
Why is the list of curses so much longer than the list of blessings, when God is slow to anger and full of compassion?
Why isn’t love of God enough of an incentive to keep the covenant?
<b>EDUCATIONAL COMPANION TO THE QUESTIONS</b>
<b><i>IN A NUTSHELL</i></b><br><i>Beḥukotai</i> gives us a choice – between good and evil, between life and death. If we make the right choice, we will always receive life and blessing. This is in its essence a hopeful message – that our fate is in our own hands. However, the <i>parasha</i> also contains the promise that God will never reject us as His people. So even if we make the wrong choice, either as individuals, or as a nation, God promises He will never completely reject us. There is no more hopeful message!
<b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>This is a difficult concept for a child to understand. Punishments are there to guide and improve us. They help us to learn about consequences. They are sometimes based on justice and sometimes on an educational process, to improve and strengthen the one being punished. When a parent (and hopefully a teacher also) warns a child, and then follows through with the promised punishment, it is because they love the child and want them to learn and grow.
This question gives the child the opportunity to relate to the concept of the <i>Tokheḥa</i> (the curses) in a personal way from their own life experience.
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br>LouAnne Johnson tried hard to motivate her students by giving them incentives – things they would receive if they worked hard. But the most effective motivation for them was when she gave them something for free but told them they had to work hard or they would lose it. The threat of losing something was more effective than the promise of reward. This is similar to the <i>Tokheḥa</i> which is a dire warning that if the Israelites do not keep their covenant with God, terrible things will happen. It was a more powerful motivator than the promise of reward (the blessings).
When we consider actions and decisions that we must take in our lives, asking what we stand to lose is sometimes a stronger question than what we stand to gain. Sometimes we make bad, impulsive decisions because we do not fully think through the possible consequences.
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>Although some philosophers such as Descartes and Kant thought humans were rational and capable of making decisions based on logic, others (such as Hume) believed we are primarily emotional beings who make decisions on the basis of feelings, desires, and drives of which we may be barely conscious. We justify our choices, but brain scans show that we may have made those choices before being aware that we had done so. Daniel Kahneman, the behavioural economist, demonstrated that we have a dual-system or twin-track brain. One track is rapid, instinctive, emotional, and subconscious. The other is slower, conscious, deliberative, and calculating. The former allows us to react quickly to situations of immediate potential danger. Without it, we and our ancestors would not have survived. But we also have the ability to “think slow,” to pause and reflect. All animals have desires. Only human beings are capable of passing judgement on these desires – of asking, should I or should I not satisfy this desire? Too often people use the former way of thinking and need help taking the time to think through the consequences more fully.
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>This is a deep and philosophical question that humans have struggled with throughout history. Religious philosophers have worked hard to find ways to understand justice in a world that often feels deeply unjust. That is why MLK described the arc of the moral universe as long. Sometimes we do not see the arc return and justice prevail. Those who have faith that God plays a role in history will believe that justice will always ultimately prevail.
By design, in order to be an effective deterrent against the people breaking their covenant with God. Psychology shows us that negative outcomes (punishments, for example) are a more powerful motivator than positive outcomes (rewards).
The ultimate goal is for our behaviour to be motivated by our love of God. But this is a difficult level to reach, and in the meantime, in order to get to that level, we need a more powerful system of incentives – reward and punishment. Just as a child, in early developmental stages, cannot be reasoned with through rational arguments, but will respond to reward and punishment, so spiritually we need to work hard to transcend our need for external incentives for our behaviour.

II; The Birth of Hope

<big><strong>II. The Birth of Hope</strong></big><br><b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>In this <i>parasha</i> we read the <i>Tokheḥa</i>, the terrifying curses warning of what would happen to Israel if it betrayed its divine mission. We read a prophecy of history gone wrong. If Israel loses its way spiritually, say the curses, it will lose physically, economically, and politically also. The nation will experience defeat and disaster. It will forfeit its freedom and its land. The people will go into exile and suffer persecution. Customarily we read this passage in the synagogue <i>sotto voce</i>, in an undertone, so fearful is it.
Yet the passage does not end there. In an abrupt change of key, we then hear one of the great consolations in the Bible:
<i>“Yet in spite of this, when they are in the land of their enemies, I will not cast them away, neither will I abhor them, to destroy them utterly and to break My covenant with them: for I am the Lord their God. But I will for their sakes remember the covenant of their ancestors, whom I brought forth out of Egypt in the sight of the heathen, that I might be their God: I am the Lord”</i> (Vayikra 26:44–45).
This is a turning point in the history of the human spirit. It is <i>the birth of hope</i>: not hope as a dream, a wish, a desire, but hope as the very shape of history itself, “the arc of the moral universe,” as Martin Luther King Jr. put it. God is just. He may punish. He may hide His face. But He will not break His word. He will fulfil His promise. He will redeem His children. He will bring them home.

<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br><i>Gena Turgel survived Plaszow, Auschwitz, and Bergen-Belsen. She saw her sister and brother-in-law shot and lost much of her family. Only an iron determination to save her mother kept her alive. When Belsen was liberated by the British in 1945, one of the officers was a Jewish man, Norman Turgel. Mere days after they met, they became engaged. Rev. Leslie Hardman, the Jewish chaplain who was with the troops as they entered Belsen, officiated at their wedding. Gena’s wedding dress, made from a British army parachute, is now exhibited in London’s Imperial War Museum. Gena and Norman moved to London, and she lived there until the age of ninety-five, leaving children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren.</i>
<i>In 1987, she wrote her autobiography,</i> I Light a Candle<i>, and she spent much of her later years speaking to young people at schools and universities, recounting her experiences during the Holocaust. Most of the people to whom she spoke were not Jewish, and what she had to tell them often came as a profound shock. Despite everything, most children do not know the details of those years. Yet what she conveyed is not dark. Gena had no bitterness or hate or rage, only serenity and graciousness.</i>
<i>What she taught, over and above the need for tolerance and the willingness to fight on behalf of those who are victims, is a love of life itself. Every day was, for her, an unexpected gift. She knew that there were hundreds of moments at which she might have died. That, too, is something that, after her experiences at the hands of the Nazis, she felt a need to convey to future generations: a sense that time is precious and must be used to create good.</i>

<i>1. How did the strength of Gena Turgel’s hope affect her throughout her life?</i>
<i>2. How can Gena’s story help you have hope?</i>
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>Hope is one of the very greatest Jewish contributions to Western civilisation. Judaism is the “voice of hope in the conversation of humankind.” In the ancient world, there were “tragic cultures” in which people believed that the gods were, at best, indifferent to our existence, at worst actively malevolent. The best humans could do was avoid attracting their attention or appease their wrath with sacrifices. In the end, though, it was considered all in vain. The great stories of unavoidable tragedy were Greek. Biblical Hebrew did not even contain a word that meant “tragedy” in the Greek sense. Modern Hebrew had to borrow the word: hence, <i>tragedya</i>.
Then there are secular cultures like that of the contemporary West in which the very existence of the universe, of human life and consciousness, is seen as the result of a series of meaningless accidents intended by no one and with no redeeming purpose. All we know for certain is that we are born, we live, we will die, and it will be as if we had never been. Hope is not unknown in such cultures, but it is what Aristotle defined as “a waking dream,” a private wish that things might be otherwise. As seen through the eyes of ancient Greece or contemporary science, there is nothing in the texture of reality or the direction of history to justify belief that the human condition could be other and better than it is.
For the most part, the Hebrew Bible expresses a quite different view: that there can be change in the affairs of humankind. We are summoned to the long journey at whose end is redemption and the Messianic Age. <i>Judaism is the principled rejection of tragedy in the name of hope</i>.
Judaism insists that the reality that underlies the universe is not deaf to our prayers, blind to our aspirations, indifferent to our existence. We are not wrong to strive to perfect the world, refusing to accept the inevitability of suffering and injustice. We hear this note at key points in the Torah. It occurs twice at the end of Bereshit when first Yaakov then Yosef assure the other members of the covenantal family that their stay in Egypt will not be endless. God will honour His promise and bring them back to the Promised Land. We hear it again, magnificently, as Moshe tells the people that even after the worst suffering that can befall a nation, Israel will not be lost or rejected (Devarim 30:3–4).
But the key text is here at the end of the curses of the <i>Tokheḥa</i>. This is where God promises that even if Israel sins, it may suffer, but it will never die. It may experience exile, but eventually it will return. It may undergo the most terrible suffering, but it will never have reason to despair. Israel may betray the covenant but God never will. This is one of the most fateful of all biblical assertions. It tells us that no fate is so bleak as to murder hope itself. No defeat is final, no exile endless, no tragedy the story’s last word.
Subsequent to Moshe, all the prophets delivered this message, each in their own way. Hoshea told the people that though they may act like a faithless wife, God remains a loving husband. Amos assured them that God would rebuild even the most devastated ruins. Yirmeyahu bought a field in Anatot to assure the people that they would return from Babylon. Yeshayahu became the poet laureate of hope in visions of a world at peace that have never been surpassed.
Of all the prophecies of hope inspired by Vayikra 26, none is as haunting as the vision in which Yeḥezkel saw the people of the covenant as a valley of dry bones. Gradually they came together, took on flesh, and lived again:
Then He said to me: Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel. They say, “Our bones are dried up and our hope is lost (<i>avda tikvatenu</i>); we are cut off.” Therefore prophesy and say to them, “This is what the Sovereign Lord says: ‘O My people, I am going to open your graves and bring you up from them; I will bring you back to the land of Israel’” (Yeḥezkel 37:11–14).
No text in all of literature is so evocative of the fate of the Jewish people after the Holocaust, before the rebirth in 1948 of the State of Israel. Almost prophetically, Naftali Herz Imber alluded to this text in his words for the song that eventually became Israel’s national anthem. He wrote: “<i>Od lo avda tikvatenu</i>,” “Our hope is not yet lost.” Not by accident is Israel’s anthem called <i>HaTikva</i>, “The Hope.”
Hope emerged as part of the spiritual landscape of Western civilisation through a quite specific set of beliefs: that God exists, that He cares about us, that He has made a covenant with humanity and a further covenant with the people He chose to be a living example of faith. That covenant transforms our understanding of history. God has given His word, and He will never break it, however much we may break our side of the promise. Without these beliefs, we would have no reason to hope at all.
History as conceived in this <i>parasha</i> is not utopian. Faith does not blind us to the apparent randomness of circumstance, the cruelty of fortune, or the seeming injustices of fate. No one reading Vayikra 26 can be an optimist. Yet no one sensitive to its message can abandon hope. Without this, Jews and Judaism would not have survived. Without belief in the covenant and its insistence, “Yet in spite of this,” there might have been no Jewish people after the destruction of one or other of the Temples, or the Holocaust itself. It is not too much to say that Jews kept hope alive, and hope kept the Jewish people alive.
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>Jewish time is not linear but something more profound. I call it <i>covenantal time</i>. This is time not as continuous advance, but as a narrative with a beginning and a distant end, in whose midst we are and whose twists and turns continue to surprise us. The terms of the drama are set. There are two characters, God and mankind. There are continuing themes: exile and redemption, wanderings in the wilderness, backslidings and lapses, atonement and forgiveness, returns and rededications, epiphanies and moments when man looks for God and fails to find Him. Nothing in this narrative is as simple as linear time. There is no guarantee of progress. There are constant digressions, false turns, wanderings in the wilderness….
The deepest difference between linear and covenantal time is that whereas the first gives rise to <i>optimism</i>, the latter leads to <i>hope</i>. These two concepts, often confused, are in fact utterly different. Optimism is the belief that things will get better. Hope is the belief that, together, we can make things better. Optimism is a passive virtue, hope an active one. It takes no courage – only a certain naivety – to be an optimist. It takes great courage to sustain hope. No Jew – knowing what we do of the past, of hatred, bloodshed, persecution in the name of God, suppression of human rights in the name of freedom – can be an optimist. But Jews have never given up hope.

<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>Where in this <i>parasha</i> do we learn that hope is central to what it means to be a Jew?
Where else in Judaism can you see this value expressed?
Can you also see hope expressed in Jewish history and the way Jews have acted throughout time?
<b>EDUCATIONAL COMPANION TO THE QUESTIONS</b>
<b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>Whatever challenges we have faced in our history, we have always refused not to see a light at the end of the tunnel. Jews have always had faith that the future will be better, because God has promised us that He will never abandon us. Even if there is reason to believe the challenges we face can be explained through our own mistakes, God always leaves the door open for return and redemption. The opportunity for <i>teshuva</i> – repentance – always exists. The covenant will never be totally broken and unrepairable. There will always be hope for a brighter future.
Hope as a dream is a superficial hope that what we wish for will be realised. But hope as the shape of history suggests that history has a destiny. The hope found in the Torah is that the destiny of history is redemption for the Jewish people and the world.
Hopes can be individual, national, or universal, and the lesson of hope from <i>Parashat Beḥukotai</i> can be applied to all of these.
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br>Gena displayed a deep hope in a brighter future by rebuilding her life immediately after her experiences in the Holocaust. She married and built a family that would contribute to the rebirth and continuity of the Jewish people in the post-Holocaust generation. Through this and her efforts to share her love of life, she demonstrated her belief in hope as “the shape of history” – that there would be a happy ending to her story, the story of the Jewish people, and the story of humanity.
On any given day, when life itself seems out to get you, when all you want to do is go back to bed and give up, remember Gena’s story. Remember how she picked up her life and went forwards, and appreciated each day as a gift.
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br><i>Covenantal time</i> is the term Rabbi Sacks gives to the unique approach of Judaism to time as “an arena of change” (something he writes about in several other places, especially in his book <i>A Letter in the Scroll</i>). Jewish time is a narrative with a beginning and a distant end, taking twists and turns and offering no guarantees of progress. However, it leads to hope because <i>covenantal time</i> is where God and man partner to make things better. As opposed to optimism, where we may believe things will get better, hope is where we believe that together we can make things better.
The alternative to hope is despair caused by the belief that history is destined to repeat itself <i>ad infinitum</i>. Judaism, in both its ritual dimension and in its philosophy, refuses to accept this position. It encourages humanity to change the world for the better, inspiring the belief that tomorrow can be better than today.
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>After listing the terrible curses that will be visited upon the Jewish people if they stray from the path of God and break their end of the covenant, the Torah states that “in spite of this, when they are in the land of their enemies, I will not cast them away, neither will I abhor them, to destroy them utterly and to break My covenant with them.” However difficult Jewish history becomes, this gives us hope that there will always be light at the end of the tunnel, because God has promised us that He will never abandon us.
This concept is inherent in the belief that one day the Messiah will come, heralding the redemption of the world, an age of universal peace and an end to suffering in the world. This belief is also found in every ethical command that requires us to make society a better place, such as every mitzva that commands us to protect the poor in society. This implies a belief that society can be improved. Hope for a brighter future is at the core of these ideas.
Persecution and suffering are recurring themes in Jewish history. But so, too, are the Jewish responses to adversity – the Jewish drive for rebuilding and continuity. Time after time, Jews would respond to an expulsion by finding another land to build and thrive in, until the next tragic chapter of Jewish history refused to leave them to live there in peace. Generation after generation of Jews showed perseverance and determination not just to survive, but to thrive as a nation. No better example of this is the establishment of the State of Israel just three years following the darkest period Jewish history has known – the Holocaust.

Bamidbar

In a Nutshell

<b><i>IN A NUTSHELL</i></b><br>The central theme of the book of Bemidbar is the second stage of the Israelites’ journey. They have travelled far from Egypt, but are still far from their future homeland. They must also evolve from slaves into a free people. This <i>parasha</i> and the next <i>parasha</i> are about the preparations for that journey. The first step is to take a census (to count the people). To inherit their land, the Israelites will have to fight battles. So the men who will form the Israelite army need to be counted up. The Levites are counted separately because it is their job to serve in the <i>Mishkan</i> (the portable Temple), and not to fight.
The layout of the camp is also described. It is to be in a square shape with the <i>Mishkan</i> in the centre. Three tribes are to set up their tents and banners on each side, while the Levites form an inner square. The order in which the tribes camp will also be the order in which they travel.
The duties of the priestly family of Kehat (Moshe, Aharon, and Miriam’s family) – are now explained. They will carry the holiest objects, the Ark, the Menora, altars, curtains, and holy vessels used in the sacrificial service, when the Israelites are on the move. They must be particularly careful with these special objects.
<b>QUESTION TO PONDER</b>
<i>Why do you think the Torah gives us so many details about life in the</i> midbar<i> (the desert)?</i>

I; Egalitarian Society, Jewish Style

<big><strong>I. Egalitarian Society, Jewish-Style</strong></big><br><b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>The <i>parasha</i> of <i>Bemidbar</i> is generally read on the Shabbat before Shavuot, when we celebrate the giving of the Torah. The Rabbis, believing that this is no coincidence, looked for a significant connection in the <i>parasha</i> to Shavuot.
Finding the link is not easy. There is nothing in the <i>parasha</i> about the giving of the Torah. Instead it is about a census of the Israelites. Nor is its setting helpful. We are told at the beginning that the events about to be described took place in “the wilderness of Sinai,” whereas when the Torah speaks about the giving of the Torah, it talks about “Mount Sinai.” The “wilderness of Sinai” is a general desert area. Mount Sinai is a specific mountain within that region.
The Sages did, nonetheless, make a connection, and it is a surprising one:
“And God spoke to Moshe in the Sinai wilderness” (Bemidbar 1:1). The Sages realised through this that the Torah was given through three things: fire, water, and wilderness. How do we know it was given through fire? From the verse in Shemot 19:18: “Mount Sinai was all in smoke as God had come down upon it in fire.” How do we know it was given through water? As it says in Shofetim 5:4, “The heavens and the clouds dripped water [at Sinai].” How do we know it was given through wilderness? [As it says above,] “And God spoke to Moshe in the Sinai wilderness.” And why was the Torah given through these three things? Just as [fire, water, and wilderness] are free to all the inhabitants of the world, so too are the words of Torah free to them, as it says in Yishayahu 55:1, “Oh, all who are thirsty, come for water...even if you have no money” (Bemidbar Rabba 1:7).
The midrash takes three words associated with Sinai – fire (that was blazing on the mountain just before the revelation), water (based on a phrase in the Song of Devora), and wilderness (as at the beginning of our <i>parasha</i>, and also in Shemot), and it explains that “they are free to all the inhabitants of the world.”
This is not the connection most of us would make. Fire is associated with heat, warmth, energy. Water is associated with quenching thirst and making things grow. Wilderness is a space between starting point and destination, the place where you need signposts and a sense of direction. All three would therefore make good metaphors for the Torah. It warms. It energises. It satisfies spiritual thirst. It gives direction. Yet that is not the approach taken by the Sages. What mattered to them is that all three elements are free. Because the Torah is for everyone!
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. What novel connection did the Rabbis find between fire, water, the desert, and the Torah?</i>
<i>2. In what way is the Torah “free for everyone”?</i>
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br><i>Pappos ben Yehuda once saw Rabbi Akiva gathering students and teaching Torah in public. Pappos said to him: Akiva, are you not afraid of the Romans who have forbidden Torah study?</i>
<i>Rabbi Akiva answered him: Let me explain with a story…. Imagine a fox walking along a riverbank when he sees fish hurriedly darting about from place to place.</i>
<i>The fox says to them: From what are you fleeing?</i>
<i>They answer: We are trying to avoid the nets that people cast to try and catch us.</i>
<i>The fox asks the fish: Why don’t you come up onto dry land, and we can live together just as our ancestors did?</i>
<i>The fish say to him: Are you really the one who they say is the cleverest of all animals? You are not clever at all – you are a fool! We may see some danger in the water, but this is our natural environment. On dry land, people will still try to catch us, but we won’t even have the water we need to live. How much more would we fear if we left the source which gives us life?</i>
<i>It is the same with us Jews. Now we sit and study Torah, about which it is written: “For that is your life, and the length of your days” (Devarim 30:20). If we fear the Romans now, imagine how much more so if we stop studying Torah, which is the source of our life!</i>
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. To what is the Torah compared in this story? Why?</i>
<i>2. Why do you think learning Torah is important?</i>
<b><i>Berakhot</i> 61b</b>
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>The Torah and the desert have several similarities. The desert is a place of silence where you can hear the voice of God. The desert is a place away from the distractions of towns and cities, fields and farms, where you can focus on the presence of God. The desert is a place where you realise how vulnerable you are: you feel like sheep in need of a shepherd. The desert is a place where it is easy to get lost, and you need some kind of Google-Maps-of-the-soul. The desert is a place where you feel your isolation and reach out to a force beyond you. Even the Hebrew name for desert, <i>midbar</i>, comes from the same root as “word” (<i>davar</i>) and “to speak” (<i>d-b-r</i>). Yet these were not the connections the Sages of the Midrash made. Why not?
The Sages understood that something profound was born at Mount Sinai, something which has distinguished Jewish life ever since. It was <i>the democratisation of knowledge</i>. Literacy and knowledge of the law was no longer to be confined to a priestly elite. For the first time in history everyone was to have access to knowledge, education, and literacy. “The law that Moshe gave us is the possession of the assembly of Yaakov” (Devarim 33:4) – the whole assembly, not a privileged group within it.
The symbol of this was the revelation at Mount Sinai, the only time in history when God revealed Himself not just to a prophet but to an entire people. In the penultimate command that Moshe gave to the people, known as <i>Hak’hel</i>, where at the end of every seven years, during the Festival of Sukkot, the Torah is read before all the people – men, women, and children, and the foreigners residing in the towns.
There is an echo of this in the famous verse from Yeshaya 54:13, “And <i>all</i> your children shall be learned of the Lord and great shall be the peace of your children.” This was and remains the unique feature of the Torah as the written constitution of the Jewish people as a nation under the sovereignty of God. Everyone is expected not merely to keep the law but to know it. Jews became a nation of constitutional lawyers.
There were two further key moments in the history of this development. The first was when Ezra and Neḥemya gathered the people, after the Babylonian exile, to the Water Gate in Jerusalem, on Rosh HaShana, and read the Torah to them, placing Levites throughout the crowd to explain to people what was being said and what it meant, a defining moment in Jewish history that took the form not of a battle but of a massive adult education programme (Neḥemya 8). Ezra and Neḥemya realised that the most significant battles in ensuring the Jewish future were cultural, not military. This was one of the most transformative insights in history.
The second was the extraordinary creation, in the first century, of the world’s first system of universal compulsory education. Here is how the Talmud describes the process, culminating in the work of Yehoshua ben Gamla, a high priest in the last days of the Second Temple:
“Truly the name of that man is to be blessed, namely Yehoshua ben Gamla, for but for him the Torah would have been forgotten from Israel. For at first, if a child had a father, his father taught him, and if he had no father he did not learn at all…. They therefore ordained that teachers should be appointed in each district, and that boys should enter school at the age of sixteen or seventeen. [They did so] but if the teacher punished them, they used to rebel and leave the school. Eventually, Yehoshua ben Gamla came and ordained that teachers of young children should be appointed in each district and each town, and that children should enter school at the age of six or seven” (Bava Batra 21a).
Universal compulsory education did not exist in England – at that time the world’s leading imperial power – until 1870, a difference of eighteen centuries. At roughly the same time as Yehoshua ben Gamla, in the first century CE, Josephus could write:
Should any one of our nation be asked about our laws, they will repeat them as readily as their own name. The result of our thorough education in our laws from the very dawn of intelligence is that they are, as it were, engraved on our souls.
We now understand the connection the Sages made between the wilderness and the giving of the Torah: it was open to everyone, and it was free. Neither lack of money nor of aristocratic birth could stop you from learning Torah and acquiring distinction in a community in which scholarship was considered the highest achievement.
As Rambam says, “The crown of Torah is for all of Israel. Whoever desires it, let them come and take it.”
<b>I believe that this is one of Judaism’s most profound ideas: Whatever you seek to create in the world, starts with education. If you want to create a just and compassionate society, start with education. If you want to create a society of equal dignity, ensure that education is free and equally available to all.</b> That is the message the Sages took from the fact that we read <i>Parashat Bemidbar</i> before Shavuot. This is the festival when we celebrate that when God gave our ancestors the Torah, He gave it to all of them equally.
<b>QUESTION TO PONDER</b>
<i>Why is free education a critical component of a free and equal society?</i>
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>The words of the Torah span a thousand years, from Moshe to Malakhi, the first and last of the prophets. For another thousand years, until the completion of the Babylonian Talmud, Jews added commentaries to the Book, and for yet another thousand years they wrote commentaries to the commentaries. Never has there been a deeper relationship between a people and a book. The ancient Greeks, puzzled by the phenomenon of an entire people dedicated to learning, called Jews “a nation of philosophers.” Certainly we are called on to be a nation of students and teachers. In Judaism we not only learn to live; we live to learn. In study, we make Torah real in the mind so that we can make it actual in the world.
<b>Ten Paths to God <i>– Study: Listening to God,</i> 3</b>
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>Why was the Torah given to the people in the wilderness?
Why is it important to note that the revelation on Mount Sinai was experienced by the entire people?
Why do you think Jewish society instituted universal education so many generations before the rest of the world?
<b>EDUCATIONAL COMPANION TO THE QUESTIONS</b>
<b><i>IN A NUTSHELL</i></b><br>While one might think that life in the desert is not relevant to us in the twenty-first century, there are many lessons to be learned from both
the structure of life, and the stories that happened to the people during this time. These lessons are timeless and relevant to every generation. They are expressions of Torah values that our lives today must also be based on. The concept of the Torah as an educational text connects to the theme of this <i>Covenant &amp; Conversation</i> essay, which is the importance of education as a value.
<b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>These are the basic elements of life. The Torah is equally elemental to our existence, and without it we would not be able to exist. However, the Rabbis focused instead on the free and totally accessible nature of these elements. Fire, water, and the wilderness are accessible to all humans, or they should be. And this is how the Torah should be too – equally accessible to everyone. Not just the rich, or the intelligent, or those with power and status. But rather everyone should be able to learn and benefit from Torah study.
The Torah is free for everyone because it is not reserved just for those who are in power, or those who can afford to go to expensive academies or hire personal teachers, and it is not just for the intelligentsia. Judaism believes that all Jews should have equal access to Torah study, and it was the first civilisation to institute universal education, many centuries before the West.
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br>The Torah is compared here to water, which is the life-giving environment that fish are dependent on for their survival. We often find water utilised as a metaphor for the Torah. In Rabbi Akiva’s story, the fish need to be in the water in order to live. They will die if they are removed from this environment. The message is that a Jewish people without Torah cannot survive and thrive. It is a fundamental element necessary for Jewish life to exist.
This can be approached on a metaphysical level: learning Torah has a spiritual impact on Jews and on the world, and without Torah study, the world could not exist. Or it could be approached on a more rational level: If we are not committed to Torah study, our Jewish identities will weaken and the transmission of our heritage will be threatened. Jewish survival can only be guaranteed if we educate ourselves and future generations.
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>If education is inaccessible to some parts of society, for example, where only the wealthy can afford to send their children to school, or a society excludes women from educational opportunities, then there will be social inequality. When there are sectors of society who are less educated, they will have fewer opportunities, less potential for economic development, etc. This is why most modern societies have universal education, which means the state provides free education for all its members. Jewish civilisation instituted universal education for all children in the first century, eighteen centuries before England (the first to do so in the West), which did this in 1870.
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>There have been many answers given to this question, including: to convey the message that a world without Torah is a <i>midbar</i>, a barren wasteland; the desert is a place that is empty and to accept the Torah we must deny our own needs and agenda and embrace humility; the Israelites were in the right state of mind to accept God’s word because they were dependent on His protection and guidance there. But the Talmud quoted here focuses instead on the free and freely accessible nature of the wilderness. So too must the Torah be freely accessible to all Jews.
Other religions are founded on the belief that revelation took place through an individual prophet. Adherents of these religions must have faith in these prophets to follow the word of God as articulated through this individual. However, Judaism believes that God revealed His word to the entire people. This democratises knowledge and power. Ultimately it paves the way for the creation of a society based on the equality of all people.
Equality of all people was a central core value of Judaism from its inception. All people are created equal, in the image of God. This principle is clear from Judaism’s focus on universal education. Other societies took generations to arrive at this value and understand that universal education is a basic human right and should be a priority of the state. Judaism was founded on this value.

II; Leading a Nation of Individuals

<big><strong>II. Leading a Nation of Individuals</strong></big><br><b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br><i>Bemidbar</i> begins with a census (a counting) of the Israelites. That is why this book is known in English as “Numbers.” Our question is: Since this is the Jewish people’s third census within the space of a single year, why was it important to do this again? Is this census special?
The answer lies in the phrase the Torah uses to describe the act of counting: “<i>se’u</i> <i>et</i> <i>rosh</i>,” literally, to “lift the head.” This is a strange, indirect expression. Biblical Hebrew contains many verbs meaning “to count”: <i>limnot</i>, <i>lifkod</i>, <i>lispor</i>, <i>laḥshov</i>. Why does the Torah not use one of these words, choosing instead the roundabout expression, “lift the heads” of the people?
In any census, headcount, or roll call, there is a tendency to focus on the total: the crowd, the multitude, the mass. The larger the total, the stronger the army, the greater the fan base, and the more successful the company.
Counting a group devalues the individual, and tends to make him or her replaceable. If one soldier dies in battle, another will take his place. If one person leaves the organisation, someone else can be hired to do his or her job.
There is therefore a danger, when counting a nation, that each individual will feel insignificant. “What am I? What difference can I make? I am only one of millions, a mere wave in the ocean, a grain of sand on the seashore, dust on the surface of infinity.” So God tells Moshe to “lift people’s heads” and to show them that they each count; they all matter as individuals. To lift someone’s head means to show them favour, to recognise them. If a census is taken in this way, it is a gesture of love. This census, and the language used to describe it, sends the clear message that in Judaism we believe that each individual matters.
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. We often count people (for example, a national census, a crowd at an event, or even the size of our families). Why do you think this is?</i>
<i>2. How might counting people devalue individuals in a group? Can you think of when this is done on purpose?</i>
<i>3. What is the message of the language “</i>se’u et rosh<i>” used in this census?</i>
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br><i>Every year at Israel’s official state Independence Day celebrations on Mount Herzl, twelve individuals are granted the honour of lighting a torch, one for each of the twelve tribes of the Jewish people. During the celebrations for Israel’s seventy-first birthday, a very special woman was honoured. Here is her story:</i>
<i>Marie Nahmias, affectionately called Mamo (“mother” in Tunisian- accented French) by all who know her, spent her youth hiding from Nazis during the German occupation of Tunisia. She was then forced to flee from Arab pogroms against the Jews of Tunisia, and so she arrived in Israel as a young woman with no money or prospects. She lived a life of poverty in those early years, forced to reside in</i> maabarot<i> (tented camps), as the government desperately tried to develop enough housing to meet the needs of the hundreds of thousands of Jewish refugees who were arriving. She settled in the northern town of Afula, married and raised eight children there, and struggled to make ends meet.</i>
<i>Then tragedy struck and her son Shaul was badly wounded whilst serving in the Yom Kippur War in 1973. As he lay in hospital for the weeks and months that followed the war, she vowed that if God healed her son, she would be willing to do any mitzva or mission given to her. God heard her prayer and her son recovered.</i>
<i>Shaul became a social worker for the municipality, and one day he called her and said he had a little disabled girl who needed a home. She didn’t hesitate, and this young girl became the first of fifty-two foster children who were raised in her house. The children she cared for often had special difficulties, illnesses, and physical limitations. At first they came from the Afula social services department. Some were Jewish, some were Arab. Soon, news of her kindness and love spread, and children began arriving at her doorstep from around the country, and sometimes even from beyond Israel’s borders. As her fame grew, it became known everywhere that she was willing to take in and raise any child, because she believed in her heart that every person was made in the image of God, no matter where they came from or what difficulties they had in life.</i>
<i>As the dignified ninety-three-year-old lit the torch that chilly May evening in front of the eyes of the nation, the host of the ceremony broke with protocol and asked Mamo to bless the nation. Again she did not hesitate: “May Israel be blessed, from all my heart, God will hear me, Israel will rise ever upwards, that we grow, that our soldiers don’t fall anymore – that the Jews and the Arabs and the Christians and the Druze will all become one single hand. We are all created by God, may He give us peace.” Before she had even finished saying these words, the crowd, led by the prime minister and his wife, rose to their feet in a standing ovation, cheering her words and her message.</i>
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. How does the life of Mamo embody the value of the message of this </i>Covenant &amp; Conversation<i> essay?</i>
<i>2. Do you think the struggles Mamo faced in her life were more or less likely to encourage her to live the life she did?</i>
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>Crowds tend to have the effect of making the individual lose his or her independent judgement and instead simply follow what others are doing. We call this “herd behaviour,” and it sometimes leads to collective madness. Gustav Le Bon’s <i>The Crowd: A Study of the Popular Mind</i> (1895) showed how crowds exercise a “magnetic influence” that transmutes the behaviour of individuals into a collective “group mind.” As he put it, “An individual in a crowd is a grain of sand amid other grains of sand, which the wind stirs up at will.” People in a crowd become anonymous. Their conscience is silenced. They also lose a sense of personal responsibility. Large gathered groups are peculiarly prone to regressive behaviour, primitive reactions, and instinctual actions. Crowds are easily led by exploiters and manipulators, who may play on people’s fears and sense of victimhood, and incite them to hate and attack other groups.
Judaism never allows us to lose our individuality in the mass. We believe that every human being is in the image and likeness of God. The Sages taught us that every life is like an entire universe. Rambam says that each of us should see ourselves as if our next act could change the fate of the world. Every dissenting view is carefully recorded in the Mishna, even if the law is otherwise. Every verse of the Torah is capable, said the Sages, of seventy interpretations. No voice, no view, is silenced.
There is a wonderful blessing mentioned in the Talmud to be said on seeing 600,000 Israelites together in one place. It is: “Blessed are You, Lord…who discerns secrets.” The Talmud explains that every person is different. We each have different attributes. We all think our own thoughts. Only God can enter the minds of each of us and know what we are thinking, and this is what the blessing refers to. In other words, even in a massive crowd where, to human eyes, faces blur into a mass, God still relates to us as individuals, not as members of a crowd.
Therefore, in Judaism, taking a census must always be done in such a way as to signal that we are valued as individuals. We each have unique gifts. There is a contribution only I can bring. God tells Moshe to lift people’s heads by showing that they each count; they matter as individuals.
All this has implications for Jewish leadership. The Jewish people always was very small, and yet it has achieved great things. A Jewish leader must respect individuals. He or she must “lift their heads.” However small or large the group you lead, you must always communicate the value you place on everyone. You must never attempt to sway a crowd by appealing to the primitive emotions of fear or hate. You must never ride roughshod over the opinions of others. It is hard to lead a nation of individuals, but this is the most challenging, empowering, inspiring leadership of all.
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>God, the creator of humanity, having made a covenant with all humanity, then turns to one people and commands them to be different, in order to teach humanity <i>the dignity of difference</i>. Biblical monotheism is not the idea that there is one God and therefore one truth, one faith, one way of life. To the contrary, it is the idea that unity of God is to be found in diversity. That is the miracle of creation. What is real, remarkable, and the proper object of our wonder is not the quintessential leaf but the 250,000 different kinds of leaves; not the archetypal bird but the 9,000 species that exist today; not one metalanguage that embraces all others, but the 6,000 languages still spoken throughout the world…
Judaism is about the miracle of unity that celebrates diversity.

<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>What positive and negative messages could be inherent in the act of counting people?
Where in Judaism can you see the value of the importance and dignity of the individual?
Is there a danger in focusing only on the value of the individual?
<b>EDUCATIONAL COMPANION TO THE QUESTIONS</b>
<b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>We count what we value. A collector will count their prize collection, an athlete will count their medals, a high achiever will list their awards, and a businessperson, or a cautious saver, will count their money. There are also other reasons to count masses of people. For example, a government or local authority must know how many citizens it has to provide services for, and this is the purpose of a national census. Another example would be counting a crowd at an event as a measure of success, significance, or popularity.
When we count a crowd of people and arrive at a total number, we devalue the significance and value of each individual. Each individual person becomes just a number, which can be interpreted to mean they are easily replaceable. In an army, a soldier’s military number makes an important statement – the soldier must suppress their own personal needs and ambitions for the good of the larger collective – in this case the army. They must follow orders without questioning, and be subordinate to their superiors. This idea was taken to an evil extreme during the Holocaust, when concentration camp inmates had numbers tattooed on their arm in order to dehumanise them and rob them of their human dignity.
The Hebrew phrase “<i>se’u et rosh”</i> means literally “lift the head,” and this was the way God commanded Moshe to count the Israelites. It implies that each member of the nation had a head, a personality, a reality, and an existence. The term to <i>lift</i> the head implies the maintaining of human dignity, rather than reducing each person to a mere number, which would have the opposite effect.
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br>Mamo saw the unique value and significance of every person, whether Jew or non-Jew, able-bodied or disabled. When she saw a human being, she saw within them their soul, created in the image of God, and therefore she treated each person with respect and dignity.
We might imagine that a person who lived a difficult life, facing much suffering at the hands of others, would find it harder to show compassion and be less likely to treat strangers with dignity and compassion. But perhaps because she suffered, she realised how important it is to live her life in this way.
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>“The dignity of difference,” a core idea in the thought of Rabbi Sacks, suggests that diversity among human beings should be celebrated, not feared. It is our differences that can bring us together, because no two people are exactly the same, but there are core similarities between all humans. This is how unity can celebrate diversity. The things that make us the same should be acknowledged and the things that make us different should be appreciated. This is the message of the census in this <i>parasha</i>. Each individual has unique worth and therefore should be afforded dignity and respect.
The national mission of the Jewish people is to model the core values of the Torah, one of which is “the dignity of difference.” An example of this is the mitzva to protect the weak in society. The Jewish people have always been “the other,” the outsider in society, and in the family of nations. The Jewish people in their “otherness” challenges the world to understand the message of “the dignity of difference.”
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>Counting a crowd of people, arriving at a total number, may devalue the significance and value of each individual. Each person becomes a mere number, which can be interpreted to mean they are easily replaceable. However, the act of counting can also have the opposite message – we count those things we value. When God uses the Hebrew phrase “<i>se’u et rosh</i>,” which literally means “lift the head,” the message is that each member of the nation has unique significance and worth.
The most important source for this concept is Bereshit 1:27, where humanity is described as being created in the image of God. No matter the race, skin colour, faith, or appearance, every human being has a divine spark in them that demands we treat them with respect and protect their dignity. Many of the ethical commands in Judaism have this value at their core also, such as <i>tzedaka</i> which is designed to redress injustice in society, reinstating the dignity of the individual.
There is a difference between individuality and individualism. Individuality means that I am a unique and valued member of a team. Individualism means that I am not a team player at all. I am interested in myself alone, not the group. Judaism values individuality, not individualism.

Nasso

In a Nutshell

<b><i>IN A NUTSHELL</i></b><br>In <i>Naso</i> we continue the last <i>parasha</i>’s description of the preparations the Israelites made for their journey from Sinai to the Holy Land.
<i>Naso</i> discusses many different topics which at first seem unconnected. These include the roles of two of the families from the tribe of Levi – Gershon and Merari; the census (counting) of the Levites as a group; rules about the purity of the camp; the laws of the Nazirite (who chooses to live an especially holy lifestyle, avoiding things like haircuts and drinking wine); and the priestly blessing, which the <i>kohanim</i> still use to bless us today. This is the same blessing parents use to bless their children every Friday night and on festivals.
The <i>parasha</i> ends with a long description of the offerings brought by each of the tribes at the dedication of the <i>Mishkan</i> (the portable Temple).
<b>QUESTION TO PONDER</b>
<i>Why do you think there is a custom for parents to bless their children every Friday night?</i>

I; The Ethic of Love

<big><strong>I. The Ethic of Love</strong></big><br><b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>In this <i>parasha,</i> God teaches the priests how to bless the people of Israel on His behalf. This is the blessing they learn:
<i>“May the Lord bless you and protect you.</i>
<i>“May the Lord make His face shine upon you and be gracious to you.</i>
<i>“May the Lord turn His face towards you and grant you peace”</i> (Bemidbar 6:24–26).
These are among the oldest continuously used words of blessing ever. We have never lost this tradition, from the day the priests were given these words, until today. We recite them every day at the beginning of the morning service. Some say them last thing at night. They are the words used to bless Jewish children each Friday night. They are often used to bless the bride and groom at weddings. They are widely used by non-Jews also.
The simplicity of the words, their increasing three-word, five-word, seven-word structure, their movement from protection to grace to peace, all make them a miniature gem of prayer whose power has not faded in the more than three thousand years since they were first spoken.
There is another special quality about this blessing that we should note: Before the priests use these words to bless the people, they make a <i>berakha</i> first where they specify that God has “commanded us to bless His people <i>with love</i>.” No other blessing over a command specifies that it be done with love.
When you bless someone, you demonstrate that you wish the best for them – this is what loving them means. When the priests bless the people, they show them what love of one’s fellow looks like. That is why the <i>berakha</i> they make before they bless the people mentions love, because love is how blessings enter the world. The <i>kohanim</i> are modelling this for the people, so the people will understand how to bring blessings into the world themselves – by caring for others.
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. Why do you think we use these same words of blessing at so many different times?</i>
<i>2. How does love lead us to give blessings?</i>
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br><i>On the eve of Yom Kippur in 1945, after the Second World War had ended, fifteen-year-old Edith Cohen was living in a crowded Displaced Persons camp called Feldafing. She had survived the nightmare of Auschwitz, but her parents and four siblings had perished. Despite her weakened state, the prospect of fasting that Yom Kippur did not faze her. She had gone hungry many times before. But the emotional pain of having no parents to give her the traditional blessing before Yom Kippur was unbearable.</i>
<i>Rabbi Yekutiel Halberstam, the Klausenberger Rebbe from the Sanz dynasty, was also a resident of the displacement camp, but his wife and eleven children had not survived. The Rebbe had been working tirelessly to help the other residents in the camp learn to embrace life once more. On the eve of Yom Kippur though, he was taking some time to meditate and study Torah in isolation, when he was interrupted by a gentle knock at the door. There stood young Edith with tears in her eyes. “My parents died in the camps. I have no one to bless me,” she pleaded. Without hesitation, and with pure love in his eyes, he raised his hands over her head, and blessed her with the words of the ancient priestly blessing.</i>
<i>Soon there was another knock, and a second orphaned girl was asking, “Please bless me, Rebbe.” Again, he lovingly obliged. Then another knock, and another. Soon a long queue of several dozen girls formed, each one waiting patiently to receive a blessing of love from the Rebbe until it was time for Kol Nidrei to begin. The Klausenberger Rebbe missed out on his private pre-Yom Kippur meditation, but from that day forwards he acted as a parent for all the orphans of the camp.</i>
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. What do you think parents feel in their hearts when they give their children this blessing?</i>
<i>2. Do you think the Rebbe felt the same for these children?</i>
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>One obvious question here is: Why was the family of priests chosen to give this special blessing, with love, to the children of Israel? Why not prophets, kings, sages, or saints? And why were human beings asked to bless the people at all? It is God who blesses humanity and His people Israel. He needs no human intermediary. Our passage says just this: “Let them put My name on the Israelites, and <i>I</i> will bless them.” The blessings come not from the priests but from God Himself. So why require the priests to “put His name” on the people?
The <i>Sefer HaḤinnukh</i> answers this question by explaining that the priests were the sacred group within the people. They ministered in the House of God. They spent their lives in divine service. Their life’s work was sacred. So was their habitat. They were the guardians of holiness. They were therefore the obvious choice for the sacred rite of bringing down God’s blessings upon the people.
A second question we might ask is: Why is there such an unusual <i>Birkat HaMitzva</i> (the <i>berakha</i> made by the priests before they bless the people)? “Blessed are You, our God, King of the world, who has sanctified us with the sanctity of Aharon and commanded us to bless His people with love.” No other blessing over a command specifies that it be done with love. There are two different interpretations: perhaps the priests must feel this love when they bless the people, or perhaps the reference is to God and <i>His</i> love for <i>benei Yisrael</i>.
This second interpretation reverses the word order of the blessing and reads it not as “who commanded us to bless His people with love,” but rather, “who in love commanded us to bless His people.” In this case, the blessing speaks of God’s love, not that of the priests. Because God loves His people, He commands the priests to bless them.
The first reading is grammatically more plausible. It states that it is the priests who must love. This is the basis of the statement in the Zohar that “a priest who does not love the people, or a priest who is not loved by the people, may not bless.” We can only bless what we love. Remember how Yitzḥak, when he was elderly and blind, said to Esav, “Prepare me the tasty food that I love and bring it to me to eat, so that I may give you my blessing before I die” (Bereshit 27:4). Whether it was the food that Yitzḥak loved, or what it represented about Esav’s character – that he cared enough for his father to find him the food he liked – Yitzḥak needed the presence of love to be able to make the blessing.
Why then does the blessing for this mitzva and no other specify that it must be done with love? Because in every other case it is the agent who performs the <i>maase mitzva</i>, the act that constitutes the command. Uniquely in the case of the priestly blessings, the priest is merely a <i>makhshir mitzva</i> – an enabler, not a doer. The doer is God Himself: “Let them place My name on the children of Israel and I will bless them.” The <i>kohanim</i> are merely channels through which God’s blessings flow.
This means that they must be selfless while uttering the blessings. We must let God into the world and into our hearts to the degree that we forget ourselves and focus on others. That is what love is. We see this in the passage in which Yaakov, having fallen in love with Raḥel, agrees to Lavan’s terms: seven years of work. We read: “So Yaakov served seven years to get Raḥel, but they seemed like only a few days to him because of his love for her” (Bereshit 29:20). The commentators ask the obvious question: Precisely because he was so much in love, wouldn’t the seven years have felt like a century? The answer is equally obvious: He was thinking of her, not himself. There was nothing selfish in his love. He was focused on her presence, not his impatient desire.
There is, though, perhaps an alternative explanation for all these things. As I explained previously in the <i>Covenant and Conversation</i> essay for <i>Kedoshim</i>, it was the priests who taught the people the specific ethic of holiness.
The key text of the holiness ethic is Vayikra 19: “Be holy for I, the Lord your God, am holy.” It is this chapter that teaches the two great commands of interpersonal love, of the neighbour and the stranger. <i>The ethic of holiness, taught by the priests, is the ethic of love</i>.
That ethic is the result of the special vision of the priest, set out in Bereshit 1, which sees the world as God’s work and the human person as God’s image. Our very existence, and the existence of the universe, are the result of God’s love.
The prophetic and wisdom voices are based on other things – the prophets on Jewish history, especially the Exodus, and wisdom on observation of the way the world works.
By blessing the people, the priests showed them what love of one’s fellow is. Here is Rambam’s definition of what it is to fulfil the command of “You shall love your neighbour as yourself”: “<i>One should speak in praise of his neighbour, and be considerate of his money, even as he is considerate of his own money, or desires to preserve his own honour</i>.” Blessing the people showed that you sought their good – and seeking their good is what loving them means.
Thus the <i>kohanim</i> set an example for the people by this public display of love – or what we would call today “the common good.” They thus encouraged a society in which each sought the welfare of all – and such a society is blessed, because the bonds between its members are strong, and because people put the interests of the nation as a whole before their own private advantage. Such a society is blessed by God, whereas a selfish society is not, and cannot, be blessed by God. No selfish society has survived for long.
Hence our answers to the questions: Why the <i>kohanim</i>? Because their ethic emphasised love – of neighbour and stranger – and we need love before we can bless. Hence the mention of love in the blessing over the commandment, because love is how blessings enter the world. And why have human beings bless, and not God directly? Because the <i>kohanim</i> were to be role models of what it is for humans to care for the welfare of others. <b>I believe that <i>Birkat Kohanim</i> contains a vital message for us today: A society whose members seek one another’s welfare is holy, and blessed.</b>
<b>QUESTION TO PONDER</b>
<i>Why did God choose the</i> kohanim<i> to be the ones to deliver His blessing to the people?</i>
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>What was new and remarkable in the Hebrew Bible was the idea that love, not just reciprocity, is the driving principle of the moral life. Three loves. “Love the Lord your God with all your heart, all your soul, and all your might,” “Love your neighbour as yourself,” and, repeated no less than thirty-six times in the Mosaic books, “Love the stranger because you know what it feels like to be a stranger.” Just as God created the natural world in love and forgiveness, so we are charged with creating the social world in love and forgiveness. That love is a flame lit in marriage and the family. Morality is the love between husband and wife, parent and child, extended outward to the world.
<b><i>Morality,</i> 72–73</b>
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>What do you think is the power contained in the ancient words of this priestly blessing?
Why do the priests have to love in order to deliver the priestly blessing in God’s name?
Can you see this value of caring about the welfare of others in society today? Where do you see it?
<b>EDUCATIONAL COMPANION TO THE QUESTIONS</b>
<b><i>IN A NUTSHELL</i></b><br>Shabbat begins each week as the sun sets on Friday, and this has always been the time when Jewish families can pause, breathe, catch up, and be together after a busy week. At this time, the children specifically, and the family unit in general, become the focus (rather than during the rest of the week, when there are many other competing distractions such as work, school, and leisurely pursuits). As we explore in this essay, the act of blessing others is an expression of love. Parents give this blessing to their children on Friday nights as they refocus their attention on the children and their love for them.
<b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>These beautiful words ask for God to protect us, show us grace, and to also grant the ultimate gift – peace. They express the wish for goodness to a depth rarely seen in any other place. Therefore, they are deeply appropriate words to use in all the instances mentioned (such as wedding days, Friday nights, <i>ḥagim</i>, or even in the regular daily worship of God).
If we love another person, we wish the best for them. This leads us to care for them, and also to bless them, in the hope that God will also care for them.
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br>Love. But this could also be the opportunity to guide a conversation that helps the reader understand the ultimate message of this essay – that the <i>Birkat HaMitzva</i> (the blessing for the mitzva) mentions love, because love is central to the concept of giving a blessing, and the <i>kohanim</i> are our role models in this when they bless us.
The story describes a pious hasidic Rebbe who had just lost his entire world, and yet found love in his heart for the orphans he had never met before. Knowing more about his life (see “Between Hope and Humanity” [<i>Shemini</i>], <i>It Once Happened</i>, 36) it is obvious to us that he was a man of overflowing love for his fellow Jews and for all of humankind, and a worthy role model for us all.
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>It was the priests who taught the people the specific ethic of holiness. The key text of the holiness ethic is Vayikra 19: “Be holy for I, the Lord your God, am holy.” It is this chapter that teaches the two great commands of interpersonal love, of the neighbour and the stranger. The ethic of holiness, taught by the priests, is the ethic of love.
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>These are ancient words, used as a blessing for thousands of years. There was tremendous excitement in 1979 when silver amulets, 2,800 years old, engraved with the priestly blessing in the exact same words as the Torah text, were found in Jerusalem by a thirteen-year-old volunteer archaeological digger, demonstrating the importance of these words throughout Jewish history. But the words themselves are also particularly powerful, calling for God to give the people protection, grace, and peace.
The essential ingredient of a blessing is love. If the blessing is authentic, then it will come from a place of love, so the <i>kohanim</i> were commanded to give the blessing on God’s behalf through love, thereby modelling this for us. By blessing the people, the priests showed them what love of one’s fellow looks like. Blessing the people showed that you sought their good – and seeking their good is what loving them means.
We can find examples of this in all areas of society, despite the parallel existence of selfish and destructive behaviour also. In Rabbi Sacks’s last book, <i>Morality</i>, he calls for society to go from being “I” centred (where people only worry about their own needs, something that has happened more and more in recent generations) to being “We” centred. We see examples of care and concern for others during challenging times, for example during the Covid-19 crisis, and this is a silver lining of this difficult time.

II; Sages and Saints

<big><strong>II. Sages and Saints</strong></big><br><b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br><i>Parashat Naso</i> contains the law of the <i>nazir</i> – the individual who undertakes the special rules of holiness and abstinence: not to drink alcohol (or anything made from grapes), not to have their hair cut, and to avoid contact with the dead (Bemidbar 6:1–21). Living as a <i>nazir</i> was usually undertaken for a limited time period; the standard length was thirty days.
What the Torah does not make clear, though, is firstly, why a person might wish to undertake this form of abstinence, and secondly, whether it considers this choice to be commendable, or merely permissible. On the one hand the Torah calls the <i>nazir</i> “holy to God” (Bemidbar 6:8). On the other, it requires him, at the end of the period of his vow, to bring a sin offering (Bemidbar 6:13–14).
The rabbis of future generations would disagree on these questions. According to R. Elazar, and later to Ramban, the <i>nazir</i> is praiseworthy. He has voluntarily undertaken a higher level of holiness. The <i>nazir</i>, like the prophet, is a person especially close to God. The reason he had to bring a sin offering was that he was now returning to ordinary life. His sin was when he stopped being a <i>nazir</i>.
R. Eliezer HaKappar and Shmuel held the opposite opinion. For them the sin was in becoming a <i>nazir</i> in the first place, because the <i>nazir</i> denied himself some of the pleasures of the world God created and declared good. R. Eliezer added: “From this we may infer that if one who denies himself the enjoyment of wine is called a sinner, all the more so one who denies himself the enjoyment of other pleasures of life.”
The contradiction is this: Judaism strongly believes that God can be found in the physical world that He created. We are humans, earthly beings, but we can elevate our physical lives through the Torah laws. For instance, we can drink wine, but we do so with a special blessing, and to sanctify holy occasions. Judaism believes not in refusing pleasure but in sanctifying it. But the holy <i>nazir</i> is careful to avoid indulging in the physical pleasures of this world.
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. Why do you think a person might wish to voluntarily abstain from these things and become a </i>nazir?
<i>2. Do you connect more with the position of R. Elazar and Ramban or the opinion of R. Eliezer HaKappar and Shmuel?</i>
<i>3. Do you see any Jews today living a life similar to or inspired by that of the nazir?</i>
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br>Rambam lived a life of contrasts. We know from his writings that he longed for solitude, and there were years when he worked day and night to write his <i>Commentary on the Mishna</i>, and later the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>. But he also recognised his responsibilities to his family and to the community, and worked as a physician. His medical advice was in great demand. In his famous letter to the translator Ibn Tibbon, he gives an account of his typical day and week. Here is an excerpt:
<i>I live in Fostat and the sultan lives in Cairo; these two places are about one and a half miles from each other. My duties to the sultan are very heavy. I am obliged to visit him every day, early in the morning; and when he or any of his children, or members of the royal household, are ill, I dare not leave Cairo, but must stay for most of the day in the palace. It also frequently happens that one or two of the royal officers fall sick, and I must see to their healing. So I generally arrive in Cairo very early in the day, and even if nothing unusual happens I do not return to Fostat until the afternoon. Then I am almost faint with hunger. I find the waiting room filled with people, both Jews and Gentiles, nobles and common people, friends and strangers</i> – <i>a mixed mass, waiting for me.</i>
<i>I dismount from my animal, wash my hands, enter, and ask my patients to bear with me while I briefly eat, the only meal I take in twenty-four hours. Then I see to my patients and write prescriptions for their various illnesses. Patients go in and out until nightfall, and sometimes even until two hours and more in the night. I talk to them while lying down from sheer fatigue, and when night falls, I am so exhausted that I can hardly speak.</i>
<i>Because of this no Israelite can have any private interview with me, except on Shabbat. Then the whole congregation visits me after the morning service. We study together a little until noon, and then they leave. Some of them return, and read with me after the afternoon service until evening prayers.</i>
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. Why do you think Rambam longed for solitude? Why do you think he compromised on his dream?</i>
<i>2. In</i> Thinking More Deeply<i> below we see that Rambam had both a positive and negative view of the nazir. Can you see these reflected in his lifestyle?</i>
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>In the same book, his law code, the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, Rambam seems to take both a positive and negative approach to the <i>nazir</i>. In the <i>Hilkhot Deot</i> section, he adopts the negative position of R. Eliezer HaKappar: “A person may say: ‘Desire, honour, and the like are bad paths to follow and remove a person from the world; therefore I will completely separate myself from them and go to the other extreme.’ As a result, he does not eat meat or drink wine or take a wife or live in a decent house or wear decent clothing…. This too is bad, and it is forbidden to choose this way.”
Yet in <i>Hilkhot Nezirut</i>, Rambam rules in accordance with the positive evaluation of R. Elazar: “Whoever vows to God [to become a Nazirite] by way of holiness, does well and is praiseworthy…. Indeed Scripture considers him the equal of a prophet.”
How does any writer come to adopt contradictory positions in a single book, let alone one as resolutely logical as Rambam? The answer lies in a remarkable insight of Rambam into the nature of the moral life as understood by Judaism. What he saw is that there is not a single model of the virtuous life. He identifies two, calling them respectively the way of the saint (<i>ḥasid</i>) and the way of the sage (<i>ḥakham</i>).
The saint is a person of extremes. Rambam defines <i>ḥesed</i> as extreme behaviour – good behaviour, to be sure, but conduct in excess of what strict justice requires. So, for example, “If one avoids haughtiness to the utmost extent and becomes exceedingly humble, he is termed a saint (<i>ḥasid</i>).”
The sage is a different kind of person altogether. He or she follows the “golden mean,” the “middle way,” the way of moderation and balance. He or she avoids the extremes of cowardice on the one hand, recklessness on the other, and thus acquires the virtue of courage. He or she avoids miserliness in one direction, and excessive spending in the other, and instead chooses the middle way of generosity. The sage knows the twin dangers of too much and too little, excess and deficiency. He or she weighs the conflicting pressures and avoids the extremes.
These are not just two types of people but two ways of understanding the moral life itself. Is the aim of the moral life to achieve personal perfection? Or is it to create gracious relationships and a decent, just, compassionate society? The intuitive answer of most people would be to say: both. What makes Rambam so acute a thinker is that he realises that you cannot have both – that they are in fact different enterprises.
A saint may give all his money away to the poor. But what about the members of the saint’s own family? They may suffer because of his extreme self-denial. A saint may refuse to fight in battle. But what about the saint’s country and its defence? A saint may forgive all crimes committed against him. But what then about the rule of law, and justice? Saints are supremely virtuous people, considered as individuals. Yet you cannot build a society out of saints alone. Indeed, saints are not really interested in society. They have chosen a different, lonely, self-segregating path.
It was this deep insight that led Rambam to his seemingly contradictory evaluations of the <i>nazir</i>. The <i>nazir</i> has chosen, at least for a period, to adopt a life of extreme self-denial. Much like a saint, a <i>ḥasid</i>, they have adopted the path of personal perfection. That is noble, commendable, and exemplary. That is why Rambam calls the <i>nazir</i> “praiseworthy” and “the equal of a prophet.”
But it is not the way of the sage – and you need sages if you seek to balance and perfect society. The sage is not an extremist – because he or she realises that there are other people at stake. There are the members of one’s own family as well as the others within one’s community. There are colleagues at work. There is a country to defend and a society to help build. The sage knows he or she cannot leave all these commitments behind to pursue a life of solitary virtue. In a strange way, saintliness is a form of self-indulgence. We are called on by God to live in the world, not escape from it; in society, not seclusion; to strive to create a balance among the conflicting pressures on us, not to focus on some while neglecting the others.
Hence, while from a personal perspective the <i>nazir</i> is a saint, from a societal perspective he is, at least figuratively, a “sinner” who has to bring an atonement offering.
Now let us look again at Rambam, and the life he led. He often longed to be a saint, secluded in study and writing, but he knew he needed to honour his daily responsibilities to others, as a physician, a teacher, and a leader. So he lived as a sage, and contributed vastly. That is a profound and moving choice, and one that still has the power to inspire us today.
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>Dualism comes in many forms, not all of them dangerous. There is the Platonic dualism that differentiates sharply between mind and body, the spiritual and the physical. There is the theological dualism that sees two different supernatural forces at work in the universe. There is the moral dualism that sees good and evil as instincts within us between which we must choose. But there is also what I will call pathological dualism where people see humanity itself as radically, ontologically divided into the unimpeachably good and the irredeemably bad. According to this view, you are either one or the other: either one of the saved, the redeemed, the chosen, or the devil’s disciple….
In the light of this we begin to understand the moral force of monotheism. The belief in one God meant that all the conflicting forces operative in the universe were encompassed by a single personality, the God of righteousness, who was sometimes just, sometimes forgiving, who spoke at times of law and at others of love. It was the refusal to split these things apart that made monotheism the humanising, civilising influence that, in the good times, it has been.
<b><i>Not in God’s Name,</i> 54–67</b>
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. Did the</i> nazir<i> believe in a form of dualism?</i>
<i>2. How does monotheism combat dualism? How can this help us understand the opinions of R. Eliezer HaKappar and Shmuel towards the</i> nazir<i>?</i>
<b>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</b>
1. Is being a <i>nazir</i> a good or a bad thing? What was Rambam’s opinion?
2. Rambam introduces us to two models of moral life: the saint and the sage. Which one is preferred?
3. In Rambam’s own life, did he demonstrate a tendency towards being a saint or a sage?
<b>EDUCATIONAL COMPANION TO THE QUESTIONS</b>
<b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>The <i>nazir</i> strives to find a greater spiritual state through achieving a higher level of spiritual purity. He or she believes that the material world is a distraction to reaching this goal and so seeks to limit exposure to the sources of materialism. Nazirites ensure they do not become spiritually contaminated by coming into contact with death, they ignore their own physical appearance and do not tend to their hair, and they avoid wine which represents the potential risk that enjoyment of physical things can become hedonistic when only focused on physical enjoyment.
Each of these approaches are legitimate, and hence represented in the talmudic debate and in Rambam’s writings and the way he lived his life (see <i>It Once Happened</i> and <i>Thinking More Deeply</i>).
The language that Rambam uses (see <i>Thinking More Deeply</i>) describing the pious saint who wishes to seclude himself from society in order to achieve greater levels of holiness and spirituality can also be used to describe the values of the ultra-Orthodox community, for example. However, it is important also to reflect on the statement, “You cannot build a society out of saints alone.”
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br>Rambam was arguably one of the greatest Jewish thinkers in history. He was a philosopher and an expert in Jewish law. He longed to have time and tranquility to think and write, and impact the Jewish (and non-Jewish) world through his writings. But he felt a deep responsibility to his community, both Jewish and non-Jewish. Perhaps he also understood the danger that philosophy and Jewish law can become too abstract when not grounded in the experience of real people and real life.
While he longed for solitude (like the saint, or the <i>nazir</i>) to think and write about Jewish philosophy and Jewish law, he led a life firmly grounded in the real world, using every available moment in his day and week to serve his community and live among the people (like a true sage).
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>Dualism is the division of something conceptually into two opposed or contrasted aspects. In this respect the <i>nazir</i> does seem to find the material world in a stark and opposed contrast to the spiritual world. However, this is not quite the same as considering these as good and evil, each with its own independent force. This approach is dangerously close to idolatry (the belief in multiple divinities), and no one is claiming that of the <i>nazir</i>. However, there are many who would argue that not seeing any good, or potential for good, in the physical world is antithetical to Judaism.
Monotheism asserts that everything was created by one God, and therefore contains inherent goodness, or at the very least the potential for goodness. The only source of evil in the world is when humans exercise their free will to achieve that end, and even then we can say our free will also comes from God, and does not exist independently of Him. Perhaps we can suggest that the opinion of R. Eliezer HaKappar and Shmuel is that the sin of the <i>nazir</i> is the rejection of the physical world, which has come from an inability or refusal to see the potential for good in all things.
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>We see two different approaches in the talmudic discussion. R. Elazar, and Ramban later, felt that the <i>nazir</i> is praiseworthy for voluntarily undertaking a higher level of holiness. R. Eliezer HaKappar and Shmuel held the opposite position; the <i>nazir</i> denied himself some of the pleasures of the world God created and declared good, and for this he was chastised.
Rambam seems to hold both viewpoints on the <i>nazir</i>, taking both a positive and negative approach in his law code, the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>. We can conclude from this that both approaches are legitimate, and both represent competing ideals in Judaism.
The fact that he takes both a negative and positive approach to the <i>nazir</i> leads us to believe that he sanctions both the sage and the saint as two legitimate paths to a fulfilled Jewish life. Which one to choose will depend on the needs of the individual and his community.

Beha'alotcha

In a Nutshell

<b><i>IN A NUTSHELL</i></b><br><i>Parashat Behaalotekha</i> begins with the final preparations for the Israelites’ journey from the Sinai desert to the Promised Land. God tells Aharon, the high priest, how to light the Menora in the ceremony for consecrating the Levites into their special role as protectors of everything holy.
Before starting the journey, the Israelites celebrate Passover, one year after the Exodus itself. Those who are unable to celebrate it at its proper time are given the chance a month later (<i>Pesaḥ Sheini</i>).
Then the story changes tone. The Israelites set out after their long stay in the Sinai desert, but almost immediately they start to complain. Moshe becomes frustrated and depressed and prays to die. God tells him to find seventy elders who will help him with the challenges of leadership.
In the last scene of the <i>parasha</i>, Moshe’s own sister and brother speak <i>lashon hara</i> (evil words) about him. Miriam is punished with the disease of <i>tzaraat</i> and must be quarantined until she recovers. Moshe, who is described as the humblest of men, prays on her behalf. After waiting a week for Miriam to recover, the people move on together<i>.</i>

I; Loneliness and Faith

<big><strong>I. Loneliness and Faith</strong></big><br><b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>After a lengthy stay in the Sinai desert, the people are about to begin the second part of their journey. They are no longer travelling <i>from</i> but travelling <i>to</i>. They are no longer escaping from Egypt; they are journeying towards the Promised Land.
The people are counted. They are gathered, tribe by tribe, around the <i>Mishkan</i>, in marching order. Preparations are made to purify the camp. Silver trumpets are made and used to gather together the people and to give them the signal to move on. Finally the journey begins.
Then comes a big anti-climax. The people start complaining. Soon we read:
<i>“The rabble with them began to crave other food, and again the Israelites started wailing and said, ‘If only we had meat to eat! We remember the fish we ate in Egypt at no cost</i> –<b></b> <i>also the cucumbers, melons, leeks, onions, and garlic. But now we have lost our appetite; we never see anything but this manna!’”</i> (Bemidbar 11:4–6).
The people seem to have forgotten that in Egypt they had been slaves, oppressed, their male children killed, and that they had cried out to be freed by God. They ate the bread of affliction and tasted bitterness, not meat and fish. As for their remark that they ate the food at no cost, it did cost them something: their liberty.
There was something monstrous about this behaviour of the people and it caused Moshe to have a kind of breakdown:
<i>“He asked the Lord, ‘Why have You brought this trouble on Your servant? What have I done to displease You that You put the burden of all these people on me? Did I conceive all these people? Did I give birth to them?…<b></b> I cannot carry all these people by myself; the burden is too heavy for me. If this is how You are going to treat me, please go ahead and kill me</i> –<b></b> <i>if I have found favour in Your eyes</i> –<b></b> <i>and do not let me face my own ruin’”</i> (Bemidbar 11:11–15).
This was the lowest point in Moshe’s career. The Torah does not tell us directly what was happening to him, but we can work it out from God’s reply. He tells him to appoint seventy elders who would share the burden of leadership. So, we must assume that Moshe was suffering from lack of companionship. He had become the “lonely man of faith.”
But what we must also remember is that it was this loneliness that allowed Moshe to develop a deeper relationship with God.

<i>2. Why can loneliness inspire us to turn to God?</i>
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br><i>Sometimes, in times of crisis, a sense of helplessness sets in. This feeling ran deep for so many during the Covid-19 pandemic, as millions of people around the globe were forced to isolate themselves in their own homes. Thomas Moore, a ninety-nine-year-old former British Army officer (popularly known as Captain Tom) was desperate to do something to help, despite being forced into quarantine in his home. So he decided to raise much-needed funds for NHS Charities Together</i> <i>which supports the National Health Service and its heroic medical teams who were risking their lives every day to look after the people of Britain. He set up a fundraising page online.</i>
<i>On April 6, 2020, Captain Tom held firmly onto his walking frame and began the challenge of walking a hundred laps of his garden, hoping to raise £1,000 by his hundredth birthday twenty-four days later. Word spread. The story was shared. Captain Tom could never have imagined how his story would capture the hearts of the British people. In just twenty-four days, he had raised over £32 million, from 1.5 million individual donations!</i>
<i>In honour of this tremendous achievement, and the inspiring model of goodness that he became for the British people and beyond, his hundredth birthday was celebrated by the RAF and the British Army with flypasts over his home, and he received more than 150,000 birthday cards from the public. The Queen even honoured him with a knighthood.</i>
<i>The nation will forever remember how Captain Tom became Sir Tom, and proved that everyone can do their part to bring good and hope to the world, even from their own backyard.</i>
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. Did you experience loneliness and helplessness during this period, or at any other time? How did you cope?</i>
<i>2. How did Captain Tom deal with this?</i>
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>Moshe was not the only person in Tanakh who felt so alone that he prayed to die. So did Eliyahu when Izevel issued a warrant for his arrest and death after his confrontation with the prophets of Baal (I Melakhim 19:4). So did Yirmeyahu when the people repeatedly failed to heed his warnings (Yirmeya 20:14–18). So did Yona when God forgave the people of Nineveh, seemingly making nonsense of his warning that in forty days the city would be destroyed (Yona 4:1–3). The prophets felt alone and unheard. They carried a heavy burden of solitude. They felt they could not go on. Few books explore this territory more profoundly than Tehillim. Time and again we hear King David’s despair (for example, Tehillim 6, 13, 22, and 130).
A similar phenomenon can be seen with leadership in modern times. Rav Kook, when he arrived in Israel, wrote, “There is no one, young or old, with whom I can share my thoughts, who is able to comprehend my viewpoint, and this wearies me greatly.” Even more candid was the late Rabbi Joseph Dov Soloveitchik. Near the beginning of his famous essay <i>The Lonely Man of Faith</i>, he writes, starkly: “I am lonely.” He continues: “I am lonely because at times I feel rejected and thrust away by everybody, not excluding my most intimate friends, and the words of the psalmist, ‘My father and my mother have forsaken me,’ ring quite often in my ears like the plaintive cooing of the turtledove.” This is extraordinary language.
At times of loneliness, I have found great solace in these passages. They told me I was not alone in feeling alone. Other people had been here before me.
Moshe, Eliyahu, Yirmeyahu, Yona, and King David were among the greatest spiritual leaders who ever lived. Such, though, is the psychological realism of Tanakh that we are given a glimpse into their souls. They were outstanding individuals, but they were still human, not superhuman. Judaism consistently avoided one of the greatest temptations of religion: to blur the boundary between heaven and earth, turning heroes into gods or demigods. The most remarkable figures of Judaism’s early history did not find their tasks easy. They never lost faith, but sometimes it was strained almost to the breaking point. It is the uncompromising honesty of Tanakh that makes it so compelling.
The psychological crises they experienced were understandable. They were undertaking almost impossible tasks. Moshe was trying to turn a generation forged in slavery into a free and responsible people. Eliyahu was one of the first prophets to criticise kings. Yirmeyahu had to tell the people what they did not want to hear. Yona had to face the fact that divine forgiveness extends even to Israel’s enemies and can overturn prophecies of doom. David had to wrestle with political, military, and spiritual challenges as well as an unruly personal life.
By telling us of their strife of the spirit, Tanakh is conveying something of immense consequence. In their isolation, loneliness, and deep despair, these figures cried out to God “from the depths,” and God answered them. He did not make their lives easier. But He did help them feel they were not alone.
Their very loneliness brought them into an unparalleled closeness to God. In our <i>parasha</i>, in the next chapter, God Himself defended Moshe’s honour against the slights of Miriam and Aharon. After wishing to die, Eliyahu encountered God on Mount Ḥorev in a “still small voice.” Yirmeyahu found the strength to continue to prophesy, and Yona was given a lesson in compassion by God Himself. Separated from their contemporaries, they were united with God. They discovered the deep spirituality of solitude.
I write these words while most of the world is in a state of almost complete lockdown because of the Coronavirus pandemic. People are unable to gather. Children cannot go to school. Weddings, bar and bat mitzvas, and funerals are deprived of the crowds that would normally attend them. Synagogues are closed. Mourners are unable to say <i>Kaddish</i>. These are unprecedented times.
Many are feeling lonely, anxious, isolated, deprived of company. To help, Natan Sharansky put out a video describing how he endured his years of loneliness in the Soviet Gulag as a prisoner of the KGB. From dozens of reports from those who endured it, including the late John McCain, solitary confinement is the most terrifying punishment of all. In the Torah, the first time the words “not good” appear are in the sentence “It is not good for man to be alone” (Bereshit 2:18).
But there are uses of adversity, and consolation in loneliness. When we feel alone, we are not alone, because the great heroes of the human spirit felt this way at times – Moshe, David, Eliyahu, and Yona. So did modern masters like Rav Kook and Rabbi Soloveitchik. It was precisely their loneliness that allowed them to develop a deeper relationship with God. Plumbing the depths, they reached the heights. They met God in the silence of the soul and felt themselves embraced.
This is not to minimise the shock of the Coronavirus pandemic and its consequences. Yet we can gain courage from the many individuals, from biblical times through to more modern ones, who felt their isolation deeply but who reached out to God and found God reaching out to them.
<b>I believe that isolation contains, within it, spiritual possibilities</b>. We can use it to deepen our spirituality. We can read the book of Tehillim, re-engaging with some of the greatest religious poetry the world has ever known. We can pray more deeply from the heart. And we can find solace in the stories of Moshe and others who had moments of despair but who came through them, their faith strengthened by their intense encounter with the Divine. It is when we feel most alone that we discover that we are not alone, for God is with us.
<b>QUESTION TO PONDER</b>
<i>What is it about isolation that so often leads to spiritual and moral development?</i>
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>In our isolation, we have the opportunity to listen to our soul, to our mind, to our heart in a way that we don’t have at other times because we are so busy interacting with other people. Perhaps also in our isolation, we can hear God’s very quiet call…. He is asking us to question: Is there someone I should call? Is there someone I should help? Is there someone I should thank? Is there a prayer I should be saying? Is there a text I should be learning? Is there a mitzva I should be doing? …Sometimes the really difficult times are the times of growth. They don’t seem so at the time. But when we look back, we see they were.

<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>Why do you think the people were so quick to complain, when they had directly experienced God’s love, protection, and miracles?
Why have so many of our leaders, from Tanakh times until today, experienced deep loneliness?
What opportunities for spiritual and moral growth have you had during periods of isolation?
<b>EDUCATIONAL COMPANION TO THE QUESTIONS</b>
<b><i>IN A NUTSHELL</i></b><br>Speaking <i>lashon hara</i> attacks the core foundation of community – trust. So, for a certain amount of time, the guilty party must separate themselves from the community and go into isolation. They must spend time reflecting on their place in the community, and how they can redeem themselves and contribute positively going forwards. This is somewhat connected to the main message of this <i>Covenant &amp; Conversation</i> essay, which suggests that time in isolation can lead to spiritual and moral growth.
<b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>Leaders sometimes need to go against the popular feeling of the people, when they see that there is room for growth if the people can be pushed out of their comfort zone. This can be an unpopular stance to take and can lead to deep loneliness. It is much easier to give the people what they want, even when the leader understands this is not what is best for them. It takes courage to take a stand, stand alone, and lead. But this takes an emotional toll.
When we are alone, and have no one to turn to for comfort and support, the only Being available to provide these basic human needs is God. God is always there if we only look for Him, and look to connect and build a relationship with Him. An isolated, lonely person will find solace in developing a relationship with God. This will lead to spiritual and also moral development and growth.
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br>It is probable that most people who experienced this period felt this at one time or another. In fact, most people can probably say they have experienced loneliness and helplessness at some point in their lives. Even children lucky enough to be growing up in loving, vibrant, and nurturing families will probably at some point have felt isolated from their friends, or from family members they cannot be with. This can help us to relate to the loneliness and isolation Moshe must have experienced in the <i>parasha</i> when leading a rebellious and stubborn people on his own.
Captain Tom channelled his feelings of frustration and isolation into doing something that made an impact and helped others. He raised money for the good of the whole country. This helped him feel connected to the rest of the country at a time when we were all separated from each other.
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>When you feel alone in the world, isolated from those you love, or from society as a whole, there is no one to turn to – except God, who is always available, waiting for all of His creation to search for Him. Isolation will often cause humans to turn to God and to develop a relationship with Him. It can also bring about a sense of helplessness which may, as in the case of the story in <i>It Once Happened</i>, lead a person to find a way to reach out from their isolation and connect to the rest of society through activism and good deeds. This kind of positive social action creates moral development and self-growth, as well as inspiring others to give, help, connect, and grow.
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>It seems that the people very quickly forgot their traumatic past (this may be a psychological self-defence mechanism to protect them from the trauma), and they soon became used to their new reality – the protection of God, and provision of all needs. They took this for granted and became ungrateful. For example, rather than marvel at the miracle of the manna, and feel blessed and grateful for it, they complained that they had become bored with it.
Each of the leaders mentioned here as an example of those who experienced loneliness and isolation had a unique reason for their feelings. However, what they all had in common was they had each taken an unpopular position that went against the common values of the times. Leadership can often be lonely, and it takes courage to be a leader at times like this. It is human nature to take the easiest path, and it is the job of the leader to direct us onto the path that will lead to the most growth, even if it is a more difficult one.
Contemplating the answer to this question can provide a good opportunity to discuss with your family/students the ways in which they have grown during periods of isolation. Have they learned to appreciate the things they have in their life more? Have they tried to do acts of kindness for people they know or for strangers? Have they found more meaning in religious ritual or prayer? Have they found comfort in their faith in these difficult times?

II; Camp and Congregation

<big><strong>II. Camp and Congregation</strong></big><br><b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>Our <i>parasha</i> speaks about the silver trumpets Moshe was commanded to make: “The Lord spoke to Moshe, saying, ‘Make two trumpets of silver; make them of hammered work. They shall serve you to summon the congregation (<i>edah</i>) and cause the camps (<i>maḥanot</i>) to journey’” (Bemidbar 10:1–2).
Rabbi Joseph Soloveitchik explored the difference between the two terms used here to describe the people in his famous essay <i>Kol Dodi Dofek</i>. There are, says Rabbi Soloveitchik, two ways in which people become a group – a community, society, or nation.
The first is when they face a common enemy. They band together for mutual protection, knowing that only by so doing can they survive. Humans are not the only creatures to do this. Animals too come together in herds or flocks to defend themselves against predators. Such a group is a <i>maḥaneh</i> – a camp, a defensive formation.
An <i>edah</i>, congregation, is altogether different. Here people can come together because they share a vision, a goal, a set of ideals. <i>Edah</i> is related to the word <i>ed</i>, witness. <i>Edot</i> (as opposed to <i>ḥukim</i> and <i>mishpatim</i>) are the commands that testify to Jewish belief – as Shabbat testifies to creation, Pesaḥ to the divine involvement in history, and so on. An <i>edah</i> is not a defensive formation but a creative one. People join to do together what none of them could achieve alone. A society built around a shared project, a vision of the common good, is not a <i>maḥaneh</i> but an <i>edah</i> – not a camp but a congregation.
These are two different ways of existing and relating to the world. A camp is brought into being by what happens to it from the outside. A congregation comes into existence by internal decision. The first is reactive, the second proactive. The first is a response to what has happened to the group in the past. The second represents what the group seeks to achieve in the future. Whereas camps exist even in the animal kingdom, congregations are uniquely human. They flow from the human ability to think, speak, communicate, envision a society different from any that has existed in the past, and collaborate to bring it about.

<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br><i>Rabbi Joseph B. Soloveitchik was born in in 1903 in Pruzhan (Belarus) into a famous rabbinic family. Even as a young child, he was a remarkable scholar of Talmud, Jewish law, and philosophy. After intensive Torah studies under his father’s instruction, he attended the University of Berlin where he was awarded a Ph.D. in philosophy.</i>
<i>In 1932, as the winds of war grew stronger in Europe, it became apparent that his Jewish life in Germany was no longer secure and Rabbi Soloveitchik was forced to flee to America. Describing his emotions during that period, he relates that he prayed to Hashem to allow him to stay in Europe with his family and friends. This was not to be, and when he later heard news of the Shoah he realised a profound lesson – that while it may not always feel this way, Hashem always listens to our personal prayers. He knows what is best for us, better than we do ourselves. This means that sometimes He helps us in a way that appears contrary to our prayers. But He always listens.</i>
<i>Rabbi Soloveitchik settled in the city of Boston, Massachusetts, and became the rabbi of the community there. Together with his wife Tonya (an academic in her own right), he founded the Maimonides High School in Boston. In 1941, he succeeded his father as rosh yeshiva of the Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary at Yeshiva University in New York, a position he held until his passing in 1993. Hugely influential as a spiritual leader of the Orthodox community in America and around the world, he ordained more rabbis than anyone else (approximately two thousand), inspired tens of thousands of people, and wrote many important works of Jewish scholarship and philosophy that remain relevant and essential reading to this day. His teachings on the application and relevance of Judaism to the modern world remain critically important, inspiring generations.</i>
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. Where in Rabbi Soloveitchik’s own life can you see his experience of the dual nature of the Jewish people as both</i> maĥaneh<i> and </i>edah?
<i>2. How do you feel about Rabbi Soloveitchik’s approach to how God answers our prayers?</i>
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>A camp and a congregation. Jews are a people in both of these two quite different ways. Our ancestors became a <i>maḥaneh</i> in Egypt, forged together in the crucible of slavery and suffering. They were different. They were not Egyptians. They were Hebrews – a word which probably means “on the other side” or “an outsider.” Ever since, Jews have known that we are thrown together by circumstance. We share a history all too often written in tears. Rabbi Soloveitchik calls this the <i>covenant of fate</i> (<i>brit goral</i>).
This is not a purely negative phenomenon. It gives rise to a powerful sense that we are part of a single story – that what we have in common is stronger than the things that separate us. It leads also to a sense of <i>shared suffering</i>. When we pray for the recovery of a sick person, we do so “among all the sick of Israel.” When we comfort a mourner, we do so “among all the other mourners of Zion and Jerusalem.” We weep together. We celebrate together. This in turn leads to <i>shared responsibility</i>: “All Israel are responsible for one another.” And this leads to collective action in the field of welfare, charity, and deeds of loving-kindness.
All these are dimensions of a congregation of fate, born in the experience of slavery in Egypt. But there is an additional element of Jewish identity. Rabbi Soloveitchik calls this the covenant of destiny (<i>brit ye’ud</i>) – entered into at Mount Sinai. This defines the people Israel not as the object of persecution but the subject of a unique vocation, to become “a kingdom of priests and a holy nation” (Shemot 19:6).
Under this covenant, the Jewish people was defined not by what others do to them but by the task they have undertaken, the role they have chosen to play in history. The Israelites did not choose to become slaves in Egypt. That was a fate thrust upon them by someone else. They did, however, choose to become God’s people at Sinai when they said, “We will do and obey” (Shemot 24:7). Destiny, call, vocation, purpose, task: these create not a <i>maḥaneh</i> but an <i>edah</i>, not a <i>camp</i> but a <i>congregation</i>.
Our task as a people of destiny is to bear witness to the presence of God – through the way we lead our lives (Torah) and the path we chart as a people across the centuries (history).
It is the concept of covenant that gives Jewish identity this strange dual character. Nations are usually forged through long historical experience, through what happens to them – rather than what they consciously set themselves to do. They fall into the category of <i>maḥaneh.</i> Religions, on the other hand, are defined in terms of beliefs and a sense of mission. Each is constituted as an <i>edah</i>. What is unique about Judaism is the way it brings together these separate and quite distinct ideas. <i>There are nations that contain many religions and there are religions that are spread over many nations, but only in the case of Judaism do religion and nation coincide.</i>
This has had remarkable consequences. For almost two thousand years Jews were scattered throughout the world, yet they saw themselves and were seen by others as a nation – the world’s first global nation. It was a nation held together not by geographical proximity or any other of the normal accompaniments of nationhood. Jews did not speak the same vernacular. Rashi spoke French; Rambam spoke Arabic. Rashi lived in a Christian culture, Rambam in a Muslim one. Nor was their fate the same. While the Jews of Spain were enjoying their Golden Age, the Jews of northern Europe were being massacred in the Crusades. In the fifteenth century, when the Jews of Spain were being persecuted and expelled, those of Poland were enjoying a rare spring of tolerance. What held Jews together during these centuries was shared faith.
In the trauma that accompanied European Emancipation and the subsequent rise of racial antisemitism, many Jews lost that faith. Yet the events of the past century – persecution, pogroms, and the Holocaust, followed by the birth of the State of Israel and the constant fight it has had to survive against war and terror – tended to bind Jews together in a covenant of fate in the face of the hostility of the world. So when Jews were divided by fate they were united by faith, and when they were divided by faith they were united again by fate. Such is the irony, or the providential nature, of Jewish history.
This duality was given its first expression in <i>Behaalotekha</i>. Sometimes the clarion call speaks to our sense of faith. At other times the silver trumpet that sounds and summons us is the call of fate. Whichever sound the instruments make, they call on that duality that makes Jews and Judaism inseparable. However deep the divisions between us, we remain one family in fate and faith. When the trumpet sounds, it sounds for us.
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>This is the destination of the Jewish journey – the Promised Land, the holy city, a society of justice, generosity, and peace. And in the transition from Exodus to Sinai, from <i>am</i> to <i>edah</i>, Jewish identity itself is transformed from passive to active, from fate to faith, from a people defined by what happens to it to a people defined by the social order they are called on to create.

<b>EDUCATIONAL COMPANION TO THE QUESTIONS</b>
<b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>In the thought of Rabbi Soloveitchik, a <i>maḥaneh</i> is a community, society, or nation that exists when a group of people come together for mutual protection in the face of a common enemy. An <i>edah</i>, on the other hand, come together because they share a vision, an aspiration, a set of ideals. Jews are a people in both of these different ways, so different people may have varied answers to this question resulting in an interesting debate, but the duality exists.
Jewish history began with the Jews as a <i>maḥaneh</i> in slavery in Egypt, and one could argue that as a group they have never ceased to experience external threats from then until now.
The Jewish people entered a covenant of destiny (<i>brit ye’ud</i>) at Mount Sinai when they received the Torah, which called on them to fulfil a unique vocation, and to become “a kingdom of priests and a holy nation” (Shemot 19:6). We are told that this covenant will ultimately be fulfilled when the Jewish people create their own society based on the values of the Torah, and through this, influence the world.
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br>Rabbi Soloveitchik lived through the lowest period in Jewish history, fleeing from Europe on the eve of the Holocaust. At this time, the Jewish people functioned as a <i>maḥaneh</i>, and had to fall back on the covenant of fate and unite like never before. However, he also witnessed the establishment of the State of Israel just a few years later and saw religious meaning in this event in history. This was the first opportunity since the destruction of the Second Temple to truly be an <i>edah</i> on a national scale, and fulfil the covenant of faith.
Rabbi Soloveitchik’s faith, which underlies his belief in divine providence and finding meaning in his personal history and our national history, is inspiring. His approach to <i>tefilla,</i> however, may not resonate with everyone.
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>When the Israelites left Egypt as liberated slaves, they became a nation (an <i>am</i> – a term Rabbi Sacks uses here instead of <i>maḥaneh</i>) and a community of fate and entered into the covenant of fate. Nations that function only as a community of fate are passive in history, acted upon, and wait for their fate to be determined by others.
When the Israelites entered the covenant of Sinai, they became an <i>edah</i> and a community of faith, entering the covenant of faith. Nations that function as a community of faith are active in history, choosing to fulfil their destiny based on a vision and a call to a vocation.
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>There are more than likely both aspects of <i>maḥaneh</i> and <i>edah</i> in all societies. But in the <i>Covenant &amp; Conversation</i> essay “Camp and Congregation,” Rabbi Sacks suggests that America and the Jewish people are perhaps the only two examples of nations created from the outset as communities of faith.
Despite being a people who like to argue, and during many times in history being divided and fractured into different <i>edot</i>, and scattered throughout the world for almost two thousand years, Jews always saw themselves (and were seen by others) as a single united nation. Throughout Jewish history, the Jewish people have contributed to the development of mankind in a way befitting a community of faith. The society being built in the State of Israel is clearly a work in progress, far from the finished product, yet it is still a society that Jews can on the whole be proud of. But there is still much work to do, both there and in the wider world!
After the Holocaust, the world believed that humanity must learn the lessons that will ensure the end to antisemitism, prejudice, and persecution in general. Sadly, this has not been the case, and antisemitism and other forms of racism and prejudice are on the rise in our generation. So as a nation, the Jewish people still find themselves in a community of fate. However, the call to the covenant of faith is also as strong as it has ever been. Perhaps these are intrinsically interconnected, and only when the destiny of the community of faith is fulfilled, will they no longer have to rely on the covenant of fate.

Sh'lach

In a Nutshell

<b><i>IN A NUTSHELL</i></b><br>Twelve men are sent by Moshe to check out the land of Israel before the people journey there. Ten of the men come back with a mixed report. They say that the land is very good, but the people are giants and their cities will be impossible to conquer. The other two men, Yehoshua and Kalev, say that with God’s help everything will be fine. But the people are scared by what they have learned and they beg to return to Egypt.
God becomes angry at the people’s lack of faith and threatens to destroy them (and to start again with Moshe). Moshe prays on behalf of the people and God relents. He decides instead that the people must spend forty years in the desert instead of entering the land immediately and directly. The entire generation will die naturally in the desert and only their children will enter the land.
The <i>parasha</i> also includes a list of laws about sacrifices, <i>ḥalla</i>, and forgiveness for sins committed by mistake. Then this list is interrupted with a short story about a man who breaks Shabbat on purpose. The <i>parasha</i> ends with the laws of tzitzit, the fringes on the corners of garments. These words become the third paragraph of the <i>Shema</i>, which we read every day and every night<i>.</i>
<b>QUESTION TO PONDER</b>
<i>Why do you think Yehoshua and Kalev saw things differently from the other ten spies?</i>

I; What Is Going On?

<big><strong>I. What Is Going On?</strong></big><br><b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>Understanding our life’s story is important for making the right decisions. Sometimes we need to ask what
is going on before deciding how to react. We can learn this by studying <i>Shelaḥ</i>.
We may think that we already know this story. Moshe sent twelve spies to explore the land. Ten of them came back with a negative tone to their report: The land is good, but unconquerable. The people are strong, the cities indestructible, the inhabitants are giants, and we are like grasshoppers. Only two of the twelve men, Yehoshua and Kalev, saw things differently. They said: We can win. The land is good. God is on our side. With His help, we cannot fail.
On this reading, Yehoshua and Kalev had faith, courage, and confidence, while the other ten men did not. But this is hard to understand. All of these men – not just Yehoshua and Kalev – knew that God was with them. He had saved them from Egypt. The Israelites had just defeated the Amalekites. How could these ten, who were all leaders and princes, not know that they could defeat the inhabitants of the land?
What is really going on? Biblical Hebrew has two verbs that mean “to spy”: <i>laḥpor</i> and <i>leragel</i> (from which we get the word <i>meraglim</i>, “spies”). It is important to note that <i>neither of these words appear in our parasha</i>. Instead, no less than twelve times, we encounter the rare verb <i>latur</i>. This verb was revived in modern Hebrew and means (and sounds like) “to tour.” <i>Tayar</i> is a tourist. There is all the difference in the world between a tourist and a spy.
Malbim explains the difference simply. <i>Latur</i> means to seek out the good. That is what tourists do. They go to the beautiful, the magnificent, the inspiring. They don’t spend their time trying to find out what is bad. <i>Laḥpor</i> and <i>leragel</i> are the opposite. They are about discovering a place’s weaknesses and vulnerabilities. That is what spies do. The exclusive use of the verb <i>latur</i> in our <i>parasha</i> – repeated twelve times – is there to tell us that <i>the twelve men were not sent to spy</i>.
Their mission was actually <i>latur</i>: to explore and report on the good things of the land so that the people would know it was worth fighting for, not to find out if it was possible to conquer it. Sadly, only two men understood their mission.

<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br><i>Steve Jobs’s biological mother Joanne was an unmarried college graduate who decided to put her baby up for adoption. But she asked that the adoptive parents also be college graduates. When Steve was born, the couple who had arranged to adopt him changed their minds and decided that they wanted a girl instead. Another interested family was contacted and agreed immediately to take him. They were good people, but they were not rich, or college graduates, as Joanne had hoped. Joanne was reluctant for them to raise her son, but in the end she agreed because they pledged that one day Steve would go to college.</i>
<i>Eighteen years later, Steve was in college as planned, but after just one semester, he decided it was too much for his parents to pay for such an expensive education. So he dropped out. For the next few years he lived on practically nothing, sleeping on the floor of friends’ dorms, making a few dollars by returning Coca-Cola bottles for five cents each. He decided to try going to some college classes again without being enrolled or receiving credit, but this time he only attended the lectures that truly interested him. This included a course in calligraphy, which fascinated him. The result was that when he and Steve Wozniak built their first computers, they incorporated the choice of multiple fonts, which gave an element of beauty to the documents composed on these machines, and have been a standard feature of computers ever since.</i>
<i>Steve faced a deep personal crisis when he was dismissed from Apple, the company that he and Wozniak had built from nothing in his parents’ garage, which had grown into a company with four thousand employees and a value of $2 billion. Anyone else might have given up in despair at this point, but Jobs did not. Instead, he created a new computer company called NeXT, and bought another one, Pixar Animations, which became the first maker of computer-animated films and produced – starting with Toy Story – a string of works of imaginative genius.</i>
<i>At the age of just forty-eight he was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, which made him re-evaluate what really mattered. All external considerations of pride or fear, embarrassment or failure, fell away, leaving only what was truly important.</i>
<i>Jobs would often talk about connecting the dots in his life. He constructed a narrative to give his life meaning, focusing on what made his life a story and on what kind of story it was. It was a story of hope, of overcoming adversity, a tale of how, despite his hardships (financial struggles, no relationship with his biological parents), he still emerged with his head held high, having made life better not just for himself, but for others also.</i>

<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>The reason ten of the twelve men came back with a negative report is not because they lacked courage or confidence or faith. It was because <i>they completely misunderstood their mission</i>. They thought they had been sent to be spies. But the Torah never uses the word “spy” in our chapter. The ten simply did not understand what was going on.
They believed it was their role to find out the vulnerabilities of the land, where its defences could be overcome. They looked and could not find any. The people were strong, and the cities impregnable. The bad news about the land was that there was not enough bad news to make it weak and thus conquerable. Thinking their task was to be spies, they did their best. They were honest and open. They reported what they had seen. Based on the intelligence they had gathered, they advised the people not to attack – not now, and not from here.
Their mistake was that <i>they were not meant to be spies</i>. They were told <i>latur</i>, not <i>laḥpor</i> or <i>leragel</i>. Their job was to tour, explore, travel, see what the land was like and report back. They were to see what was good about the land, not what was bad. So now we must ask ourselves: If they were not meant to be spies, what was the purpose of this mission?
I suggest that the answer is to be found in a passage in the Talmud (Kiddushin 41a) that states: It is forbidden for a man to marry a woman without seeing her first. The reason? Were he to marry without having seen her first, he might, when he does see her, find he is not attracted to her. Tensions will then inevitably arise. Hence the idea: <i>first see, then love</i>.
The same applies to a marriage between a people and its land. The Israelites were travelling to the country promised to their ancestors. But none of them had ever seen it. How then could they be expected to muster the energies necessary to fight the battles involved in conquering the land? They were about to marry a land they had not seen. They had no idea what they were fighting for.
The twelve men were sent <i>latur</i>: to explore and report on the good things of the land so that the people would know it was worth fighting for. Their task was to tour and explore, not spy and decry. But only two of them, Yehoshua and Kalev, listened carefully and understood what their mission was: to be the eyes of the congregation, letting them know the beauty and goodness of what lay ahead, the land that had been their destiny since the days of their ancestor Avraham.
<i>The Israelites at that stage did not need spies</i>. As Moshe said many years later: “You did not trust in the Lord your God, who went ahead of you on your journey, in fire by night and in a cloud by day, to search out places for you to camp and to show you the way you should go” (Devarim 1:32–33). God was going to show them where to go and where to attack.
The people needed something else entirely. Moshe had told them that the land was good. It was “flowing with milk and honey.” But Moshe had never seen the land. Why should they believe him? They needed the independent testimony of eyewitnesses. That was the mission of the twelve men. And in fact, all twelve fulfilled that mission. When they returned, the first thing they said was: “We went into the land to which you sent us, and it does flow with milk and honey! Here are its fruits” (Bemidbar 13:27). But because ten of them thought their task was to be spies, they went on to say that the conquest was impossible, and from then on, tragedy was inevitable.
The difference between Yehoshua and Kalev compared to the other ten men is not that the former two had the faith, courage, and confidence the latter ten men lacked. It is that they understood the story; the ten did not. Ten of the twelve men thought they were part of a story of espionage. The result was that they looked for the wrong things, came to the wrong conclusion, demoralised the people, destroyed the hope of an entire generation, and will eternally be remembered as being responsible for one of the worst failures in Jewish history.
<b>I believe that the story we tell affects the decisions we make. Get the story wrong and we can rob an entire generation of their future. Get it right, as did Yehoshua and Kalev, and we can achieve greatness.</b>
<b>QUESTION TO PONDER</b>
<i>What helped Yehoshua and Kalev get the story right? How can we do this in our own lives?</i>
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>Narrative is how we construct meaning out of the flow of events, and the fact that it does not have simple criteria of verification or refutation the way science does, does not mean that it is mere fiction. To the contrary, storytelling is of the essence of who we are as meaning-seeking animals…. We are, in large measure, the story we tell about ourselves, which means that we are always a work in process. Nor do we construct our story out of nothing. Our lives, our culture, our faith, all shape the narrative which, in itself, then reshapes our life.
<b><i>Morality,</i> 255–256</b>
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>How does asking the question “What is going on?” help us to make the right decisions in our lives?
If all the spies had asked this question, what should the answer have been and how would that have changed the outcome of the mission?
How can we apply this approach to recent years in our own lives during the difficult times that humanity has faced? What narratives will we be able to identify?
<b>EDUCATIONAL COMPANION TO THE QUESTIONS</b>
<b><i>IN A NUTSHELL</i></b><br>Our traditional understanding is that Kalev and Yehoshua had stronger faith in God, allowing them to be more positive when they saw the land and its inhabitants. Another reading, as we will see here, is that they had a better understanding of their mission – to bring back information on the positive aspects of the land.
<b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>As tourists, we tend to see the nicest parts of the countries we visit and leave with a positive impression of them. Every country has beautiful aspects and sites, and we aim to enjoy our visits, so we invest in seeing those parts of the country. Help your child or student remember the places they have visited and relate to the real mission of the twelve spies according to Rabbi Sacks.
The ten spies lost track of the real mission because they feared the momentous task ahead of them – to conquer a fortified land with a strong nation inhabiting it. This fear caused them to lose their faith (or at least to lose their perspective on the role that God would play).
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br>Steve Jobs reflected on the episodes of his life as a continuous story and took a positive and constructive approach to the narrative he created for himself. He always saw himself as the subject of the narrative, rather than the object (where he would have been passive to external factors deciding his fate). This allowed him to give meaning to all the events that he experienced. He kept a sense of this meaning throughout his life. The spies lost the sense that their situation was part of a narrative, with meaning and destiny, and thus they were led to making a catastrophic mistake in the way they reported their experiences to the people when they returned from their mission.
This is more challenging for young lives, but try and help your child or student to construct a story where they are the subject, finding meaning in the events of their life, allowing them to see the larger picture and narrative, and reflect on the decisions they have made (or others have made for them) in this respect.
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>Yehoshua and Kalev always kept the larger picture at the forefront of their mind – they were God’s people, on a journey to their destiny in the Promised Land, where God had promised to help them conquer the inhabitants and deliver the land to them. In the context of the larger picture, it was easier to maintain their faith that God would fulfil His promises to them. With this faith, they could return from their mission with a positive report on the land.
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>Seeing our life (or the life of a nation, or humanity as a whole) as a narrative helps us to see the larger picture. It helps us to take a step back, reflect, and find meaning in our lives, and then make decisions based on the meaning we have found, bringing us closer to the desired outcome.
If the ten spies had asked this question as Yehoshua and Kalev did, had they taken a step back and seen the bigger picture, they might have found it easier to find faith in God’s plan. Had they kept their perspective and curbed their fears, they could have seen that they were part of a historic narrative that began in Egypt, and ultimately was to end in the Promised Land. They might have seen that they were being asked to play a key role in that moment, to help reassure the people that the land of Israel was worth fighting for.
The challenging element of this theory is identifying the narrative (what Steve Jobs termed “connecting the dots” – see <i>It Once Happened</i>). Sometimes this can only happen in retrospect, once we have hindsight and can see the full picture. We hope that this challenging period in the history of humanity will one day be remembered for the positive, where important lessons were learned.

II; Fear of Freedom

<big><strong>II. Fear of Freedom</strong></big><br><b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>The story of the spies is one of the most tragic in the entire Torah. Twelve spies are chosen to visit the land of Canaan and bring back a report about it: Are the people many or few, strong or weak? What is the land itself like? Is the soil fertile? They were also told to bring back some of its fruit. The spies returned with a positive report about the land itself: “It is indeed flowing with milk and honey, and this is its fruit” (Bemidbar 13:27). From ten of the spies, there then followed one of the most famous “buts” in Jewish history: “But – the people who live there are powerful, and the cities are fortified and very large. We even saw descendants of Anak [‘the giant’] there” (13:28).
Sensing that these words were distressing the people, Kalev, one of the other two spies, reassured them: “We should go up and take over the land, for we can certainly do it.” But the ten spies insisted: “We cannot attack those people; they are stronger than us…. All the people we saw there are huge…. We seemed like grasshoppers in our own eyes, and so we were in their eyes” (Bemidbar 13:30–33). The next day, the people, persuaded that the challenge was completely beyond them, said they regretted ever leaving Egypt. They said, “Let us appoint a leader and go back to Egypt” (14:4).
The story is deeply puzzling. How could ten of the spies come back with such a negative report? Only one year before, they saw with their own eyes how God saved them from Egypt, the strongest of all the empires of the ancient world. They saw the Egyptian army with its cutting-edge military technology, the horse-drawn chariot, drown in the sea, while they passed through safely, on dry land. Before Egypt was defeated, it had been far stronger than the groups of people they would have to confront to conquer the land.
Stranger still, we find out later that the people of the land were entirely different from how they had been described here. In the <i>haftara</i> of our <i>parasha</i>, taken from the book of Yehoshua, we discover that the people of Yeriḥo were not giants. And they were as fearful of the Israelites as the Israelites were of them.
The spies were not random people from among the population. The Torah states that they were “heads of the people of Israel.” They were leaders, not people easily scared. So why did they bring back a report so exaggerated, so terrifying to the children of Israel that it caused them to decide to give up, turn around, and return to Egypt?
It was this question that led the Lubavitcher Rebbe (Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson) to give a radical interpretation of the episode. He said the spies were not afraid of failure. They were afraid of success.
Until now the people were in continuous contact with the <i>Shekhina</i> (Divine Presence). God provided for them everything they needed as a people. Never had a people lived so close to God. But once they had a land of their own, everything would change. They would be responsible for their own food, their security, and all their earthly needs. They feared these distractions. Their mistake was the mistake of very holy men. They wanted to spend their lives close to God, with no distractions.

<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br><i>In 1968, I was a student at Cambridge University, with plans to one day be a professor of philosophy, or of economics. That summer, I came to America hoping to meet the great intellectual leaders and rabbis of the day, and every one of them told me to see the Rebbe. So I went to 770 Eastern Parkway and said to the first Hasid I met there, “I’d like to speak to the Rebbe, please.” He just laughed and laughed. He said, “Do you know how many thousands of people are waiting to see the Rebbe? Forget it!” I explained I would be travelling around America and would come back to New York any time, if there was a chance. I left the phone number of my aunt in Los Angeles. “If it’s possible, call me,” I said.</i>
<i>Weeks later, soon after Shabbat ended, someone from Chabad called and said, “The Rebbe will see you on Thursday.” I only had enough money for a Greyhound bus ticket, so I sat on a bus for seventy-two hours non-stop from Los Angeles to New York.</i>
<i>I arrived at 770, and when my turn came, I was ushered into the Rebbe’s study. I asked him all my intellectual, philosophical questions and he gave intellectual, philosophical answers. But then he did what no one else had done. He reversed the roles and started asking me questions. How many Jewish students are in Cambridge? How many are involved in Jewish life? What are you doing to bring others closer to Judaism? I had come to ask the Rebbe my questions and all of a sudden, he was challenging me! So I began mumbling, “In the situation in which I find myself…” and then the Rebbe did something quite unusual for him. He interrupted me mid-sentence. He said, “Nobody finds themselves in a situation; you put yourself in a situation. And if you put yourself in that situation, you can put yourself into another situation.”</i>
<i>That moment changed my life. There I was, a nobody from nowhere, and there he was, one of the greatest leaders in the Jewish world challenging me to look at the bigger picture, and not just accept the situation, but change it. He told me to help Jews discover their roots. He said we needed more rabbis. He told me this was my task, to teach Torah and to train rabbis. At that moment I realised the Rebbe’s greatness was not that he had thousands of followers. A great leader creates other leaders. That’s what the Rebbe did for me and for thousands of others.</i>

<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>During their time in the wilderness, the people ate manna from heaven, drank water from a miraculous well, and were surrounded by Clouds of Glory. They were camped around the <i>Mishkan</i>. They were in continuous contact with the <i>Shekhina</i>. Never had a people lived so close to God. When they entered the land their situation would be radically different. They would have to fight battles, maintain an army, create an economy, farm the land, worry about the weather, and deal with all the other hundreds of distractions that come from living in this world. What would happen to their closeness to God when they were preoccupied with mundane and material pursuits. In the desert they could spend their entire lives learning Torah, lit by the radiance of the Divine. In their own land they would be one more nation in a world of nations with the same kind of economic, social, and political problems that every nation has to deal with.
The spies were not afraid of failure. They were afraid of success. They wanted to spend their lives in the closest possible proximity to God. What they did not understand was that God seeks, in the midrashic phrase, “a dwelling in the lower worlds.” One of the great differences between Judaism and other religions is that while others seek to lift people to heaven, Judaism seeks to bring heaven down to earth.
Much of Torah is about things not conventionally seen as religious at all: labour relations, agriculture, welfare provisions, loans and debts, land ownership, and so on. It is often suggested that the ideal location for an intensely religious or spiritual experience is in the desert, or in a monastic retreat, or in an ashram. But that is not the Jewish way. God wanted the Israelites to create a model society where human beings were not treated as slaves, where rulers were not worshipped as demigods, where human dignity was respected, where law was impartially administered to rich and poor alike, where no one was destitute, no one was abandoned to isolation, no one was above the law, and no realm of life was a morality-free zone. That requires a society, and a society needs a land. It requires an economy, an army, fields and flocks, labour and enterprise. All these, in Judaism, become ways of bringing the <i>Shekhina</i> into the shared spaces of our collective life.
The spies did not doubt that Israel could win its battles with the inhabitants of the land. Their concern was not physical but spiritual. They did not want to leave the wilderness and lose their unique relationship with God in the deep silence of the desert, far removed from civilisation and its distractions. Ultimately, the spies feared freedom and its responsibilities. This was the mistake of deeply religious men – but it was a mistake, for although there is something noble about this desire, it was also profoundly irresponsible. Ten of the spies demoralised the people and provoked the anger of God.
The Torah is about the responsibilities of freedom. Judaism is not a religion of monastic retreat from the world. It is a religion of engagement with the world. God chose Israel to make His presence visible in the world. Therefore <i>Israel must live in the world</i>. The Jewish task is not to fear the real world but to enter and transform it, healing some of its wounds and bringing to places often shrouded in darkness fragments of divine light.
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>This is the challenge of Judaism in the State of Israel in our time…. Its role is to create, shape, drive, and motivate civil society. If religion is not seen by Israelis as a unifying force in society, if religious Jews are not admired for their work with the poor, the lonely, and the vulnerable, if Judaism is not the voice of justice and compassion, then something is wrong in the soul of Israel. To be sure, some of this work happens already; there are many admirable examples. But there is much more to be done. Judaism in Israel today has lost the prophetic instinct when it needs it most…. [Zionism] must regain what Jewry had even when it lacked a state, namely a profound sense of responsibility to the weak, the poor, the socially marginalised, the neglected and unheard. That is the challenge for a new religious Zionism: to build a society worthy of being a home for the Divine Presence by honouring the divine image in all its citizens.

<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>How many reasons can you think of that make it hard to understand why ten of the spies brought a negative report back with them?
Why might life in the land of Israel weaken the people’s relationship with God?
How does Judaism “seek to bring heaven down to earth?”
<b>EDUCATIONAL COMPANION TO THE QUESTIONS</b>
<b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>The simple understanding of this episode is that the spies were afraid of being unsuccessful in their campaign to conquer the land, and lacked faith in God that He would fulfil His promise that they would be successful. The Lubavitcher Rebbe’s radical re-interpretation is that they were afraid of being successful in the conquest, because this would lead to a life of distraction from their main goal – remaining closely connected to God.
In order to successfully conquer and settle the land, they would have to fight battles, maintain an army, create an economy, and farm the land. This would also involve anxiety and worry, including whether there would be enough rain to produce a crop, as well as all the other thousand distractions that result from living in the world. This preoccupation with mundane and material pursuits would distract them from learning Torah and remaining in the closest proximity to God.
According to the Rebbe’s interpretation, they didn’t lack faith in God (the more classic reading of the story) but rather they lacked faith in themselves – in their own ability to remain close to God once they had additional worries, distractions, and occupations.
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br>Rabbi Sacks was considering a career in academia or as an economist, and the Rebbe changed his life path by inspiring him to become a leader of the Jewish world, first in the student community of the University of Cambridge, and later as a rabbi.
The Rebbe did not believe in long-term sheltering within the walls of the yeshiva or the ivory towers of academic institutions (as Rabbi Sacks was himself considering), which are both far from the people and the real world. As leader of Chabad, he instructed his followers to go out into the world (all over the world, even to places where there is no organised Jewish community) and lead the Jewish people.
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>This is a contentious subject that Rabbi Sacks explores at length in his book <i>Future Tense</i> in the chapter “A New Zionism.” There he suggests that when religion and politics mix, religion ceases to be a force for good in society.
Torah Judaism is not supposed to be lived only in the yeshiva, or in the desert. It is a code of living upon which a model society can be created. The spies (according to this interpretation) feared a corrupting influence of real life, feeling it to be a distraction from their personal relationship with God. Both the Rebbe and Rabbi Sacks in this text argue that the Torah must be lived and applied to the “real world” so we can “bring heaven down to earth.”
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>They had seen with their own eyes the miraculous Exodus from Egypt, which was the strongest empire in history; they had seen the Egyptian army, with its cutting-edge military technology, drown in the sea; Egypt was far stronger than the Canaanites; and this had all happened a mere year previously; they were entirely wrong about the people of the land, who it turned out feared the Israelites and God; the spies were not regular people but leaders of the people and not given lightly to fear.
The people were afraid of being successful in the conquest of the land because this would lead to a life of distraction from their main goal – remaining closely connected to God. Conquering and settling the land would necessitate an army and fighting battles, and the building of an economy based on farming the land. This preoccupation with mundane and material pursuits would distract them from learning Torah and remaining in the closest proximity to God. They didn’t lack faith in God (the more classic reading of the story) but rather they lacked faith in themselves – in their own ability to remain close to God once they had additional worries, distractions, and occupations.
There are other religions and religious systems of thought that focus on “lifting people to heaven.” These are primarily concerned with achieving individual salvation and a place in heaven for their adherents. To do this, physical distractions are avoided wherever possible. There are Jewish thinkers who focus on this also. However, at the core of the thought of Rabbi Sacks is Judaism’s focus on the Torah being a code of living, which tries to achieve the bringing of heaven down to earth by creating a society based on the values of the Torah.
God wanted the Israelites to create a model society where human beings were not treated as slaves, where rulers were not worshipped as demigods, where human dignity was respected, where law was impartially administered to rich and poor alike, where no one was destitute, no one was abandoned to isolation, no one was above the law, and no realm of life was a morality-free zone. That requires a society, and a society needs a land. It requires an economy, an army, fields and flocks, labour and enterprise. All these, in Judaism, become ways of bringing the <i>Shekhina</i> into the shared spaces of our collective life. This is how we are to “bring heaven down to earth.”

Korach

In a Nutshell

<b><i>IN A NUTSHELL</i></b><br>In this <i>parasha</i> we read the story of Koraḥ and his followers, who rebelled against Moshe and challenged his leadership. The entire generation of people who left Egypt with Moshe was now aware that they would not live to enter the land of Israel. Koraḥ took advantage of their shattered hopes and feelings of frustration. He gathered a rabble of trouble-makers – some from his own tribe, some from the tribe of Reuven, and others who had leadership positions in other tribes – and together they stood against the leadership of Moshe and Aharon and questioned their authority and their motives.
The rebellion failed and the leaders of the rebellion ended up being swallowed by the ground. But the people continued to be restless and to complain. Finally, rods were set out, one for each tribe, and Aharon’s rod blossomed miraculously, sprouting almonds, which was a message of peace and harmony. Then the people truly accepted the authority of Moshe and Aharon.
<b>QUESTION TO PONDER</b>
<i>Do you think Koraḥ would have made a better leader than Moshe?</i>

I; How Not to Argue

<big><strong>I. How Not to Argue</strong></big><br><b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>The Sages said (in <i>Pirkei Avot</i> 5:17) that Koraḥ’s story is a great example of an argument <i>not</i> for the sake of heaven. What is an example of the right kind of argument? The Sages directed us to the schools of Hillel and Shammai, who argued about laws and ideas in the Torah, but who did so “for the sake of heaven.” The Bartenura noted that the key difference between these two types of argument is that argument for the sake of heaven is <i>argument for the sake of truth</i>. Argument not for the sake of heaven is <i>argument for the sake of victory and power</i>, and these are two very different things.
Koraḥ and his followers came from three different groups. Koraḥ was from the tribe of Levi. Datan and Aviram came from the tribe of Reuven. And there were 250 leaders from different tribes who joined them. Each had their own complaint. The 250 leaders were angry that leadership roles had been taken from them after the sin of the Golden Calf and given instead to the tribe of Levi. Datan and Aviram felt it was unfair that their tribe – descendants of Yaakov’s firstborn son Reuven – had been given no special status. Koraḥ wanted to be a priest, and probably wanted to be high priest in place of Aharon.
The rebels said to Moshe and Aharon, “Why then do you <i>set yourselves above</i> the Lord’s assembly?” Later, Datan and Aviram said to Moshe, “And now you also want <i>to lord it over us</i>!” What the rebels revealed here is their true resentment: they wanted to be in charge. The three groups had nothing in common except that they each wanted to be leaders. Each of them wanted a more important or respected position than they currently held. In a word, they wanted power. This was an argument not for the sake of heaven.
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. How was the Koraĥ rebellion an argument “not for the sake of heaven”?</i>

<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br><i>There were five of us, sitting facing one another on the plane, and we were to be together for the next eight hours. Across the aisle was the British Prime Minister John Major and Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind. Opposite me was the leader of the opposition Tony Blair, and next to me, Paddy Ashdown, leader of the Liberal Democrats, Britain’s third party. I had been invited, as chief rabbi, to represent the Jewish community. It was Sunday, November 5, 1995, and we were on a plane of the Queen’s Flight to attend the funeral of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, who had led the Oslo peace process with the Palestinians, and who had been assassinated the previous night by a Jewish religious-nationalist zealot at a peace rally in Tel Aviv.</i>
<i>A normal commercial flight from London to Ben-Gurion airport takes about four and a half hours, but this plane of the Queen’s Flight, like an antiquated but very dignified limousine, travelled slowly, though in immense style, and needed to land halfway to refuel. The atmosphere was sombre. We all knew that a great man who had been pursuing peace had lost his life. War often turns ordinary people into heroes, while the pursuit of peace can make genuine heroes look like traitors to their own more nationalistic countrymen.</i>
<i>Half an hour into the flight, Paddy Ashdown turned to John Major and said, “John, here we are, leaders of three opposed parties, but we probably have more in common with one another here than we do with the extremists in our own parties. We’ve never sat together before like this. Let’s talk honestly and openly about what we really believe about the biggest issues today.” John Major, with a smile, willingly agreed, and for hour after hour, they talked together as candid friends. It was possibly the only time such an extended conversation took place between the party leaders. For eight hours, I sat and listened to the closest British politics came to a team of rivals, sharing their deepest convictions with total openness and friendship. I cherish the memory of those hours because it showed me politics at its best.</i>

<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. How is this story closer to a debate between the schools of Hillel and Shammai than Koraḥ’s story?</i>
<i>2. What do you think makes the story exceptional?</i>
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>Listen carefully to what people accuse others of, and you will then know what they themselves want. Often their words reveal their own underlying resentments. For example, various empires over many centuries have accused Jews of wanting to dominate the world. Yet Jews have never wanted to dominate the world. Unlike almost any other long-standing civilisation, they never created or sought to create an empire. But the people who levelled this accusation against Jews belonged to empires that were beginning to crumble. They themselves wanted to dominate the world but knew they could not, so they attributed their desire to Jews (in the psychological process known as splitting and projection, the single most important phenomenon in understanding antisemitism). That is when they created antisemitic myths, the classic case being the <i>Protocols of the Elders of Zion</i>, invented by writers or propagandists in Czarist Russia during the last stages of its decline.
What Koraḥ and his fellow rebels wanted was what they attributed to Moshe and Aharon, a form of leadership unknown in the Torah and radically incompatible with the value Moshe embodied, namely humility. They wanted to “set themselves above” the Lord’s assembly and “lord it over” the people. They wanted power.
What do you do when you seek not truth but power? You attack not the message but the messenger. You attempt to destroy the standing and credibility of those you oppose. You attempt to de-voice your opponents. That is what Koraḥ and his fellow rebels tried to do. So they accused Moshe of setting himself above the congregation, of turning leadership into lordship.
They made other claims too, as we can infer from Moshe’s response. He replied, “I have not taken so much as a donkey from them, nor have I wronged any of them,” implying that they had accused him of abusing his position for personal gain, misappropriating people’s property. He said, “This is how you will know that the Lord has sent me to do all these things and that it was not my idea,” implying that they had accused him of making up certain instructions or commands, attributing them to God when they were in fact his own idea.
The most extreme example is the accusation levelled by Datan and Aviram: “Isn’t it enough that you have <i>brought us up out of a land flowing with milk and honey to kill us in the wilderness</i>?” This is a forerunner of those concepts of our time: fake news, alternative facts, and post-truth. These were obvious lies, but they knew that if they said them often enough and at the right times, someone would believe them.
There was not the slightest attempt to set out the real issues: a leadership structure that left simmering discontent among the Levites, Reubenites, and other tribal chiefs; a generation that had lost all hope of reaching the Promised Land; and whatever else was troubling the people. There were real problems, but the rebels were not interested in truth. They wanted power.
Their aim, as far as we can judge from the text, was to damage Moshe’s credibility as a leader, to raise doubts among the people as to whether he really was receiving his instructions from God, and to so besmirch his character that he would be unable to lead in the future, or at least force him to capitulate to the rebels’ demands. When you are arguing for the sake of power, truth doesn’t come into it at all.
Koraḥ was swallowed up by the ground, but his spirit is still alive and well, and in the unlikeliest of places – places like the British and American universities of today.
Arguments not for the sake of heaven have resurfaced in our time in the form of the “cancel” or “call-out” culture that uses social media to turn people into non-persons when they are deemed to have committed some wrong – sometimes genuinely so (sexual harassment for example), sometimes merely for going against the moral fashion of the moment. Particularly disturbing has been the growing practice of denying or withdrawing a platform at university to someone whose views are deemed to be offensive to another group.
This is a contemporary instance of arguments not for the sake of heaven. This is about abandoning the search for truth in favour of the pursuit of victory and power. It works by discrediting and de-voicing – “cancelling” – an individual. A university is, or should be, the home of argument for the sake of heaven. It is where we go to participate in the collaborative pursuit of truth. We listen to views opposed to our own. We learn to defend our beliefs. Our understanding deepens, and intellectually, we grow. We learn what it means to care for truth. The pursuit of power has its place, but not where knowledge has its home.
That is why the Sages contrasted Koraḥ and his fellow rebels with the schools of Hillel and Shammai:
<i>For three years there was a dispute between the schools of Shammai and Hillel. The former claimed, “The law is in agreement with our views,” and the latter insisted, “The law is in agreement with our views.” Then a voice from Heaven (a</i> bat kol<i>) announced, “These and those are the words of the living God, but the law is in accordance with the school of Hillel.”</i>
<i>Since the voice announced that both schools “are the words of the living God,” why was the school of Hillel chosen to have the law determined in accordance with their rulings? Because they were kind and modest, they studied both their own rulings and those of the school of Shammai, and they were even so humble as to mention the teachings of the school of Shammai before their own.</i>
This is a beautiful portrait of the rabbinic ideal: we learn by listening to the views of our opponents, at times even before our own. <b>I believe that what is happening at universities, turning the pursuit of truth into the pursuit of power, silencing, demonising, and no-platforming those with whom people disagree, is the Koraḥ phenomenon of our time, and it is very dangerous indeed.</b> <b>An old Latin motto says that to secure justice, <i>audi alteram partem</i>, “Listen to the other side.” It is through listening to the other side that we walk the path to truth.</b>
<b>QUESTION TO PONDER</b>
<i>Why do you think people today are often unable to listen to the other side?</i>
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>Here are the three principles of civility: (1) For there to be justice, all sides must be heard. (2) Truth on earth cannot aspire to be truth as it is in heaven. All truth on earth represents a perspective, and there are multiple perspectives. (3) The alternative to argument is violence. That is why the argument must never cease.
Those are the conclusions I have reached since that long plane journey when I listened to three party leaders debating together as they flew to attend the funeral of a brave politician, assassinated by a zealot who did not believe in the democratic argument, and believed instead that politics can be dictated by the barrel of a gun.
<b><i>Morality</i>, 230</b>
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>Are the leaders in your country more similar to Hillel, Shammai, and Moshe, or Koraḥ?
Where can you see in society today arguments that are not “for the sake of heaven?”
Why is it so important to listen to the other side even if you are sure you are right?
<b>EDUCATIONAL COMPANION TO THE QUESTIONS</b>
<b><i>IN A NUTSHELL</i></b><br>Koraḥ would not have made a good leader because, as he clearly demonstrated in this story, his main concern was his own prestige and power, and he did not have the best interests of the people at heart. Moshe, on the other hand, was a selfless leader, known for his humility, and he dedicated his life to serving the people. He only had the best interests of the people at heart.
<b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>Koraḥ and his followers were not arguing with Moshe with pure intentions. They wanted power for themselves and they wanted to replace Moshe and Aharon as the leaders of the nation. They were jealous that Moshe and Aharon had influence and positions of leadership above them. They did not have the best interests of the people in mind, but rather they were trying to benefit themselves. They were uninterested in truth (such as who would be the better leader and who God wanted to lead the people), and they were only concerned with their own position, arguing for the power they lacked but yearned for.
A worthy leader dedicates their life to serving the people. Leadership challenges are not always a bad thing. If the challenger honestly believes they can serve the people better than the current leader, then a challenge may be appropriate (if it is also the will of the people, and in our case, God). The focus of good leadership must always be the good of the people.
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br>The conversation on the plane among these British politicians was between three politically opposed leaders who deeply disagreed with each other over important issues. However, they argued in this instance with respect and with an openness to hear the others’ positions. This was an argument that searched for truth rather than power or ego. It was a discussion with the intent to find the truth and not to achieve a political victory.
Sadly, it seems that today, too many of the world’s political leaders are in positions of leadership largely for their own interests, and their main objective is to stay in power at all costs. Often it does not seem like they are serving the interests of the people or acting in the pursuit of what is right and just. In our story, however, these leaders were debating with each other in the pursuit of truth, and with an openness to listening to each other’s ideas and beliefs.
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>Perhaps people have become overly sensitive, feeling too deeply offended by positions they disagree with. Or perhaps they have become arrogant and over-confident with the conviction of their beliefs, and they refuse to even give any space to opinions they disagree with. Or perhaps they are scared that if they are exposed to other ideas, they will be forced to re-evaluate their own cherished beliefs.
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>Make sure that the discussion of this question is “for the sake of heaven” and stays within the spirit of Hillel and Shammai, not Koraḥ and his followers!
Universities used to be places where the discourse was a paradigm example of arguments for the sake of heaven and the pursuit of truth. Rabbi Sacks referred to how this is becoming less and less the case today, where there is no space for dissenting positions, and those with alternative voices are shot down and “cancelled.” Similarly, the political discourse in many countries today can often be described as being not for the sake of heaven. The arena of the press and journalism is also under threat as the political discourse there becomes partisan and venomous.
Listening to opinions that are opposed to your own challenges you to grow and to think, calling on you to evaluate your opinion more fully, and helping you to articulate what you do believe in. It encourages humility and guards against arrogance and over-confidence. Openness to hearing other voices is also a moral ideal, showing respect to other people and their ideas.

II; Argument for the Sake of Heaven

<big><strong>II. Argument for the Sake of Heaven</strong></big><br><b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>The Koraḥ rebellion was different from the other complaints and demonstrations Moshe faced during the wilderness years. It did not stem from a problem the Israelites faced such as a lack of food or water, or a way through the sea, or having to fight a battle against giants. It was a personal attack on Moshe and Aharon. Koraḥ and his fellow rebels accused Moshe of favouritism, of failure, and of being a fraud – of making decisions for his own benefit, in the name of God. So terrible was this argument, that it became the classic example for the Sages of the worst kind of disagreement – an argument “not for the sake of heaven.” The opposite of this is an <i>argument for the sake of heaven</i>, and the classic example given by the Sages is arguments between Hillel and Shammai (Mishna Avot 5:17).
The Meiri (who lived in Spain in the thirteenth century) explains the difference between them in this way: “Hillel and Shammai argued out of a desire to discover the truth, not out of grumpiness or just for the sake of winning an argument…but Koraḥ and his followers came to attack Moshe out of jealousy and a desire for victory.” In other words, the first type of argument is an <i>argument for the sake of truth</i> and the second is an <i>argument for the sake of victory.</i>
This becomes obvious when you notice the difference between what the rebels <i>said</i> and what they really wanted. What they said was that the people did not need leaders, because they were all holy. They had all heard the word of God. There should therefore be no leaders of higher rank or holiness within Israel. “Why then do you set yourselves above the Lord’s assembly?” (Bemidbar 16:3). But from Moshe’s reply, it is clear that he knew they actually wanted something altogether different. He answered: “Now listen, you Levites! Is it not enough for you that the God of Israel has separated you from the rest of the Israelite community and brought you near Himself to do the work at the Lord’s Tabernacle and to stand before the community and minister to them…but now you are trying to get the priesthood too” (Bemidbar 16:8–10).
Moshe knew they did not really want a community without leaders. Instead, <i>they</i> wanted to be the leaders. Koraḥ’s speech had nothing to do with finding the truth, but rather it was about achieving personal honour, status, and power.
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. What distinguishes an argument for the sake of heaven from other arguments?</i>
<i>2. What did Koraḥ really want? What do you think Hillel and Shammai wanted when they argued?</i>
<i>3. Can you think of examples of both types of arguments from your own life?</i>
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br><i>A story is told in the Talmud (Eiruvin 13b) where for three years, Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel (the students of Shammai and Hillel) argued about a matter of halakha, neither being able to convince the other to change their opinion. Beit Shammai said, “The halakha follows our opinion,” and Beit Hillel said, “The halakha follows our opinion.” Eventually, a voice from heaven was heard announcing, “Both these and those are the words of the living God. But the halakha follows the opinion of Beit Hillel.”</i>
<i>The Talmud then asks: “Since God declares that both these and those are the words of the living God, for what reason does the halakha follow the opinion of Beit Hillel?” The following explanation is given: The followers of Hillel were friendly and patient, treating everyone with respect, and when they taught the halakha they would teach the teachings of Beit Shammai as well as their own teachings. In fact, when they presented their own position in a debate between the teachings of Hillel and Shammai, they gave priority to the teachings of Shammai, teaching this position before their own.</i>
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. How can the positions of both Hillel and Shammai be the words of the living God if they contradict each other?</i>
<i>2. If both positions are right, why does God need to announce a winner?</i>
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>Moshe’s first response to Koraḥ and his followers was to propose a simple test. Let the rebels bring an offering of incense the next day and God would show whether He accepted or rejected their offering. This is a rational response. Since Koraḥ and his fellows claimed Moshe did whatever he wanted, not what God wanted, let God decide who the true leader should be. It was a controlled experiment, an empirical test. God would let the people know, in an unambiguous way, who was right. It would establish, once and for all, the truth.
But Moshe did not stop there, as he would have done if truth were the only issue involved. As we saw in the quote above, Moshe tried to argue Koraḥ out of his dissent, not by addressing his argument but by speaking to the resentment that lay behind it. He told him that he had been given a position of honour. He may not have been a priest but he was a Levite, and the Levites had special sacred status not shared by the other tribes. He was telling him to be satisfied with the honour he had and not let his ambition overreach itself.
At this point, the confrontation became yet more intense. For the first and only time in his life, Moshe staked his leadership on the occurrence of a miracle. He said, “By this you shall know that it was the Lord who sent me to do all these things, that they were not of my own devising: If these men die a natural death and suffer the fate of all mankind, then the Lord has not sent me. But if the Lord brings about something totally new, and the earth opens its mouth and swallows them, with everything that belongs to them, and they go down alive into the grave, then you will know that these men have treated the Lord with contempt” (Bemidbar 16:28–30).
He was immediately answered. No sooner had he finished than “the ground under them split apart and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them” (Bemidbar 16:32). The rebels “went down alive into the grave” (16:33). One cannot imagine a more dramatic vindication. God had shown, beyond possibility of doubt, that Moshe was right and the rebels wrong. <i>Yet this did not end the argument</i>. That is what is extraordinary. Far from being apologetic and repentant, the people returned the next morning still complaining – this time, not about who should lead whom but about the way Moshe had chosen to end the dispute: “The next day, the whole Israelite community grumbled against Moshe and Aharon. ‘You have killed the Lord’s people,’ they said” (17:6).
You may be right, they implied, and Koraḥ may have been wrong. But is this a way to win an argument? To cause your opponents to be swallowed up alive? This time, God suggested an entirely different way of resolving the dispute. He told Moshe to have each of the tribes take a staff and write their name on it, and place them in the Tent of Meeting. On the staff of the tribe of Levi, the name of Aharon should be written. One of the staffs would sprout, and that would signal whom God had chosen. The tribes did so, and the next morning they returned to find that Aharon’s staff had budded, blossomed, and produced almonds. That, finally, ended the argument (Bemidbar 17:16–24).
What resolved the dispute, in other words, was not a show of power but something altogether different. The fact that Aharon’s rod produced almond blossoms seems to have had rich symbolism. In the Near East, the almond is the first tree to blossom, its white flowers signalling the end of winter and the emergence of new life. The almond flowers recalled the gold flowers on the Menora (Shemot 25:31; 37:17), lit daily by Aharon in the Sanctuary. The Hebrew word <i>tzitz</i>, used here to mean “blossom,” recalls the <i>tzitz</i>, the frontlet of pure gold worn as part of Aharon’s headdress, on which were inscribed the words, “Holy to the Lord” (Shemot 28:36). The sprouting almond branch was therefore more than a sign. It was a multifaceted symbol of life, light, holiness, and the watchful presence of God.
One could almost say that the almond branch symbolised the priestly will to life as against the rebels’ will to power. The priest does not rule the people; he blesses them. He is the channel through which God’s life-giving energies flow. He connects the nation to the Divine Presence. What makes a spiritual leader is not ambition but humility. Moshe answered Koraḥ in Koraḥ’s terms, by a show of force. God answered in a quite different way, showing that leadership is not self-assertion but self-effacement.
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>The Sages celebrated <i>maḥloket leshem shamayim,</i> “argument for the sake of heaven.” They epitomised it in the archetypal debates between Hillel and Shammai, about which it was said that “<i>elu ve’elu divrei Elokim ḥayim</i>,” “<i>these and these are the words of the living God</i>.” The central document of rabbinic Judaism, the Babylonian Talmud, is written in the form of sequences of argument. The argument itself and the clarification of the issues involved is often more important than the conclusions reached. Rejected opinions are considered as closely as accepted ones. Indeed, the Talmud states that the rulings of the school of Hillel became authoritative because, among other things, they studied the views of their opponents as well as their own and stated them before their own.
Argument, for the Sages, was a deeply religious mode of discourse: not only argument between man and man, but even argument between man and God. The aggadic or interpretive literature of the talmudic period turns the biblical conversations between man and God – Moshe’s plea for the Israelites after the sin of the Golden Calf, for example, or Ḥana’s prayer for a child – into intense and dramatic confrontations which the rabbis termed <i>ḥutzpah kelapei shamaya</i>, audacity towards heaven. In this respect they were continuing a biblical tradition of argument between earth and heaven – we recall Avraham’s dialogue over the fate of Sodom, Iyov’s over his tragedy, Moshe’s and Yirmeya’s over the justice of providence. It is a highly distinctive tone of Jewish spirituality, one that embarrassed Philo and other Jewish philosophers, but one that remained close to the Jewish heart.

<b>EDUCATIONAL COMPANION TO THE QUESTIONS</b>
<b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>An argument for the sake of heaven involves both sides striving to establish the truth. The losing side in an argument will gracefully accept defeat because the truth has been reached and that was their sole motivation for the argument. However, an argument not for the sake of heaven is driven by ulterior motives such as honour and status. The loser in such an argument will feel the pain of defeat and find it hard to accept, because their sole aim has not been achieved.
Koraḥ wanted the status and power that Moshe and Aharon had. He was jealous of the position and status that they had been given by God. Hillel and Shammai had only one goal in their debates – to decide on the halakha. This was their truth and while Shammai was defeated in all but five occasions, he accepted this because the truth of a halakhic ruling had been established.
If we are honest with ourselves, we can all find examples of arguments that we have had that have been less about finding the truth and more about winning the argument. Hopefully we can also find examples when we have gracefully accepted defeat because we were only interested in the question being debated.
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br>Both positions are seen as “right” and “true” in the eyes of God. Neither is superior to the other (if one position was, then it would have disproven the other and there would have been a clear winner without a need for God to declare which was the halakha). Not all arguments are between truth and falsehood. Sometimes two truths can be in opposition.
Because this is a matter of normative halakha, we need to have a final decision so we can know how to act. God needed to announce which of the two legitimate positions is the one that was to become the normative halakha.
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>The culture of debate and argument democratises Jewish knowledge and spirituality. It means that anyone can be part of the conversation. The Sages even extend this to standing face to face with God and challenging Him for justice or understanding. Whether the greatest Jewish leaders such as Moshe and Avraham, or simple Jews such as Iyov or you and I, each has the right to stand before God and challenge and argue, within the parameters of deep faith in God.
If an argument for the sake of heaven is the pursuit of truth, then when Moshe, Avraham, and Iyov challenge God they are asking for an account of the truth. This is a remarkable and unique spiritual paradigm for a personal relationship with God. Man can and should hold God accountable for truth and justice. However, this must also be within the framework of faith and a humility that recognises that not all of truth can be grasped by finite humanity.
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>They were searching for the truth only, and not interested in personal honour or status. This is clearly seen in the way they accepted the legitimacy of each other’s position, accepting “defeat” with grace, because it was ultimately not seen as defeat, but rather victory in the search for truth. Beit Hillel especially demonstrated this in the way that they respected the opinion of their opponents, making it a priority to teach the opinions of Beit Shammai first.
Sometimes having truth on your side to win an argument is not the most important thing. The way you treat your opponent and allow room in society for those who feel excluded as a result of the outcome of an argument is more important. The more effective way to resolve conflict was demonstrated later. When all the leaders planted their rods, only Aharon’s blossomed. This was a sign of life and light, rebirth and ultimately reconciliation.
As we mentioned, the culture of debate and argument democratises Jewish knowledge and spirituality, allowing everyone to be part of the conversation. This can even include challenging God. “That is the glory of Judaism. The Divine Presence is to be found not in this voice as against that, but in the totality of the conversation.” This empowers everyone to be part of the conversation in the search for truth.

Chukat

In a Nutshell

<b><i>IN A NUTSHELL</i></b><br><i>Ḥukat</i> begins with the law of the Red Heifer (a young female cow who can be used to purify us). The Sages thought the Red Heifer was the hardest of all the mitzvot in the Torah to understand, and it became the classic example of a <i>ḥok</i> – a mitzva with no obvious explanation.
The <i>parasha</i> then continues telling the story of the Israelites in the desert. After the death of Miriam, the people complain they no longer have any water. Moshe and Aharon turn to God for help, and then show impatience with the people. God judges that they have acted wrongly and tells them they will not live to enter the land of Israel. Soon after this Aharon dies a natural death, aged 123.
The people complain again and are attacked by venomous snakes. God tells Moshe to place a brass snake on a pole, so that all who look up to it will be healed. Moshe then leads the people into battle against Siḥon and then Og, and they win both battles.

I; Kohelet, Tolstoy, and the Red Heifer

<big><strong>I. Kohelet, Tolstoy, and the Red Heifer</strong></big><br><b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>The law of the <i>para aduma</i>, the Red Heifer, does not seem to have a logical explanation. The opening words, “<i>Zot ḥukat haTorah</i>,” indicate that this is the classic example of a <i>ḥok</i>, a law whose logic is hidden, perhaps unknowable.
It was used in a ceremony for the purification of those who had been in contact with a dead body. Death is the primary source of impurity, and no person made impure was allowed to enter the <i>Mishkan</i> or Temple until they had been ritually cleansed, in a process that lasted seven days.
A key element of the purification process involved a priest sprinkling the person affected, on the third and seventh day, with a specially prepared liquid known as “the water of cleansing.” First a Red Heifer that had never been used to perform work, and was without blemish, had to be found, ritually killed, and burned outside the camp. Cedar wood, hyssop, and scarlet wool were added to the fire, and the ashes were placed in a vessel containing “living,” i.e., fresh, water. It was this water that was sprinkled on those who had become impure by contact with death.
The meaning behind this ritual addresses the basic human fear of death. The animal itself is a symbol of pure life, natural and untamed. Red is the colour of blood, the essence of life. The cedar, tallest of trees, represents vegetative life. The hyssop symbolises purity. All these were reduced to ash in the fire, a powerful reminder that all things die. The ash was then dissolved in water, symbolising continuity, the flow of life, and the potential of rebirth. The body dies but the spirit flows on. Lives may end but life does not. Those who live after us continue what we began, and we live on in them. Life is a never-ending stream, always carrying us onwards.

<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br><i>It was a devastating tragedy. A young man, brilliant, gifted, with a devoted wife and two beautiful young children, was diagnosed with leukemia. For two and a half years, helped by advanced medical technology and lifted by the prayers of friends, he fought with all his strength against the war taking place within his body. In the end it was all too much, and he died.</i>
<i>This was no ordinary young man. He was a person of the most profound religious belief and practice, who spent every spare moment of his crowded, short life helping others and bringing out the best in them, who by the sheer force of his example became a leader who transformed lives, as a youth leader, a student, a teacher, and as a builder of communities. He taught people the power of possibility and helped them become better than they thought they were.</i>
<i>There are moments that can shake your faith to its foundations. Yet, as I stood at his funeral, this was not the feeling that swept over me. Instead I felt a strange, quite unexpected access of faith.</i>
<i>For around me, gathered at seemingly impossible short notice – in Judaism we try never to delay a funeral – were more than a thousand mourners, many of them his age or younger. Through their tears I saw the difference he had made to their lives. He wasn’t rich or famous. He had lived all too briefly. Yet each of them had a story to tell of how he had helped them, inspired them, befriended them when they were lonely, lifted them when they were suffering some personal crisis; and each of those blessings had given rise to others in turn, in a series of ever-widening ripples of good.</i>
<i>We had come to honour the memory of one who, without ever saying so, taught people to pay it forward, and he had left behind him a vast legacy of blessings. And yes, he had died young and left a tidal wave of grief. But he had also taught us how never to let grief, or suffering, or sadness have the last word. Before he died, he taught us how to live.</i>

<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. How does this story of a tragic death teach us how to live?</i>
<i>2. How is this message similar to the message of the Red Heifer?</i>
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>Though this ritual has not been practised since the days of the Temple, it nonetheless remains significant, in itself and for an understanding of what a <i>ḥok</i>, usually translated as “statute,” actually is. Other examples include the prohibition against eating meat and milk together, wearing clothes of mixed wool and linen (<i>shatnez</i>), and sowing a field with two kinds of grain (<i>kilayim</i>). There have been several very different explanations of <i>ḥukim</i>.
The most famous is that a <i>ḥok</i> is a law whose logic we cannot understand. It makes sense to God, but it makes no sense to us. We cannot aspire to the kind of cosmic wisdom that would allow us to see its point and purpose. Or perhaps, as Rav Saadia Gaon put it, it is a command issued for no other reason than to reward us for obeying it.
The Sages recognised that whereas gentiles might understand Jewish laws based on social justice (<i>mishpatim</i>) or historical memory (<i>edot</i>), commands such as the prohibition of eating meat and milk together seem irrational and superstitious to others. The <i>ḥukim</i> were laws of which “Satan and the nations of the world made fun.”
Rambam had a quite different view. He believed that no divine command was irrational. To suppose otherwise was to think God inferior to human beings. The <i>ḥukim</i> only appear to be inexplicable because we have forgotten the original context in which they were ordained. Each of them was a rejection of, and education against, some idolatrous practice. For the most part, however, such practices have died out, which is why we now find the commands hard to understand.
A third view, adopted by Ramban in the thirteenth century and further articulated by Samson Raphael Hirsch in the nineteenth, is that the <i>ḥukim</i> were laws designed to teach us the integrity of nature. Nature has its own laws, domains, and boundaries; to cross them is to dishonour the divinely created order, and to threaten nature itself. So we do not combine animal (wool) and vegetable (linen) textiles, or mix animal life (milk) and animal death (meat). As for the Red Heifer, Hirsch says that the ritual is to cleanse humans from depression brought about by reminders of human mortality.
My own view is that <i>ḥukim</i> are <i>commands deliberately intended to bypass the rational brain, the pre-frontal cortex</i>. The root from which the word <i>ḥok</i> comes is <i>ḥ-k-k</i>, meaning, “to engrave.” Writing is on the surface; engraving cuts much deeper than the surface. Rituals go deep below the surface of the mind, and for an important reason. We are not fully rational animals, and we can make momentous mistakes if we think we are. We have a limbic system, an emotional brain. We also have an extremely powerful set of reactions to potential danger, located in the amygdala, that lead us to flee, freeze, or fight. <i>A moral system, to be adequate to the human condition, must recognise the nature of the human condition</i>. It must speak to our fears.
The most profound fear most of us have is of death. As La Rochefoucauld said, “Neither the sun nor death can be looked on with a steady eye.” Few have explored death and the tragic shadow it casts over life more profoundly than the author of the book of Kohelet: “The fate of man is the fate of cattle; the same fate awaits them both. The death of one is like the death of the other; their spirits are the same, and the pre-eminence of man over beast is nothing, for it is all shallow breath. All end in the same place; all emerge from dust and all go back to dust” (Kohelet 3:19<i>–</i>20).
The knowledge that he will die gives Kohelet the feeling that there is no point to his life. We have no idea what will happen, after our death, to what we have achieved in life. Death makes mockery of virtue: the hero may die young while the coward lives to old age. And bereavement is tragic in a different way. To lose those we love is to have the fabric of our life torn, perhaps irreparably. Death defiles in the simplest, starkest sense: mortality opens an abyss between us and God’s eternity.
The person in more recent times who most deeply experienced and expressed what Kohelet felt was the Russian writer Leo Tolstoy, who told the story in his essay “A Confession.” By the time he wrote it, in his early fifties, he had already published two of the greatest novels ever written, <i>War and Peace</i> and <i>Anna Karenina</i>. His literary legacy was secure. His greatness was universally recognised. He was married, with children. He had a large estate. His health was good. Yet he was overcome with a sense of the meaninglessness of life in the face of the knowledge that we will all die. He quoted Kohelet at length. He contemplated suicide. The question that haunted him was: “Is there any meaning in my life that will not be annihilated by the inevitability of death which awaits me?”
He searched for an answer in science, but all it told him was that “in the infinity of space and the infinity of time, infinitely small particles mutate with infinite complexity.” Science deals in causes and effects, not purpose and meaning. In the end, he concluded that only religious faith rescues life from meaninglessness. “Rational knowledge, as presented by the learned and wise, negates the meaning of life.” What he felt was needed was something other than rational knowledge. “Faith is the force of life. If a man lives, then he must believe in something…. If he does understand the illusion of the finite, he is bound to believe in the infinite. Without faith it is impossible to live.”
That is why, to defeat the defilement of contact with death, there must be a ritual that bypasses rational knowledge. Hence the rite of the Red Heifer, in which death is dissolved in the waters of life, and those on whom it is sprinkled are made pure again so that they can enter the precincts of the <i>Shekhina</i> and re-establish contact with eternity.
These days, we no longer perform the seven-day purification ritual that involves the Red Heifer but we do have the <i>shiva</i>, the seven days of mourning during which we are comforted by others and thus reconnected with life. Our grief is gradually dissolved by the contact with friends and family, as the ashes of the heifer were dissolved in the “living water.” We emerge, still bereaved, but to some extent cleansed, purified, able again to face life.
<b>I believe that we can emerge from the shadow of death if we allow ourselves to be healed by the God of life. To do so, though, we need the help of others.</b> “A prisoner cannot release himself from prison,” says the Talmud. It took a <i>kohen</i> to sprinkle the waters of cleansing. It takes comforters to lift our grief. <b>But faith – faith from the world of <i>ḥok</i>, deeper than the rational mind – can help cure our deepest fears.</b>
<b>QUESTION TO PONDER</b>
<i>How can this message help us deal with the crises we face that threaten life (such as global pandemics)?</i>
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>The Holocaust survivors I have come to know are astonishing in their tenacious hold on life. Perhaps it’s how they survived. Some believed in God, others didn’t, but they all believed in life – not life as most of us understand it, something taken for granted, part of the background, a fact that rarely holds our attention, but life as something to fight for, as a consciously articulated value, as something of whose fragility you are constantly aware. They had, in Paul Tillich’s phrase, the “courage to be.”
<b><i>Future Tense,</i> 253</b>
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>Why do you think proximity to death causes impurity?
What is the benefit of having a mitzva designed to “bypass the rational brain”?
How is the purpose of <i>shiva</i> similar to the idea of the Red Heifer?
<b>EDUCATIONAL COMPANION TO THE QUESTIONS</b>
<b><i>IN A NUTSHELL</i></b><br>There are many approaches to this question. Some that a younger person may relate to include that we don’t always understand what we are told to do, but if we trust the person instructing us (for example, our parents, or in this case, God) knows more than us about what is best for us, then we do it anyway. Our motivation could also be to show them that we love them, carrying out their wishes even if we do not understand them.
<b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>All humans live in the knowledge that they are mortal and will one day die. The fear of the unknown surrounding death is a natural emotion, and throughout our lives we have to find ways to live life despite this fear.
Water represents life. Vegetation and animals are dependent on water for their very existence. It symbolises continuity, the flow of life, and the potential of rebirth. This reminds us that while the body may die (as represented by the slaughtering of the Red Heifer), the spirit lives on. “A generation dies but another is born. Lives may end but life does not. Those who live after us continue what we began, and we live on in them. Life is a never-ending stream, and a trace of us is carried onwards to the future.”
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br>This story is about a man called Marc Weinberg, who was a dear friend. He lived his life to the full, even during his illness. He showed us how to do the same, how to maximise life always, until the end, despite the sense of our own mortality. Learning about and remembering the inspiring way that he lived helps us to focus on embracing life even while feeling the sadness of his death.
The Red Heifer ceremony is an elaborate ritual with symbolic reminders of life. We take a pure animal (with hair the colour of blood) and end its life, as all lives inevitably will end. Yet we then dissolve its ashes into water, which represents life and continuity. The ceremony reminds us to focus on life rather than death. It reminds us that if we create a legacy before we die, we can live beyond our years.
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>The Covid global pandemic, for example, created fear, and a reminder of the reality of death was pervasive. So many people prematurely lost their lives due to this relentless virus, as well as suffering other secondary difficulties surrounding Covid-19, such as loneliness and separation, illness, both physical and mental, and economic hardships. It is understandable that at times such as this it is hard to focus on and embrace life. The message of the Red Heifer can give us some perspective on the blessings we have, to help us to continue to live our life to the fullest, within the confines of what is safe and possible.
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>Ritual impurity in Judaism is caused by proximity to death, or to unfulfilled potential for life. The laws of ritual impurity are there to sensitise us to the value of life by making us aware of death, or absence of life, in all its forms.
We are not fully rational animals, and we can make mistakes if we think we are. We have a limbic system, an emotional brain as well as a rational brain. Fear of death is an emotional experience, and to live with it we need a moral system that can bypass the rational thought system and speak to the more emotional parts of our brains.
The seven-day mourning period known as <i>shiva</i>, during which we are comforted by others while experiencing grief from the recent loss of a loved one, reconnects the mourner with life. Our grief is gradually dissolved by the contact with friends and family, just as the ashes of the heifer were dissolved in the “living water.” We emerge, still bereaved, but to some extent cleansed, purified, able again to face life. <i>Shiva</i> pulls the mourner back into the land of the living, preventing them from fixating on their grief and matters of death.

II; Losing Miriam

<big><strong>II. Losing Miriam</strong></big><br><b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>It is a shocking scene. The people complain that there is no water. It is a predictable complaint. This is what happens in a desert. Moshe should have been able to handle it. He has been through far tougher challenges in his time. Yet suddenly, he explodes in anger: “‘Listen, you rebels, shall we bring you water out of this rock?’ Moshe raised his hand and struck the rock twice with his staff” (Bemidbar 20:10–11). What made this trial different? Why did Moshe lose control?
The Torah has told of two previous episodes where Moshe has faced this same challenge. One took place at Mara, almost immediately after the splitting of the Red Sea. The people found water but it was bitter. Moshe prayed to God, God told him how to sweeten the water, and the episode passed.
The second episode occurred at Refidim (Shemot 17:1–7). This time, there was no water at all. Moshe scolded the people, then turned to God and said, “What am I to do with this people?” God told him to go to a rock at Ḥorev, take his staff, and hit the rock. Moshe did so, and water came out. There was drama, tension, and resolution, with nothing like the emotional distress evident in <i>Parashat Ḥukat.</i> Surely, Moshe, by now almost forty years older, with a generation of experience behind him, should have coped with this challenge without drama. He has already learned how to handle these complaints.
The text gives us a clue, but it is easy to miss. The chapter begins: “In the first month, the whole Israelite community arrived at the desert of Tzin, and they stayed at Kadesh. There Miriam died and was buried. And there was no water for the community…” (Bemidbar 20:1–2). Tradition tells of a miraculous well that accompanied the Israelites during Miriam’s lifetime, in her merit. Many commentators said this explained why this crisis was now happening. When Miriam died, the water ceased.
There is, though, another way of reading the connection. Moshe lost control because his sister Miriam had just died. He was in mourning for his eldest sibling. It is hard to lose a parent, but in some ways it is even harder to lose a brother or sister. They are our generation.
So it was not simply the Israelites’ demand for water that led Moshe to lose control of his emotions, but rather dealing with this in the midst of his own deep grief. The Israelites may have lost their water, but Moshe lost his sister, who had watched over him as a child, guided his development, supported him throughout the years, and helped him carry the burden of leadership in her own role as leader of the women.
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. What is different about Moshe’s reaction this time compared to the previous times the Israelites complained that there was no water to drink?</i>
<i>2. Do you think Moshe’s reaction was understandable? Was it fair?</i>
<i>3. What do you think was underlying the grief Moshe was experiencing?</i>
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br><i>Hannah Senesh was born in Budapest, Hungary, in 1921. She grew up in a Zionist home that was passionate about the Jewish national movement and the land of Israel. She fulfilled her lifelong dream of aliya in 1939 at the age of eighteen. She joined Kibbutz Sedot Yam near Caesarea and also enrolled in the Hagana, the pre-state Jewish army, to fight for the future Jewish state.</i>
<i>In 1943, the British Army were looking for volunteers to join their fight against the Nazis in Europe and, without hesitation, Hannah signed up to be a paratrooper. On June 7, 1944, at the height of the deportation of Hungarian Jews to Auschwitz, she was one of thirty-seven Jewish parachutists from Palestine to be parachuted by the British Army into Yugoslavia. Their mission was to assist in the rescue of Hungarian Jews about to be deported. She was captured by the Hungarian police, and endured months of cruel torture, but she showed tremendous courage and refused to divulge any information.</i>
<i>Throughout her ordeal she remained unwavering in her bravery, and when she was executed by a firing squad on November 7, 1944, she refused the blindfold, staring squarely at her executors and her fate. She was only twenty-three years old. After the establishment of the State of Israel, her body was reinterred on Har Herzl along with the other heroes and leaders of the nation.</i>
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. What did Hannah Senesh have in common with Miriam?</i>
<i>2. Would you also describe Miriam as courageous?</i>
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>Miriam was more than a sister to Moshe.
In a truly remarkable passage, the Sages wrote that Miriam persuaded her father Amram, the leading scholar of his generation, to annul his decree that Hebrew husbands should divorce their wives and have no more children because there was a fifty per cent chance that any child born would be killed. “Your decree,” said Miriam, “is worse than Pharaoh’s. He only decreed against the males; yours applies to females also. He intends to rob children of life in this world; you would deny them even life in the World to Come.” Amram admitted her superior logic. Husbands and wives were reunited. Yokheved became pregnant and Moshe was born. Note that this midrash, told by the Sages, unambiguously implies that a six-year-old girl had more faith and wisdom than the leading rabbi of the generation!
She was still a young child when she followed the course of the wicker basket holding her baby brother as it drifted down the Nile. She then had the courage and ingenuity to approach Pharaoh’s daughter and suggest that she employ a Hebrew nurse for the child, thus ensuring that Moshe would grow up knowing his family, his people, and his identity.
Moshe surely knew what he owed his elder sister. According to the midrash, without her he would not have been born. According to the plain sense of the text, he would not have grown up knowing who his true parents were and to which people he belonged. Though they were separated during his years of exile in Midyan, Miriam accompanied him throughout his mission once Moshe returned to lead the people. She was the one to lead the women in song after they crossed the sea.
Moshe mourned the loss of Miriam, and furthermore felt the loss of her leadership. It is a moment that reminds us of words from the book of Shofetim said by Israel’s chief of staff, Barak, to its judge and leader Devora: “If you go with me, I will go, but if you do not go with me, I cannot go” (Shofetim 4:8). The relationship between Barak and Devora was not as close as the one between Moshe and Miriam, yet Barak acknowledged his dependence on a wise and courageous woman. Can Moshe have felt less?
Bereavement leaves us deeply vulnerable. In the midst of loss we can find it hard to control our emotions. We make mistakes. We act rashly. We suffer from a momentary lack of judgement. These are common symptoms even for ordinary humans like us. In Moshe’s case, however, there was an additional factor. He was a prophet, and grief can block or eclipse the prophetic spirit. Moshe, the greatest of all the prophets, remained in touch with God. It was God, after all, who told him to “speak to the rock.” But somehow the message did not penetrate his consciousness fully. That was the effect of grief.
So the details are, in truth, secondary to the human drama played out that day. Yes, Moshe did things he might not have done, should not have done. He struck the rock, said “we” instead of “God,” and lost his temper with the people. The real story, though, is about Moshe the human being in an onslaught of grief, vulnerable, exposed, caught in a whirl of emotions, suddenly without the sisterly presence that had been the most important bass note of his life. Miriam had been the precociously wise and plucky child who had taken control of the situation when the life of her three-month-old brother lay in the balance, undaunted by either an Egyptian princess or a rabbi-father. She had led the Israelite women in song. The Midrash speaks of her as the woman in whose merit the people had water in a parched land. In Moshe’s anguish at the rock, we sense the loss of the elder sister without whom he felt bereft and alone.
The story of the moment Moshe lost his confidence and calm is ultimately less about leadership and crisis, or about a staff and a rock, than about a great Jewish woman, Miriam, appreciated fully only when she was no longer there.
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>It was a devastating tragedy. A young man, brilliant, gifted, with a devoted wife and two beautiful young children, was diagnosed with leukaemia. For two and a half years, helped by advanced medical technology and lifted by the prayers of friends, he fought with all his strength against the civil war taking place within his body. In the end it was all too much, and two weeks ago he died.
If any of us had been so minded, here was a supreme trial of faith. This was no ordinary young man. He was a person of the most profound religious belief and practice, who spent every spare moment of his crowded, short life helping others and bringing out the best in them, who by the sheer force of his example became a leader who transformed lives, whether as a youth leader, a student, a teacher, or as a builder of communities. He taught people the power of possibility and helped them become better than they thought they were.
“Is this the religious life, and this its reward?” asked the Rabbis. “Shall the Judge of all the earth not do justice?” asked Avraham. There are moments that can shake your faith to its foundations. Yet, as I stood at his funeral, this was not the feeling that swept over me. Instead I felt a strange, quite unexpected access of faith….
We wept that day. I believe God wept too. Shmuel Yosef Agnon, the Nobel Prize-winning writer, once speculated that Kaddish, the Jewish prayer for the dead, speaks not about human death but about divine life, as if it were our way of offering comfort to God for the loss of one of His children. Mortality is written into the human condition, but so too is the possibility of immortality, in the good we do that continues, long after we are here, to beget further good. There are lives that defeat death and redeem existence from tragedy. We knew, that day, that we had known one of them.
<b>“Credo,” <i>The Times,</i> July 17, 2010</b>
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. What are the different approaches to grief found in this excerpt?</i>
<i>2. What does it mean that “there are lives that defeat death and redeem existence from tragedy”?</i>
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>Why did the grief experienced by Moshe at the death of Miriam affect him so deeply?
Do you think the people were also grieving Miriam’s death?
Do you think this human side to Moshe makes him a weak leader, or a more powerful leader and role model?
<b>EDUCATIONAL COMPANION TO THE QUESTIONS</b>
<b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>In this instance, Moshe directs his frustration at the people directly, while previously he channelled his frustration to God, and turned to Him in prayer. God responded by calming him with a practical plan to solve the issue. In this instance, Moshe seems to have less patience and understanding.
It may be understandable. He was under immense stress and was low on emotional reserves due to the personal grief that he was experiencing because of the loss of his sister. However, this does not mean it was a fair or appropriate reaction for a great leader. We make high demands on our leaders, that they put their own personal feelings aside as they dedicate themselves to their flock.
The grief for a sibling is particularly intense and challenging because the bereaved must come to terms with their own mortality. In this case, there was the added dimension that Miriam had played such an important role in Moshe’s life, both when he was a child and after becoming the leader of the Jewish people.
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br>Both took on courageous leadership roles, starting at a young age. Both dedicated their lives to helping the Jewish people. And of course, both were women (living in times when most leadership roles were taken by men).
There were many illustrations of Miriam’s bravery. For example, she put herself at personal risk to approach Pharaoh’s daughter and suggest her mother as a nurse for baby Moshe. Even her role as a leader among the women after the splitting of the Sea of Reeds, leading them in a song of praise, was an act of initiative and courage.
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>Grief, especially when caused by tragedy, can lead to a crisis of faith, a “supreme trial of faith.” But it can equally connect one to God, strengthening faith, described here as a “quite unexpected access of faith.” Rabbi Sacks (in the name of S. Y. Agnon) here refers to a third approach, whereby we find ourselves comforting God in His moment of grief at a lost child, and we do this by saying Kaddish.
Sometimes death can remind us of the “possibility of immortality, in the good we do that continues, long after we are here.” The good we do lives on, and when we live life as a role model, others will follow in our path long after we are gone.
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>Apart from the normal grief experienced when a loved one is lost, there is an added dimension to this when the departed is a sibling (and from the same generation), forcing the bereaved to face the emotional challenge of coming to terms with their own mortality. In this case, there was also the third dimension that Miriam had played such an important role in his life, both when Moshe was a child and when he was the leader of the Jewish people. In fact, Moshe owed his very existence and identity to her, as it was Miriam who convinced their parents to continue having children, and she also made sure Moshe knew who he really was by arranging for their mother to be his nurse in the court of Pharaoh’s daughter.
Perhaps the people’s unreasonable reaction to the loss of water after Miriam’s death was also due to their own grief. She was, after all, a leader of the nation, providing a constant source of leadership and inspiration.
Role models and leaders who show their human side demonstrate to the people that they understand their own reality, what it means to be a human, and have a deeper self-awareness and emotional intelligence. To know that Moshe felt the same emotions as the people must have been comforting and inspiring to them.

Balak

In a Nutshell

<b><i>IN A NUTSHELL</i></b><br>Balak is the king of Moav, a country next to the land of Israel. He becomes scared when he hears that the Israelites are heading his way. Together with the elders of Midyan (another country near Israel), he tries to hire the famous non-Jewish prophet Bilam to curse the Israelites. Bilam asks God what he should do, and God tells him not to go with them. But the Moabites and Midianites return to ask him again, this time with a better offer. God tells Bilam that if he goes, he must only say the words God puts in his mouth.
Then a strange thing happens. Bilam’s donkey sees an angel blocking their way and stops walking, so Bilam strikes her, and the donkey speaks to him. Bilam is then able to see the angel, who reminds Bilam to only use the words God gives him. After that, Bilam and the king climb a mountain above the Israelite camp to prepare for Bilam’s curse. They try three times to prepare altars and sacrifices, but each time, Bilam blesses the children of Israel instead of cursing them. King Balak eventually gives up and leaves, angry and frustrated. Despite escaping Bilam’s curses, the Israelites bring disaster on themselves anyway when Moabite women convince some Israelites to have forbidden relations with them and to worship idols. Twenty-four thousand people die in a plague as punishment, until Pinḥas, in an act of passion, rises up against one of the wrongdoers and kills him.

<i>Why do people hate? Why do the leaders of Moav and Midyan hate Israel?</i>

I; The Hidden Meaning of the Bilam Story

<big><strong>I. The Hidden Meaning of the Bilam Story</strong></big><br><b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br><b>The Question:</b> Many questions have been asked about the story of Balak and Bilam and the almost-curses that turned into blessings. Was Bilam a true man of God, or was he a fraud, a magician, a sorcerer, a practitioner of dark arts? Did he have genuine powers? Was he really – as some of the Sages said – the equal of Moshe? Was he motivated by money and honour from the Moabites and Midianites, or was he motivated by hatred towards the Israelites and their closeness to God? Why did God first tell him <i>not</i> to go, then change His mind and tell him to go? What is the meaning of the story of the talking donkey? Did it really happen, or was it, as Rambam argued, a vision in Bilam’s mind?
These are important questions. But to really understand this story, first we must examine the fundamental question: What is the story doing here at all? The entire episode occurred away from the Israelites. No one from their side, not even Moshe, even knew about it. The only witnesses were Balak, Bilam, and some Moabite princes. Had the Israelites known the danger they were in, and how they were saved from it, maybe they would have thought twice before engaging in immoral behaviour with the Moabite women, in the story immediately after the story of Bilam. They would have known that the Moabites were not their friends.
Even Moshe only knew that this happened after God told him later on. In short, the Israelites were rescued from a danger they knew nothing about by a deliverance they knew nothing about. How then did it, or could it, affect them?
Besides which, why did God permit Bilam to go at all? He said no the first time. He could have said no the second time also. The curses would have been avoided, Israel would have been protected, and there would have been no need for the angel, the talking donkey, and the various locations, sacrifices, and attempted curses. The entire drama seems to have been unnecessary.
God only needed Bilam to recite the promise He gave to Avraham: “I will bless those who bless you, and whoever curses you I will curse” (Bereshit 12:3). And Bilam did eventually say this. Why did God also put into Bilam’s mouth the famous and extraordinary poetry – “<i>Ma tovu ohalekha Yaakov</i>,” “How beautiful are your tents Yaakov”?
Who was this episode for? What was the intended change it was meant to bring about? Who was its target audience? It did not affect the Moabites. They proceeded to get their women to successfully lead astray the Israelite men. A plague then struck the Israelites, taking twenty-four thousand lives.
It did not affect the Midianites, whose hatred for Israel was so great that God later told Moshe: “Treat the Midianites as enemies and kill them” (Bemidbar 25:17). Several chapters later, God instructed Moshe to take military vengeance against them (Bemidbar 31).
It did not affect Bilam himself. The Torah is very subtle about this. Six chapters after the incident of the Moabite women, we read that in the course of the war against the Midianites, Bilam was killed (31:8). Then, several verses after that, “They were the ones who followed Bilam’s advice and enticed the Israelites to be unfaithful to the Lord in the Peor incident, so that a plague struck the Lord’s people” (31:16). In other words, having gone through the powerful experience of finding curses turned to God’s blessings in his mouth, Bilam remained full of hatred for the people he had blessed, and plotted against them.
It did not change the Israelites, who remained vulnerable to the Moabites and Midianites, and to the temptations they brought. It did not change Moshe, who left it to Pinḥas to take the decisive act that stopped the plague and was soon after told that Yehoshua would succeed him as leader.
There are a lot of questions raised here. In essence, we are asking: what did this episode achieve and what must we learn from it?

<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. How does this story connect to the message of the story of Bilam and Balak?</i>
<i>2. How does the quote by MLK connect to the story and to the message from the</i> parasha?
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br><b>The Answer:</b> Although it did not change the Moabites, Midianites, Israelites, Bilam, or Moshe, this incident <i>does</i> play a significant role in the story of our people. We are reminded of it time and again. In Devarim, Moshe reminds the people that the Moabites “did not come to meet you with bread and water on your way when you came out of Egypt, and they hired Bilam son of Beor from Petor in Aram Naharayim to curse you. However, the Lord your God would not listen to Bilam but turned the curse into a blessing for you, because the Lord your God loves you” (Devarim 23:4–5).
Yehoshua, when he came to renew the covenant after the conquest of the land, gave an abridged summary of Jewish history, singling out this event for attention: “When Balak son of Tzipor, the king of Moav, prepared to fight against Israel, he sent for Bilam son of Beor to put a curse on you. But I would not listen to Bilam, so he blessed you again and again, and I delivered you out of his hand” (Yehoshua 24:9–10).
The prophet Mikha, younger contemporary of Yeshayahu, said in the name of God, “My people, remember what Balak king of Moav plotted and what Bilam son of Beor answered,” just before he delivers his famous summary of the religious life: “He has shown you, O man, what is good and what the Lord requires of you: to act justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with your God” (Mikha 6:5, 8).
At the culmination of the reforms instituted by Ezra and Neḥemya after the Babylonian exile, Neḥemya had the Torah read to the people, reminding them that an Amonite or Moabite may not enter “the assembly of the Lord” because “they did not meet the Israelites with food and water but had hired Bilam to call a curse down on them. Our God, however, turned the curse into a blessing” (Neḥemya 13:2).
So why the significance of an event that seemingly had no impact on any of the parties involved, made no difference to what happened thereafter, and yet was deemed to be so important that it occupied a central place in the telling of Israel’s story by Moshe, Yehoshua, Mikha, and Neḥemya?
The answer is important. We often wonder why God made a covenant with a people who repeatedly proved to be ungrateful, disobedient, and faithless. God Himself threatened twice to destroy the people (after the Golden Calf and the episode of the spies). At the end of our <i>parasha</i>, He sent a plague against them. There were other devoted and religious peoples in the ancient world. The Torah calls Malki Tzedek, Avraham’s contemporary, “a priest of God Most High” (Bereshit 14:18). Yitro, Moshe’s father-in-law, was a Midianite priest who gave his son-in-law sound advice as to how to lead. In the book of Yona, during the storm, while Yona was sleeping, the gentile sailors were praying. When the prophet arrived at Nineveh and delivered his warning, immediately the people repented, something that happened rarely in Yehuda/Israel. Malakhi, the last of the prophets, says: “From where the sun rises to where it sets, My name is honoured among the nations…said the Lord of Hosts – but <i>you</i> profane it” (Malakhi 1:11–12).
Why then choose Israel? <b>The answer is: love.</b> Virtually all the prophets said so. God loves Israel. He loved Avraham. He loves Avraham’s children. He is often exasperated by their conduct, but He cannot relinquish that love. He explains this to the prophet Hoshea. Go and marry a woman who is unfaithful, He says. She will break your heart, but you will still love her, and take her back (Hos. 1–3).
Where in the Torah does God express this love? <i>In the blessings of Bilam</i>. That is where He gives voice to His feelings for this people. “I see them from the mountain tops, gaze on them from the heights: this is a people that dwells apart, not reckoned among the nations.” “Lo, a people that rises like a lion, leaps up like the king of beasts.” “How good are your tents, O Yaakov, your dwellings, O Israel!” These famous words are not Bilam’s. They are God’s – the most eloquent expression of His love for this small, otherwise undistinguished people.
Bilam is the most unlikely vehicle for God’s blessings. But that is God’s way. He chose an aged, infertile couple to be the grandparents of the Jewish people. He chose a man who couldn’t speak to be His voice. He chose Bilam, who hated Israel, to be the messenger of His love. Moshe explains: “The Lord your God would not listen to Bilam but turned the curse into a blessing for you, <i>because the Lord</i> <i>your God loves you</i>.”
That is what the story is about: not Balak, or Bilam, or Moav, or Midyan, or what happened next. It is about God’s love for a people, their strength, resilience, their willingness to be different, their family life (tents, dwelling places), and their ability to outlive empires. <b>I believe all God’s acts have a moral message for us. God is teaching us that love can turn curses into blessings. It is the only force capable of defeating hate. Love heals the wounds of the world.</b>
<b>QUESTION TO PONDER</b>
<i>How can we apply this message to our lives today?</i>
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>The Jewish way is to rescue hope from tragedy. However dark the world, love still heals. Goodness still redeems. Terror, by defeating others, ultimately defeats itself, while the memory of those who offer kindness to strangers lives on.
<b><i>Future Tense</i>, 20</b>
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>What is distinct and unique about the story of Bilam and Balak compared to other stories in the Torah?
How can a story about God’s love for Israel help all of us (both Jews and non-Jews) to live our lives?
How can the message “Only love can defeat hate” help in times of social unrest around the world?
<b>EDUCATIONAL COMPANION TO THE QUESTIONS</b>
<b><i>IN A NUTSHELL</i></b><br>Hatred of people who are different from ourselves is unfortunately very common. Often it comes from a tribal feeling of being threatened by outsiders. Sometimes this feeling comes from a fear of the unknown, when someone is significantly different (whether in ethnicity, culture, or beliefs). In the case of our <i>parasha</i>, Balak and the other leaders felt threatened by the Israelites as they had heard that they were a powerful people (or at least a people with a powerful God – they knew what had happened in Egypt!) and when they heard that the Israelites were marching towards them, the Moabites and Midianites were afraid their intention was to conquer their lands.
<b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>The Torah is not a history textbook. Neither is it a book of laws or a philosophical treatise. The Torah is all of these and none of these. It does not present a comprehensive account of this period of Jewish history, and its aim is not merely to teach us what happened. We cannot guess why God chose to include some historical narratives in the Torah and leave others out (for example, much of the forty years of wandering in the desert is not presented in the Torah at all). Each narrative included is there to teach a moral truth of some sort. The subject of this <i>Covenant &amp; Conversation</i> essay is the moral truth behind the story of Bilam and Balak, and why this story was included in the Torah.
There are many messages and moral truths available to be taken away from this story. Rabbi Sacks gives one answer. Others may have other ideas, such as the concept of divine providence and the role God takes in the destiny of peoples and the world in general; the blessing God ultimately gave to the Israelites through the mouth of Bilam contains many truths; the character of Bilam is also something we can learn from.
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br>According to Rabbi Sacks, the message of this story is: “Love can turn curses into blessings. It is the only force capable of defeating hate. Love heals the wounds of the world.” Ken Nwadike travels America showing love to all people, on both sides of many conflicts. He attempts to show that love is stronger than hate, and by showing love he de-escalates tense situations that threaten to become violent. He believes that love will ultimately heal all wounds and close all divides.
The quote from MLK echoes Nwadike’s message about love. Hating those who hate will not end hate in the world but only increase hate. Love is the only force that can truly conquer hate. And to do this we must multiply love in the world. This is what Ken Nwadike attempts to do with his Free Hugs Project. This is also the message of the story in our <i>parasha</i> – love can turn a curse into a blessing. Only love can defeat hate!
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>Every day we have choices to make. We meet people and have to decide how to relate to them. Sometimes it will be justified to disagree and argue with them, and debate and dialogue is a good thing. However, the message here is rather than choosing to be right, choose to be kind. Every person is fighting a battle we may never be aware of. Strive to see people in all their complexities and choose to show compassion and love.
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>What is most unique about this story is that it is a sub-plot that does not directly involve any of the main characters and protagonists of the main narrative. In fact, until God informs Moshe, he and the rest of the people are completely unaware that this has been happening nearby. Yet the Torah shares the story with us because of the moral messages available to learn from it.
God’s message here is that He chose the most unlikely of messengers to deliver His blessing of love to an undistinguished people. God does not value power, wealth, or size. He does not only speak to holy prophets. Anyone can be a conduit for His word, and anyone can be the object of His love. The Jewish God is the God of the weak and of the underdog. We can re-evaluate our values to align with God’s, and spread love as wide and as far as we can.
We are living through difficult times, when racism and hatred can be found even in the most open and free of societies. There is much pain and hurt in society, and sometimes this has been expressed through conflict. The only way to truly banish hate is to increase love in the world in whichever form we can do this. “Hate cannot drive out hate. Only love can do that.”

II; Not Reckoned Among the Nations

<big><strong>II. Not Reckoned Among the Nations</strong></big><br><b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>Some of the most beautiful things ever said about the Jewish people were said by Bilam. “Who can count the dust of Yaakov…. How beautiful are your tents, Yaakov, your dwelling places, Israel!… A star will come out of Yaakov; a sceptre will rise out of Israel.”
One of these blessings is among the most famous descriptions ever given of the people of Israel: “It is a nation dwelling alone, not reckoned among the nations” (Bemidbar 23:9). But what does this mean?
There is an explanation that has become popular in modern times, that it is Israel’s destiny to be isolated, friendless, hated, abandoned, and alone, as if antisemitism were somehow written into the script of history. I do not believe this. It isn’t. None of the prophets said so. To the contrary, they believed that the nations of the world would eventually recognise Israel’s God and come to worship Him in the Temple in Jerusalem. Zekharya foresees a day when “ten people from all languages and nations will take firm hold of one Jew by the hem of his robe and say, ‘Let us go with you, because we have heard that God is with you’” (Zekharya 8:23). There is nothing destined or inevitable about antisemitism.
What then do Bilam’s words mean? “It is a nation dwelling alone, not reckoned among the nations.” Ibn Ezra says they mean that unlike all other nations, even when we are a tiny group surrounded by many in a non-Jewish culture, Jews will not assimilate. Ramban says that it means our culture and faith will remain pure, not a mix of multiple traditions and nationalities. Netziv gives the interpretation which was a clear warning to the Jews of his time, that “if Jews live distinctive and apart from others they will dwell safely, but if they seek to emulate ‘the nations’ they ‘will not be reckoned’ as anything special at all.”
There is, however, another possibility, ironically hinted at by an antisemitic writer, G. K. Chesterton. He famously wrote that America was “a nation with the soul of a church” and “the only nation in the world founded on a creed (religious belief).” But in fact, America is not the only nation that can be described in this way. This is precisely what made Israel different – and when America was first formed, it was strongly influenced by the idea of biblical Israel and the Jewish concept of covenant. Ancient Israel was indeed founded on a creed, and was, as a result, a nation with the soul of a religion. When Bilam described the Jewish people as “not reckoned among the nations,” he was highlighting what made Israel unique. The Jewish people are unique in that they are both a nation and a religion.
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. Why is it tempting to interpret the words, “a nation dwelling alone, not reckoned among the nations” to mean that Israel’s destiny is to be isolated, friendless, and hated?</i>
<i>2. Do you think one day we will live in a world without antisemitism?</i>
<i>3. What makes a nation a nation? How is the Jewish nation unique?</i>
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br><i>It once happened on the battlefield between two warring nations that Jew faced Jew in mortal combat. As one of the Jewish soldiers ran for cover into a foxhole, the other called out, “Surrender, or I’ll shoot!” The hiding soldier, quivering in fear, closed his eyes, and crying, recited the familiar words from his childhood:</i> “Shema Yisrael, Hashem Elokeinu, Hashem eḥad.<i>” As the other soldier heard these words, he responded with surprise and emotion, “</i>Barukh shem kevod malkhuto le’olam va’ed<i>.” As he laid down his gun, he extended a hand to his former enemy, and they embraced as brothers.</i>
<i>This story has been told at different times in history, of different wars (including World War I and the Falklands conflict in 1982) and could theoretically have happened in any war between two armies that had Jewish soldiers fighting each other.</i>
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. Did these soldiers share a religious identity, a national identity, or both?</i>
<i>2. Can you belong to more than one nation? What is your national identity?</i>
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>As we explored in the <i>parasha</i> of <i>Behaalotekha</i>, nations, both ancient and modern, have always arisen out of historical factors. A group of people live in a land, develop a shared culture, form a society, and thus become a nation.
Jews, certainly from the Babylonian exile onwards, had none of the conventional attributes of a nation. They did not live in the same land. Some lived in Israel, others in Babylon, yet others in Egypt. Later they would be scattered throughout the world. They did not share a language of everyday speech, as they learned the language of the country where they lived. Rashi spoke French; Rambam spoke Arabic. There were many Jewish vernaculars, such as the versions of Yiddish, Ladino, and other regional Jewish dialects. They did not live under the same political dispensation. They did not share the same cultural environment. And Jews in different countries experienced different golden ages and hard times. Yet we always saw ourselves, and were seen by others, as one nation: the world’s first, and for a long time, the world’s only, global people.
What then made them a nation? This was the question Rabbi Saadia Gaon asked in the tenth century, to which he gave the famous answer: “Our nation is only a nation in virtue of its laws (<i>torot</i>).” They were the people defined by the Torah, a nation under the sovereignty of God. Having received, uniquely, their laws before they even entered their land, they remained bound by those selfsame laws even when they lost the land. Of no other nation has this ever been true.
Uniquely then, in Judaism, religion and nationhood coincide. There are nations with many religions: multicultural Britain is one among many. There are religions governing many nations: Christianity and Islam are obvious examples. Only in the case of Judaism is there a one-to-one correlation between religion and nationhood. Without Judaism there would be nothing (except antisemitism) to connect Jews across the world. And without the Jewish nation, Judaism would cease to be what it has always been, the faith of a people bound by a bond of collective responsibility to one another and to God. Bilam was right. The Jewish people really are unique. Nothing therefore could be more mistaken than to define Jewishness as a mere ethnicity. If ethnicity is a form of culture, then Jews are not one ethnicity but many. In Israel, Jews are a walking lexicon of almost every ethnicity under the sun. If ethnicity is another word for race, then conversion to Judaism would be impossible (you cannot convert to become Caucasian; you cannot change your race at will).
What makes Jews “a nation dwelling alone, not reckoned among the nations” is that their nationhood is not a matter of geography, politics, or ethnicity. It is a matter of religious vocation as God’s covenant partners, summoned to be a living example of a nation among the nations made distinctive by its faith and way of life. Lose that and we lose the one thing that was and remains the source of our singular contribution to the heritage of humankind. When we forget this, sadly, God arranges for people like Bilam and Chesterton to remind us otherwise. We should not need such reminding.
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>Uniquely, Jews are born into a faith. It chooses us before we choose it. Physically we come into this world without any possessions, but spiritually we each come with a gift: the story of our past, of our parents and theirs, through almost forty centuries from the day Avraham and Sara first heard the call of God and began their journey to a land, a promise, a destiny, and a vocation. That story is ours.
It is a strange and moving story. It tells of how a family, then a collection of tribes, then a nation, were summoned to be God’s ambassadors on earth. They were charged with building a society unlike any other, based not on wealth and power but on justice and compassion, the dignity of the individual and the sanctity of human life – a society that would honour the world as God’s work and the human person as God’s image.
That was and is a demanding task, yet Judaism remains a realistic religion. It assumed from the outset that transforming the world would take many generations – hence the importance of handing on our ideals to the next generation. It takes many gifts, many different kinds of talent – hence the importance of Jews as a people. None of us has all the gifts, but each of us has some. We all count; we each have a unique contribution to make. We come before God as a people, each giving something, and each lifted by the contributions of others.
And yes, at times we fail or fall short – hence the importance of <i>teshuva</i>, repentance, apology, forgiveness, rededication. Judaism is bigger than any of us, yet it is made by all of us. And though Jews were and are a tiny people, today a mere fifth of a per cent of the population of the world, we have made a contribution to civilisation out of all proportion to our numbers.
To be a Jew is to continue the journey our ancestors began, to build a world that honours the image of God in every human being and to be part of a people summoned by God to be His ambassadors down here on earth.
<b>Ten Paths to God<i> – Identity: On Being a Jew,</i> 3</b>
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. What makes the Jewish people a nation?</i>
<i>2. What makes the Jewish people a religion?</i>
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>Do you feel more affinity and brotherhood towards a non-Jewish citizen of the country in which you live or a Jew from another part of the world?
Why is being Jewish not an ethnicity?
What is unique about the Jewish people that means they are “a nation dwelling alone, not reckoned among the nations”?
<b>EDUCATIONAL COMPANION TO THE QUESTIONS</b>
<b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>This way of reading these words resonates because this is the experience of the Jewish people throughout their history. Rarely, if ever, has there been a time in Jewish history when there was no persecution and antisemitism facing some Jews in some place (at the original time of publication, Rabbi Sacks had just delivered a speech in the House of Lords about the recent escalation in worldwide antisemitism.) To interpret this as a defining characteristic of what it means to be God’s people gives this historical experience meaning, and solves various theological problems (such as: “If we are God’s chosen people why do we face continual persecution?”). This is a tempting interpretation of Jewish history, but one that Rabbi Sacks rejects.
Rabbi Sacks certainly did. That is why he rejected the idea that it is the destiny of the Jewish people. Perhaps this can only happen when the world rids itself of all forms of prejudice, and maybe this will only be in a Messianic age. Perhaps when humanity finally manages to rid the world of all forms of prejudice, this will herald the Messianic time.
Nations are defined through historical and geographic factors, such as geographic location (land), shared culture and language, and historical narrative. Beliefs, on the other hand, sometimes change. One can convert to join a new religion, and one can leave a religious community when one no longer believes in its creed. Judaism and the Jewish people is a unique combination of these two. As a people, we share a history and a fate. As a religion, we are a community of faith with a common creed and belief system. This means that Judaism does accept conversion into the Jewish people, while also not considering Jews who stop believing in Judaism as lost to the Jewish people.
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br>Rabbi Sacks presents Jewish identity here as national as well as religious. In this respect, he believes that these two soldiers are both members of a Jewish nation. When these soldiers looked at each other in the eye, did they see an enemy soldier from a rival nation, or a brother and fellow member of the Jewish people? This story may or may not have actually taken place (and it may have even happened in more than one period). What is clear is that Jews have faced each other in combat over time, and may have found themselves facing an identity crisis such as this.
Opinions differ on this. Perhaps it is possible to be a member of two nations, without one being the dominant identity. This must be approached in a personal way, allowing the individual to create their own self-definition and self-identity. The question is often framed in the following way: Are you a British Jew or a Jewish Briton (replace British for American or any other national identity)? What is your core identity, and can you have a dual core identity?
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>The Jewish people are a nation in light of a shared history (beginning with Avraham, but on a national level this became consolidated in the experience of slavery in Egypt and the Exodus), an ancestral homeland (Israel), and a shared culture that has developed over many centuries.
The Jewish people are a religion in the way that Rabbi Sacks describes here. The Jewish people were formed with a destiny and a vision, based on religious beliefs and a national calling. A people summoned to be God’s ambassadors on earth, charged with building a society unlike any other, based on Jewish universal values. A people with a destiny and a calling, to improve the world, working every day towards bringing it to a redeemed state, and with the faith that this destiny will one day be achieved. These shared values, and this shared mission, mean that even with all the different types of Jews found in the world today, they are all members of the Jewish people, a people who share a religion, who share a destiny.
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>This question is asking for an honest appraisal of personal identity. Which is your primary identity: Jewish or the national identity of the country in which you were born or in which you live? For example, would you as a British Jew feel a stronger connection with a non-Jewish fellow British citizen, or a Jew from France, or Morocco, or America?
The Jewish nation is made of many ethnicities. If ethnicity is a social group that has a common national or cultural tradition, then there are many groupings that may be termed ethnicities within the Jewish people. Just compare the traditions and cultures of Ashkenazi, Sephardi, Yemenite, and Ethiopian Jews, for example. The Jewish people is also not a race, where race is defined as a group of persons related by common descent or heredity. Because one can convert to Judaism to gain membership to the Jewish people, the Jewish people can also not be considered a race.
The Jewish people is something else, unique to the world in this respect. Neither a nation alone, or merely a religious grouping, they are not an ethnicity or a race. To be a Jew is to be a member of a unique nation that built its foundation not on geographical or historical factors alone, but rather through a shared vision and a destiny consecrated in a covenant with God. What makes Jews “a nation dwelling alone, not reckoned among the nations” is that their nationhood is not a matter of geography, politics, or ethnicity. It is a matter of religious vocation as God’s covenant partners, summoned to be a living example of a nation among the nations, made distinctive by its faith and way of life.

Pinchas

In a Nutshell

<b><i>IN A NUTSHELL</i></b><br>Despite escaping Bilam’s curses in the last <i>parasha</i>, the Israelites bring disaster on themselves when Moabite women convince some Israelite men to have forbidden relations with them and to worship idols. Twenty-four thousand people suffer a deadly plague as punishment, until Pinḥas, in an act of passion, rises up against the wrongdoers to slay an Israelite man and Midianite woman who are sinning together publicly. Immediately, the plague ends. God gives Pinḥas a “covenant of peace” and “lasting priesthood” as a reward for this act of leadership.
The <i>parasha</i> then tells two stories. The first is about the daughters of Tzelofḥad who ask Moshe for their own share in the land of Israel because their father had no sons to inherit his portion (which would mean it would leave their family after his death). God tells Moshe that they are indeed able to inherit their father’s portion of the land. The second story is about Moshe’s request that God appoint someone to be the new leader of the people after he dies. The <i>parasha</i> ends with two chapters about the different sacrifices that should be brought daily, weekly, monthly, and on festivals.
<b>QUESTION TO PONDER</b>
<i>Was Pinḥas right to kill the man and woman who were sinning?</i>

I; Moral vs; Political Decisions

<big><strong>I. Moral vs. Political Decisions</strong></big><br><b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>The Israelites began mixing with Moabite women and were soon worshipping their gods. A plague raged and 24,000 Jewish men died. A leading Israelite, Zimri, brought a Midianite woman, Kozbi, and sinned with her in full view of Moshe and the people. It was the most shameless act of rebellion against God. Pinḥas took a spear and killed them both, and the plague immediately ended.
Was Pinḥas a hero or a murderer? On the one hand, he saved countless lives: no more people died from the plague. On the other hand, did he know that in advance? To any onlooker, he might have seemed like a man of reckless violence, caught up in anger. In our <i>parasha</i> God announces: “Pinḥas, son of Elazar, son of Aharon the priest, has turned back My anger from the Israelites by being zealous among them on My behalf, so that I did not wipe out the Israelite people in My zeal. Therefore…I am making with him My covenant of peace” (Bemidbar 25:11–12).
God declared Pinḥas a hero. He had saved the Israelites from destruction by showing a passion for God that was the antidote to the people’s faithlessness, and as a reward, God honoured him. Pinḥas acted correctly in God’s eyes.
The Rabbis of the Talmud tell us that the halakha sees things differently. Firstly, they rule that if Zimri had turned and killed Pinḥas in self-defence, he would be declared innocent in a court of law. Secondly, they rule that if Pinḥas had killed Zimri and Kozbi just before or after they were engaged in the sin, he would have been guilty of murder. Thirdly, had Pinḥas checked with a <i>beit din</i> as to whether he should act as he did, the answer would have been no. This is one of the rare cases where we say, “<i>Halakha ve’ein morin kein</i>” – “It is the law, but we do not teach people to act like this.” While the Torah gives us an answer about Pinḥas’s act, rabbinic halakha teaches us that this is not the kind of behaviour we can follow.
But God was pleased with Pinḥas, so why do the Rabbis criticise his actions? How can he have been both right and wrong? It helps to look at the story from two different perspectives. From an individual, <i>moral</i> perspective, Pinḥas should not have done what he did. He took the law into his own hands. But from a <i>political</i> perspective, he showed true leadership and protected his people – he stopped the plague and was blessed by God.
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. Why do you think the Rabbis are so uncertain about the act?</i>
<i>2. If the act was morally questionable, what is the message of the story for us?</i>
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br><i>Together with his government, the authoritarian leader made many decisions that imposed hardships on the citizens of his country</i> <i>for years. He enforced a curfew on the nation, controlling the hours when people could move around freely. He rationed food, limiting families to the basic foodstuffs, much less than they were used to. He enlisted every man who was able to fight, young and old alike, into the army. Ultimately, he sent thousands to their death.</i>

<i>1. How did you feel about this leader when you read the first paragraph (before you knew who he was)?</i>
<i>2. Did your opinion change once you learned his name? Why?</i>
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>The Coronavirus pandemic raised a series of heartbreaking moral and political dilemmas, such as: How far should governments go in seeking to prevent a virus from spreading? To what extent should they restrict people’s movements, violating their civil liberties? How far should they be allowed to clamp down on businesses, driving many bankrupt, increasing unemployment, building up national debt, and sending the economy into a severe recession?
Strikingly, almost every country adopted the same measures: social distancing and lockdowns until the number of new infections dropped. Nations didn’t count the cost. Virtually unanimously, they placed the saving of lives above all other considerations. The economy has suffered, but life is infinitely precious and saving it takes precedence over all else.
This was a momentous example of the Torah value that human life is sacred. As the Sages put it, “Every life is like a universe. Save a life and it is as if you have saved a universe” (Mishna Sanhedrin 4:4).
In the ancient world, economic considerations always took precedence over life. Great building projects like the Tower of Bavel and the Egyptian pyramids involved huge loss of life. Even in the twentieth century, lives were often sacrificed to economic ideology: between 6 and 9 million under Stalin, and between 35 and 45 million under Chinese Communism. The fact that virtually all nations, in the face of the pandemic, chose life was a significant victory for the Torah’s ethic of the sanctity of life.
That said, the former Supreme Court judge Jonathan Sumption recently wrote a challenging article in which he argued that the world, or at least Britain, had got it wrong. It was overreacting. The cure may be worse than the disease. The lockdown amounted to subjecting the population to house arrest, causing great distress and giving the police unprecedented and dangerous powers. It represented “an interference with our lives and our personal autonomy that is intolerable in a free society.” The economic impact would be devastating. “If all this is the price of saving human life, we have to ask whether it is worth paying.”
There are, he said, no absolute values in public policy. As proof, he cited the fact that we allow cars, despite knowing that they are potentially lethal weapons, and that every year thousands of people will be killed or maimed by them. In public policy there are always multiple, conflicting considerations. There are no non-negotiable absolutes, not even the sanctity of life. It was a powerful and challenging piece. Are we wrong to think that life is indeed sacred? Might we be placing too high a value on life, imposing a huge economic burden on future generations?
I am going to suggest that there is a direct connection between this argument and the story of Pinḥas. It is far from obvious, but it is fundamental. It lies in the difference – philosophical and halakhic – between <i>moral</i> and <i>political</i> decisions. Moral decisions are answers to the question, “What should I do?” Usually they are based on <i>rules that may not be transgressed whatever the consequences</i>. In Judaism, moral decisions are the province of halakha.
Political decisions are answers to the question, “What should <i>we</i> do?” where the “we” means the nation as a whole. They tend to involve several conflicting considerations, and there is rarely a clear-cut solution. Usually the decision will be based on an evaluation of the likely consequences. In Judaism this sphere is known as <i>mishpat melekh</i> (the legal domain of the king), or <i>hilkhot medina</i> (public policy regulations). Whereas halakha is timeless, public policy tends to be time-bound and situational.
Were we in Pinḥas’s position, asking, “Should I kill Zimri and Kozbi?” the <i>moral</i> answer is an unequivocal no. They may deserve to die and the whole nation may be eyewitnesses to their sin, but you cannot execute a death sentence without a duly constituted court of law, a trial, evidence, and a judicial verdict. Killing without due process is murder. That is why the Talmud rules “<i>Halakha ve’ein morin kein</i>.” If Pinḥas had asked a <i>beit din</i> first, he would have been told no. Halakha is based on non-negotiable moral principles, and halakhically you cannot commit murder even to save lives.
<i>But Pinḥas was not acting on moral principle</i>. He was making a <i>political</i> decision. There were thousands dying. The political leader, Moshe, was in a highly compromised position. How could he condemn another man for consorting with a Midianite woman when he himself had a Midianite wife? Pinḥas saw that there was no one leading. People were sinning. People were dying. The danger was immense. So he acted – <i>not on moral principle but on political calculation,</i> relying not on halakha but on what would later be known as <i>mishpat melekh</i>. Better take two lives immediately that would have eventually been sentenced to death by the court, and save thousands now. And he was right, as God soon made clear.
Now we can see exactly what was ambiguous about Pinḥas’s act. He was a private individual. The question he would normally have asked was, “What shall I do?” to which the answer is a moral one. But he acted as if he were a political leader asking, “What shall we do?” and decided, based on consequences, that this would save many lives. Essentially, he acted as if he were Moshe. He saved the day and the people. But imagine what would happen today if an ordinary member of the public usurped the role of head of state. It would be disastrous. Only God’s endorsement protected Pinḥas.
In politics, as opposed to morality, the sanctity of life is a high value, but it is not the only value. What matters are consequences. A ruler or government must act in the long-term interests of the people. That is why, though some will die as a result, governments are now gradually easing the lockdown provisions once the rate of infection falls, to relieve distress, ease the economic burden, and restore suspended civil liberties.
We have moral duties as individuals, and we make political decisions as nations. The two are different. That is what the story of Pinḥas is about. It also explains the tension in governments during the pandemic. We have a moral duty to the sanctity of life, but we also have a political duty, not just to life but also to “liberty and the pursuit of happiness.” What was beautiful about the global response to Covid-19 was that virtually every nation in the world put moral considerations ahead of political ones until the danger began to recede.
<b>I believe that there are moral and political decisions and they are different. But there is a great danger that the two may drift apart. Politics then becomes amoral, and eventually corrupt. That is why the institution of prophecy was born. Prophets hold politicians accountable to morality. When leaders act for the long-term welfare of the nation, they are not criticised. When they act for their own benefit, they are. Likewise when they undermine the people’s moral and spiritual integrity. Salvation by zealot – the Pinḥas case – is no solution. Politics must be as moral as possible if a nation is to flourish in the long run.</b>
<b>QUESTION TO PONDER</b>
<i>In the absence of prophets today, how can we ensure our political leadership keeps morality at the heart of its decision making?</i>
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>The concept of covenant has the power to transform the world. It sees relationships in terms not of interests but of moral commitment. It changes everything it touches, from marriage to friendship to economics and politics, by turning self-interested individuals into a community in pursuit of the common good…. Societies have moved from “I” to “We” in the past. They did so in the nineteenth century. They did so in the twentieth century. They can do so in the future. And it begins with us.
<b><i>Morality,</i> 336</b>
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>What are the complex elements that every government has to take into account when deciding on policy during a global pandemic?
If Pinḥas made a political decision (rather than a personal moral one), was he right to act as if he was the leader?
How does Judaism ensure that morality is at the heart of political decisions taken by the leaders?
<b>EDUCATIONAL COMPANION TO THE QUESTIONS</b>
<b><i>IN A NUTSHELL</i></b><br>This is a tricky question. We are asking for the child’s own opinion, and all opinions are legitimate. However, the Torah seems to suggest that God agreed with Pinḥas and rewarded him with a “covenant of peace” (although perhaps there was a message in the name of this covenant – you may have acted correctly, but peaceful ways of achieving your goal would have been preferable). On the other hand, as seen here, the Rabbis of the Talmud were uncomfortable with the act Pinḥas took and cast some doubt on the morality of the act.
<b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>The Rabbis were warning that this should not be seen as a precedent for individuals in the future to take the law into their own hands. A person must go through due process using the framework of the legal system, and not take the law into their own hands as Pinḥas did.
The message of the story is that sometimes leadership must make difficult moral decisions. For the sake of the well-being of the people, Pinḥas acted swiftly, showing strong leadership and zeal for God and the people by acting on his own in this way.
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br>The story is intentionally written ambiguously, allowing the reader to, at first, assume that the leader is a despot, causing suffering to his people for his own personal benefit. It is not until the reader becomes aware of the context of the story that we can understand the difficult moral decisions that had to be taken for the greater good of the people in this case.
Now that we know that the story is about Winston Churchill, who led the battle against the despotic Hitler and the evil of Nazism, saving the free world, we can see that these acts caused necessary hardships in order to ensure the greater long-term good for the British people and for the world. This connects to the message of the <i>Covenant &amp; Conversation</i> essay in the following way: The decisions Churchill took, if he were an individual, would have been morally wrong. It was unjust to cause suffering to the British people in this way. However, these were difficult political decisions taken by a government on behalf of its citizens, in order to protect them.
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>Prophets spoke truth to leadership. We may still have an equivalent process, when people as a movement stand up in protest for what they believe in. In democracies this can make change, and hold governments accountable. The ultimate power that the people have over their democratically elected leaders is their vote. Unfortunately, this process of change can take a long time.
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>Value of life is only one of the moral elements of a government’s decisions in times of crisis such as these. Protecting the economy is also a moral decision. When economies collapse, people suffer and die from poverty, and hardship can be experienced by millions. It is a government’s responsibility to protect its citizens physically, emotionally, and economically.
This act, which was sanctioned by God (as proven by the rewarding of Pinḥas with a “covenant of peace”), was on some level a challenge to the leadership of Moshe. Pinḥas was not the leader of the people (he had a spiritual leadership position as a priest rather than a political position of power), yet he stepped in with zeal to act in the moment, protecting the people from themselves and waging a moral war for God.
It does this through the institution of prophecy (prophets speaking truth to power) and through the area of law called <i>mishpat melekh</i> (the legal domain of the king), or <i>hilkhot medina</i> (public policy regulations). Today, through the democratic systems that are in place, we still have the mechanisms to hold our leadership morally accountable.

II; The Crown All Can Wear

<big><strong>II. The Crown All Can Wear</strong></big><br><b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>A man named Tzelofḥad had died. His five daughters went to Moshe with a question. It had been decided that sons would inherit their portion of the land of Israel from their fathers, but since this man had left no sons, the daughters asked if they might instead inherit from their father. Moshe asked God and the request was granted. Then Moshe asked a question of his own:
<i>Moshe said to the Lord, “May the Lord, God of the spirits of all flesh, appoint a man over this community…so the Lord’s people will not be like sheep without a shepherd.”</i>
Why does Moshe’s question come right after the request of Tzelofḥad’s daughters? The Sages found a connection, and an important revelation, in both Moshe’s question and God’s answer.
Moshe had recently lost his siblings Miriam and Aharon, and he knew that he, too, would not live long enough to lead the children of Israel into the land of Israel. God had also just informed Moshe that he was at his last resting place. His thoughts were therefore firmly on his own mortality, and how he would not live to cross the Jordan and bring the people into the land, which would have been the fulfilment of his life’s work.
Now he asked God who would take over the leadership role. Paying careful attention to context, and keeping in mind the previous passage about the daughters of Tzelofḥad, the Sages found a clue as to why Moshe chose this moment to ask God this question<i>,</i> and what he may have been hoping the answer would be.
<i>“Moshe reasoned: The time is right for me to make my own request. If daughters inherit, it is surely right that my sons should inherit my glory.</i>
<i>“The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, ‘He who keeps the fig tree shall eat its fruit’ (Mishlei 27:18). Your sons sat idly by and did not study the Torah. Yehoshua served you faithfully and showed you great honour. It was he who rose early in the morning and remained late at night at your House of Assembly. He used to arrange the benches and spread the mats. Seeing that he has served you with all his might, he is worthy to serve Israel, for he shall not lose his reward.”</i>
This was another great disappointment for Moshe. Not only was he not going to enter the land, but he was also destined to see his sons overlooked in the search for a successor.
But it is precisely here that we find, for the first time, one of Judaism’s most powerful ideas. Yehoshua <i>earned</i> the right to inherit the role of leader and teacher. This is a profoundly egalitarian concept (democratic and classless), teaching us an important message about Jewish leaders: we are a nation of individuals standing with equal dignity in the presence of God. And yes, there is an inheritance relationship between Torah and the Jew, but the former has to be loved if it is to be earned.
You have to love Torah if you are to inherit it.
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. Why do you think Moshe would want to know that his son would become the next leader of the Jewish people?</i>
<i>2. How does the fact that Yehoshua merited to take over from Moshe prove that Judaism’s concept of a nation is an egalitarian one?</i>
<i>3. Can you think of anything else in Jewish thought or Jewish law that also suggests Judaism believes that all Jews are equally holy and valued in the eyes of God?</i>
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br>Yehoshua Ben Gamla was a high priest in Israel, in the last years of the Second Temple. It is written in the Talmud:
<i>May the name of that man, Yehoshua ben Gamla, be blessed and remembered, because, were it not for him, the Torah would have been forgotten and lost from the Jewish people.</i>
<i>For at first, if a child had a father, the father taught the child, and if they had no father, they did not learn at all….</i>
<i>They then made an ordinance that teachers of children should be appointed in Jerusalem….</i>
<i>Even so, however, if a child had no parent, there would be no one who would take them to learn in Jerusalem.</i>
<i>They therefore ordained that teachers should be appointed in each region, and that children should enter school at the age of sixteen or seventeen.</i>
<i>However, these children were nearly grown, and it happened that if the teacher punished them, they would rebel and leave the school.</i>
<i>Eventually Yehoshua ben Gamla came and ordained that teachers of young children should be appointed in each district and each town, and that children should enter the school at the age of six or seven.</i>
<b>Adapted from Talmud Bavli, Bava Batra 21a</b>
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. Why does the Talmud claim that without these measures introduced by Yehoshua ben Gamla, the Torah would have been forgotten?</i>
<i>2. How is this connected to the idea of an egalitarian approach to the people discussed in</i> The Core Idea<i>?</i>
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>The egalitarian tradition in Judaism is summed up in this famous Maimonidean ruling:
<i>With three crowns was Israel crowned – with the crown of Torah, the crown of priesthood, and the crown of kingship. The crown of priesthood was bestowed upon Aharon and his descendants. The crown of kingship was conferred on David and his successors. But the crown of Torah is for all Israel. Whoever wishes, let them come and take it. Do not suppose that the other two crowns are greater than that of Torah…. The crown of Torah is greater than the other two crowns.</i>
This had immense social and political consequences. Throughout most of the biblical era, all three crowns were in operation. In addition to prophets, Israel had kings and an active priesthood serving in the Temple. The dynastic principle – leadership passing from father to son – still dominated two of the three roles. But with the destruction of the Second Temple, kingship and a functioning priesthood ceased. Leadership passed to the Sages, who saw themselves as heirs to the prophets.
In biblical Israel, though, it was the priests and not the prophets who were the primary guardians and teachers of Torah. It would therefore, on the face of it, have been a natural step from priest to rabbi, but the Sages instead defined themselves as successors to the prophets. Why did the Sages not see themselves as heirs to Aharon and the priesthood? There are many reasons, but one is surely this: The priesthood was a dynasty. It was not open to everyone. It was restricted by birth. Prophetic leadership, by contrast, could never be predicted in advance. The proof was Yehoshua, whose actions allowed him to become the next prophet after Moshe. It meant that anyone, by discipleship and dedication, could aspire to rabbinic leadership and the crown of Torah.
Hence we find in the sources a paradox. On the one hand, the Torah describes itself as an inheritance: “Moshe commanded us the Torah as an inheritance (<i>morasha</i>) of the congregation of Yaakov” (Devarim 33:4). On the other, the Sages were insistent that Torah is <i>not</i> an inheritance: “R. Yose said: Prepare yourself to learn Torah, for it is not given to you as an inheritance (<i>yerusha</i>)” (Mishna Avot 2:12).
The simplest resolution of the contradiction is that there are two kinds of inheritance. Biblical Hebrew contains two different words for what we receive as a legacy: <i>yerusha</i>/<i>morasha</i> and <i>naḥala</i>. <i>Naḥala</i> is related to the word <i>naḥal</i>, a river. It signifies something passed down automatically through the generations, as river water naturally flows downstream. <i>Yerusha</i> comes from the root <i>yarash</i>, meaning “to take possession.” It refers to something to which you have legitimate title, but which you need positive action to acquire.
A hereditary title, such as being a duke or an earl, is passed from parent to child. So too is a family business. The difference is that the first needs no effort on the part of the heir, but the second requires hard work if the business is to continue to be worth something. Torah is like a business, not a title. It must be earned if it is to be sustained.
Moshe’s personal tragedy was Israel’s consolation. The Torah could be inherited by all the people he led, and all of their descendants. In Nedarim 81a, the Sages put it this way: “Why is it not usual for scholars to give birth to children who are scholars?… So that it should not be said that the Torah is their inheritance.”
The fact that his successor was not a child of Moshe, but rather Yehoshua, his disciple, meant that one form of leadership – historically and spiritually the most important of the three crowns – could be an aspiration for everyone. Dignity is not a privilege of birth. Honour is not confined to those with the right parents. In the world defined and created by Torah, everyone is a potential leader. We can all earn the right to wear the crown.
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>Ezra and Neḥemya [instituted a public reading of the Torah. This is where our tradition of reading the weekly <i>parasha</i> each Shabbat comes from.
This] set in motion a profound change in Jewish life, one whose early details are hard to come by because of the shortage of literary materials from Jewish sources between the fourth and second centuries BCE. But we can take up the story with Shimon ben Shetaḥ in the first century BCE. Until then, education had largely taken place within the family. Shimon ben Shetaḥ established the first national educational system in Israel, creating schools throughout the country for sixteen- and seventeen-year-olds…. This was the first system of its kind in the world. The Talmud also contains the world’s first regulations about teacher provision and class size.
As H. G. Wells noted in his <i>Outline of History</i>, “The Jewish religion, because it was a literature-sustained religion, led to the first efforts to provide elementary education for all children in the community.” By contrast, universal compulsory education did not exist in England until 1870. There was nothing remotely similar in the ancient world. Even the great academies of ancient Greece were confined to an elite. Rabbinic Judaism set itself to achieve a society of universal literacy. Paul Johnson calls it an “ancient and highly efficient social machine for the production of intellectuals.”
<b><i>Ceremony &amp; Celebration</i>, 279</b>
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. What is the link between Ezra and Neḥemya and Shimon Ben Shetaḥ, and how does it connect to Judaism’s egalitarian tradition explored in this</i> Covenant &amp; Conversation<i> essay?</i>
<i>2. Why is education a basic human right?</i>
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>What was on Moshe’s mind when he asked God to find a successor?
Do you think education is important for all children and all adults? Why?
What is the difference between a <i>naḥala</i> and a <i>yerusha</i>? Which is the Torah?
<b>EDUCATIONAL COMPANION TO THE QUESTIONS</b>
<b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>It must have seemed like everyone else was able to pass on a legacy to their children. All of Aharon’s children were to become <i>kohanim</i>, even to this day. Tzelofḥad’s daughters also were able to inherit from their father. But for Moshe this wasn’t merely a desire to be able to give his sons a job or status. When a child takes over a parent’s legacy it is as if it is the parent continuing it themselves. It’s a kind of eternity achieved when the next generation continues in the path you have set, and it means that your name and your ideas will continue beyond your death. Everyone wants to know their life is meaningful and will not be forgotten, and this may feel like a way to guarantee that.
The fact that Moshe’s son did not automatically receive the job of leader means that everyone stands an equal chance, and is seen as equally valued in the eyes of God. This meritocracy is what an egalitarian society looks like.
Jewish education and Torah learning is open to everyone and encouraged for everyone (see <i>It Once Happened</i>, <i>Thinking More Deeply</i>, and <i>From the Thought of Rabbi Sacks</i>). There is no hierarchy in Judaism when it comes to connecting to God or serving God. All spiritual, normative (legal), and personal ritual aspects of Judaism are open to everyone.
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br>Without education a society cannot pass its heritage to the next generation. This will lead to assimilation and ultimately the end of that distinctive nation and culture. Yehoshua ben Gamla realised that it wasn’t enough to educate just the academic or spiritual elite to truly ensure the continuity of the Jewish people. So he introduced universal education for every Jew. This was 1,800 years before the Western world saw the value in universal education. (The first nation to legislate this was Britain in 1870. See <i>From the Thought of Rabbi Sacks</i>.)
Universal education is predicated on the value that all people deserve access to education as a basic human right, because all people are equally important in the eyes of society. Some ancient societies believed only the elite deserved education, or that it was only worthwhile to educate those who were intelligent enough to receive that education. Judaism believes all people fall into this category.
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>Ezra and Neḥemya found a way to ensure that every Jew, from the most scholarly rabbi to the average person on the street, had access to the Torah on a regular basis. Shimon ben Shetaḥ (and Yehoshua ben Gamla before him – see <i>It Once Happened</i>) built on this idea by establishing universal education in the form of formal schooling for all Jewish children. All of these initiatives ensured that not just the rich or the privileged or the academically smart in Jewish society would be educated. All Jews would have equal access to a Torah education.
Education gives an individual power and dignity in society. All democratic systems are founded on an educated society. In this respect it is a universal human right, thus ensured by all democratic nations. This was instituted generations earlier in Jewish talmudic society.
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>Moshe had recently seen both his siblings die, and had been told he was at the end of his life, so he knew that he would be unable to complete his life’s work and bring the children of Israel into the land of Israel. He wanted to ensure that a worthy successor would be chosen to complete this mission. He had also recently presented the question of the daughters of Tzelofḥad to God, asking what happens when a man only has daughters to inherit his estate. This raised the question in his mind of his own legacy and the role his children would play in continuing it.
See <i>From the Thought of Rabbi Sacks</i>, answer 2. Torah education is also encouraged as a daily activity even for adults who have learned for many years. We study Torah again and again, and the more we learn, the more we discover.
A <i>naḥala</i>, like a stream, flows to the next generation without any action required. A child automatically inherits their parent’s estate. A <i>yerusha,</i> on the other hand, needs to be actively taken as an inheritance. <i>Yerusha</i> means “to take possession.” It refers to something to which you have legitimate title, but which you need positive action to acquire. This is the Torah, our inheritance, that we must work hard to earn. And even though a child born from a Jewish mother is automatically Jewish, to fully acquire the Torah we must study and engage with it all of our lives.

Matot

In a Nutshell

<b><i>IN A NUTSHELL</i></b><br><i>Parashat Mattot</i> begins with Moshe teaching the people about promises – vows and oaths – including how they should be kept and how they can be cancelled.
Two tribes, Reuven and Gad, together with half the tribe of Menashe, then ask permission to dwell on the east side of the River Jordan where the land is ideal pasture for their cattle. Moshe is disappointed that they are choosing to live outside of the land of Israel, but eventually he says yes, as long as they first join in all the battles for the Promised Land, west of the Jordan, helping the rest of the Israelites.
<b>QUESTION TO PONDER</b>
<i>Why is Moshe disappointed by the request of these tribes and what might it have to do with the other subject of the</i> parasha<i> (vows and oaths)?</i>

I; Keeping Our Word

<big><strong>I. Keeping Our Word</strong></big><br><b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>This <i>parasha</i> opens with an account of the laws of vows and oaths. What is it doing here near the end of the book of Bemidbar, as the Israelites approach the destination of their journey to the Promised Land?
Vows and oaths are obligations created by words. They are commitments to do something or refrain from doing something. A vow, <i>neder</i>, affects the status of an object. I may vow not to eat something. That something is now, for me, forbidden food. An oath, <i>shevua</i>, affects the person, not the object. What is now forbidden is not the food but the act of eating it. Both acts bind: that is the primary meaning of the word <i>issur</i>.
These commitments have a holy dimension to them, and therefore they have demanding rules that have to be met if they are to be cancelled. You cannot do it by yourself: the <i>parasha</i> sets out some of the ground rules, the rest of which were supplied by the Oral Tradition. So seriously does Judaism treat verbal promises that one act of annulment, <i>Kol Nidrei</i>, takes place at the start of the holiest day of the year, Yom Kippur.
The superficial reason for the law of vows appearing here is that the previous section of the Torah dealt with communal sacrifices. Individuals also brought sacrifices, sometimes because they were bound to do so but at other times because they voluntarily chose to do so. Hence the laws of voluntary undertakings.
But there is a deeper reason. The Israelites were nearing the land. They were about to construct a society unlike any other. It was to be a free society based on a covenant between the people and God. The rule of law was to be secured not by the use of force but by people honouring their moral commitments, their voluntary undertaking to God that what He commanded, they would do.
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. What covenant was to be the basis of the society the Israelites were to create in the land of Israel?</i>
<i>2. What does this have to do with the laws of vows and oaths?</i>
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br><i>When Elaine and I were married, I was twenty-two. She was twenty-one. We had no idea what the future would hold. At that time she was practising radiography. For the first few years of our marriage, while I was studying, she was the breadwinner and I the – not very good – housekeeper.</i>
<i>I had gone to university wanting to be an accountant. I then wandered into philosophy. For a while, after graduating, I studied for a doctorate. It didn’t go well (I eventually completed it ten years later). I then taught philosophy for two years. I made a foray into law but soon discovered that it and I didn’t get on. Then, following an insistent inner voice, I turned to the rabbinate. This involved intensive study and put a huge burden on Elaine. I went into the rabbinate, continuing to teach at our rabbinical seminary. Along the way our three children were born.</i>
<i>Our life together has had its twists and turns. At each stage of the way we were faced with new challenges. Looking back across twenty-nine years of married life, we could not have foreseen the outcome. We can know the past. We can never know the future. Human life is life lived towards the future, which means facing the unknown. But we faced it together. Without that togetherness, I doubt whether we could have done much of what we eventually did. It’s what made our marriage. At difficult times we were there for one another. I don’t think it ever occurred to us that we wouldn’t be. That’s what a marriage is: a journey across an unknown land, with nothing to protect you from the elements except one another. It’s not much, but it’s everything.</i>
<i>What is a marriage? Words. A commitment. We pledge ourselves to someone else. It’s probably the most significant commitment any of us can make, and it depends on our moral determination to honour it. A declaration of marriage doesn’t mean “We are man and wife so long as we find each other attractive or compatible; so long as we feel passion for one another; so long as we don’t meet someone else more attractive.” It means “I will be with you whatever fate brings. I will stay loyal to you. When you need me, I’ll be there. When things are tough, I won’t walk away.” By moralising the bond it lifts it to an altogether different plane. A personal commitment is stronger than passion or emotion or attraction. It is a pledge to share a life together, come what may.</i>
<b><i>Celebrating Life,</i> 87–88</b>
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. What does Rabbi Sacks mean when he writes that marriage is “words”?</i>
<i>2. How does marriage as a commitment connect to the message of this Covenant &amp; Conversation essay?</i>
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>A covenantal society is one in which words are holy, sacrosanct. This is the principle at the heart of Judaism as a code of collective freedom, a constitution of liberty.
This needs explanation. Any society needs laws. Without that, it descends into anarchy. There are three reasons why people obey laws. The first is that they will be punished if they don’t. This is a society based on power. The second is that it is to their advantage to do so. This is a society based on self-interest.
Both have shortcomings. Power corrupts. So, at times, does the pursuit of self-interest. When power is corrupted, there is a loss of freedom. When self-interest prevails, there is a loss of social cohesion. When people care about themselves but not others, the successful thrive while others suffer. Justice and compassion give way to greed and exploitation.
The Torah sets forth a third way, in which people obey the law because they have voluntarily undertaken to do so. This is a society based not on power or the pursuit of self-interest but on freely embraced moral obligation. The Torah is the story of how the Israelites came to this unique and radical idea: the politics of covenant.
Ironically it was one of the great critics of Judaism, Friedrich Nietzsche, who had the insight to see that the capacity to bind ourselves by words is the basis of both morality and human freedom. This is what he says in his book <i>On the Genealogy of Morality</i>:
<i>To breed an animal with the prerogative to promise – is that not precisely the paradoxical task which nature has set herself with regard to humankind? Is it not the real problem of humankind?</i>
Homo sapiens is distinguished from other animals by its use of language. That is well known. What Nietzsche saw, however, is that we use language in many different ways. We use it to describe, communicate, categorise, and explain. Language in this sense is a kind of picture of reality, a translation of what is into a set of signs, symbols, and images.
But we can also use language in a quite different way – not to describe what is, but to commit ourselves to some form of behaviour in the future.
So for instance, when a groom says to his bride under the <i>ḥuppa</i>, “Behold you are betrothed to me...,” he is not describing a marriage. He is getting married. He is undertaking a set of obligations to the woman he has chosen as his wife. Philosophers nowadays call this a performative utterance. Nietzsche saw how fundamental this is to the human condition:
<i>In order to have that degree of control over the future, man must first learn to distinguish between what happens by accident and what by design...and before he can do this, man himself will really have to become reliable, regular, necessary, even in his own self-image, so that he, as someone making a promise is, is answerable for his own future!</i>
When we bind ourselves by words we are using language not to describe but to create – to create an orderly future out of the chaos of human instincts and desires. What makes humans unique is not just the use of language. Other animals use forms of language. Dolphins do. So do primates. Even bees do complex dances that convey information to other bees.
What is unique to humans is that we use language to bind our own future behaviour so that we can form with other human beings bonds of mutuality and trust. One such bond is the promise. Another is marriage. A third – unique to Judaism – is society understood as a covenant, a set of mutually binding promises between the Jewish people and God.
It is this use of language, not to describe something already in existence but to create something that didn’t exist before, that links us to God. God used words to bring the natural universe into being: “And God said…and there was.” We use words to bring a social universe into being. What the Torah is telling us is that words create because words are holy: that is to say, they bind. When words bind, they generate trust. Trust is to society what predictability is to nature: the basis of order as opposed to chaos.
Social institutions in a free society depend on trust, and trust means that we keep our word. We do what we say we are going to do. If we make a vow, an oath, a promise, a verbal undertaking, then we hold ourselves bound by it. This means that we will actually fulfil our commitment unless we can establish that, due to circumstances unforeseeable at the time, we are simply unable to do so.
If trust breaks down, social relationships break down, and then society depends on law enforcement agencies or some other use of force. When force is widely used, society is no longer free. The only way free human beings can form collaborative and cooperative relationships without recourse to force is by the use of verbal undertakings honoured by those who make them.
Freedom needs trust; trust needs people to keep their word; and keeping your word means treating words as holy, vows and oaths as sacrosanct. Only under very special and precisely formulated circumstances can you be released from your undertakings. That is why, as the Israelites approached the Holy Land where they were to create a free society, they had to be reminded of the sacred character of vows and oaths.
The temptation to break your word when it is to your advantage to do so can sometimes be overwhelming. That is why belief in God – a God who oversees all we think, say, and do, and who holds us accountable to our commitments – is so fundamental. Although it sounds strange to us now, the father of toleration and liberalism, John Locke (England, seventeenth century) held that citizenship should not be extended to atheists because, not believing in God, they could not be trusted to honour their word.
So the appearance of laws about vows and oaths at the end of the book of Bemidbar, as the Israelites are approaching the Holy Land, is no accident, and the moral is still relevant today. A free society depends on trust. Trust depends on keeping your word. That is how humans imitate God by using language to create.
<b>I believe words create moral obligations, and moral obligations, undertaken responsibly and honoured faithfully, create the possibility of a free society.</b>
So – always do what you say you are going to do. If we fail to keep our word, eventually we will lose our freedom.
<b>QUESTION TO PONDER</b>
<i>What power do words have?</i>
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>I believe faith is part of what makes us human. It is a basic attitude of trust that always goes beyond the available evidence, but without which we would do nothing great. Without faith in one another we could not risk the vulnerability of love. Without faith in the future, we would not choose to have a child. Without faith in the intelligibility of the universe we would not do science.

What is the connection between keeping promises and a healthy society?
<b>EDUCATIONAL COMPANION TO THE QUESTIONS</b>
<b><i>IN A NUTSHELL</i></b><br>Moshe worries that these tribes are trying to shirk their responsibilities to fight with the other tribes to conquer the land of Israel. Ultimately they are given permission to settle on the other side of the Jordan River as long as they promise to send their menfolk to fight with the rest of the Israelite army. The commitment they give is a promise of sorts, just like an oath or vow, which is another theme of the <i>parasha</i>. They are true to their word, which is an important value necessary to build a society based on trust and faithfulness.
<b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>The Torah is the covenant that was to become the basis of the society the Israelites were to create in the land of Israel. It consisted of a commitment of the Israelites to keep the mitzvot and be faithful to God, and in exchange God promises to protect and look after the Israelites, and bless them with security and prosperity in the land of Israel.
This covenant is in itself a form of an oath. Both sides commit and promise to keep their side of the covenant. Ultimately the Israelites were not fully committed to their promise, and strayed from the Torah. This resulted in punishment in the form of exile from the land.
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br>The commitment of marriage is ultimately just words. The couple pledge to each other with words their loyalty and fidelity.
In the words of Rabbi Sacks from this <i>Covenant &amp; Conversation</i> essay, “Words create moral obligations, and moral obligations, undertaken responsibly and honoured faithfully, create the possibility of a free society.” While he is not referring to marriage, but rather vows and oaths in particular and commitment and trust in general, marriage is an example of a moral obligation taken with words. A free and just society is built on words that lead to trust and commitment, just as a marriage is.
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>While we know words have tremendous power, for good and for bad (explored in many other places by Rabbi Sacks), in the context of this <i>parasha</i>, Rabbi Sacks expresses the potential sacred nature of words when used to commit to others in relationships in society. A free society is built on words that express moral obligations. Words create moral obligations, and moral obligations, undertaken responsibly and honoured faithfully, create the possibility of a free society.
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>While there are animals that can communicate and have some basic form of language, it is only humans who can think abstractly about the future, and therefore use language to plan for the future. In the words of Rabbi Sacks, “What is unique to humans is that we use language to bind our own future behaviour so that we can form with other human beings bonds of mutuality and trust.”
There are different definitions of the word “holy,” but one that Rabbi Sacks often uses is “the domain of God.” Words become godly when they reflect God and godliness. This means they must reflect the values and characteristics of God, including trustworthiness and faithfulness.
Society can only function if there is trust between people. Trust is the foundation of relationships and the functioning of society, from the most basic transactions to a system of government. If people do not keep their word and break their promises then there can be no trust between people and the breakdown of relationships, and society itself.

II; Priorities

<big><strong>II. Priorities</strong></big><br><b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>The Israelites were almost within sight of the Promised Land. They had successfully waged their first battles. They had just won a victory over the Midianites. There is a new tone from the Jewish people in the story. The complaining and negativity was the sound of the original generation, born in slavery, that had left Egypt. But now almost forty years have passed. The second generation, born in freedom and toughened by conditions in the desert, have a more purposeful feel about them. Battle-tried, they no longer doubt their ability, with God’s help, to fight and win.
Now a fresh challenge arises. The people as a whole are focused on the destination: the land west of the River Jordan, the place that even the spies had confirmed to be “flowing with milk and honey” (Bemidbar 13:27). The members of the tribes of Reuven and Gad, though, began to have different thoughts. Seeing that the land through which they were travelling was ideal for raising cattle, they decided that they would prefer to stay there, to the east of the Jordan, and proposed this to Moshe. Unsurprisingly, he was angry at the suggestion: “Moshe said to the Gadites and Reubenites, ‘Are your brothers to go to war while you stay here? Why would you discourage the Israelites from going over into the land the Lord has given them?’” (Bemidbar 32:6–7). He reminded them of the last time a group discouraged the nation from entering the land – the spies – and how the whole nation suffered. If they remained on the east side of the Jordan, they would show not only that they were unsure about God’s gift of the land but also that they had learned nothing from history.
The tribes did not argue with his claim. They accepted it, but they pointed out that his concern was not incompatible with their objectives. They suggested a compromise. They were willing to join the rest of the Israelites in the battles that lay ahead, and they were even prepared to be the nation’s advance guard, in the forefront of the battle. They were not afraid of combat and were not trying to evade their responsibilities to the people as a whole. They simply wanted to raise cattle to the east of the Jordan, where the land seemed ideal. Warning them of the seriousness of their undertaking, Moshe agreed, on condition that they keep their word. And so it came to pass (see Yehoshua 22:1–5).
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. Do you think the request these tribes made was reasonable?</i>
<i>2. What does Rashi suggest is the real problem with the request they made? How does Moshe address this?</i>
<i>3. What does it mean for a parent to put their children at the top of their priorities?</i>
That is the story on the surface. But as is so often the case in the Torah, there are subtexts as well as texts. One in particular was noticed by the Sages, with their sensitivity to nuance and detail. They listened carefully to what the Reubenites and Gadites said, and to the order of their priorities: “They said, ‘We would like to build sheepfolds for our flocks and towns for our children.’ Moshe replied: ‘Build towns for your children, and sheepfolds for your flocks, but do what you have promised’” (Bemidbar 32:24).
The arrangement of the nouns is crucial. The men of Reuven and Gad put property before people: they spoke of their flocks first, their children second. Moshe reversed the order, putting special emphasis on the children. As Rashi notes: “They paid more regard to their property than to their sons and daughters, because they mentioned their cattle before the children. Moshe said to them: ‘Not so. Make the main thing primary and the less important thing secondary. First build cities for your children, and only then, folds for your flocks’” (commentary on Bemidbar 32:16).
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br><i>When Hillel the Elder was a young man he was very poor. He earned a mere half-dinar for every hard day’s work. Half of this he spent on food for himself and his relatives, and the other half he would use to learn Torah. The great spiritual leaders of the generation, Shemaya and Avtalyon, had a</i> beit midrash <i>to teach Torah every day, for a quarter-dinar per person, per day.</i>
<i>One Friday, Hillel could not find work and did not earn any money at all, and so the guard of the</i> beit midrash <i>did not allow him to enter that day. He was so determined to continue his studies that he climbed onto the roof of the</i> beit midrash <i>and leaned over the edge of the skylight so he could hear the words of Torah from these great teachers. It was the month of Tevet and one of the coldest Shabbat evenings of the year. Hillel stayed up on the roof all night and snow fell on him, covering him completely.</i>
<i>When it was dawn, Shemaya noticed it was darker than usual inside, so he looked up and saw the image of a man in the skylight. He and Avtalyon climbed to the roof and found Hillel almost frozen, covered with snow three cubits high! They needed to work quickly to save his life. They carried him down, gave him dry clothes, and although it is forbidden to light a flame on Shabbat, they built a fire to warm him up. They said: “This man is worthy for us to desecrate Shabbat for him.” Saving a life always overrides Shabbat laws; however, this great man was especially deserving. Clearly, he understood even in poverty the importance of striving to study Torah!</i>

<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. What values did Hillel prioritise in this story? What did he compromise on to do this? Do you agree with his decision?</i>
<i>2. How is this story connected to the message of the</i> Covenant &amp; Conversation<i> essay (see also</i> Thinking More Deeply<i>)?</i>
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>The story of these tribes requesting to remain on the east side of the Jordan turned out to be not a minor incident in the wilderness long ago, but rather a consistent pattern throughout much of Jewish history. The fate of Jewish communities, for the most part, was determined by a single factor: their decision, or lack of decision, to put children and their education first. Already in the first century, Josephus was able to write: “The result of our thorough education in our laws, from the very dawn of intelligence, is that they are, as it were, engraved on our souls.” The Rabbis ruled that “any town that lacks children at school is to be excommunicated” (Shabbat 119b). Already in the first century, the Jewish community in Israel had established a network of schools at which attendance was compulsory (Bava Batra 21a) – the first such system in history.
The pattern persisted throughout the Middle Ages. In twelfth-century France, a Christian scholar noted: “A Jew, however poor, if he has ten sons, will put them all to letters, not for gain as the Christians do, but for the understanding of God’s law – and not only his sons but his daughters too.”
In 1432, at the height of Christian persecution of Jews in Spain, a council was convened at Valladolid to institute a system of taxation to fund Jewish education for all. In 1648, at the end of the Thirty Years’ War, the first thing Jewish communities in Europe did to re-establish Jewish life was to reorganise the educational system. In their classic study of the <i>shtetls</i>, the small townships of Eastern Europe, Zborowski and Herzog write this about the typical Jewish family: “The most important item in the family budget is the tuition fee that must be paid each term to the teacher of the younger boys’ school. Parents will bend in the sky to educate their son…. The boy must study, the boy must become a good Jew – the two are synonymous.”
In 1849, when Samson Raphael Hirsch became the rabbi in Frankfurt, he insisted that the community create a school before building a synagogue. After the Holocaust, the few surviving yeshiva heads and hasidic leaders concentrated on encouraging their followers to have children and build schools.
It is hard to think of any other religion or civilisation that has so predicated its very existence on putting children and their education first. There have been Jewish communities in the past that were affluent and built magnificent synagogues – Alexandria in the first centuries of the Common Era is an example. Yet because they did not put children first, they contributed little to the Jewish story. They flourished briefly, then disappeared.
Moshe’s implied rebuke to the tribes of Reuven and Gad is not a minor historical detail but a fundamental statement of Jewish priorities. Children come first; property is secondary. Civilisations that value the young stay young. Those that invest in the future have a future. It is not what we own that gives us a share in eternity, but those to whom we give birth and the effort we make to ensure that they carry our faith and way of life into the next generation.
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>For Jews, education is not just what we know. It’s who we are. No people ever cared for education more. Our ancestors were the first to make education a religious command, and the first to create a compulsory universal system of schooling – eighteen centuries before Britain. The Rabbis valued study as higher even than prayer. Almost two thousand years ago, Josephus wrote: “Should anyone of our nation be asked about our laws, he will repeat them as readily as his own name. The result of our thorough education in our laws from the very dawn of intelligence is that they are, as it were, engraved on our souls.”
The Egyptians built pyramids, the Greeks built temples, the Romans built amphitheatres. Jews built schools. They knew that to defend a country you need an army, but to defend a civilisation you need education. So Jews became the people whose heroes were teachers, whose citadels were schools, and whose passion was study and the life of the mind. How can we deprive our children of that heritage?
The world is changing ever faster. In a single generation, nowadays, there is more scientific and technological advance than in all previous centuries since human beings first set foot on earth. In uncharted territory, you need a compass. That’s what Judaism is. It guided our ancestors through good times and bad. It gave them identity, security, and a sense of direction. It enabled them to cope with circumstances more varied than any other people have ever known. It lifted them, often, to heights of greatness. Why? Because Judaism is about learning. Education counts for more in the long run than wealth or power or privilege. Those who know, grow.

<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. Why do you think Jews have valued education so highly throughout their history?</i>
<i>2. What do you think the long-term impact of this has been on Jews as individuals and as a nation?</i>
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>How was Reuven and Gad’s request not to enter the land of Israel different from the previous story of the spies?
How does Rabbi Sacks take this criticism further, contrasting their priorities with the priorities of the Jewish people throughout history?
Why have Jews always been so passionate about their children’s education, and what impact has this had in Jewish history?
<b>EDUCATIONAL COMPANION TO THE QUESTIONS</b>
<b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>When Moshe first heard the request from these tribes he thought to deny their request. It sounded to him as if they were avoiding their responsibility to join with their people in the conquest of the land. Once they reassured him they would fight side by side with the rest of the people, he agreed to their proposal. The question is: Should we nevertheless see this as a rejection of the land of Israel that God promised the people, or just as an understandable proposal to expand the military and political presence the Jewish people had, which would also allow these tribes to thrive economically?
Rashi suggests that they “mentioned their cattle before the children,” which revealed that their priorities needed re-balancing. Their primary focus was economic stability rather than the welfare of their families. Moshe addresses this by switching the order of the nouns, stressing to them that they should be more concerned with their children than with wealth.
While children and parents may have a different list of what parents should be providing for their children (and this could lead to an interesting discussion around your Shabbat table), the basic responsibilities of a parent to their child is to provide a loving and secure environment for the physical and emotional development of their children. However, beyond that, a parent also has a responsibility to educate their child, whether directly in the home or by ensuring they receive an education in school. Do the children in this discussion also see this as a parental responsibility and priority?
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br>While the story clearly tells us that he provided for his family and placed that priority on par with his Torah study (in contrast, perhaps, with the tribes of Reuven and Gad), he was willing to compromise on his health and safety in order to continue to learn Torah.
The tribes in the story seem (according to Rashi) to think about wealth before anything else. Rabbi Sacks draws our attention (in <i>Thinking More Deeply</i>) to the traditional Jewish focus on education as an example of where Jews throughout the ages have put the welfare of their children (physical and spiritual) above other priorities such as wealth. It is interesting to reflect on the fact that while Rabbi Sacks celebrates the Jewish tradition of universal education for all Jews, the story from the Talmud shows us this wasn’t always the case (only the wealthy and religious elite had access to the educational institutions during this time, until later when this was changed to allow all Jews to learn Torah).
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>This value has been central to the Jewish people since the beginning of their history. Love of learning in general and Torah specifically is a core value found in Jewish texts and Jewish traditions. However, the Diaspora experience of being a nomadic people has forced the Jewish people to rely more on their intellectual skills rather than the physical skills that come with agriculture and other crafts connected to the physical land. Universal education is a particularly Jewish concept. All people are created equal and in the image of God, and education is a basic right of all. This is why Jews established universal education many generations before this became the norm in the West.
Education as a central and core Jewish value has meant that Jewish literacy levels tend to be high, leading to Jews finding themselves in professions that require this. This has often led to Jewish communities prospering, while at the same time sometimes suffering from persecution because of this (for example, as money lenders). Ensuring that all Jews are fully versed in their own traditions and laws has also contributed to the strength of Jewish identity and continuity throughout the period of exile, being one of the factors explaining the miracle of Jewish survival and continuity against the odds.
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>The spies lacked the faith that they would be able to enter the land and conquer its inhabitants, whereas the request in our <i>parasha</i> was about a specific need for these tribes – agriculturally rich land that was on the east side of the River Jordan. These tribes were fully willing to fight side by side with the rest of the people, and they showed no lack of faith that they would be successful in this campaign.
For Rabbi Sacks, the best example of the Jewish concern for children is the preoccupation with providing a Jewish education for every Jewish child. Often, just as Moshe suggested to these tribes by switching the order of the priorities mentioned in the verse, Jewish communities and families have used every last financial resource they have to ensure their children receive an education.
Education has always been central to the Jewish people since the beginning of their history, and a love of learning is a core value found in Jewish texts and Jewish traditions. Education also became even more important during the period of the Diaspora, as Jews were forced to rely on their intellectual skills. This meant that Jewish literacy levels tended to be high, leading to Jewish communities prospering (although sometimes this also led to suffering from persecution from these professions, especially as money lenders). A commitment to Jewish education also contributed to maintaining Jewish identity and continuity in every generation, often against all odds.

Masei

In a Nutshell

<b><i>IN A NUTSHELL</i></b><br><i>Parashat Masei</i> gives us a list of the forty-two stopping points of the Israelites’ forty-year journey through the wilderness. Their final stop is on the plains of Moav, where they will stay until the death of Moshe. Then the <i>parasha</i> sets out the borders of the Promised Land, as well as highlighting which places will become cities of refuge (where people guilty of accidental murder can live safely, protected from the relatives of the person who has died).
<i>Mattot</i> and <i>Masei</i>, often read together, are the final <i>parashot</i> in the book of Bemidbar. This book is full of the stories of what happened while the people lived in the desert, as well as the laws that the people were taught during this time. Moshe taught them (and us) about: the laws of purity, of the <i>Mishkan</i> (the portable Temple), <i>lashon hara</i>, and future laws for the land. Sometimes the people rebelled against Moshe and against God Himself; sometimes they complained or broke the laws. Every time they made a mistake, God forgave them and Moshe tried to show them a better way to behave.
<b>QUESTION TO PONDER</b>
<i>Moshe was a leader, a judge, and a prophet. Why do you think we call him “</i>Moshe Rabbeinu<i>” (meaning, Moshe our teacher) and not by a different title?</i>

I; My Teacher; In Memoriam

<big><strong>I. My Teacher: In Memoriam</strong></big><br><b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>The cities of refuge were set aside for the protection of those found guilty of manslaughter, that is, of killing someone accidentally, without hatred or intention. Because of the once universal practice of blood vengeance (where the family of the victim would get their revenge by killing those responsible), these places of protection were very necessary.
As <i>Shofetim</i> puts it: “And he shall flee to one of these cities and live” (Devarim 19:5). This apparently simple concept was given a remarkable interpretation by the Talmud: The Sages taught that <i>if a student was exiled, his teacher was exiled with him</i>, as it is said: “And he shall flee to one of these cities and <i>live</i>,” so we must do the things for him that will enable him to live (Makkot 10a).
Rambam explains: “Life without study is like death for scholars who seek wisdom.”
In Judaism, study is seen as life itself, and students need a teacher to guide them. So, as Rambam explains, our teachers give us more than knowledge; they give us life.
Note that this is a halakhic ruling, containing an important message. Judaism appreciates its teachers, like it appreciates parents, and in one way they are even more important. Parents give us physical life; teachers give us <i>spiritual life</i>. And when our parents teach us, we are doubly blessed. Physical life is mortal, transient. Spiritual life is eternal. Therefore, we owe our teachers our life in the very deepest sense.
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. Why is life without Torah study like death for scholars?</i>
<i>2. Think of a teacher who is really important to you. How have they made an impact on your life?</i>
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br><i>Rabbi Nachum Rabinovitch, zt”l, achieved much in the world of Torah education. He was a community rabbi in South Carolina and Toronto, principal of Jews’ College in London, and rosh yeshiva of Yeshivat Birkat Moshe in Israel. He was also a world-renowned</i> posek<i> of halakha and wrote many responsa. His knowledge of the entire rabbinic literature was comprehensive, and yet he was also well known for his mastery over almost every secular discipline, especially the sciences.</i>
<i>While he was a community rabbi in Charleston, he also established a Jewish school there, demonstrating his passion for Jewish education. He believed Jewish educational institutions should be at the core of every Jewish community.</i>
<i>Once, a friend of his came to visit, and was invited to see the school. When the friend saw Rabbi Rabinovitch teaching the youngest children in the school how to read the</i> Alef-Beit<i>, he asked, “Is it fitting for such a scholar as yourself to be doing such a menial task?” Rav Rabinovitch responded: “I see nothing menial or undignified in this – it is an honour and a pleasure to be teaching the</i> Alef-Beit <i>to Jewish children.”</i>
<i>More than anything, Rav Rabinovitch was a teacher.</i>
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. Why do you think Rav Rabinovitch was happy teaching young children the</i> Alef-Beit<i> when he knew so much more?</i>
<i>2. How did he “give life” (see</i> The Core Idea<i>) to all his students (young and old alike)?</i>
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>There are moments when divine providence touches you on the shoulder and makes you see a certain truth with blazing clarity. Let me share with you such a moment that happened to me this morning.
For technical reasons, I have to write my essays for the <i>Covenant &amp; Conversation</i> series many weeks in advance. I had come to <i>Mattot-Masei</i>, and had decided to write about the cities of refuge, but I wasn’t sure which aspect to focus on. Suddenly, overwhelmingly, I felt an instinct to write about one very unusual law: <i>If a student was exiled to a city of refuge, his teacher was exiled with him (</i>see<i> The Core Idea).</i>
I had just written out the text, when the phone rang. It was my brother in Jerusalem to tell me that my teacher, Rabbi Nachum Rabinovitch, <i>zt”l livrakha</i>, had just died. Only rarely in this “world of concealment” do we feel the touch of providence, but this timing was unmistakable.
For me, and I suspect everyone who had the privilege of studying with him, he was the greatest teacher of our generation. He was a master <i>posek</i>, as those who have read his responsa will know. He knew the entire rabbinic literature, Bavli, Yerushalmi, Midrash Halakha and Aggada, biblical commentaries, philosophy, codes, and responsa. His creativity, halakhic and aggadic, knew no bounds. He was a master of almost every secular discipline, especially the sciences. He had been a professor of mathematics at the University of Toronto and had written a book about probability and statistical inference. His supreme passion was the Rambam in all his guises, particularly the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, to which he devoted some fifty years of his life to writing the multi-volume commentary <i>Yad Peshuta</i>.
By the time I came to study with the Rav, I had already studied at Cambridge and Oxford with some of the greatest intellects of the time, among them Sir Roger Scruton and Sir Bernard Williams. Rabbi Rabinovitch was more demanding than either of them. Only when I became his student did I learn the true meaning of intellectual rigour, <i>shetihyu amelim baTorah</i>, “labouring” in the Torah. To survive his scrutiny, you had to do three things: first, to read everything ever written on the subject; second, to analyse it with complete lucidity, searching for <i>omek hapeshat</i>, the deep plain sense; and third, to think independently and critically. I remember writing an essay for him in which I quoted one of the most famous of nineteenth-century talmudic scholars. He turned to me and said, “But you didn’t criticise what he wrote!” He thought that in this case the scholar had not given the correct interpretation, and I should have seen and said this. For him, intellectual honesty and independence of mind were inseparable from the quest for truth which is what <i>talmud Torah</i> must always be.
Some of the most important lessons I learned from him were almost accidental. I remember on one occasion his car was being serviced, so I had the privilege of driving him home. It was a hot day, and at a busy junction in Hampstead, my car broke down and would not start up again. Unfazed, Rabbi Rabinovitch said to me, “Let’s use the time to learn Torah.” He then proceeded to give me a <i>shiur</i> on Rambam’s <i>Hilkhot Shemitta VeYovel</i>. Around us, cars were hooting their horns. We were holding up traffic and a considerable queue had developed. The Rav remained completely calm, came to the end of his exposition, turned to me, and said, “Now turn the key.” I turned the key, the car started, and we went on our way.
On another occasion, I told him about my problem getting to sleep. I had become an insomniac. He said to me, joyfully, “Could you teach me how to do that?” He quoted the Rambam who ruled that one gains most of one’s wisdom at night, based on the talmudic statement that the night was created for study.
He and the late Rabbi Aharon Lichtenstein, <i>zt”l,</i> were the <i>gedolei hador</i>, the leaders and role models of their generation. They were very different, one scientific, the other artistic; one direct, the other oblique; one bold, the other cautious, but they were giants, intellectually, morally, and spiritually. Happy is the generation that is blessed by people like these.
It is hard to convey what having a teacher like Rabbi Rabinovitch meant. He knew, for example, that I had to learn fast because I was coming to the rabbinate late, after a career in academic philosophy. What he did was very bold. He explained to me that the fastest and best way of learning anything is to teach it. So the day I entered Jews’ College as a student, I also entered it as a lecturer. How many people would have had that idea and taken that risk?
He also understood how lonely it could be if you lived by the principles of intellectual integrity and independence. Early on, he said to me, “Don’t be surprised if only six people in the world understand what you are trying to do.” When I asked him whether I should accept the position of chief rabbi, he said, in his laconic way: “Why not? After all, maybe you can teach some Torah.”
He himself, in his early thirties, had been offered the job of chief rabbi of Johannesburg, but turned it down on the grounds that he refused to live in an apartheid state. He told me how he was visited in Toronto by Rabbi Louis Rabinowitz who had held the Johannesburg position until then. Looking at the Rav’s modest home and thinking of his more palatial accommodation in South Africa, he said, “You turned down that for <i>this</i>?” But the Rav would never compromise his integrity and never cared for material things.
In the end, he found great happiness in the thirty-seven years he served as head of Yeshivat Birkat Moshe in Maale Adumim. The yeshiva had been founded six years earlier by Rabbi Haim Sabato and Yitzchak Sheilat. It is said that when Rabbi Sabato heard the Rav give a <i>shiur</i>, he immediately asked him to become the <i>rosh yeshiva</i>. It is hard to describe the pride with which he spoke to me about his students, all of whom served in the Israel Defense Forces. Likewise it is hard to describe the awe in which his students held him. Not everyone heard of his greatness, but every person who studied with him knew his worth.
<b>I believe that Judaism made an extraordinarily wise decision when it made teachers its heroes and lifelong education its passion. We don’t worship power or wealth. These things have their place, but not at the top of the hierarchy of values. Power forces us. Wealth induces us. But teachers develop us. They open us to the wisdom of the ages, helping us to see the world more clearly, think more deeply, argue more cogently, and decide more wisely.</b>
“Let the reverence for your teacher be like the reverence for Heaven,” said the Sages. In other words: If you want to come close to Heaven, don’t search for royalty, saints, priests, or even prophets. They may be great, but a fine teacher helps <i>you</i> to become great, and that is a different thing altogether. I was blessed by having one of the greatest teachers of our generation. The best advice I can give anyone is: Find a teacher, then make yourself a disciple.
<b>QUESTION TO PONDER</b>
<i>How has Judaism’s emphasis on education impacted Jews over the generations of Jewish history?</i>
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>The word Torah means “teaching.” God reveals Himself to humankind not in the storm, the wind, the sun, the rain, but in the voice that teaches, the words that instruct. The Torah is a text meant for every member of the nation. We must each give our consent before the covenant is binding. The heroes of Israel – Avraham, Moshe, the Prophets, Scribes, and Sages – are not kings, emperors, or warriors but educators; and we must all be teachers to the next generations. The central institutions of the Jewish people – the family, the Temple, the Sabbath, festival rituals, and later the synagogue – are all educational in character, contexts of learning.
<b><i>A Letter in the Scroll 134–135</i></b>
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>Why does the law force a person’s teacher to relocate to a city of refuge whenever their student moves there?
What do you think were the most important lessons Rabbi Sacks learned from Rabbi Rabinovitch?
Why does Judaism “make teachers its heroes and lifelong education its passion”?
<b>EDUCATIONAL COMPANION TO THE QUESTIONS</b>
<b><i>IN A NUTSHELL</i></b><br>Moshe plays many roles when leading the Jewish people. Over the course of his life, the Torah portrays him as a shepherd, a military leader, a prophet, and a judge. Yet he is known as <i>Moshe Rabbeinu</i> – Moshe our teacher. That is because in Judaism, this is the very greatest honour we can pay him. The role of teacher is the most highly respected one in Jewish society, because education is the highest of our values.
<b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>For a Torah scholar who dedicates their entire life to the pursuit of learning Torah, this becomes life itself. Without Torah learning, life has no meaning. To some extent, this is the case for all Jews, and the Talmud expresses this by comparing the Torah in various places to water and air – the basic physical necessities to live in this world.
For younger children, this may be a more challenging activity. They probably can name teachers they have a close relationship to, and feel enriched by, but it is harder for them to see the bigger picture of how teachers can change lives, sometimes through the small things. Older children and adults may be able to see this very clearly. It could be through one specific conversation, or an ongoing sense that this teacher believed in them, or a time when the teacher went above and beyond their duty as a teacher to care for them. Teachers have the power to change lives, and sometimes it takes the hindsight of many years to see how we have been impacted by them.
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br>Teaching young children <i>Alef-Beit</i> is not any less important than teaching Talmud in an advanced academy or yeshiva. Clearly Rabbi Rabinovitch felt it was just as important. He was teaching the children the letters of the Hebrew language, the building blocks and very foundation of all their future Torah learning.
By dedicating his life to teaching Torah, Rabbi Rabinovitch “gave life” to hundreds of students. He helped them to live a full Jewish life, and he spoke to their souls through the wisdom of the Torah, helping them to actualise their lives as Jews. This is why the Sages ruled that a teacher must be exiled with his student – as Rambam explained, because a teacher “gives life” through teaching Torah, and this is a basic human necessity.
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>Jewish education as a central value has been essential in ensuring the survival of the Jewish people through generations of exile and persecution. It has been an important factor in limiting assimilation, and due to universal Jewish literacy, it has also helped Jews thrive economically in challenging times. Without education as a priority, would Jews have made the same impact in all the fields of wisdom throughout the ages, such as science, philosophy, and the arts (well beyond what could be expected by their small numbers)? And would Jews have been able to pass down the Jewish story throughout the ages, keeping hope, traditions, and beliefs alive, if parents hadn’t taught their children, and communities hadn’t constantly worked to ensure that we had Jewish schools?
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>Learning Torah is a basic requirement for every Jew. Rambam says that a teacher “gives life” to their students. This suggests that life without Torah learning is not, in essence, life. So we make sure that someone who is forced to be exiled to a city of refuge has a teacher to learn from, so they can have a full life even during exile.
Rabbi Sacks shares with us many things that he learned from his teacher in this <i>Covenant &amp; Conversation</i> essay. These include the breadth of his Torah and secular knowledge, intellectual rigour, utilising every moment life offers us, practical rabbinical skills, ethical values, and perhaps most critical was that he taught him the importance of teachers, and of teaching Torah whenever you can.
Judaism values education above almost everything else. It therefore respects and values its teachers, and elevates them to the status of hero. Judaism believes that every Jew should have equal access to Jewish wisdom. We must all know, and live by, the Jewish values, and we have a national mission and destiny to model them by building and living in a Jewish society that places these values at its core and foundation. This can only happen if every Jew has equal access to a Jewish education.

II; The Religious Significance of Israel

<big><strong>II. The Religious Significance of Israel</strong></big><br><b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>The long journey to Israel is almost over. The Jordan is nearly within sight. We have read the long list of stops along the way. Finally, the list draws to a close, and God tells Moshe: “Take possession of the land and settle in it, for I have given you the land to possess” (Bemidbar 33:53). This, according to Ramban, is the source of the command to dwell in the land of Israel and inherit it.
This brings us the question of the religious significance of the land of Israel. Israel is clearly central to Judaism. The overarching story told in Tanakh is the promise of and journey to the land. Jewish history begins with Avraham and Sara’s journey to it. Shemot to Devarim are taken up with the second journey in the days of Moshe. Tanakh as a whole ends with Koresh king of Persia granting permission to Jews, exiled in Babylon, to return to their land (II Divrei HaYamim 36:23).
The puzzle of Jewish history is that though the Holy Land is at its heart, Jews have spent more time in exile than in Israel; more time longing for it than dwelling in it; more time travelling than arriving. On the one hand, monotheism must understand God as non-territorial. The God of everywhere can be found anywhere. He is not limited to one people or one place – as pagans believed. He exercises His power even in Egypt. He sends a prophet, Yona, to Nineveh in Assyria. He is with another prophet, Yeḥezkel, in Babylon. There is no place in the universe where He is not. On the other hand, it must be impossible to live fully as a Jew outside Israel, for if not, Jews would not have been commanded to go there initially, or to return subsequently. Why is the God beyond place to be found specifically in <i>this</i> place?
What is special about Israel? In <i>The Kuzari,</i> Judah Halevi says that different environments have different ecologies. Just as there are some countries, climates, and soils particularly suited to growing vines, so there is a country, Israel, particularly suited to growing prophets – indeed, a whole divinely inspired people. Ramban gives a different explanation. Though every land and nation is under the overarching sovereignty of God, only Israel is directly so. Others are ruled by intermediaries earthly and heavenly. Their fate is governed by other factors. Only in the land and people of Israel do we find a nation’s fortunes and misfortunes directly linked to their relationship with God.
Yehudah Halevi and Ramban both describe what we might call mystical geography. The difference between them is that Yehudah Halevi looks to earth, Ramban to heaven. For Yehudah Halevi, what is special about the land of Israel is its soil, landscape, and climate. For Ramban, it is its direct governance by God. For both of them, religious experience is possible outside Israel, but it is a pale shadow of what it is in the land.

<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br><i>There once was an old man with many pains, who was prescribed goat’s milk to drink. He bought a goat so he could drink its milk every day and be healed. Soon the goat disappeared from the house, and could not be found anywhere nearby. Days later she returned all by herself, with her udder full of milk that tasted like it was from Eden itself. Many times the goat disappeared, and then returned with milk sweeter than honey. The old man dreamed of learning where his goat went, and so his granddaughter said she would follow the goat, so they could learn what was happening.</i>
<i>The next time the goat left, the young girl followed her until they arrived at a cave, into which the goat entered. With some hesitation the girl entered after her and continued to follow the goat until they emerged from the cave into a magnificent land of mountains and rivers, trees full of fruit, and fields of grain. The goat climbed up a tree and ate from the carobs that were dripping with honey, and then drank from a clear spring of water.</i>
<i>When some people passed by, the girl asked them the name of the place they had arrived at, and they replied, “You are in the land of Israel!” She kissed the soil and blessed God for bringing her to this place, and sat down under the tree.</i>
<i>As she was sitting and eating from the fruits of the land of Israel, she planned to return home, but then she heard a voice proclaiming: “Come, let us go out to greet the Shabbat Queen.” It was too late to get home before Shabbat arrived, so she took a piece of paper and wrote a letter to her grandfather explaining where she was, and telling him to simply follow the goat the next time, and he would be able to join her in the land of Israel. She rolled up the note and placed it in the goat’s ear, because she knew that when the goat returned to her grandfather, he would pet her, and she would flick her ear, and the note would fall out. Then she sent the goat back to her grandfather.</i>
<i>The goat returned to the old man, but she did not flick her ears, and the note did not fall. When the old man saw that the goat had returned without his granddaughter, he cried a bitter cry, for his beloved was missing. He wept and mourned for his granddaughter, and whenever he saw the goat, he was reminded of his grief. So he sent for the butcher to slaughter the goat. As they were skinning her, the note fell out of her ear. As he read the note he wept and was inconsolable for his lost granddaughter and the missed opportunity to reach the land of Israel.</i>
<i>Since that time the mouth of the cave has been hidden from the eye, and there is no longer a short way to reach the land of Israel.</i>

<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. How does this story describe the unique nature of the land of Israel? How does this compare to the explanations found in</i> The Core Idea<i> and</i> Thinking More Deeply<i>?</i>
<i>2. What do you think the message of the story is?</i>
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>The Torah is not merely a code of personal perfection. It is the framework for the construction of a society, a nation, a culture. It contains welfare legislation, civil law, rules governing employer-employee relationships, environmental provisions, rules of animal welfare, public health, and governmental and judicial systems. The Torah stands at the opposite end of the spectrum from Gnosticism and other world-denying philosophies that see religion as an ascent of the soul to ethereal realms of the spirit. For Judaism, God lives here, on earth, in human lives, interactions, and associations. The Torah is terrestrial because God seeks to dwell on earth. Thus the Jewish task is to create a society with the Divine Presence in its midst.
What was and is unique about Israel is that it is the sole place on earth where Jews have had the chance to create an entire society on Jewish lines. It is possible to live a Jewish life in Manchester or Monsey, Madrid or Minsk. But it is always an abridged experience. Only in Israel do Jews conduct their lives in the language of the Bible, within time defined by the Jewish calendar, and space saturated in Jewish history. Only there do they form a majority. Only there are they able to construct a political system, an economy, and an environment on the template of Jewish values. There alone can Judaism be what it is meant to be – not just a code of conduct for individuals, but also and essentially the architectonics of a society.
Hence there must be some space on earth where Jews practise self-government under divine sovereignty. But why Israel, specifically? Because it was and is a key strategic location where three continents – Europe, Africa, and Asia – meet. Lacking the extended flat and fertile space of the Nile Delta or the Tigris-Euphrates valley (or today, the oil fields of Arabia), it could never be the base of an empire, but because of its location it was always sought after by empires. So it was politically vulnerable.
It was and is ecologically vulnerable, because its water resources are dependent on rain, which in that part of the world is never predictable (hence the frequent famines mentioned in Bereshit). Its existence could never, therefore, be taken for granted. Time and again its people, surviving challenges, would experience this as a miracle. Small geographically and demographically, it would depend on outstanding achievement – political, military, and economic – on the part of its people. This would depend, in turn, on their morale and sense of mission. Thus the prophets knew, naturally as well as supernaturally, that without social justice and a sense of divine vocation, the nation would eventually fall and suffer exile again.
There is a directness, a naturalness, of Jewish experience in Israel that can be found nowhere else. Only in Israel is God so close that you can feel Him in the sun and wind, sense Him just beyond the hills, hear Him in the inflections of everyday speech, breathe His presence in the early morning air and live, dangerously but confidently, under the shadow of His wings.
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>Because the terrain of Israel is such that it cannot become the base of an empire, it will constantly be at threat from larger and stronger neighbouring powers. Israel will always find itself outnumbered. It will need to rely on exceptional courage from its soldiers, and ingenuity in battle. That will take high national morale, which in turn will require from the people a sense of belonging to a just and inclusive society.
Commitment will be needed from every individual. They will need to feel that their cause is justified and that they are fighting for something worth preserving. So the entire configuration of the Torah’s social ethics, whose guardians were the prophets, is already implicit in the kind of geopolitical entity Israel is and will be. It would always be a small and highly vulnerable country, set in a strategic location at the junction of three continents, Europe, Africa, and Asia…as with its agriculture, so with its battles: Israel is a people that must lift its eyes to heaven.
<b><i>Future Tense</i>, 139–140</b>
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. According to the description here of the land of Israel, is it a good place to live?</i>
<i>2. Does this idea about the impact of living in Israel on its inhabitants apply equally today?</i>
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>Why is Israel central to Judaism?
How might the importance of Israel in Judaism seem to conflict with the idea of a non-territorial God?
Why did God choose Israel to be the Holy Land?
<b>EDUCATIONAL COMPANION TO THE QUESTIONS</b>
<b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>When it comes to personal Judaism, there is a wide range of opinions from Jewish thinkers on this. Ramban famously declared that Judaism in the Diaspora is merely practice for when the Jewish people can return as a nation to their land in Messianic times. However, this is a minority opinion. On a national level, it is clear that Judaism has changed dramatically since exile has forced Judaism to evolve into a personal religion of ritual practice rather than national Temple worship. Rabbi Sacks has many times expressed that the national mission of the Jewish people is to create a society based on the values and principles of Torah, and that this can only truly happen in a Jewish state.
Yehudah Halevi says that the physical land of Israel is the most conducive to developing a spiritual relationship with God. Ramban says that God personally supervises the land of Israel (which is not the case for other lands). Yehuda Halevi’s position leads to the conclusion that Israel is physically different from other lands, while Ramban’s position has it that the land of Israel is spiritually different. Both agree that this has a spiritual impact on the inhabitants of the land.
Encourage this discussion to be honest and thoughtful.
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br>The story describes in an almost mystical way the physical quality of the land of Israel. It is a literary expression of the biblical description of Israel as a “land flowing with milk and honey.” However, it is possible to interpret Agnon’s fable in a spiritual way also, and the original story explores the connection between the land and the spirituality of its participants as they welcome Shabbat.
This story was originally published in 1925, at a time when there was no State of Israel but when Zionism as an aspirational political movement was increasing in strength. The British Mandate had recently been established and the chance of a Jewish state was looking increasingly possible. Agnon often wrote from a cultural perspective of his youth in the <i>shtetl</i> of Europe, and this story is an example of this. Agnon’s message is that we have yearned to return to the land of Israel for thousands of years, waiting for a mystical route back (perhaps through the Messiah). Now, in our generation, a physical route is appearing, and if we don’t take it now we may lose the opportunity for many generations.
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>Israel is described here as a difficult place to live due to its climate (and lack of precipitation) and geopolitical location (under continuous threat of attack). However, these factors generate a spiritual strength and refinement that make it an attractive place to live spiritually.
The argument can be made that this remains the case, both in terms of climate and geopolitics. The question is whether this leads to Israelis being more focused and connected on God. (This is not about how religiously practising Israelis are, but rather about their spiritual connection to God.)
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>Israel has always been the central focus of Judaism, from the “final destination” in the biblical narrative, to the role Jerusalem and the Temple played in the service of God. During the period of exile, Israel became the focus of our daily prayer, and the place we longed to return to in Messianic times. It is even the direction to which Jews pray every day. There are many mitzvot that can only be done in the land of Israel. Israel has a central role to play in the philosophy of Rabbi Sacks, as the only place where Jews can fulfil their destiny and national mission, creating a society based on the values of the Torah.
Pagan religions believed that each nation and each region have their own personal god watching over them in that place. Judaism’s revolutionary belief is that there is one God, who is concerned and cares for all people, nations, and regions equally. The tension here is: if God is everywhere and cares for everyone, why might Israel be so important that He commanded Moshe and Yehoshua to lead us there, to settle there, and build a society of Torah values there?
According to Ramban and Yehudah Halevi, there are spiritual and physical qualities that lead to the spiritual development of the people who live in this land. According to Rabbi Sacks, it was chosen because it was and is a key strategic location where three continents meet, and because it lacks the necessary conditions to be the base of an empire. Therefore, its occupants could never become imperial (which is antithetical to Torah values). And yet, because of its location, it has always been sought after by empires, leading to political and military vulnerability. It is also ecologically vulnerable, with scarce water resources and dependency on rain, in an arid region. All of this leads its inhabitants to realise just how dependent they are on God, and this leads to an improved connection to and relationship with God.

Devarim

In a Nutshell

<b><i>IN A NUTSHELL</i></b><br>The book of Devarim is, in essence, Moshe’s renewal of the same covenant that God made with Israel at Mount Sinai. This time Moshe joins the covenant to the next generation, because they will soon enter the Promised Land and create a society based on the Torah there. And because a covenant often begins with a preamble and a historical outline, this is also how <i>Parashat Devarim</i> begins. Moshe explains the background to the covenant, and then discusses the events that led to the covenant and its renewal.
First we have an introduction that describes the time and place: we are in the last weeks of Moshe’s life and the people are camped by the banks of the River Jordan. Moshe reminds Israel about the story of the spies and the people’s lack of faith that led to forty-year wandering in the desert.
Then he moves on to more recent events, retelling the stories of their battles and victories over Moav and Amon and the settlement of their land (on the other side of the River Jordan) by the tribes of Reuven and Gad and part of Menashe. The <i>parasha</i> ends with the appointment of Yehoshua as his successor. He will lead the people into the land.
<b>QUESTION TO PONDER</b>
<i>Why do you think Yehoshua was chosen to lead after Moshe?</i>

I; The First Follower

<big><strong>I. The First Follower</strong></big><br><b><i> THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>In the last month of his life, Moshe gathered the people and taught them the laws they were to keep and reminded them of their history since the Exodus. The book of Devarim is a record of these speeches to them. Almost immediately he retells the episode of the spies, as this is the main reason the people’s parents were not allowed to enter the land. He wanted the new generation to learn the lesson of that episode and carry it with them always. They needed faith and courage. Perhaps that has always been part of what it means to be a Jew.
But the story of the spies as he tells it here is very different indeed from the version in <i>Shelaḥ</i> (Bemidbar 13–14), which describes the events as they happened at the time, almost thirty-nine years earlier. The differences between the two accounts are many and are obvious. Here I want to focus only on two differences, and the questions they raise.
<b>First:</b> Who proposed sending the spies? In <i>Shelaḥ</i>, it was God who told Moshe to do so. “The Lord said to Moshe, ‘Send men…’” In our <i>parasha</i>, it was the people who requested it: “Then all of you came to me and said, ‘Let us send men…’” Who was it: God or the people? This makes a massive difference in how we understand the episode.
<b>Second:</b> What was their mission? In our <i>parasha</i>, the people said, “Let us send men to spy out (<i>veyaḥperu)</i> the land for us” (Devarim 1:22). The twelve men “made for the hill country, came to the Eshkol Ravine, and spied it out (<i>vayeraglu</i>)” (Devarim 1:24). In other words, our <i>parasha</i> uses the two Hebrew verbs, <i>laḥpor</i> and <i>leragel</i>, that mean “to spy.”
But as I pointed out in <i>Parashat Shelaḥ</i>, the account there does not mention spying. Instead, <i>thirteen times</i>, it uses the verb <i>latur</i>, which means to tour, explore, travel, inspect.
According to Malbim, <i>latur</i> means to seek out what is good about a place. <i>Laḥpor</i> and <i>leragel</i> mean to seek out what is weak, vulnerable, exposed, defenceless. Touring and spying are completely different activities, so why does the account in our <i>parasha</i> present what happened as a spying mission, which the account in <i>Shelaḥ</i> does not?
We then hear an extraordinary statement from Moshe. Having said that the spies and the people were punished by not living to enter the Promised Land, he then says: <i>“Because of you, the Lord was incensed with me also</i>, and He said: You shall not enter it either. Yehoshua son of Nun shall enter it. Strengthen him, because he will lead Israel to inherit it” (Devarim 1:37–38).
This is very strange indeed. Moshe seems to be blaming others for what seems to be his own failing, and this appears to contradict the testimony of the Torah itself, which tells us that Moshe and Aharon’s punishment of being denied entrance to the land was because of what happened at Kadesh when the people complained about the lack of water. What they did wrong there is debated by the commentators. Was it that Moshe hit the rock? Or that he lost his temper? Or perhaps it was some deeper reason? Whichever it was, that is when God said, “Because you did not trust in Me enough to honour Me as holy in the sight of the Israelites, you will not bring this community into the land I give them.”
Which brings us to our <b>third question</b>: Why does Moshe seem to now blame the people for the story of the spies, and for his punishment?
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. Why was it important for Moshe to teach the people their history, including the mistakes that were made?</i>
<i>2. When a people sin, who is to blame: the people or their leader?</i>
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br><i>One summer at camp there was a serious problem of bullying amongst the kids. Everyone on the staff team agreed immediate action needed to be taken. So they looked to Ilana, the</i> rosh maḥaneh <i>(head of the camp), to decide what should happen. It was part of her job. But Ilana was deeply aware of the educational opportunity here and wanted to make sure it was maximised. She needed to decide how to address the bullies, how to reassure the victim of the bullying, and perhaps most importantly, how to address the issue to the entire camp.</i>
<i>Ilana consulted with David, her</i> segan<i> (assistant head of camp), and then she decided to open this up to the team of madrikhim. As a team they discussed ideas, weighing the pros and cons of each suggested approach, and thinking through which best reflected the values that were at the heart of the camp.</i>
<i>Ultimately Ilana would have to make the final decision, and she would be the one addressing the issue to the camp, the parents, and to the campers who needed to change their behaviour. So she involved all of her team in planning their next steps, which resulted in their backing her actions wholeheartedly. This united front allowed them to make a deep impact on everyone at camp that summer. Ilana showed true leadership, but her team were the ones who placed her in a position to do so</i>.
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. Does a good leader need good followers to lead?</i>
<i>2. Does a leader make good followers? Is this what happened in this story?</i>
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>Abarbanel offers a fascinating explanation for the reason Moshe and Aharon were not permitted to enter the land. He says it was not because of the episode of water at the rock in Kadesh. That is intended to distract attention from their real sins. Aharon’s real sin was the Golden Calf. Moshe’s real sin was the episode of the spies. The hint that this was so is in Moshe’s words here, “Because of you, the Lord was incensed with me also.”
How, though, could the episode of the spies have been Moshe’s fault? It wasn’t his idea to send them. According to the two accounts, it was either God or the people. Moshe also did not go on the mission. He did not bring back a report. He did not demoralise the people. Where then was Moshe at fault? Why was God angry with him?
The answer lies in the first two questions we raised: Who proposed sending the spies? And why is there a difference in the verbs used here and in <i>Shelaḥ</i>?
Following Rashi, the two accounts, here and in <i>Shelaḥ</i>, are not two different versions of the same event. They are the same version of the same event, but split in two, half told there, half here. It was the people who requested spies (as stated here). Moshe took their request to God. God acceded to the request, but as a concession, not a command: “You <i>may</i> send,” not “You <i>must</i> send” (as stated in <i>Shelaḥ</i>).
However, in granting permission, God made a specific provision. The people had asked for spies: “Let us send men ahead to spy out (<i>veyaḥperu</i>) the land for us.” God did <i>not</i> give Moshe permission to send spies. He specifically used the verb <i>latur</i>, indicating His permission for the men to tour the land, come back, and testify that it is a good and fertile land, flowing with milk and honey.
<i>The people did not need spies</i>. As Moshe reminds them, throughout the wilderness years God has been going “ahead of you on your journey, in fire by night and in a cloud by day, to search out places for you to camp and to show you the way you should go” (Devarim 1:33). They did, however, need eyewitness testimony of the beauty and fruitfulness of the land to which they had been travelling and for which they would have to fight.
<i>Moshe, however, did not make this distinction clear</i>. He told the twelve men: “See what the land is like and whether the people who live there are strong or weak, few or many. What kind of land do they live in? Is it good or bad? What kind of towns do they live in? Are they unwalled or fortified?” This sounds dangerously like instructions for a spying mission.
When ten of the men came back with a demoralising report and the people panicked, at least part of the blame lay with Moshe. The people had asked for spies. He should have made it clear that the men he was sending were not to act as spies.
How did Moshe come to make such a mistake? Rashi suggests an answer. Our <i>parasha</i> says: “Then <i>all of you came to me</i> and said, ‘Let us send men ahead to spy out the land for us.’” The English translation does not convey the sense of menace in the original text. They came, says Rashi, “in a crowd,” without respect, protocol, or order. They were a mob, and they were potentially dangerous. This mirrors the people’s behaviour at the beginning of the story of the Golden Calf: “When the people saw that Moshe was so long in coming down from the mountain, they <i>gathered against Aharon</i> and said to him….”
Faced with an angry mob, a leader is not always in control of the situation. True leadership is impossible in the face of the madness of crowds. Moshe’s mistake, if the analysis here is correct, was a very subtle one, the difference between a spying mission and a morale-boosting eyewitness account of the land. Even so, it must have been almost inevitable given the mood of the people.
That is what Moshe meant when he said, “Because of you the Lord was incensed with me too.” He meant that God was angry with him for not showing stronger leadership, but it was they – or rather, their parents – who made that leadership impossible.
This suggests a fundamental, counterintuitive truth. There is a fine TED talk about leadership by Derek Sivers called “How to start a movement.” It takes less than three minutes to watch, and it asks, “What makes a leader?” It answers: “The first follower.”
There is a famous saying of the Sages: “Make for yourself a teacher and acquire for yourself a friend” (Avot 1:6). The order of the verbs seems wrong. You don’t make a teacher, you acquire one. You don’t acquire a friend, you make one. In fact, though, the statement is precisely right. <i>You make a teacher by being willing to learn. You make a leader by being willing to follow.</i> When people are unwilling to follow, even the greatest leader cannot lead. That is what happened to Aharon at the time of the Golden Calf, and in a far more subtle way it also happened to Moshe at the time of the spies.
This, I would argue, is one reason why Yehoshua was chosen to be Moshe’s successor. There were other distinguished candidates, including Pinḥas and Kalev. But Yehoshua, serving Moshe throughout the wilderness years, was a role model of what it is to be a follower. That is something fundamental that the Israelites still needed to learn.
<b>I believe that followership is the great neglected art. Followers and leaders form a partnership of mutual challenge and respect. To be a follower in Judaism is not to be submissive, uncritical, blindly accepting. Questioning and arguing is part of the relationship. Too often, though, we decry a lack of leadership when we are really suffering from a lack of followership.</b>
<b>QUESTION TO PONDER</b>
<i>How is a democratic system of government based on this idea of followership?</i>
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>In Judaism, followership is as active and demanding as leadership. We can put this more strongly: leaders and followers do not sit on opposite sides of the table. They are on the same side, the side of justice and compassion and the common good. No one is above criticism, and no one too junior to administer it, if done with due grace and humility…all of us, simply by bearing the name Israel, are summoned to wrestle with God and our fellow humans in the name of the right and the good.
<b><i>Lessons in Leadership</i>, 160</b>
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>What was the purpose of the spies’ mission originally supposed to be and what did it become?
Why was Yehoshua chosen to be Moshe’s successor?
According to Rabbi Sacks, what was Moshe’s real failing as a leader?
<b>EDUCATIONAL COMPANION TO THE QUESTIONS</b>
<b><i>IN A NUTSHELL</i></b><br>Yehoshua had been a loyal and long-serving deputy to Moshe. He had watched and learned from Moshe throughout his time as leader of the people. He had also proved himself during the episode of the spies, where he showed his loyalty to Moshe, to God, and to the land of Israel.
<b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>Every nation and every individual must learn their history in order to understand their identity. Sometimes learning history can be painful. There is a common saying: “Those who fail to learn the lessons of history are doomed to repeat it” (attributed to George Santayana, the philosopher, poet, and novelist, who most likely said it in the following way: “Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it”). This adage expresses the reason behind why Moshe made sure to reiterate the painful episodes of the previous generation – for educational reasons.
It is harsh to blame the leadership of a wayward people, but they cannot be considered blameless. The people here were the sinners, but Moshe was also held responsible. He certainly was responsible for the way he responded to his wayward flock, when he failed to live up to God’s expectations.
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br>Without any followers, a leader is not a leader. Without good followers, a leader cannot be a good leader. It is in fact the followers of a leader who create the leader and determine how successful they will be.
In this story, Ilana empowered her staff to take joint responsibility. Although she fronted the decisions, and would ultimately be judged by them, she brought her followers into the process of leadership. This is an example of how a leader can encourage her followers to be “good followers,” which in turn creates good leadership.
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>Democratically elected leaders only find themselves in a position of leadership because their followers have placed them there. They also face continued feedback and critique in a democratic system, via polls and a free press, and any subsequent campaigns for re-election.
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>The spies (who were not really spies but princes of each tribe) were sent on a fact-finding mission to inform the people of the quality of the land. But because of their approach (and lack of faith) they brought back an evaluation of the oncoming difficulties of conquering the land instead. This panicked the people, who lost their faith quickly.
Yehoshua had served an extensive apprenticeship to Moshe, and therefore witnessed his leadership in close quarters for many years. He had also proven his loyalty, both to Moshe and to God, on many occasions (including his response as a member of the mission of the spies). Yehoshua had also modelled what a good follower looks like, and so now the people would know how to follow him and install him as a successful leader in Moshe’s stead.
Moshe’s real failure as a leader is most clearly evident during the sin of the spies. At this time, he did not show strong leadership, and the people did not follow his lead. Perhaps he should have found a way to encourage the people to be good followers – inspiring them, allowing him to lead – and this may be what he meant when he said, “Because of you the Lord was incensed with me too.” He failed to ensure that the spies and the people understood the real nature of their mission, and then he failed to deal with the repercussions of this initial failure when the people lost faith and wished to return to Egypt.

II; The Teacher as Hero

<big><strong>II. The Teacher as Hero</strong></big><br><b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>Imagine you are 119 years and 11 months old. The end of your life is in sight. Your hopes and dreams have received devastating blows. You have been told by God that you will not enter the land to which you have been leading your people for forty years. You have been repeatedly criticised by the people you have led. Your sister and brother, with whom you shared the burdens of leadership, have died. And you know that neither of your children, Gershom and Eliezer, will succeed you. Your life seems to be coming to a tragic end, your destination unreached, your hopes unfulfilled. What do you do?
You could sink into sadness, reflecting on what might have been, had the past taken a different direction. You could continue to plead with God to change His mind and let you cross the Jordan. You could retreat into memories of the good times: when the people sang a song at the Red Sea, when they accepted the covenant at Sinai, when they built the <i>Mishkan</i>. These would be the normal human reactions. Moshe did none of these things – and what he did instead helped change the course of Jewish history.
Moshe gathered the people on the far side of the Jordan and spoke to them for a month. Those speeches became the book of Devarim. The topics are extremely diverse, covering a history of the past, prophecies and warnings about the future, laws, stories, a song, and a set of blessings. Together they form a profound vision of what it is to be a holy people, dedicated to God, and instructions of how to construct a society that would be a model for humanity in combining freedom and order, justice and compassion, individual dignity and collective responsibility.
Let us now look beyond what Moshe said in the last month of his life, and examine what Moshe <i>did</i>. He changed careers. He shifted his relationship with the people. No longer defined as Moshe the great and powerful leader who set them free, the lawgiver, the worker of miracles, the intermediary between the Israelites and God, he now became the figure known to Jewish memory: <i>Moshe Rabbeinu</i>, “Moshe our teacher.”
That is how Devarim begins – “Moshe began to explain this law” (1:5). The Torah uses the verb <i>be’er</i> (to explain), in a way that we have not seen used before. Moshe wanted to explain, expand on, make clear. He wanted the people to realise that Judaism is not a religion of mysteries that makes sense only to a few special people. It is – as he would say in his very last speech – an “inheritance of the entire congregation of Yaakov” (33:4).
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. Why do you think Moshe made this career change at the end of his life?</i>
<i>2. Why do you think Moshe is known to us as</i> Moshe Rabbeinu,<i> “Moshe our teacher,” rather than as any of the other roles he played?</i>
<i>3. Do teachers play an  important role in your life?</i>
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br>Nehama Leibowitz, the famous Jerusalem Torah scholar, writer, and teacher who died in 1997, requested that the only words that appear on her gravestone should be her name and the single word <i>mora</i> – teacher. For her, this was her greatest achievement, her life’s work, and the ultimate honour and title. The following story was written by a teacher who read this about Nehama Leibowitz and thought, “I feel the same way!”
<i>When I was training to be a secondary school teacher (for pupils aged 11</i>–<i>18) at the very beginning of my career, the university course required that the first week be spent in a primary school (for pupils aged 4</i>–<i>11) so that we could gain an understanding of where our high school students would be coming from. Without a moment’s hesitation I knew which school and which teacher I would choose to shadow.</i>
<i>Rabbi B. was my favourite teacher from primary school. That I knew. But to be honest, I had no idea why. I do not particularly remember any of the lessons he taught or information that I left his classes with, and I am sure that over the years as I continued my Jewish education I relearned that information many times since. So what was it about this particular teacher that had had such a lasting impact on me? I was excited to find out.</i>
<i>It didn’t take long. As soon as I entered his classroom and perched my full-sized body on one of the tiny chairs, it was obvious to me that his classroom was filled with love and respect for his students, and with their respect for him in return. He connected to the soul of each of his students individually, and taught them using his own soul. I knew then that I wanted to model my teaching on his. Some twenty-five years later, I pray I have lived up to this wish.</i>
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. Do you have any teachers like this, who you can imagine you will remember for many years to come?</i>
<i>2. What do you think is the key to being a teacher who can make an impact like this?</i>
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>Moshe became, in the last month of his life, the master educator. In these addresses recorded in the book of Devarim, he does more than just tell the people <i>what</i> the law is. He explains to them <i>why</i> the law is. There is nothing arbitrary about it. The law is as it is because of the people’s experience of slavery and persecution in Egypt, which was their tutorial in why we need freedom and law-governed liberty. Time and again he says: <i>You shall do this because you were once slaves in Egypt.</i> They must <i>remember</i> and <i>never forget</i> – two verbs that appear repeatedly in the book – where they came from and what it felt like to be exiled, persecuted, and powerless.
Throughout Devarim, Moshe reaches a new level of authority and wisdom. For the first time we hear him speak extensively in his own voice, rather than merely as the transmitter of God’s words to him. His grasp of vision and detail is faultless. He wants the people to understand that the laws God has commanded them are for their good, not just God’s.
At this defining moment of his life, Moshe understood that, though he would not be <i>physically</i> with the people when they entered the Promised Land, he could still be with them intellectually, spiritually, and emotionally if he gave them the teachings to take with them into the future. Moshe became the pioneer of perhaps the single greatest contribution of Judaism to the concept of leadership: the idea of the teacher as hero.
Heroes are people who demonstrate courage in the field of battle. What Moshe knew was that the most important battles are not military. They are spiritual, moral, cultural. A military victory shifts the pieces on the chessboard of history. A spiritual victory changes lives. A military victory is almost always short-lived. Either the enemy attacks again or a new and more dangerous opponent appears. But spiritual victories can – if their lesson is not forgotten – last forever. Even quite ordinary people, Yiftaḥ, for example, or Shimshon, can be military heroes. But those who teach people to see, feel, and act differently, who enlarge the moral horizons of humankind, are rare indeed. Of these, Moshe was the greatest.
Not only does <i>he</i> become the teacher in Devarim. In words engraved on Jewish hearts ever since, he tells the entire people that <i>they</i> must become a nation of educators: “<i>Teach [these words] repeatedly to your children,</i>” speaking of them when you sit at home and when you travel on the way, when you lie down and when you rise (Devarim 6:7).
In Devarim, a new word enters the biblical vocabulary: the verb <i>l-m-d</i><b>,</b> meaning to learn or teach. The verb does not appear even once in Bereshit, Shemot, Vayikra, or Bemidbar. In Devarim it appears seventeen times.
There was nothing like this concern for universal education elsewhere in the ancient world. Jews became the people whose heroes were teachers, whose citadels were schools, and whose passion was study and the life of the mind.
Moshe’s end-of-life transformation is one of the most inspiring in all of religious history. In that one act, he redeemed his career from tragedy. He became a leader not only for his time but for all time. His body did not accompany his people as they entered the land, but his teachings did. His sons did not succeed him, but his disciples did. He may have felt that he had not changed his people in his lifetime, but in the full perspective of history, he changed them more than any leader has ever changed any people, turning them into the people of the book and the nation who built not pyramids but schools and houses of study.
The poet Shelley famously said, “Poets are the unacknowledged legislators of the world.” In truth, though, it is not poets but teachers who shape society, handing on the legacy of the past to those who build the future. That insight sustained Judaism for longer than any other civilisation, and it began with Moshe in the last month of his life.
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>The greatest leader we ever had was Moshe. And what fascinates me is the title we gave him. Moshe was a liberator, a law-giver, a military commander, and a prophet. But we call him none of these things. Instead we call him <i>Moshe Rabbeinu</i>, “Moshe our teacher,” because that, for us, is the highest honour….
Teachers open our eyes to the world. They give us curiosity and confidence. They teach us to ask questions. They connect us to our past and future. They’re the guardians of our social heritage. We have lots of heroes today, and they are often celebrities – athletes, supermodels, media personalities. They come, they have their fifteen minutes of fame, and they go. But the influence of good teachers stays with us. They are the people who really shape our life.
<b><i>From Optimism to Hope,</i> 132</b>
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. Why is being a teacher “the highest honour” for Judaism? Do you think this is reflected in wider society?</i>
<i>2. Who are your heroes? Are any of your teachers a hero?</i>
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>Why do you think Moshe focused on education at the end of his life, and became known to us simply as <i>Moshe Rabbeinu</i>, “Moshe our teacher,” rather than another equally deserved title?
How can a teacher make an impact that will last long after they have stopped teaching the student? How did Moshe do this?
How and why did the Jewish people become a “nation of educators?”
<b>EDUCATIONAL COMPANION TO THE QUESTIONS</b>
<b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>Moshe realised that soon he would no longer be a physical presence for the people, personally leading them through the upcoming challenges they would face. So he changed the focus of his role to making an impact that would last beyond his life, becoming a teacher, leaving a legacy that would guide his people, and all subsequent generations of the people (even until today).
While Moshe played many important roles as the greatest leader of the Jewish people, such as statesman, military leader, and spiritual leader as a prophet, his role as a teacher is the one that has had the longest impact on future generations. Perhaps this is because the role of the teacher is the most respected and honoured in Judaism. What we are taught, and what we pass on to others, outlives us, and can span across generations.
Hopefully the younger generation discussing this can see the importance of teachers in their lives and the lasting impact they can have (although not all teachers have a long-lasting or positive impact on the lives of their students, every teacher has the potential to do this).
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br>In all likelihood, we will each have only a handful of teachers (if we are lucky) who will leave a lasting impact like this. And it may be hard for a child to identify them while still a student. They may need the help of an adult to identify the qualities in a teacher that will leave a lasting impact.
There are pedagogic skills that can be learned, and improved with experience, such as classroom management and curriculum development. But the essence of good teaching is love and respect, and that is what Rabbi B. based his teaching on, and what made him beloved as a teacher then and now.
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>Because education is one of the highest values in Judaism, being a teacher is one of the highest honours for Jews, and is a highly valued and deeply respected profession. Perhaps this is not reflected in wider society, where other values (such as wealth and power) are prioritised by many. Some argue this can be seen in the salaries commanded by various professions.
A hero is a person who is admired or idealised for courage, outstanding achievements, or noble qualities. The greatest teachers leave a real, positive impact on their students, and their actions and values could allow us to respect them as heroic figures who make a lasting impact on us.
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>Moshe changed his focus towards the end of his life to creating a legacy that would outlive him. By playing a stronger role as a teacher, he left a lasting imprint on his people, in both that generation and beyond, until today. While Moshe played many important roles as the greatest leader of the Jewish people, his role as teacher is the one that has had the longest impact on future generations.
A teacher can still have an impact on his or her students long after ceasing to teach them by giving them teachings and values they can take with them into the future. Moshe realised this and so he dedicated the remaining time he had with his people to teaching them everything he felt they needed to know in their hearts to go on without him.
The value of education has been central to the Jewish people since the beginning of their history. Love of learning has always been a core value in Judaism, found in Jewish texts and Jewish traditions. Elevating education to a central and core Jewish value has meant that literacy levels among Jewish communities were often much higher than the average, and many Jewish people reach adulthood with a great love for learning. Many Jewish children grow up to be rabbis, teachers, leaders, writers, educators, academics, and teachers to their own children. Ensuring that all Jews are fully versed in their own traditions and laws has also contributed to the strength of Jewish identity and continuity throughout the period of exile, being one of the factors explaining the miracle of Jewish survival and continuity against the odds.

Vaetchanan

In a Nutshell

<b><i>IN A NUTSHELL</i></b><br><i>Vaetḥanan</i> contains some of the most important sections of the whole Torah. First Moshe tells the people how special their laws and history are. Their mitzvot, their laws, were given by God Himself, and their history was written by God. There is no other nation that can say the same.
Moshe then begins his second great speech in preparation for the Israelites to enter the land of Israel. He reminds the people of the Ten Commandments and he retells how they were given to Israel by God at Mount Sinai. He then commands them to remember to make God the centre of their lives – the words he uses will become the first paragraph of the <i>Shema</i>, the greatest expression of our love for God. This love is more than an emotion. It is an ideal that we surround ourselves with. We constantly speak about it with our children, men wear it on their arms and heads in the form of tefillin, and we place it as mezuzot “on the doorposts” of all the rooms in our homes (Devarim 6:9).
<b>QUESTION TO PONDER</b>
<i>Isn’t it enough to do the mitzvot? Why must we love God also?</i>

I; The Infinite Game

<big><strong>I. The Infinite Game</strong></big><br><b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>It says in this <i>parasha</i>: “Be sure to keep the commandments, decrees, and laws that the Lord your God has commanded you. Do what is right and good in the eyes of the Lord” (Devarim 6:17–18).
The second verse seems strange. Doesn’t the first verse cover all 613 of the Torah’s mitzvot? Why then does the Torah add, “Do what is right and good in the eyes of the Lord”? Surely, doing what is right and good means keeping God’s commands, decrees, and laws. Are these not two ways of saying the same thing?
The Talmud (Bava Metzia 108a) explains: “And you shall do that which is right and good in the eyes of the Lord” means that one should ensure that every action is right and good, even beyond what we are legally allowed to do. For an example of this in the Torah, let’s look at <i>dina debar metzra</i>, “the law of the bordering property.” When a landowner comes to sell a piece of land, the owner of the neighbouring land has the right to buy it. If it is instead sold to someone else, the neighbour can force the buyer to give them the land, and then reimburse them for the price they paid for it.
This law is not about land ownership as such. In general, a landowner has the right to sell to whomever they choose. It is about doing “the right and the good” – what people sometimes call <i>being a mensch</i>. To the neighbour, the purchase of the land is an immense good. They can expand their estate without having to spread their landholdings in different locations. To the outsider, losing this purchase is not a significant loss because they can acquire other fields elsewhere. The law of <i>bar metzra</i> goes beyond the usual principles of law in order to achieve a moral end: helping one’s neighbour.
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. What is the difference between laws and morality?</i>
<i>2. Why do we keep laws? Why should we try to be moral?</i>
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br><i>It was two weeks until Aryeh’s bar mitzva. He had been practising his parasha,</i> Vaetḥanan<i>, for many months, and although he was nervous, deep down he knew he was prepared. But he still needed to find a devar Torah for his speech, and this was easier said than done. With so many different topics in</i> Vaetḥanan<i>, which idea should he choose to speak about?</i>
<i>Then he noticed something strange in Devarim</i> 6:17–18<i>. After reminding us of the Ten Commandments and the Shema, Hashem tells us not only to keep all the commandments, but to also “do what is right and good in the eyes of God.”</i>
<i>“Surely the right thing is to keep all the mitzvot!” he said to his father. “What else is Hashem telling us?”</i>
<i>So they sat down together to take a closer look. “Do you think it is possible to keep the mitzvot according to all the laws, and still not be doing ‘what is right and good’?” asked his father. Aryeh thought about this and became frustrated. “How can there be more than keeping the mitzvot? What else can God expect from us?” he demanded.</i>
<i>“I think we might find the answer in the FA Cup,” his father replied with a mischievous grin. Aryeh looked totally confused. They had just watched their beloved Arsenal football team reach the FA Cup finals at the expense of the superior Manchester City (a miracle of almost biblical proportions), but what on earth could that have to do with</i> Vaetḥanan<i>?</i>
<i>“Let me explain,” said his father. “Before you were born, in 1999, Arsenal faced Sheffield United in the fifth round of the FA Cup. With fifteen minutes remaining, the score was level at 1-1 but then a Sheffield player got injured. A teammate kicked the ball out to allow him to receive treatment, and when the game restarted, Arsenal threw the ball back towards the Sheffield side so they could start the game again in possession. But Arsenal’s striker Kanu misunderstood what had happened. He ran on to the loose ball and crossed to Marc Overmars, who calmly slotted the ball away for the winning goal!”</i>
<i>“Wow, the Sheffield players must have been furious!” Aryeh exclaimed, understanding the injustice of the moment.</i>
<i>“They were! They demanded that the referee disallow the goal, but there was nothing the ref could do. Arsenal had not broken any official rules, only an unwritten rule of decency and fair play that could not be enforced. The Sheffield team didn’t want to forfeit the match, so they played on, and a few minutes later the final whistle blew and they were out of the Cup.”</i>
<i>“I get it!” exclaimed Aryeh. “This is an example of when playing by the rules just isn’t enough. Arsenal didn’t do the right thing, despite not breaking the rules!”</i>
<i>“Exactly,” said his father with a smile. “This is just what Hashem is asking of us. Not only to keep the rules, which are the mitzvot, but also to always do ‘the right thing,’ which sometimes requires more. In the end Arsenal did do the right thing. The team and their manager Arsène<b></b> Wenger were upset by the misunderstanding, and wanted to play the game under fairer conditions, so they offered a rematch. This had never happened in the history of the FA Cup. And Arsenal won the rematch and progressed to the next round, although sadly they lost in the semi-final, so this year’s team has already gone one better. Let’s hope they win it for you on your bar mitzva!”</i>
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. How are the laws of the game and the spirit of the game different?</i>
<i>2. How are the rules of football similar to Devarim 6:17–18?</i>
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>The popular author and TED lecturer Simon Sinek recently published a book entitled <i>The Infinite Game</i> about the difference between two types of enterprise. One, a <i>finite game</i>, has a starting and ending point. It obeys rules, recognises boundaries, and has winners and losers. Most sports are like this. Often, politics is too: there are campaigns, elections, rules and regulations, winning and losing amongst the candidates. Businesses can be run this way as well, when they focus on quarterly profits, share price, market share, and the like.
But there are also <i>infinite games</i>. These have no starting point or finishing line, no clear winners and losers, no agreed rules or boundaries. Art is like this. So are music and literature. Beethoven didn’t win. Bach didn’t lose. Great artists change the rules. That is what Beethoven, Schoenberg, and Stravinsky did; so too did Van Gogh, Cézanne, and Picasso. Politics can be like this when it rises above opinion polls and sets its vision on larger issues of justice, equality, and the moral health of society. Education is a finite game when it focuses on exam results and qualifications, or it can be an infinite game when it is about breadth and depth of understanding and character development.
Finite games are played to win. Infinite games are played for their own sake. Finite games are usually performed in front of an audience of some kind. Infinite games are participative. We engage in them because we are changed by them. Infinite games are not a means to an end: winning the championship, beating the market, victory in an election. Instead they are what psychologists call autotelic, that is, they contain their purpose within themselves. We do them because the activity is inherently creative, demanding, uplifting, and ennobling.
These are not simply two types of games. They are two different ways of playing a game. If, in any country at any time, politics is treated as a finite game where the focus is on popularity, ratings, and election results, then it quickly becomes superficial, trivial, uninspiring. The quality of leadership declines. The public becomes cynical and disillusioned. Trust is eroded and the social bond becomes frayed. When politics is lifted by a sense of history and destiny on the part of its leaders, when it becomes not the pursuit of power but a form of service to others and social responsibility, when it is driven by high ideals and ethical aspiration, then leadership becomes statesmanship and politics itself a noble calling.
This is not to denigrate finite games. We need them, because in many spheres of life we need rules, boundaries, and time limits. But we must also have space for infinite games because they are among the highest expressions of the human spirit.
These reflections are prompted by the two verses quoted above (Devarim 6:17–18). Rashi says that doing what is right and good in the eyes of the Lord means “compromise, acting beyond the strict demands of the law.” Ramban agrees with this but goes on to make a fascinating and fundamental point:
First we are told to keep the commandments, testimonies, and laws as God has commanded them. And then we are taught: even regarding what God did <i>not</i> command, pay attention to do what is good and right in God’s eyes, because God loves goodness and righteousness. This is important because it is impossible to mention in the Torah all the details of people’s behaviour with neighbours and friends, or business conduct or local ordinances. The Torah mentions many such laws…[and then] states generally that one should do what is good and right regarding everything, including compromise and acting beyond the strict demands of the law.
Ramban seems to be concurring with Rashi, but actually he is making a somewhat different point. Rashi is saying: keep the law and go beyond it. Ramban is saying that there are some things that <i>cannot be specified by law</i>: “Because it is impossible to mention in the Torah all the details of people’s behaviour.” The Torah gives us specific examples: don’t gossip, don’t take revenge, and so on. But the rest depends on the situation, the circumstances, and the person or people you are dealing with.
Not all the Torah is a finite game. Much of it is. There are rules, commands, decrees, and laws. There is the halakha. There are boundaries: milk, meat, public domain, private domain. There are beginnings and endings: the earliest time to say the morning <i>Shema</i> and the latest time. There are successes and defeats: either one does or doesn’t complete the counting of the Omer. All of this is finite even though it is dedicated to the One-who-is-Infinite.
Ramban’s point, however, is that there are significant areas of the moral life that cannot be reduced to rules. That is because rules deal in generalities, and human lives are particular. We are all different. So is every situation in which we find ourselves. Good people know when to speak, when to be silent, when to praise, when to challenge. They hear the unspoken word, sense the concealed pain, focus on the other person rather than on themselves, and are guided by a deeply internalised moral sense that leads them instinctively away from anything less than the right and the good. The “right and the good in the sight of the Lord” is about leading a moral life during the infinite game of life.
<b>I believe that we make a fundamental error when we think that all we need to know and to keep are the rules governing interactions <i>bein adam leḥavero</i>, between us and our fellows. The rules are essential but also incomplete. We need to develop a conscience that does not permit us to wrong, harm, or hurt someone even if the rules permit us to do so. The moral life is an infinite game which cannot be reduced to rules. We need to learn and internalise a sense of “the right and the good.”</b>
<b>QUESTION TO PONDER</b>
<i>Can you think of practical examples of when this message needs to be heeded?</i>
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>Morality matters because we cherish relationships and believe that love, friendship, work, and even the casual encounter of strangers are less fragile and abrasive when conducted against a shared code of civility and mutuality. It matters because we care for liberty and have come to understand that human dignity is better served by the restraints we impose on ourselves than those forced upon us by external laws and punishment and police.
<b><i>Morality,</i> 319</b>
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>Which parts of the Torah are a “finite game” and which are an “infinite game”?
What motivates us to keep the mitzvot and what motivates us to “do what is right”? Are they separate motivations?
Why does the Torah need to add the extra command to “do what is right”?
<b>EDUCATIONAL COMPANION TO THE QUESTIONS</b>
<b><i>IN A NUTSHELL</i></b><br>This question reflects an age-old debate – do we need to have the correct focus and intention when we perform mitzvot? Or is just fulfilling the act of the mitzva enough? Which is primary in Judaism, belief or practice? The context of the <i>Shema</i> in our <i>parasha</i>, included immediately after the Ten Commandments, seems to suggest that loving (and obviously believing in) God is important when practising mitzvot. This connects to the message of the <i>Covenant &amp; Conversation</i> essay. The morality that is expected beyond practice – going beyond the letter of the law – is more likely to come from the motivation of love of God than commitment to following the laws of Judaism for their own sake.
<b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>Laws are a system that enforces the values of a society. These should be moral, and their goal is to ensure people lead a moral life. But they are not the sum total of morality. A system of law cannot be comprehensive and apply to every situation. It is possible to obey the laws and still find ways to not be moral. Morality, doing “what is right,” is the way we keep the laws, and the way we live in society. The Torah needs to command both, to ensure that we follow the laws and also concern ourselves with doing “what is right” in the way we live our lives.
We keep the laws because they are enforced by the state or the rabbinic law courts, or some other authority. We fear punishment or social marginalisation and this motivates us to be law abiding. However, we are moral because we believe it is the right way to live.
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br>The laws of the game try to enforce the spirit of the game, but in football, like in any other legal system, laws can be obeyed and enforced without the spirit of the game being ensured. In this case, while Arsenal were keeping the laws of the game, and the referee was enforcing these laws, the spirit of the game was missing, because the Arsenal team mistakenly did not give the ball back to Sheffield United when they deserved it (having kicked the ball out of play so their player could receive treatment). The referee could not enforce the spirit of the game, but ultimately the Arsenal manager, Arsène Wenger, showed a commitment to the true spirit of the game by offering a rematch.
In our <i>parasha</i>, the Torah commands us to keep the mitzvot and to do “what is right.” The mitzvot (the laws) are not enough to achieve “what is right,” just as the laws of football are not always enough to ensure the spirit of the game. The “spirit of the game” in the Torah is morality – “what is right.”
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>The Ramban developed the idea of <i>naval bireshut haTorah</i> (see his commentary on Vayikra 19:2). He describes someone who keeps all the mitzvot and halakhot, but who despite this is not moral, someone who doesn’t treat people respectfully and finds other loopholes in the law – ultimately, this kind of person keeps to the written rules but is immoral. Unfortunately, we can find examples (in all religions) of religiously observant people who are careful to keep the laws but not careful to be good, moral people who treat others kindly. These verses are addressing these people in particular.
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>There are rules in the Torah, commands, decrees, and laws. There is the halakha. Examples given here include boundaries: milk and meat, public domains and private domains. There are beginnings and endings: the earliest time to say the morning <i>Shema</i> and the latest time. There are successes and defeats: either one does or doesn’t complete the counting of the Omer. The “right and the good in the eyes of the Lord” is about the part of the moral life that is an infinite game. These are the areas of the moral life that cannot be reduced to rules, but describe ongoing behaviour, especially towards other people.
We keep the laws because they are enforced by rewards and punishments. These may be man-made consequences (rabbinic in this case) or from God (spiritual reward and punishment). We “do what is right” because it is right. This is morality, and in <i>Parashat Vaetḥanan</i> God urges us to identify it and protect it.
It is possible to keep the laws in full and still not “do what is right.” Ramban calls this a <i>naval bireshut haTorah</i> (someone who is immoral despite keeping the laws of the Torah). Rules deal in generalities, and human lives are particular. We are all different. So is every situation in which we find ourselves. “Do what is right” is our guiding principle here – to follow the spirit of the Torah even when the law of the Torah does not specify an action or behaviour.

II; Why Is the Jewish People So Small?

<big><strong>II. Why Is the Jewish People So Small?</strong></big><br><b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>Near the end of <i>Vaetḥanan</i> is a short statement which can be easy to miss, but it is an almost radical point of great importance. It seems to give us an entirely new impression of the children of Israel. Moshe says, “The Lord did not set His affection on you and choose you because you were more numerous than other peoples, for you are the fewest of all peoples” (Devarim 7:7).
This is not what we have heard thus far. In Bereshit, God promised the patriarchs that they would have so many descendants that they would be like the stars of the heaven, the sand on the seashore, the dust of the earth, uncountable. And Avraham was told he was fated to become the father, of not just one nation but of many. At the beginning of Shemot, we read of how the covenantal family, numbering a mere seventy when they went down to Egypt, “became so numerous that the land was filled with them” (Shemot 1:7). Three times in the book of Devarim, Moshe describes the Israelites as being “as many as the stars of the sky” (1:10; 10:22; 28:62).
In all these texts, as well as in several others, it is the size of the people that is emphasised, the idea that one day we will be great in number. So what does Moshe mean by speaking of our smallness? There is something in this verse that connects to the reality of Jewish history. Historically, Jews were a small people. Still today, we form less than 0.2 per cent of the population of the world. There are two reasons for this. First is the heavy toll taken through the ages by exile and persecution. It has been hard for our scattered people to flourish, as Jews have been attacked, expelled, or forced to convert in many countries over the years. The Jewish population is a mere fraction of what it might have been had there been no Hadrian, no Crusades, and no antisemitism.
The second reason is that Jews did not seek to convert others. Had they done so, they would have been closer in numbers to Christianity (2.4 billion) or Islam (1.6 billion). In fact, Malbim (a biblical commentator born in 1809 in Ukraine) reads something like this into our verse. The previous verses have said that the Israelites were about to enter a land with seven nations: Hittites, Girgashites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites. Moshe warns them against intermarriage with the other nations, not for racial but for religious reasons: “They will turn your children away from following Me to serve other gods” (Devarim 7:4). Malbim interprets our verse as Moshe saying to the Israelites: Do not justify out-marriage on the grounds that it will increase the number of Jews. God is not interested in numbers.

<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br>Mark Twain is widely considered to be one of America’s finest writers. His real name was Samuel Langhorne Clemens (1835–1910). The following famous passage is taken from a magazine article he wrote in answer to a request to clarify his views about the Jews.
<i>If the statistics are right, the Jews constitute but one percent of the human race. It suggests a nebulous dim puff of star dust lost in the blaze of the Milky Way.</i>
<i>Properly the Jew ought hardly to be heard of; but he is heard of, has always been heard of. He is as prominent on the planet as any other people, and his commercial importance is extravagantly out of proportion to the smallness of his bulk.</i>
<i>His contributions to the world’s list of great names in literature, science, art, music, finance, medicine, and abstruse learning are also away out of proportion to the weakness of his numbers. He has made a marvelous fight in this world, in all the ages; and has done it with his hands tied behind him. He could be vain of himself, and be excused for it.</i>
<i>The Egyptian, the Babylonian, and the Persian rose, filled the planet with sound and splendor, then faded to dream-stuff and passed away; the Greek and the Roman followed, and made a vast noise, and they are gone; other peoples have sprung up and held their torch high for a time, but it burned out, and they sit in twilight now, or have vanished. The Jew saw them all, beat them all, and is now what he always was, exhibiting no decadence, no infirmities of age, no weakening of his parts, no slowing of his energies, no dulling of his alert and aggressive mind.</i>

<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>Tanakh itself offers one extraordinary episode that sheds a different light on the issue of the size of the Jewish people. It occurs in the seventh chapter of the book of Shofetim. God has told Gidon to assemble an army and do battle with the Midianites. He gathers a force of 32,000 men. God tells him, “You have too many men. I cannot deliver Midyan into their hands, or Israel would boast against Me, ‘My own strength has saved me’” (Shofetim 7:2).
God tells Gidon to say to the men: Whoever is afraid and wishes to go home may do so. Twenty-two thousand men leave. Ten thousand remain. God tells Gidon, “There are still too many men.” He proposes a new test. Gidon is to take the men to a river and see how they drink the water. Ninety-seven hundred kneel down to drink, and are dismissed. Gidon is left with a mere three hundred men. “With the three hundred men that lapped [the water], I will save you and give the Midianites into your hands,” God tells him (Shofetim 7:1–8). By a brilliant and unexpected strategy, the three hundred men then put the entire Midianite army to flight.
<i>The Jewish people are small but have achieved great things to testify within themselves to a force beyond themselves.</i> It has achieved things no other nation its size could have achieved. Its history has been living testimony to the force of divine providence and the impact of high ideals. That is what Moshe meant when he said:
“Ask now about the former days, long before your time, from the day God created human beings on the earth; ask from one end of the heavens to the other. Has anything so great as this ever happened, or has anything like it ever been heard of? Has any other people heard the voice of God speaking out of fire, as you have, and lived? Has any god ever tried to take for himself one nation out of another nation, by tests, by signs and wonders, by war, by a mighty hand and an outstretched arm, or by great and awesome deeds, like all the things the Lord your God did for you in Egypt before your very eyes?” (Devarim 4:32–34).
Israel defies the laws of history because it serves the Author of history. Attached to greatness, it becomes great. Through the Jewish people, God is telling humankind that you do not need to be numerous to be great. Nations are judged not by their size but by their contribution to human heritage. Of this the most compelling proof is that a nation as small as the Jews could produce an ever-renewed flow of prophets, priests, poets, philosophers, sages, saints, halakhists, aggadists, codifiers, commentators, rebbes, and <i>roshei yeshivot.</i> It has also yielded some of the world’s greatest writers, artists, musicians, filmmakers, academics, intellectuals, doctors, lawyers, businesspeople, and technological innovators. Out of all proportion to their numbers, Jews could and can be found working as lawyers fighting injustice, economists fighting poverty, doctors fighting disease, teachers fighting ignorance, and therapists fighting depression and despair.
You do not need numbers to enlarge the spiritual and moral horizons of humankind. You need other things altogether: a sense of the worth and dignity of the individual, of the power of human possibility to transform the world, of the importance of giving everyone the best education they can have, of making each feel part of a collective responsibility to ameliorate the human condition. Judaism asks of us the willingness to take high ideals and enact them in the real world, unswayed by disappointments and defeats.
This is still evident today, especially among the people of Israel in the State of Israel. Defamed in the media and scorned by much of the world, Israel continues to produce human miracles in medicine, agriculture, technology, and the arts, as if the word “impossible” did not exist in the Hebrew language. Israel remains a small nation, surrounded, as in biblical times, by “nations larger and stronger than you” (Devarim 7:1). Yet the truth remains, as Moshe said: “The Lord did not set His affection on you and choose you because you were more numerous than other peoples, for you are the fewest of all peoples.”
This small people has outlived all the world’s great empires to deliver to humanity a message of hope: you need not be large to be great. What you need is to be open to a power greater than yourself. It is said that King Louis XIV of France once asked Blaise Pascal, the brilliant mathematician and theologian, to give him proof of the existence of God. Pascal is said to have replied, “Your Majesty, the Jews!”
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>Jews were always a tiny people, yet our ancestors survived by believing that eternity is found in the simple lives of ordinary human beings. They found God in homes, families, and relationships. They worshipped God in synagogues, the first places ever to become holy because of the mere fact that people gathered there to pray. They discovered God in the human heart and in our capacity to make the world different by what we do. They encountered God, not in the wind or the thunder or the earthquake, but in words, the words of Torah, the marriage contract between God and the people He took as His own. They studied those words endlessly and tried to put them into practice. They brought heaven down to earth, because they believed that God lives wherever we dedicate our lives to Him.

<b>EDUCATIONAL COMPANION TO THE QUESTIONS</b>
<b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>The context of each time that strength in numbers of the Jewish people is mentioned in the Torah is a promise about the future. The patriarchs were promised that their family would grow into a large vibrant people who would fulfil the covenant with God. Moshe was also reassuring the people about the future. At these stages of Jewish history, the future was far from certain, and the people were indeed tiny in number. In fact, the Jewish people of today, despite its relative smallness compared to other nations, is “numerous like the stars” compared to early biblical times.
Rabbi Sacks gives two reasons for the small size of the Jewish population: First, the thousands of years of persecution, exile, and wandering, including and culminating in the Holocaust, and second, because Judaism has never been a proselytising religion, and has never aimed to convert non-Jews to Judaism or to bring them into the Jewish people (as opposed to the other major monotheistic religions that now comprise more than half the population of the planet). Despite this, the Jewish people are strong and vibrant, and compared to biblical times, even numerous. This means it can still be argued that God’s promise has indeed been fulfilled.
God is more interested in quality than quantity. Despite only comprising less than 0.2 per cent of the world’s population, the contribution the Jewish people have made to humanity is incalculable and certainly way beyond their numbers. The Jewish national mission as set out in the Torah is not dependent on the Jewish people being a large and powerful nation.
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br>Many scholars have suggested various theories to explain this, and these are beyond our scope here. However, it would be interesting to explore with your children/students what they think, and why it seems that this tiny people always seems to be at the centre of humanity and its achievements (and challenges), and whether they think this is part of God’s plan for the Jewish people, and the fulfilment of their national destiny (and what that may be).
No one has the answer to this. But some believe it is God’s influence. Some believe it is the by-product of a lengthy exile experience. Others believe this is a direct result of the central Jewish values of family and education in traditional Judaism.
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>As opposed to the Almighty Infinite God choosing a mighty and numerous nation to be His “chosen people” to testify to His greatness, God chose a small and insignificant people who found God and godliness in all humans, and in simple places. The message here is that all human beings can have an intimate relationship with the one true God, not just the wealthy and powerful.
This is the message of the Jewish people and Jewish history. God is not interested in numbers and power. This tiny insignificant people have outlasted all the mighty empires of the world (see <i>It Once Happened</i>). There are no hierarchies based on wealth, power, or even education, when it comes to worship of God. Every human is created in the image of God, and has inalienable value and worth, and equal right to an intimate relationship with God.
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>God taught Gidon a profound lesson that numbers do not necessarily contain power. Power and strength can come from brilliant intellect (the strategy the tiny army of three hundred employed). Furthermore, with the help and providence of God, numbers become irrelevant, both in battle and in surviving and thriving in history (Jewish history is a case in point).
While theories have been suggested, including the impact of surviving a two-thousand-year exile without stability or the opportunity to become complacent or comfortable, it is hard to consider how this tiny people always seems to be at the centre of humanity and its achievements (and challenges) without invoking God and the plan Jews have always believed they are part of. Perhaps this is in part the fulfilment of Jewish national destiny, what God wants us to achieve.
While one could imagine the Almighty Infinite God choosing a mighty and numerous nation to be His “chosen people” to testify to His greatness, God instead chose a small and insignificant people, showing how all human beings can have an intimate relationship with the one true God, not just the wealthy and powerful. This is the message of the Jewish people and Jewish history. God is not interested in numbers and power. This tiny insignificant people have outlasted all the mighty empires of the world. Every human is created in the image of God, and has inalienable value and worth, and equal right to an intimate relationship with God.

Eikev

In a Nutshell

<b><i>IN A NUTSHELL</i></b><br>In <i>Ekev</i>, Moshe continues his speech to the Israelites, preparing them for life in the land of Israel and for a future without him as their leader. He reminds them of the general rules of the covenant (the responsibilities that they have towards God and that God has towards them, as it is written in the Torah), and what it means to be a chosen nation in a promised land.
If they keep the covenant, they will be blessed, both with material things (such as wealth and financial security) as well as spiritual blessings. But they must not forget God’s loving-kindness and think that their success is because of their own efforts or because they are righteous. Moshe reminds them of all the times they made mistakes and sinned as a people during the wilderness years, including the Golden Calf, the Koraḥ rebellion, and other similar stories. He reminds them, too, of God’s forgiveness. Remembering their history, they must love and respect God and teach their children to do the same. This entire set of beliefs is summarised in what we call the second paragraph of the <i>Shema</i> (Devarim 11:13–21), which is found in the <i>parasha</i>. The clear message to the people is that Israel’s fate depends on Israel’s faith.

I; The Covenant and the Love

<big><strong>I. The Covenant and the Love</strong></big><br><b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>There is an interesting phrase found at the beginning of this <i>parasha</i>, and together with a similar phrase at the end of the previous <i>parasha</i>, they are the only places where it appears in the Torah. The phrase is <i>et habrit ve’et haḥesed</i> (Devarim 7:12): “If you pay attention to these laws and are careful to follow them, then the Lord your God will keep the <i>brit</i> and the <i>ḥesed</i> with you, as He swore to your ancestors.”
The phrase is strange. The relationship between God and Israel is defined by the <i>brit</i>, covenant. That, basically, is all the content of the Torah. What then is added by the word <i>ḥesed</i>?
A covenant is essentially mutual. Two people or two groups promise something to one another and enter into this mutual agreement, the covenant. This is how it was defined by God at Mount Sinai: “Now if you obey Me fully and keep My covenant, then out of all nations you will be My treasured possession, for all the earth is Mine” (Shemot 19:5). This means:<i> If</i> you are My people, I will be your God. <i>If</i> you serve Me, I will bless you. Every covenant has an “if-then” quality to it.
<i>Ḥesed</i>, in contrast, is not conditional. It is given out of the goodness of the giver, regardless of whether the recipient is deserving. What we learn from these words, carefully chosen, “The Lord your God will keep the <i>brit</i> and the <i>ḥesed</i> with you,” is that God acts with <i>ḥesed</i> towards us even when we do not deserve it.
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. Can you think of examples when you have done</i> ḥesed<i>? Why did you do it?</i>
<i>2. Why does God show</i> ḥesed<i> in cases where it is undeserved?</i>
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br><i>One of the possible treatments for Covid-19 that scientists are developing involves using plasma from the blood of recovered patients, as this contains the antibodies that the body uses to fight the virus. But this method depends on the willingness of recovered patients to donate their plasma.</i>
<i>In America, thousands of recovered patients are now donating their blood to plasma clinics in the hope that it can be used to treat other people struck down by the virus. Dr. Michael Joyner of the Mayo Clinic said, “By far, the largest group of plasma donors is our Orthodox friends in New York City.” In fact, they number more than half of all plasma donors. Orthodox Jews from New York are “punching way above their weight when it comes to donating,” said Dr. Shmuel Shoham from Johns Hopkins University.</i>
<i>The Jewish community of New York City has been hit particularly hard by Covid-19. Members of the community see their recovered health as a blessing that they feel a responsibility to share with others. Several grassroots initiatives have sprung up in the local community, with the word spreading via synagogues and community newsletters. “The community has taken a tragedy and turned it into a superpower,” says Dr. Shoham.</i>
<i>So many community members have volunteered, New York blood banks can no longer keep up with demand, and donors have been asked to travel for many hours to make their donations out of state. “There were probably never so many Hasidim in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania in the history of the world, and here they’re riding in literally to save lives,” said Mordy Serle, an Orthodox Jewish lawyer who travelled from Brooklyn to a bank in Pennsylvania last month to donate blood and who has helped organise donations.</i>
<i>Rabbis in the community have even given halakhic rulings allowing their followers to drive to blood banks on Shabbat to donate if these are the only available appointments, because this act is saving lives. Saving a life is an ultimate value in Judaism.</i>
<i>Avrohom Weinstock, who initiated a program through Agudath Israel to organise volunteers said, “I think that it comes from our education and the way we’re raised, the idea of kindness, or</i> ḥesed<i>, as being one of the foundations of what the world is built on and how it is sustained.”</i>
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. Why were so many Jews donating their plasma?</i>
<i>2. Why was</i> ḥesed<i> so important during the time of Covid-19?</i>
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>The phrase “<i>the brit and the ḥesed</i>” is rare in Tanakh, but it does occasionally make an appearance at key moments in Jewish history. For example, it figures in King Shlomo’s great prayer at the consecration of the Temple in Jerusalem (I Melakhim 8:23): “Lord, the God of Israel, there is no God like You in heaven above or on earth below – You who keep <i>the covenant and love</i> with Your servants who continue wholeheartedly in Your way.”
When, after the Babylonian exile, the nation gathered in Jerusalem and renewed the covenant, Ezra and Neḥemya said: “Now therefore, our God, the great God, mighty and awesome, who keeps <i>His covenant and love</i>…” (Neḥemya 9:32).
At these critical moments, when Moshe renewed the covenant on the banks of the Jordan, when Shlomo dedicated the Temple, and when the people in Ezra and Neḥemya’s time rededicated themselves, they took care to define the relationship between God and the people as one of <i>brit</i> and <i>ḥesed</i>, covenant and love. It seems that both are necessary, or they would not have used this language on these three defining occasions many centuries apart.
What is the true meaning of <i>ḥesed</i>? Significantly, Rambam dedicates the penultimate chapter of <i>The Guide for the Perplexed</i> to the analysis of three words: <i>ḥesed</i>, <i>tzedaka,</i> and <i>mishpat</i>. On <i>ḥesed</i> he says:
“In <i>Pirkei Avot</i> (5:7) we have explained the expression <i>ḥesed</i> as denoting excess. It is especially used of extraordinary kindness. Loving-kindness is practised in two ways: first, we show kindness to those who have no claim whatever upon us; secondly, we are kind to those to whom it is due, in a greater measure than is due to them…. The very act of creation is an act of God’s loving-kindness: ‘I have said, “The universe is built in loving-kindness”’ (Tehillim 89:3).”
The difference between the three terms is that I am <i>legally</i> entitled to <i>mishpat</i>. I am <i>morally</i> entitled to <i>tzedaka</i>. But to <i>ḥesed</i>, I am not entitled at all. When someone acts towards me in <i>ḥesed</i>, that is an act of pure grace. I have done nothing to deserve it. Rambam notes, citing the phrase from Tehillim, that creation was an act of pure <i>ḥesed</i>. No one ever creates something because it deserves to be created. Creations do not exist before they are created.
We can define this in human terms more precisely. The book of Rut is known as the purest example of a story of <i>ḥesed</i>. There are two key scenes in the book. The first occurs when Naomi decides to return to Israel alone. She says to her two daughters-in-law, “Go back, each of you, to your mother’s home. May the Lord show you kindness, as you have shown kindness to your dead husbands and to me.” She was telling them that they had no further obligations towards her. You owe me nothing, she is saying. You have been kind, you have been good daughters-in-law, but now we must go our separate ways. Yet Rut goes even further in love and kindness, and continues her journey with Naomi.
Then, when Rut gathers grain in the field of Boaz, he treats her with great care and consideration. She asks him: “Why have I found such recognition in your eyes that you notice me – a foreigner?” The two key words here are “recognition” and “foreigner.” “Recognition” means that you have behaved towards me as if you had obligations to me. But “I am a foreigner.” The word used here is not “stranger,” i.e., a resident alien to whom certain duties are owed. It means a complete outsider. Rut is saying to Boaz, you do not owe me anything.
<i>That is what makes Rut the supreme book of</i> ḥesed, that is, of good done to another who has no claim whatsoever upon you. What Rut does for Naomi, and what Boaz does for Rut, are not <i>mishpat</i> or <i>tzedaka</i>. They are pure <i>ḥesed</i>.
Now let us return to the question with which we began. Why did Moshe, and Shlomo, and Neḥemya define the relationship between the Jewish people and God not in terms of a single concept, covenant, but added to it a second idea, namely <i>ḥesed</i>, meaning an act of love.
Covenant is essentially reciprocal. Two people or entities pledge themselves to one another, each committing to a responsibility. Every covenant has an if-then quality to it. Therefore, every covenant is inherently vulnerable. That is what Moshe emphasised throughout Devarim. Don’t take the land or its blessings for granted. If you do well, things will go well, but if you do badly, great dangers lie in store.
That is covenant. <i>Ḥesed</i>, in contrast, has no “if-then” quality. It is given out of the goodness of the giver, regardless of the worth of the recipient. When Moshe, Shlomo, and Neḥemya referred to <i>ḥesed</i> in addition to the covenant, they were making an implicit request of God of the most fundamental significance. Even if we fail to honour the covenant, please God be gracious to us, for You are good even when we are not, and You do good even when we do not deserve it – <i>ki le’olam ḥasdo</i>, for His <i>ḥesed</i> is eternal.
The verses in our <i>parasha</i> <i>sound</i> conditional: “If you pay attention to these laws…then the Lord your God will keep the <i>brit</i> and the <i>ḥesed</i>.” This suggests that we will be shown <i>ḥesed</i> if we deserve it, but if not, not. But it isn’t so. At the end of the curses in <i>Beḥukotai</i>, God says: “Yet in spite of this, when they are in the land of their enemies,<i> I will not reject them</i> <i>or abhor them so as to destroy them completely, breaking My covenant with them</i>: I am the Lord their God.”
God will never break the covenant, even if we do, because of His <i>ḥesed</i>. Tanakh describes the relationship between God and Israel in two primary ways: like a spouse, and like a parent and a child. Between spouses there can be a divorce. Between parent and child there cannot be. They may be estranged, but the parent is still their parent and the child is still their child. Marriage is a covenant; parenthood is not. Do not forsake us, we say to God, because whatever we have done, You are our parent and we are Your children. <i>Ḥesed</i> is the kind of love a parent has for a child, whether they deserve it or not. <i>Ḥesed</i> is unconditional grace.
<b>I believe that <i>ḥesed</i> is the highest achievement of the moral life.</b> It is what Rut did for Naomi, and Boaz for Rut, and from that kindness came David, Israel’s greatest king.<b></b> Reciprocal altruism – I do this for you, and you do this for me – is universal among social animals. <i>Ḥesed</i> is not. In <i>ḥesed</i> God created the universe. <b>In <i>ḥesed</i> we create moments of moral beauty that bring joy and hope where there was darkness and despair.</b>
<b>QUESTION TO PONDER</b>
<i>Why is</i> ḥesed<i> a higher moral value than</i> mishpat<i> (law) or</i> tzedaka<i> (justice)?</i>
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>What is <i>ḥesed</i>? It is usually translated as “kindness” but it also means “love” – not love as emotion or passion, but love expressed as deed. Theologians define <i>ḥesed</i> as covenant love. Covenant is the bond by which two parties pledge themselves to one another, each respecting the freedom and integrity of the other, agreeing to join their separate destinies into a single journey that they will travel together. Unlike a contract, it is an open-ended relationship lived towards an unknown future.

<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>What do these historical moments all have in common: Moshe on the banks of the Jordan, Shlomo dedicating the Temple, and Ezra and Neḥemya at the end of the Babylonian exile?
Why is the book of Rut known as “the supreme book of <i>ḥesed</i>”?
Why do we think of our relationship with God both as a spousal relationship and a parent-child relationship?
<b>EDUCATIONAL COMPANION TO THE QUESTIONS</b>
<b><i>IN A NUTSHELL</i></b><br>One approach to this question is that this is a new generation that did not experience the stories Moshe is relating here, and this generation was not at Sinai to experience the giving of the Torah. So Moshe is making sure they have internalised the lessons and national experiences from their parents’ generation. A second approach is that this was Moshe’s chance to leave the people with the most important lessons and core values he had to impart before he died. This involved the retelling of various national narratives and important laws.
<b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>Often, we find ourselves doing acts of kindness because it feels good, or because we know it is the right thing to do. But an individual act of kindness is not performed because of an obligation. It is beyond the obligation of the citizen to do this (for if this were not the case, then the law would require it). Acts of <i>ḥesed</i> go beyond obligations, even if they can be considered “the right thing to do.”
God acts in kindness because He is the God of Love. He acts with <i>ḥesed</i> towards us because He does not limit His relationship with us to just a covenant – what He is obligated to do. The God of Love goes beyond His obligation to us and performs acts of loving-kindness, and we should imitate this model.
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br>Reasons found in the story include a sense of gratitude for their own health, and a sense of responsibility to help other people recover theirs; because the value of life is a core value in Judaism; and finally because a Jewish education leaves you with a clear sense that the value of <i>ḥesed</i>/loving-kindness is central to the world’s existence.
The world went through a painfully difficult time, leaving so many vulnerable, whether economically, emotionally, or physically. The institutions that normally work hard to care for people in these situations were stretched to the breaking point. Individual acts of kindness and <i>ḥesed</i> became even more critical during this period than ever before.
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br><i>Mishpat</i> and <i>tzedaka</i> are legislated, both in Torah law, and in civil law in the country in which you live. But <i>ḥesed</i> goes beyond that. Individual citizens are not obligated to perform such acts. A society built on private acts of loving-kindness is the highest of moral societies, one that the Torah encourages, but cannot obligate.
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>These were all watershed moments in Jewish history when the nation renewed its relationship with God and re-committed to the covenant of the Torah and the values contained therein. This is why the language of <i>brit veḥesed</i> was important at these times, because it summed up God’s relationship with the Jewish nation.
The narrative in the book of Rut revolves around two great moments of <i>ḥesed</i>. The first is when Rut commits to following Naomi – she had every right and reason to return to Moav, but instead stands by Naomi. The second is when Boaz shows kindness to Rut, despite her status as a foreigner in the land. He has no legal obligation to her, yet he goes beyond his obligations and shows her <i>ḥesed</i>.
A marriage is a contractual relationship where both parties commit to care for and love each other. This represents the Torah as covenant, whereby God and the Jewish people have entered into a relationship that is conditional on the behaviour of the other, and is enforceable in law. This contractual relationship can be terminated (through divorce). However, a relationship between a parent and child is an intimate and private relationship based not on a covenant or contract, but on love. This relationship cannot be terminated. God tells us that while there can be exile and punishment if the covenant is broken, there will always be a path back, because He will always love His people.

II; The Politics of Memory

<big><strong>II. The Politics of Memory</strong></big><br><b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>In this <i>parasha</i> Moshe continues to speak to the people, setting out an ideology that holds such wisdom that it will remain relevant for all of their lives and for every generation that follows. He does it by presenting the contrast between the ideal to which Israel is called, and the danger with which it is faced. This is the ideal:
<i>“Observe the commands of the Lord your God, walking in His ways and revering Him. For the Lord your God is bringing you into a good land – a land with streams and pools of water, with springs flowing in the valleys and hills; a land with wheat and barley, vines and fig trees, pomegranates, olive oil, and honey; a land where bread will not be scarce and you will lack nothing; a land where the rocks are iron and you can dig copper out of the hills. When you have eaten and are satisfied, bless the Lord your God for the good land He has given you”</i> (Devarim 8:7–10).
And this is the danger:
<i>“Be careful that you do not forget the Lord your God, failing to observe His commands, His laws, and His decrees that I am giving you this day. Otherwise, when you eat and are satisfied, when you build fine houses and settle down, and when your herds and flocks grow large and your silver and gold increase and all you have is multiplied, then your heart will become proud and you will forget the Lord your God who brought you out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery…. You may say to yourself, ‘My power and the strength of my hands have produced this wealth for me.’ But remember the Lord your God, for it is He who gives you the ability to produce wealth, and so confirms His covenant, which He swore to your forefathers, as it is today”</i> (Devarim 8:11–18).
The two passages follow directly on from one another. They are linked by the phrase “when you have eaten and are satisfied,” and the contrast between them is the appearance of the opposite verbs “to remember” and “to forget.”
Good things, Moshe tells the people, will happen to you. Everything, however, will depend on how you respond. Either you will eat and be satisfied and bless God, remembering that all things come from Him – or you will eat and be satisfied and forget to whom you owe all this. You will think it comes entirely from your own efforts: “My power and the strength of my hands have produced this wealth for me.” Although this may seem a small difference, it will, says Moshe, make <i>all</i> the difference. On this alone will turn your future as a nation in its own land.
Moshe’s argument is brilliant and counterintuitive. You may think, he says, that the hard times are behind you. You have wandered for forty years without a home. There were times when you had no water, no food. You were exposed to the elements. You were attacked by your enemies. You may think this was the test of your strength. It was not. <i>The real challenge is not poverty but affluence, not slavery but freedom, not homelessness but home</i>.

<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br><i>There once was a man who fell off the side of a ship into the ocean. The crew of the ship immediately went into action mode, and worked to rescue him. First they threw him a life-saver. But the man shouted up at them, “Don’t worry. I believe that God will save me,” and he didn’t take it. So they sent a lifeboat to pick him up, but he refused to climb up onto the boat, declaring instead, “Don’t worry. I believe that God will save me.” Finally, they called for a helicopter to come and rescue him, but even as he struggled to tread water, he refused to reach for the helping hand, and climb onto the ladder dangling from the helicopter.</i>
<i>“Don’t worry,” he called, “I believe that God will save me.” Eventually, the man drowned. When he arrived in heaven, he was angry with God, and confronted Him. “I had total faith in You that You would rescue me, but You abandoned me!” he cried to God.</i>
<i>God gently replied, “My son, I sent you a life-saver, and then a lifeboat, and then a helicopter. But you refused to see My hand in them.”</i>
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. What do you think is the message of this story?</i>
<i>2. How is this connected to</i> The Core Idea<i>?</i>
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>Many nations have been lifted to great heights when they faced difficulty and danger. They fought hard battles and survived. They came through crises – droughts, plagues, recessions, defeats – and were toughened by them. When times are hard, people grow. They bury their differences. There is a sense of community and solidarity, of neighbours and strangers pulling together. Countless people who have lived through a war know this.
The real test of a nation is not if it can survive a crisis but if it can survive the lack of a crisis. Can it stay strong during times of ease and plenty, power and prestige? That is the challenge that has defeated every civilisation known to history. Let it not, says Moshe, defeat you.
Moshe’s foresight was little less than stunning. The pages of history are littered with the relics of nations that seemed invincible in their day, but which eventually declined and lapsed into oblivion – and always for the reason Moshe predicted. They forgot. Memories fade. People lose sight of the values they once fought for – justice, equality, independence, freedom. The nation, its early battles over, becomes strong. Some of its members grow rich. They become lax, self-indulgent, over-sophisticated, decadent. They lose their sense of social solidarity. They no longer feel it their duty to care for the poor, the weak, the marginal, the losers. They begin to feel that such wealth and position as they have is theirs by right. The bonds of fraternity and collective responsibility begin to fray. The less wealthy feel an acute sense of injustice. The scene is set for either revolution or conquest. Societies succumb to external pressures when they have long been weakened by internal decay. That was the danger Moshe foresaw and about which he warned the generation about to enter the land of Israel.
Moshe, however, did more than prophesy and warn. He also taught how the danger could be avoided, and here too his insight is as relevant now as it was then. He spoke of the vital significance of memory for the moral health of a society. Throughout history there have been many attempts to ground ethics in universal attributes of humanity. Some, like Immanuel Kant, based it on reason. Others based it on duty. Bentham rooted it in consequences (“the greatest happiness for the greatest number”). David Hume attributed it to certain basic emotions: sympathy, empathy, compassion. Adam Smith predicated it on the capacity to stand back from situations and judge them with detachment (“the impartial spectator”). Each of these has its virtues, but none has proved fail-safe.
Judaism took and takes a different view. The guardian of conscience is memory. Time and again the verb <i>zakhor</i>, “remember,” resonates through Moshe’s speeches in Devarim:
“Remember that you were slaves in Egypt…therefore the Lord your God has commanded you to observe the Shabbat day” (5:15).
“Remember how the Lord your God led you all the way in the desert these forty years” (8:2).
“Remember this and never forget how you provoked the Lord your God to anger in the desert” (9:7).
“Remember what the Amalekites did to you along the way when you came out of Egypt” (25:17).
“Remember the days of old; consider the years of ages past” (32:7).
As Yosef Hayim Yerushalmi notes in his great treatise, <i>Zachor: Jewish History and Jewish Memory</i>, “Only in Israel and nowhere else is the injunction to remember felt as a religious imperative to an entire people.” Civilisations begin to die when they forget. Israel was commanded never to forget.
In an eloquent passage, the American scholar Jacob Neusner once wrote:
Civilisation hangs suspended, from generation to generation, by the gossamer strand of memory. If only one cohort of mothers and fathers fails to convey to its children what it has learned from its parents, then the great chain of learning and wisdom snaps. If the guardians of human knowledge stumble only one time, in their fall collapses the whole edifice of knowledge and understanding.
The politics of free societies depends on the handing on of memory. That was Moshe’s insight, and it speaks to us with undiminished power today.
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>Biblical Hebrew has no word for history. Modern Hebrew had to borrow a word: <i>historya</i>. The key word of the Hebrew Bible is not history but memory. <i>Zakhor</i>, the command to remember, occurs time and again in the Torah…. There is a profound difference between history and memory. History is <i>his story</i> – an event that happened sometime else to someone else. Memory is <i>my</i> story – something that happened to me and is part of who I am. History is information. Memory, by contrast, is part of identity. I can study the history of other peoples, cultures, and civilisations. They deepen my knowledge and broaden my horizons. But they do not make a claim on me. They are the past as past.
Memory is the past as present, as it lives on in me. Without memory there can be no identity. Alzheimer’s disease, the progressive atrophying of memory function, is also the disintegration of personality. As with individuals, so with a nation: it has a continuing identity to the extent that it can remember where it came from and who its ancestors were.
<b><i>The Jonathan Sacks Haggada,</i> 38–39</b>
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. What is the difference between history and memory? Why does Judaism only have a word for memory?</i>
<i>2. How does Judaism ensure that our national memory is passed from each generation to the next?</i>
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>Why do you think some people only look to connect to God when they face challenges in life?
Should we only rely totally on God (like the man in <i>It Once Happened</i>) and have complete faith?
Why do you think the Jewish people have not suffered the same fate as other civilisations (such as Ancient Greece and Renaissance Italy), which have disappeared from the pages of history?
<b>EDUCATIONAL COMPANION TO THE QUESTIONS</b>
<b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>The ideal is that you will always recognise that your blessings come from God and thank Him for them. While you must also play a part in achieving success in anything, and although you should feel proud of your progress, effort, and successes, the danger is that you will forget to see God as the source of your blessings. This may be because God’s role may be hidden, leaving only your own effort perceptible, and in Israel the land is good and you will prosper in it, and this will tempt you to forget God’s role in your success.
When we work hard to achieve things in life, it is unfair to give someone else, even God, all of the credit. However, it is also problematic to ignore the gifts and opportunities that God has provided in order to allow us to work hard and to achieve. A healthy approach is to see a balance in everything we do: allow ourselves to take some credit and make sure to credit God with His role as well, and of course show gratitude for that.
Faith is always a challenge. During the bad times it is hard to understand God’s plan for us and maintain our faith in Him (although sometimes the challenges during these times can bring us closer to Him because of our need for comfort and hope during difficult times). During good times it is often all too easy to forget to acknowledge God’s role, and mistakenly credit ourselves or other factors for the good times. Our challenge is to find God in both bad times and good.
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br>The message here is to always look for the hand of God in our lives. Sometimes, even when it could seem obvious, we can miss the hand of God, so we must strive to look for it. God does not just play a role in our lives through miracles and supernatural phenomena. He can also direct and influence our lives through natural means and through our interactions with other people and the influence they have on our lives. Sometimes the signs are subtle, and it is our challenge to see them.
Moshe warns the Israelites that when they enter the land they will prosper because it is a good land. But this will mean they run the very real risk of forgetting to see God’s hand in their prosperity. They will forget God’s role and think it was only their own hard work and ingenuity that led to their success and achievements. Their challenge is to see the hand of God in all that they achieve.
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>History is the story that does not belong to us. It may be interesting and valuable to learn from, but it is not part of our own identity. Memory is our own story and our own identity. It is personal, and is the basis for who we are, and the collective identity we transfer to the next generation. Judaism is concerned with this transmission and therefore places great significance on ritual and education in order to ensure the next generation receives the national memory, and with it, our collective identity.
It does this through much of its ritual, which is based around an active process of memory (such as the Pesaḥ Seder night ritual). These rituals aim to personalise the national memories of the people through the re-experiencing and re-enacting of events that took place thousands of years ago. Together with the core Jewish value of education, the heritage and national identity of the Jewish people is transmitted from generation to generation.
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>In good times, it is too easy to forget God and the role He plays in our lives. It feels like we prosper because of our own efforts or “luck.” But when times are bad, while some find this a challenge to their faith, many others will turn to God for comfort and hope. Our challenge is to turn to God in gratitude when times are good as well as to prayer in bad times.
While it is important to have faith in God and show gratitude for the role He plays in our life, Judaism does not believe in total dependence, relying solely on God. We must partner with God and do our share to achieve the things we want in life.
From the ideas contained in this <i>Covenant &amp; Conversation</i> essay, there can be two possible approaches to this question. Firstly, this could be because the Jewish people have never really had a period of quiet tranquility when they have been left to “forget God” and mistakenly credit their success to themselves only. They therefore avoided the risk that this would have led to arrogance and moral decay, which proved to be the downfall of so many nations throughout history. Even in a post-Holocaust world where a Jewish state exists, antisemitism still exists across the world (and only seems to be increasing in our generation), and the State of Israel itself is still fighting an existential war for its own survival. Alternatively, it can be argued that Judaism has been deeply effective at maintaining its own continuity through a cultural and religious focus on education and the transmission of national values and identity.

Re'eh

In a Nutshell

<b><i>IN A NUTSHELL</i></b><br>In <i>Parashat Re’eh</i>, Moshe focuses on specific details of the covenant. He begins with presenting the choice that lies before the Jews: blessings and rewards if they keep God’s laws, and curses and punishments if they do not. Once they finally enter the land of Israel, these will also be read out to the nation in a ceremony on two mountains in the Shomron – Mount Gerizim and Mount Eival.
Moshe continues by commanding the people to destroy all signs of idolatry in the land when they enter, such as temples and altars, and then establish a central site, which God will choose, where they will worship, offer sacrifices, and eat holy food. This will later be the site of the <i>Beit HaMikdash</i> (the Temple).
Next, Moshe gives more warnings about idolatry and false prophets, and teaches about clean and unclean animals, tithes, and the Sabbatical year (when debts are to be cancelled and slaves set free). The <i>parasha</i> ends with the laws of the three foot festivals (Pesaḥ, Shavuot, and Sukkot) when every year the nation is to celebrate, in Jerusalem, together.
<b>QUESTION TO PONDER</b>
<i>When do you find yourself facing the choice between getting a reward or a punishment? Do you always make the right choice?</i>

I; The Good Society

<big><strong>I. The Good Society</strong></big><br><b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>Having set out the prologue and preamble to the covenant and its general guiding principles, Moshe turns to the details, which will form most of the book of Devarim, from chapter 12 to chapter 26. But before he begins with the specifics, he states a proposal that is the most fundamental one in the book, and one that will be repeated over and over by Israel’s prophets:
“See, this day I set before you blessing and curse: blessing, if you obey the commandments of the Lord your God that I command you this day; and curse, if you do not obey the commandments of the Lord your God, but turn away from the path that I command you this day and follow other gods, whom you have not experienced” (Devarim 11:26–28).
Simply put, if you behave well, things will go well. If you act badly, things will turn out badly. Behaving well means honouring our covenant with God, being faithful to Him, listening to His words, and following His commands. That was the foundation of the nation. Uniquely, it had God as its liberator and lawgiver, its sovereign, judge, and defender. Other nations had their gods, but none had a covenant with any of them, let alone with the Creator of heaven and earth.
There are things Israel must do in order to survive. Therefore, warns Moshe, beware of any temptation to act like the nations around you, copying their gods, their worship, or their practices. Their way is not yours. If you behave like them, you will perish like them. To survive and thrive, stay true to your faith, history and destiny, your mission, calling, and task as “a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.”
<i>As you act, so shall you fare</i>. A free society is a moral achievement. A society is strong when it cares for the weak, rich when it cares for the poor, and invulnerable when it takes care of the vulnerable. Historically, the only ultimate guarantor of this is a belief in Someone greater than this time and place, greater than all time and place, who guides us in the path of righteousness, seeing all we do, urging us to see the world as His work, and humans as His image, and therefore to care for both. <i>Bein adam leMakom</i> and <i>bein adam leḥavero</i> – the duties we have to God and those we owe our fellow humans – are inseparable. Without a belief in God we would pursue our own interests, and eventually those at the social margins, with little power and less wealth, would lose. That is not the kind of society Jews are supposed to build.
The good society does not just happen. Nor is it created by the market (how we spend our money) or the state (the government). It is made from the moral choices of each of us. That is the basic message of Devarim: Will we choose the blessing or the curse? As Moshe says at the end of the book: “This day I call the heavens and the earth as witnesses that I have set before you life and death, blessings and curses. Now choose life, so that you and your children may live” (30:15, 19).
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. If it is a choice, why would anyone ever “choose” the curse and punishment option?</i>
<i>2. Isn’t true freedom the ability to act entirely for your own sake, without worrying about other people?</i>
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br><i>A positive aspect of the Coronavirus pandemic has been the increase in volunteering and acts of kindness from strangers. In Israel, this was most clearly demonstrated by the many volunteers of the National Civil Service, young people aged 18</i>–<i>20 from all sectors of Israeli society – Jews, Arabs, Druze, religious and secular – who were exempted from the army but chose to devote one or two years of their lives to contribute to the country instead. These volunteers have made a decisive contribution to Israel’s civilian resilience in the face of the virus and risked their own health to help out in hospitals and with Magen David Adom. They have cared for the elderly and served as an additional and essential force in the fields of health and welfare. There were also those volunteers originally assigned to educational institutions who were sent home because schools were closed during the lockdown period, who chose to volunteer instead in essential areas where extra help was needed.</i>
<i>This group of people is just one example of the spirit of volunteerism in Israeli society, especially during these trying times. Other age groups such as teenagers and retired people have also given of their time and energy to look after the most vulnerable in society. This is a very positive sign of the moral health of Israeli society, proving the values of</i> ḥesed<i> and volunteerism are important national values.</i>
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. Which is a better indicator of the morality of a society, the spirit of volunteerism or government decision making?</i>
<i>2. Would you describe your society as a moral one?</i>
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br><i>The test of a society is not military, political, economic, or demographic. It is moral and spiritual.</i> That is what is revolutionary about the biblical message. But is this really so? Did not ancient Egypt have the concept of <i>maat</i>, order, balance, harmony with the universe, social stability, justice, and truth? Did not the Greeks and Romans, Aristotle especially, give a central place to virtue? Did not the Stoics create an influential moral system, set out in the writings of Seneca and Marcus Aurelius? What is different about the Torah’s message?
Those ancient systems were essentially ways of worshipping the state, which was given cosmic significance in Pharaonic Egypt and heroic significance in Greece and Rome. In Judaism we do not serve the state; we serve God alone. The unique ethic of the covenant, whose key text is the book of Devarim, places on each of us an immense dual responsibility, both individual and collective.
I am responsible for what I do. But I am also responsible for what you do. That is one meaning of the command in <i>Kedoshim</i>: “You shall surely remonstrate with your neighbour and not bear sin because of them.” As Rambam wrote in his <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>, “It is not right for any of us to say, ‘I will not sin, and if someone else sins, that is a matter between them and their God.’ This is the opposite of the Torah.” In other words, it is not the state, the government, the army, or the police that is the primary guardian of the law, though these may be necessary (as indicated at the beginning of the next <i>parasha</i>: “You shall appoint magistrates and officials for your tribes”). It is each of us as well as all of us together. That is what makes the ethic of the covenant unique.
We see this in a phrase that is central to American politics and does not exist at all in British politics: “We, the people.” These are the opening words of the preamble to the American constitution. Britain is not ruled by “We, the people.” It is ruled by His Majesty the King, whose loyal subjects we are. The difference is that Britain is not a covenant society whereas America is: its earliest key texts, the Mayflower Compact of 1620 and John Winthrop’s address on board the <i>Arbella</i> in 1630, were both covenants, built on the Devarim model. Covenant means we cannot delegate moral responsibility away to either the market or the state. We – each of us, separately and together – make or break society.
Stoicism is an ethic of endurance, and it has some kinship with Judaism’s wisdom literature. Aristotle’s ethic is about virtue, and much of what he has to say is of permanent value. Rambam had enormous respect for it. But embedded in his outlook was a hierarchical mindset. His portrait of the “great-souled man” is of a person of aristocratic bearing, independent wealth, and high social status. Aristotle would not have understood Abraham Lincoln’s statement about a new nation, “dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.”
The Greeks were fascinated by structures. Virtually all the terms we use today – democracy, aristocracy, oligarchy, tyranny – are Greek in origin. The message of the book of Devarim is: Yes, create structures – courts, judges, officers, priests, kings – but what really matters is how each of you behaves. Are you faithful to our collective mission in such a way that “all the peoples on earth will see that you are called by the name of the Lord, and they will be in awe of you” (Devarim 28:10)? A free society is made less by structures than by personal responsibility for the moral-spiritual order.
This was once fully understood by the key figures associated with the emergence (in their different ways) of the free societies of England and America. In England, Locke distinguished between liberty, the freedom to do what you may, and licence, the freedom to do what you want. Alexis de Tocqueville, in <i>Democracy in America</i>, wrote that “liberty cannot be established without morality, nor morality without faith.” In his <i>Farewell Address</i>, George Washington wrote, “Of all the dispositions and habits which lead to political prosperity, religion and morality are indispensable supports.”
Why so? What is the connection between morality and freedom? The answer was given by Edmund Burke:
“Men are qualified for civil liberty in exact proportion to their disposition to put moral chains upon their own appetites…. Society cannot exist unless a controlling power upon will and appetite be placed somewhere; and the less of it there is within, the more there must be without. It is ordained in the eternal constitution of things that men of intemperate minds cannot be free. Their passions forge their fetters.”
In other words, the less law enforcement depends on surveillance or the police, and the more on internalised habits of law abidingness, the freer the society. That is why Moshe, and later Ezra, and later still the Rabbis, put so much emphasis on learning the law so that it became natural to keep the law.
It is sad to realise that this entire constellation of beliefs – the biblical foundations of a free society – has been almost completely lost to the liberal democracies of the West. Today it is assumed that morality is a private affair. It has nothing to do with the fate of the nation. Even the concept of a nation has become questionable in a global age. National cultures are now multi-cultures. Elites no longer belong “somewhere”; they are at home “anywhere.” A nation’s strength is now measured by the size and growth of its economy. The West has reverted to the Hellenistic idea that freedom has to do with structures – nowadays, democratically elected governments – rather than the internalised morality of “We, the people.”
<b>I believe Moshe was right when he taught us otherwise: that the great choice is between the blessing and the curse, between following the voice of God or the seductive call of instinct and desire. Freedom is sustained only when a nation becomes a moral community. And any moral community achieves a greatness far beyond its numbers, as we lift others and they lift us.</b>
<b>QUESTION TO PONDER</b>
<i>How is “following the voice of God” the opposite of following “instinct and desire”?</i>
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>A free society is a moral achievement, and it is made by us and our habits of thought, speech, and deed. Morality cannot be outsourced because it depends on each of us. Without self-restraint, without the capacity to defer the gratification of instinct, and without the habits of heart and deed that we call virtues, we will eventually lose our freedom.
<b><i>Morality</i>, 16–17</b>
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>What is the blessing and what is the curse referred to in the <i>parasha</i>?
Why do the market and the state not create a good society? What can do this?
How do you think the strength of a society can be measured?
<b>EDUCATIONAL COMPANION TO THE QUESTIONS</b>
<b><i>IN A NUTSHELL</i></b><br>Every child encounters this choice regularly, often at home and at school. Their choices are often couched in these terms, as adults use a system of reward and punishment as motivation for action and correct behaviour. This question tries to help the child relate to the mechanism described in the Torah by drawing a parallel between the reward and punishment they experience in their lives.
<b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>Sometimes it is tempting to choose the curse/punishment option. There are choices that provide immediate satisfaction and enjoyment, but in the longer term these often result in undesirable outcomes (the curse/punishment referred to in the <i>parasha</i>). But it is often hard for humans to see the long-term implications of such behaviour and choices, and to understand the implications of today’s behaviour. Humans often make wrong choices, especially when we only think of the short-term result and not the long-term consequences.
This absolute freedom results in anarchy where the weak in society are unprotected and therefore lose their freedom. For a society to be based on true freedom, the rights of everyone must be somewhat limited by law, which has to protect its weak members. This prevents a lawless society where in the end anarchy will reign and only the very powerful will have liberty.
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br>While the government legislates laws to protect the weak in society, a truer indicator of a society’s morality is in the voluntary sector, where citizens on their own initiative act morally and organise groups that can care for the its vulnerable members.
There are moral people and programmes of volunteering in every society. But obviously these are more common and more developed in some societies than in others. A moral state that sees this as an important value will encourage and find ways to support these grassroot initiatives.
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>God asks us to delay our personal instant and selfish gratification in order to act and live with the good of society in mind rather than our own individual needs and concerns. Animals, which do not have the freedom of choice granted to humankind by God, act on their “instincts and desires.” God asks us to be better than the animal world, to strive to be higher spiritual beings, by putting aside our instinctual drives and living a life of higher moral and spiritual values.
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>The blessing referred to in the Torah is the good life that will ensue if we follow the word of God. This will be both a material and a spiritual reward, but also a blessed life, because a life based on Torah values and practice is a blessed one. Conversely, one who chooses the curse will not receive these rewards, and will live an empty life devoid of meaning and value.
Rabbi Sacks has written on this topic at length in several of his books, most recently in <i>Morality</i>. The market and the state are about competition, with winners and losers. The market is amoral, concerned not with morality but economic forces. The state can only go so far in enforcing morality on society. Only the moral choices of the individuals who constitute society can create a good society.
The strength of a society is not its military or political power, or its economic health or demographic strength. Rather, the strength of a society is its moral and spiritual dimension. A society is only as strong as its most weak and vulnerable, and how much they are cared for is an indicator of its strength. Only moral and spiritual acts and values motivate this.

II; Collective Joy

<big><strong>II. Collective Joy</strong></big><br><b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>If we were to ask which key words Moshe repeats over and over in his farewell speeches about the future society of Israel, we may hear answers such as justice, compassion, reverence, respect, holiness, responsibility, dignity, and loyalty. It is unlikely that we would hear anybody suggest <i>simḥa</i>, joy. This is a word that appears only once in each of the other books of the Torah but it appears twelve times in Devarim, seven of these times in this very <i>parasha</i> of <i>Re’eh</i>.
It may be a surprise that <i>simḥa</i> is so often mentioned here. The story of the Israelites so far has not been a joyous one. It has been marked by suffering on the one hand, rebellion and disagreement on the other. Yet Moshe makes it extremely clear that joy is what the life of faith in the land of promise is about. Here are the seven times in this <i>parasha</i> where he uses the word joy:
<i>1. “In the presence of the Lord your God [in the</i> Mishkan<i>] you and your families shall eat and rejoice in everything you have put your hand to, because the Lord your God has blessed you” (12:7).</i>
<i>2. “And there [in the</i> Beit HaMikdash <i>in Jerusalem] you shall rejoice before the Lord your God, you, your sons and daughters, your menservants and maidservants, and the Levites from your towns” (12:12).</i>
<i>3. “You are to eat [holy food] in the presence of the Lord your God at the place the Lord your God will choose [in Jerusalem] – you, your sons and daughters, your menservants and maidservants, and the Levites from your towns – and you are to rejoice before the Lord your God in everything you put your hand to” (12:18).</i>
<i>4. “Use the silver to buy whatever you like: cattle, sheep, wine, or other fermented drink, or anything you wish. Then you and your household shall eat there in the presence of the Lord your God and rejoice” (14:26).</i>
<i>5. “And rejoice before the Lord your God [on Shavuot] at the place He will choose as a dwelling for His name – you, your sons and daughters, your menservants and maidservants, the Levites in your towns, and the strangers, the fatherless, and the widows living among you” (16:11).</i>
<i>6. “Be joyful at your feast [on Sukkot] – you, your sons and daughters, your menservants and maidservants, and the Levites, the strangers, the fatherless, and the widows who live in your towns” (16:14).</i>
<i>7. “For seven days [of Sukkot] celebrate the feast to the Lord your God at the place the Lord your God will bless you in all your harvest and in all the work of your hands, and your joy will be complete [</i>vehayita akh same’aḥ<i>]” (16:15).</i>
<i>Simḥa</i> is usually translated as joy, rejoicing, gladness, happiness, pleasure, or delight. In fact, <i>simḥa</i> has a subtle meaning that is untranslatable into English. Joy, happiness, pleasure, and the like are all states of mind, emotions. They belong to the individual. We can feel them alone. <i>Simḥa</i>, by contrast, is not a private emotion. It means happiness shared. It is a social state, experienced as a “We,” not as an “I.” There is no such thing as feeling <i>simḥa</i> alone.
Each time the word <i>simḥa</i> is used in <i>Parashat Re’eh</i> it refers to a communal group experience of joy. The message Moshe is giving here is that the nation will come together naturally through crisis, catastrophe, or impending war, but the challenge, and the ideal, is for unity to also happen in good times, through collective celebration in the presence of God.

<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br><i>Today was going to be a good day. Natan could feel it in his bones. His bar mitzva was a week away, the sun was shining, and in the match ahead, he was starting in his favourite position, on the right wing. As he pulled on his red team shirt with the number 14 on the back, just like his favourite player, he felt sure of it. Today was going to be a good day!</i>
<i>So when he picked up the ball on the half-way line and stormed into the opponents’ half, he just knew he was going to score. It seemed as if the ball was magnetised to his feet as he weaved left and right, leaving a trail of bemused defenders in his wake. Teammates were calling his name, desperate for him to pass to them, but Natan only had eyes for the goal. Finally, through on goal, facing a one-on-one with the goalkeeper, he dropped his shoulder and feigned to shoot right, and then with a power that surprised even him, he shot a screamer into the top left corner of the goal. Gooooalll! A goal that was worthy of his idol deserved his famous celebration, and Natan performed a perfect somersault in the air.</i>
<i>He looked around waiting for his teammates to join him in celebrating his wonder goal, but they just walked away. As the final whistle blew shortly afterwards, he ran over to his best friend, Gilad. “Why did you guys just walk away from me when I scored? What’s your problem?” he said trying to hide the hurt in his voice. Gilad replied, “We lost 3-1, or didn’t you notice?!”</i>
<i>Only one week later did he really understand the lesson to be learned. As Gilad and the rest of their friends lifted him up on a chair, dancing and singing in joy and celebration, he realised that true joy is the</i> simḥa<i> that we share together. That day on the football pitch, only he had felt joy, while his teammates were despondent about their loss. Today, on his bar mitzva day, everyone was a winner!</i>
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. What was the difference between the joy Natan experienced after scoring and the happiness felt at his bar mitzva celebration?</i>
<i>2. Do you think Natan would have experienced more joy if he hadn’t scored but the team had won?</i>
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>While joy, happiness, and pleasure, are all emotions experienced by the individual, <i>simḥa</i> is not a private emotion. It is a social state, a happiness shared. Moshe repeatedly belabours the point. When you rejoice, he says time and again, it must be “you, your sons and daughters, your menservants and maidservants, and the Levites, the strangers, the fatherless, and the widows in your towns.” A key theme of <i>Parashat Re’eh</i> is the idea of a central <i>Mishkan</i>, a Sanctuary “in the place the Lord your God will choose.” As we know from later Jewish history, during the reign of King David this place was Jerusalem, where David’s son Shlomo eventually built the Temple.
What Moshe is articulating for the first time is the idea of <i>simḥa</i> as communal, social, and national rejoicing. The nation was to be brought together not just by crisis, catastrophe, or impending war, but by collective celebration in the presence of God. The celebration itself was to be deeply moral. Not only was this a religious act of thanksgiving; it was also to be a form of social inclusion. No one was to be left out: not the stranger, or the servant, or the lonely (the orphan and widow). In a remarkable passage in the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, Rambam makes this point in the strongest possible terms:
“And while one eats and drinks, it is their duty to feed the stranger, the orphan, the widow, and other poor and unfortunate people, for those who lock the doors to their courtyard, eating and drinking with their family, without giving anything to eat and drink to the poor and the bitter in soul – their meal is not a rejoicing in a divine commandment, but a rejoicing in their own stomach.”
Moshe’s insight remains valid today. The West is more affluent than any previous society has ever been. Our life expectancy is longer, our standards of living higher, and our choices wider than at any time since Homo sapiens first walked on earth. Yet Western societies are not measurably happier. The most telling measures of unhappiness – drug and alcohol abuse, depressive illnesses, stress-related syndromes, eating disorders, and the rest – have risen by between 300 and 1,000 per cent in the space of two generations. Why so?
A man once wrote to the Lubavitcher Rebbe: “I am depressed. I am lonely. I feel that life is meaningless. I try to pray, but the words do not come. I keep mitzvot but find no peace of mind. I need the Rebbe’s help.” The Rebbe sent a brilliant reply without writing a single word. He simply circled the first word of every sentence and sent the letter back. The word in each case was “I.”
Our natural tendency is to always think in the first-person singular: I want, I need, I must have. There are many things we can achieve in the first-person singular but we cannot have <i>simḥa</i> alone – because <i>simḥa</i> is the joy we share, the joy we have only because we share. That, said Moshe before the Israelites entered their land, would be their greatest challenge. Suffering, persecution, and a common enemy unite a people and turn it into a nation. But freedom, affluence, and security reduce a nation into a collection of individuals, each pursuing his or her own happiness, often indifferent to the fate of those who have less, the lonely, the marginal, and the excluded. When that happens, societies start to disintegrate. At the height of their good fortune, the long slow process of decline begins.
The best way, said Moshe, is to share your happiness with others, and, in the midst of that collective, national celebration, serve God. Blessings are not measured by how much we own or earn or spend, but by how much we share. <i>Simḥa</i> is the mark of a sacred society. It is a place of collective joy.
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>The ethical life is a form of celebration. Doing good is not painful, a matter of dour duty and a chastising conscience. The key term here is <i>simḥa</i>, usually translated as “joy.” What it really means is the happiness we share, or better still, the happiness we make by sharing.
One of the great statements of individual dignity and responsibility, Judaism is also an intensely communal faith, not simply a matter of the lonely soul in search of God.... It is about sharing what we have, seeing possessions less as things we own than things we hold in trust, one of the conditions of which is that we use part of what we have to help others. That is not self-sacrifice.
If there is one thing I have heard more often than any other from those who spend part of their time in service to others, it is that they gain more than they give. They do not want to be thanked; they want to thank. Lifting others, they find that they themselves have been lifted.

<b>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</b>
1. Why do you think Jerusalem and the Temple (or Sanctuary) features in each of the seven mitzvot that require joy in this<i> parasha</i>?
2. Why is it harder to achieve unity and shared joy in affluent, secure times rather than in difficult, challenging times?
3. Is there currently unity and shared joy in the society where you live? What do you think can be done to increase this?
<b>EDUCATIONAL COMPANION TO THE QUESTIONS</b>
<b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>Each mention of <i>simḥa</i> speaks of a mitzva that involves celebration and joy, and that is accomplished in a group, be it as a family, a community, or as the nation as a whole.
Examples could include any shared joy, such as a family or community event, or even with a group of friends.
True joy can only happen when it is shared. Unity too often comes from challenging times. When life is good people tend to become overly focused on themselves. The challenge is to have unity and a strong society that is concerned for all members, even in times of success and security.
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br>The joy Natan experienced after scoring was a personal joy that was not shared by his teammates, because the team did not win that day. In fact, they had not even played a part in Natan’s goal. But the joy felt at his bar mitzva celebration was when all his friends and family came together as a group and experienced shared joy, like the shared <i>simḥa</i> described in the <i>parasha</i>.
The joy of an individual scoring is limited and not as powerful as the joy of a team working together to victory. Natan eventually realised that he would have experienced more joy (even if he hadn’t scored) had he played as a team member and been able to celebrate a well-played game with his teammates. The team is always greater than the player.
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>In this quote, Rabbi Sacks defines <i>simḥa</i> as “the happiness we make by sharing” rather than “shared happiness.” This means that true joy is experienced not just in a shared environment, but by the act of sharing and giving.
The message is that <i>simḥa</i> is joy that is shared in community. The mitzvot that appear in the <i>parasha</i> and are connected to joy ensure shared joy by forcing the people to appear together in Jerusalem in celebratory worship of God. This strengthens the unity and togetherness of society, in the same way that sharing and giving are integral values of a healthy society. Both definitions of <i>simḥa</i> achieve the same goals.
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>Jerusalem and the Temple (and before that, the <i>Mishkan</i>) were the central focus of the entire nation (in much the same way that in a modern country, the capital and the buildings of state are the central focus). They are where the entire nation came in unity to worship God. This is critical to achieve the shared national joy that these mitzvot require.
In times of affluence and security, individuals find themselves focusing on their own lives only (and perhaps forgetting the role of God in their affluence and security and ignoring the importance of communal unity and the sharing and giving that is necessary to achieve this). When times are difficult, economically or from an external threat, groups naturally come together in strength, so unity is organically achieved without too much effort or thought.
Applying the theory presented here to the society where you live would mean that initiatives that encourage the fulfilment of the values of sharing and giving and volunteerism would increase shared joy and unity in society. This may be an opportunity to encourage the people around your Shabbat table or discussion group to think of creative, practical ways this could happen.

Shoftim

In a Nutshell

<b><i>IN A NUTSHELL</i></b><br>In <i>Parashat Shofetim</i>, Moshe finishes explaining how to worship God in the Promised Land. Next he discusses the different kinds of Jewish leaders and how they will govern society. He begins with the structure of the justice system: there must be courts, judges, and officers in every city. All people must be able to approach the justice system and judges must be fair and unbiased. Special procedures must be followed when someone is accused of idolatry, and there is to be a supreme court to deal with difficult cases. There will be three main types of leaders: kings, priests and Levites, and prophets.
Moshe then warns the people to avoid magic, witchcraft, and false prophets. Lying witnesses who testify falsely are to be punished. The laws of going to war are set out. The <i>parasha</i> ends with the laws of responding to an unsolved murder case (a process called the <i>egla arufa</i>).
<b>QUESTION TO PONDER</b>
<i>Which of the types of biblical leaders in the</i> parasha<i> do we still have today? Do we have any other kinds of religious leaders not included here?</i>

I; A Sage Is Greater Than a Prophet

<big><strong>I. A Sage Is Greater Than a Prophet</strong></big><br><b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>In <i>Shofetim</i>, Moshe speaks about the great institutions of Judaism: courts, judges, officers, kings, priests, Levites, and prophets. In the case of the prophet, Moshe says in the name of God: “I will raise up a prophet for them from among their own people, like yourself: I will put My words in his mouth, and he will speak to them all that I command him” (Devarim 18:18).
This cannot be meant literally. In the quality and clarity of his communications with God, Moshe was unique. He was matchless in the miracles he performed. Most importantly, only he was authorised to proclaim Torah: he was Israel’s sole legislator. The king and Sanhedrin both had powers to make temporary laws for the sake of social order. Prophets were given the authority to command specific, time-bound acts. But no one could add to or subtract from the 613 commandments given by God through Moshe.
Rambam explains the role of future prophets like this: “<i>He [the prophet] will come not to establish a religion, but to command them to keep the words of the Torah, warning the people not to transgress them, as the last among them said: ‘Remember the Torah of Moshe My servant’</i>” (Malakhi 3:22).
In other words, the prophets who followed Moshe, from Eliyahu to Malakhi, were not revolutionaries. They did not intend to create something new. Rather, they restored something old. Their task was to bring the people back to the mission Moshe had taught them: to stay faithful to God and to create a just and compassionate society.
Eventually, during or after the Second Temple period, most of these institutions of leadership came to an end. There were no more kings because Israel had no sovereignty. There were no priests because there was no Temple. But there were also no prophets. How important were the prophets and what happened to prophecy?
One opinion stated in the Talmud (Bava Batra 12a) is that the Sages became the successors to the prophets: “From the day that the Temple was destroyed, prophecy was taken from the prophets and given to the Sages…. And a sage is greater than a prophet, as it is stated: ‘A prophet has a heart of wisdom’ (Tehillim 90:12). Who is compared to whom? You must say that the lesser is compared to the greater.” (Since a prophet must have a heart of wisdom, the sage, who is wisdom personified, must be greater still.)
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br><i>Theodor Herzl is known as the “</i>Ḥozeh HaMedina<i>” (Visionary of the State). He was born into an assimilated Jewish family in Budapest, Hungary, and apart from his bar mitzva, Judaism did not play a significant part in his life during his early years. But then he moved to Paris to work as a journalist, and everything changed. He covered the Dreyfus Affair in 1894 and witnessed the deeply ingrained antisemitism in French society. It was then that he realised the Jewish people needed to have their own state. So Herzl embarked on a campaign to convince both the Jewish world and the powerful and influential heads of state to support his idea to create a Jewish state. Ten years later, he died at the age of forty-four, with little to show for his efforts. While he had created the Zionist Congress which brought together Zionists from across the Jewish world, there was little agreement within this group, and despite numerous meetings with heads of state, none had formally agreed to support his ideas. He spent his entire fortune and sacrificed his health to the cause of Zionism, yet did not live to see the result of his hard work.</i>
<i>David Grün was born in Poland in 1886. In 1906, two years after Herzl’s death, he immigrated to Palestine, later changing his name to David Ben-Gurion. He soon took on leadership roles in the Yishuv (the Jewish community in pre-state Palestine), and ultimately became the de facto leader of the Jewish community in Palestine. He was instrumental in creating the organisations that would later become the institutions of state such as the Histadrut, Hagana, and the political party Poalei Zion (which later became the Labour Party). He ultimately became the first prime minister of the State of Israel, a position he held for fourteen years.</i>
<i>Herzl’s vision was to create a state from the top down, using political means and diplomacy to achieve international support for the creation of a Jewish state. He famously said, “If you will it, it is no dream.” David Ben-Gurion represented practical Zionism, a movement that differed from Herzl’s political strategy, by instead working to create a Jewish state through moving to Palestine and starting with establishing the foundations. This was a bottom-up approach. There is much debate over which strategy ultimately led to the establishment of the State of Israel. Most historians agree that neither approach would have succeeded without the other.</i>
<i>Forty-four years after Herzl’s death, David Ben-Gurion declared Israel’s independence on May 14, 1948, whilst sitting in the Tel Aviv Museum with a portrait of Theodor Herzl proudly displayed on the wall behind him.</i>
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. What do you think is more important, having a vision or taking practical steps towards a goal?</i>
<i>2. Which approach best represents the prophets and which is more similar to the approach of the Sages?</i>
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>The notion that the Sages are the successors to the prophets is seriously interesting. The early judges in Israel were <i>kohanim</i>. When Moshe blessed the people at the end of his life, he said of the tribe of Levi, “They shall teach Your laws to Yaakov and Your instructions to Israel” (Devarim 33:10). When Ezra taught Torah to the Israelites, he positioned Levites among the people to explain what was being said. All this suggests that when the Sages – teachers and masters of Jewish law – traced their intellectual-spiritual lineage, they should have done so by seeing themselves as heirs of the <i>kohanim</i> and <i>Levi’im</i>. But they did not do so. We see this from the famous mishna that opens <i>Pirkei Avot</i>: “Moshe received the Torah at Sinai and handed it on to Yehoshua, Yehoshua to the elders, and the elders<i> to the prophets, and the prophets to</i> <i>the Men of the Great Assembly.</i>”
The Sages saw themselves as heirs to the prophets. But in what sense? And how did they come to see themselves not just as heirs to, but as <i>greater than,</i> the prophets? What is more, the proof-text they cite means nothing of the kind. The verse in Tehillim 90 says, “Teach us to number our days, that <i>we may gain</i> a heart of wisdom.” The Talmud is playing on the fact that two quite different words sound alike: נבא (we may gain) and נביא (a prophet). In other words, only by suspending our critical faculties is the proof-text a proof.
Something very strange is happening here. The Sages, who valued humility, who knew that prophecy had come to an end in the days of Ḥagai, Zekharya, and Malakhi (five centuries before the destruction of the Second Temple), who believed that the most one could hear from heaven was a <i>bat kol</i>, a distant echo, are here saying that not only are they like the prophets, but that they are superior to the prophets.
The message here is that the Sages took the ideals of the prophets and turned them into practical programmes. That is how they increased the wisdom of the prophets. For example, prophets often had to reprimand the people, administering rebuke. This was Yeḥezkel’s experience of the task:
<i>“God said: ‘Son of man, I am sending you to the Israelites, to a rebellious nation that has rebelled against Me…. Say to them, “This is what the Sovereign Lord says.” And whether they listen or fail to listen</i> – <i>for they are a rebellious people</i> – <i>they will know that a prophet has been among them’”</i> (Yeḥezkel 2:3–5).
Yeḥezkel was told to take a public stand. Once he had done that, he had fulfilled his duty. The people were warned, and then it was their decision whether or not to change their behaviour.
The Sages had a completely different approach. First, they understood the task of remonstrating as belonging to everyone, not just prophets. That is how they understood the verse, “You shall surely rebuke your neighbour so you will not share in their guilt” (Vayikra 19:17). Second, they held that it should be done not once but up to a hundred times if necessary. In fact, they said that a person should keep reprimanding a wrongdoer until they were hit or cursed or scolded. All of this, though, applies only if there is a reasonable chance of making the situation better. If not, then we apply the rule: “Just as it is a mitzva to say something that will be heeded, so it is a mitzva <i>not</i> to say something that will not be heeded.”
Note the difference between the two approaches. The prophet takes a heroic stand but does not take responsibility for whether the people listen or not. The Rabbis do not take a heroic stand. In fact, they democratise the responsibility for rebuke so that it applies to everyone. But they are also hypersensitive to when it is the right approach. If there is a chance of changing someone for the better, then you must try a hundred times, but if there is no chance at all, it is better to be silent. This is not only a wise approach, it is a highly effective one.
Now consider peace. No finer visions of a world at peace have ever been given than by Israel’s prophets. This is just one:
<i>“The wolf will live with the lamb, the leopard will lie down with the goat, the calf and the lion and the yearling together; and a little child will lead them…. They will neither harm nor destroy on all My holy mountain, for the earth will be filled with the knowledge of the Lord as the waters cover the sea”</i> (Yeshaya 11:6–9).
And the Sages taught:
<i>“For the sake of peace, the poor of the heathens should not be prevented from gathering gleanings, forgotten sheaves, and corners of the field…. They should be supported as we support the poor of Israel, the sick of the heathens should be visited as we visit the sick of Israel, and the dead of the heathens should be buried as we bury the dead of Israel.”</i>
Once again, the difference is glaring. The prophets had a dazzling vision of a distant future, but the Sages took this idea and actually set out a practical programme of good community relations, a way of sustaining peaceful coexistence between the Jewish community and its gentile neighbours. Their teachings were imaginative, gracious, and workable.
There are many other examples. The Sages achieved something extraordinary. Throughout the biblical era, the Israelites were constantly tempted by idolatry and foreign ways. The prophets were often driven close to despair. During the rabbinic era, Jews became a people defined by religion, commandments, learning, and prayer, sustained voluntarily and maintained tenaciously against all pressures to convert to the majority faith. How was this achieved? Because the Rabbis did not focus on distant visions. They devised practical programmes. These may have lacked drama, but they worked.
The Sages, perhaps to their own surprise, realised that where the prophets failed, they were succeeding. <b>I believe that institutions like prophecy survive when they are translated from utopian ideals into practical policies. The greatness of the Sages, still not fully appreciated by the world, is that guided by the visions of the prophets, they gave us the instructions for how to get from here to there.</b>
<b>QUESTION TO PONDER</b>
<i>Why is it so important to translate ideas and ideals into practical steps, implementing them in society?</i>
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>Judaism’s genius was to take high ideals and translate them into life’s simple daily deeds: the way of mitzvot, acting in accordance with God’s will. We do not just contemplate truth: we live it.
Ten Paths to God<b><i> – Mitzvot: Responding to God, 3</i></b>
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>How did the later prophets differ from Moshe?
Why did the age of prophecy come to an end?
What aspects of the different types of biblical leadership mentioned in the <i>parasha</i> can be found in the later religious leadership of the Sages?
<b>EDUCATIONAL COMPANION TO THE QUESTIONS</b>
<b><i>IN A NUTSHELL</i></b><br>The <i>parasha</i> mentions judges, officers, kings, priests, Levites and prophets. Although we still have Levites and priests (<i>kohanim</i>) they only have a ceremonial leadership role. All the other leadership positions mentioned were discontinued when sovereignty and the Temple worship were lost. Today we have religious leadership from rabbinic leaders and teachers (and some suggest these have inherited the mantle of the prophetic religious leadership model).
<b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>The prophets communicated the word of God and through their speeches, they encouraged the people to create a society based on Torah values and ideals. When the people strayed from these ideals it was the role of the prophet to highlight this and guide them back to the path of God.
While the Sages did not receive direct instructions from God to deliver messages to the people, they developed a system of Jewish law based on the mitzvot in order to ensure the people had the best possible chance of living the Torah values that the prophets had been communicating to them. If Jewish law and Torah values were followed faithfully then Jewish society would be based on these ideals, which was the aim of the prophets.
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br>This interesting question is relevant in many different contexts, including business, social entrepreneurship, and religious communal life. Without a vision, ideals and dreams cannot be fulfilled. But without a practical plan and leadership that can deliver it in a real and tangible way, visions and ideals are at risk of being trapped in mere words and in the dreams of the visionaries. Very often, we find leaders who excel in one or the other of these areas, but rarely both. Neither can succeed without the other.
Herzl was the visionary who did not manage to bring his vision to practical fulfilment in his lifetime, and Ben-Gurion excelled at delivering Herzl’s Zionist dream through a practical programme of state-building. The prophets, like Herzl, were the dreamers who spoke in beautiful, poetic language about a society based on the ideals and values of the Torah. The Sages, like Ben-Gurion, built a programme of laws and mitzvot that established a society based on those ideals and values.
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>Ideals can remain abstract and theoretical if they are not translated into practical steps for fulfilment. Only very few people can find a way to live by ideals without clear practical instructions showing them how to do this. Most of us need guidance and concrete instruction. This is the basis of all legal systems, which translate national values into practical society and civilisation.
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>Moshe was Israel’s sole legislator, and only he could proclaim Torah (in the name of God). The later prophets were given the authority to command specific, time-bound acts, but could not add to or subtract from the 613 commandments given by God through Moshe. The prophets who followed Moshe were not revolutionaries, because they did not create something new but rather restored something old. Their task was to recall people to the mission Moshe taught them: to stay faithful to God, and to create a just and compassionate society.
Prophecy was lost to the people once they were exiled from the Holy Land and distanced from their previous intimacy with God there (including the loss of the Temple as a means to worship God).
The Sages (and their successors, today’s modern rabbis) are our only surviving religious leadership. We no longer have Temple worship, so the majority of the functions of the priests and Levites are lost to us. The educational aspects of the Levites’ role have been transferred to professional teachers and rabbis. But the aspiration of the prophets and Sages, to ensure the ideals and values of the Torah are at the heart of Jewish society, has been taken on by the rabbis, who continue to develop and legislate Jewish law, ensuring those ideals are embodied by those who are faithful to halakha and mitzvot.

II; The Ecological Imperative

<big><strong>II. The Ecological Imperative</strong></big><br><b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>While discussing the laws of war, Moshe adds what seems like a minor point about trees, as follows:
“When you lay siege to a city for a long time, fighting against it to capture it, do not destroy its trees by putting an axe to them, because you can eat their fruit. Do not cut them down. Are the trees people, that you should besiege them? However, you may cut down trees that you know are not fruit trees and use them to build siege works until the city at war with you falls” (Devarim 20:19–20).
This may sound like simple, additional detail to the laws of fighting a war, but in fact these words formed the basis of how Judaism understands our responsibilities to the natural world around us, laws which are crucial to our behaviour even today.
War is, the Torah implies, inevitably destructive. That is why Judaism’s highest value is peace. Nonetheless, there is a difference between necessary damage and needless destruction. Trees are a source of wood for siege works. But greater than that, some trees, those that bear fruit, are also an important source of food. Therefore, do not destroy them. Do not needlessly deprive yourself and others of a productive resource. Do not engage in a “scorched earth” tactic in the course of war.
The Sages saw in this command something more than a detail in the laws of war. They saw it as a <i>binyan</i> <i>av</i>, a specific example that explains a wider general principle. They called this the rule of <i>bal</i> <i>tashḥit</i>, the prohibition against needless destruction of any kind. This is how Rambam summarises it: “Not only does this apply to trees, but also whoever breaks vessels or tears garments, destroys a building, blocks a wellspring of water, or destructively wastes food transgresses the command of <i>bal</i> <i>tashḥit</i>.” This is the halakhic basis of an ethic of ecological responsibility (our role of caring for the world and for the environment).

<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br><i>There was once a royal family that lived in a palace with wonderful gardens. In those gardens there lived thousands of diverse, beautiful creatures. They were of great variety and colour, and they turned that place into a kind of paradise that everyone could enjoy. There was only one thing in those gardens that the royal family disliked: near the centre stood the remains of what had been, centuries ago, a great tree, but now it was withered, grey, and dry.</i>
<i>This bothered the king and queen so much that they finally ordered it to be cut down and replaced by a beautiful stone statue of an even grander tree. Sometime later, the princess said to her parents, “Everyone talks to me of the famous beauty of our gardens and the many creatures that populate them. But today I looked all around, and I’ve hardly seen anything other than the statue and a few small birds!” The king and queen saw to their horror that the princess was correct. They had spent so many months admiring the new statue that they hadn’t noticed that hardly any animals remained in the gardens. Without wasting time, they sent for the court’s experts and advisers, but no one could explain what had happened.</i>
<i>Many years later a young gardener who was presented to the princess could explain what had happened, and how the animals could be returned. “It is a lack of moths, Your Majesty. Particularly their waste.” All those present laughed at the gardener’s words, but the princess stopped them. “I want to hear what you have to say.” The gardener continued, very seriously, explaining how the gardens’ big animals fed mainly on the colourful birds, who owed their appearance to their own food, composed of glow worms, who in turn fed on various rare species of plants and flowers that grew only so long as there was enough fertilisation from the moths for them…and the moths were in turn food for many other birds, whose waste encouraged the growth of many plants that fed other insects and animals, and which were vital to their existence…. And the gardener would have kept speaking without pause if the princess had not sighed, “But where did the moths go? And how can we get them back?”</i>
<i>“Well, nowadays all the moths and other animals from your garden are at mine. Long ago, my father collected that old tree you had torn out from the middle of the garden, and he planted it in our garden. Since then, every spring, from out of that tree come thousands and thousands of moths. With time, the moths attracted the birds, and new plants and trees grew, providing food for other animals that, in turn, provided food for others…. And now, my father’s old place is filled with life and colour. All thanks to the moths from the big old tree.”</i>
<i>“Excellent!” exclaimed the princess. “Now we’ll be able to recover our gardens. Let us hurry. My people will all want to help. Within a week everything will be ready.” “Your Majesty, I’m afraid that cannot be,” said the gardener. “If you like, I can try to recreate the gardens, but it may take many years for the natural balance to return. Things like these do not depend on how many people work on them.” The face of the princess was sad and pensive, understanding how delicate was the balance of nature, and how careless her parents had been to disturb it. So the gardener and the princess decided to build a vast public park next to the gardener’s land.</i>
<i>And with the help of her willing people, they managed to see the new park finished in much less time than would have taken to re-establish the balance of nature in the garden palace.</i>

<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. What is the message of this story?</i>
<i>2. How does this message connect to the</i> parasha?
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>The earth is not ours. It belongs to its Creator, to God Himself. That is the point of the very first chapter of the Torah: “In the beginning, God created….” He made the world, and He is entitled to lay down the conditions within which we live in it as His guests. The logic of this is immediately played out in the story of the first humans. In the first chapter of Bereshit, God gives a command to humanity: “<i>Fill the earth and subdue it. Rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky and over every living creature that moves on the ground</i>” (1:28). “Subdue” and “rule” are verbs of dominance. In the second chapter, however, the text uses two new verbs instead. God placed the first man in the garden “to serve it (<i>le’ovda</i>) and guard it (<i>leshomra</i>)” (2:15). These are words of responsibility. The first term, <i>le’ovda</i>, tells us that humanity is not just the manager but also the servant of nature. The second, <i>leshomra</i>, is the term used in later biblical law to explain the responsibilities of someone who undertakes to guard something that does not belong to them.
How are we to understand the difference between the two opening chapters of Bereshit? Quite simply: Bereshit 1 tells us about creation and nature, the reality mapped by the natural sciences. It speaks about humanity as the biological species, Homo sapiens. Humans have the unique ability to dominate nature and exercise control over the forces that shape the physical world. This is a matter of fact, not value, and it has increased over the period of human civilisation. As former US President John F. Kennedy once said: “Man holds in his mortal hands the power to abolish all forms of human poverty and all forms of human life.” Power is morally neutral. It can be used to heal or wound, build or destroy.
Bereshit 2, by contrast, is about morality and responsibility. It tells us about the moral limits of power. Everything has its boundaries. We have the power but not the permission; we have the ability but not the right. The earth is not ours. It belongs to God who made it. Therefore we are not the owners of nature but its custodians. We are here to serve it and care for it.
This explains the story that immediately follows, about Adam, Ḥava, the serpent, and the forbidden fruit. What the fruit was, why the serpent spoke, and what was the nature of the first sin – all these are secondary. The primary point the Torah is making is that, even in paradise, there are limits. There is forbidden fruit. Not everything we <i>can</i> do <i>may</i> we do.
Few moral principles have been forgotten more often and more disastrously. The record of human intervention in the natural order is marked by devastation on a massive scale. Within a thousand years, the first human inhabitants of America had travelled from the Arctic north to the southernmost tip of Patagonia, making their way through two continents and, on the way, destroying most of the large mammal species then extant, among them mammoths, mastodons, tapirs, camels, horses, lions, cheetahs, and bears.
A similar pattern can be traced almost everywhere human beings have set foot. They have consistently been more mindful of the ability to “subdue” and “rule” than of the responsibility to “serve” and “guard.” A midrash sums this up in a way that deeply resonates with contemporary ecological awareness: “When God made man, He showed him the panoply of creation and said to him: ‘See all My works, how beautiful they are. All I have made, I have made for you. So take care that you do not destroy My world, for if you do, there will be no one left to mend what you have destroyed’” (Kohelet Rabba 7:13).
Environmental responsibility seems to be one of the principles underlying the three great commands of periodic rest: Shabbat, the Sabbatical year, and the Jubilee year. On Shabbat all agricultural work is forbidden, “so that your ox and your donkey may rest” (Shemot 23:12). It sets a limit to our intervention in nature and the pursuit of economic growth. We remind ourselves that we are creations, not just creators. For six days the earth is handed over to us and our labours, but on the seventh we may perform no “work.” Shabbat is thus a weekly reminder of the integrity of nature and the limits of human striving.
What Shabbat does for humans and animals, the Sabbatical and Jubilee years do for the land. The earth too is entitled to its periodic rest. Behind this are two concerns. One is environmental. As Rambam points out, land which is overexploited eventually erodes and loses its fertility. The Israelites were therefore commanded to conserve the soil by giving it periodic fallow years, not pursuing short-term gain at the cost of long-term desolation. The second, no less significant, is theological: “The land,” says God, “is Mine; you are but strangers and temporary residents with Me” (Vayikra 25:23). We are guests on earth.
Another set of commands is directed against over-interference with nature. The Torah forbids crossbreeding livestock, planting a field with mixed seeds, and wearing a garment of mixed wool and linen. These rules are called <i>ḥukim</i> or “statutes.” Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch (Germany, 1808–1888), like Ramban, understood <i>ḥukim</i> to be laws that respect the integrity of nature. They represent the principle that “the same regard which you show to humans you must also demonstrate to every lower creature, to the earth which bears and sustains all, and to the world of plants and animals.” They are a kind of social justice applied to the natural world: “They ask you to regard all living things as God’s property. Destroy none; abuse none; waste nothing; employ all things wisely.... Look upon all creatures as the household of creation.”
So it was no accident that Jewish law interpreted the law against cutting down fruit-bearing trees during war as an example of a more general mitzva against needless destruction, and more generally still, against acts that deplete earth’s non-renewable resources, or damage the ecosystem, or lead to the extinction of species. If that applies even in war, how much more so in times of peace. “The earth is the Lord’s and all that is in it” (Tehillim 24:1). We are its guardians, on behalf of its Creator, for the sake of future generations.
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>The Bible tells us very little about Avraham to explain why he was chosen for the mission he undertook. It doesn’t call him righteous, as it does in the case of Noaḥ. It doesn’t portray him as a fighter for justice, as it does for Moshe. The only place in the Bible to explain why Avraham was chosen is this verse: “For I have chosen him, so that he will direct his children and his household after him to keep the way of the Lord by doing what is right and just.” This tells us…what it is to be an heir of Avraham. It means that we are the guardians of our children’s future. We must ensure that they have a world to inherit. Today that means political, economic, and environmental sustainability.

<b>EDUCATIONAL COMPANION TO THE QUESTIONS</b>
<b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>Judaism sees war as a necessary evil, and in specific circumstances not only permissible, but a religious imperative (such as a war of self-defence). This is why the Torah has laws relevant to warfare, to ensure that if and when war occurs, the Jewish people know how to behave in the most ethical way possible. However, peace is the ultimate goal, and we pray for the Messianic time when the world will exist in a redeemed state, in a time of absolute peace.
Do not destroy a fruit tree, as this is a resource for humanity for food. The broader value here is the acknowledgement that the world is a gift from God and that we should be grateful for this and act responsibly when profiting from it. Humans are permitted to use its resources for their own benefit, but only in an ethical and responsible way. In modern-day language we would call this sustainable development (using natural resources for our benefit in a way that does not use them up and only at a rate that allows them to replenish and maintain their natural balance).
This could include recycling, being careful with our consumption of food, energy, materials, and water, limiting the use of greenhouse gases, and finding green alternatives to consuming fossil fuels.
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br>The story illustrates the importance of nature, and its delicate ecosystems, which is connected to understanding that we have a responsibility to protect the world, both because it is God’s gift and to ensure future generations can also benefit from it. In many ways, we are also like the garden and its life forms, and when something vital to our environment is needlessly destroyed, generations may suffer.
The message in this story is the value of environmental responsibility. The mitzva of <i>bal tashḥit</i>, found in this <i>parasha</i>, is also based on this value.
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>The only information we have in the Torah about why Avraham was chosen is that he will instruct his children in the way of the Lord. This means he will orientate his life around his children and their needs, especially when it comes to their education. And he therefore will teach them how to live a moral life.
Rabbi Sacks interprets this beyond just education to also include the responsibility to ensure they inherit a world worth living in. This includes the responsibility to work for political, economic, and environmental sustainability for future generations.
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>The world was created by God and belongs to its Creator. However, He has allowed its use for the benefit of humanity – though only in a responsible way that maintains environmental sustainability. Rabbi Sacks sees this balance in the contrast between the language found in the first two chapters of Bereshit. The language of Bereshit 1 is “subdue” and “conquer” while the language of Bereshit 2 is “serve” and “guard.” Alternatively, some interpret the term <i>le’ovda</i> as “to work the land” and see the balance of sustainable development in the terms <i>le’ovda</i> (to work) and <i>leshomra</i> (to protect). Either way, sustainable development through environmental responsibility is the value and message contained here in the first two chapters of Bereshit.
Examples include Shabbat, <i>Shemitta</i> (the Sabbatical year), <i>Yovel</i> (the Jubilee year), the prohibition of crossbreeding livestock, planting a field with mixed seeds, and wearing a garment of mixed wool and linen.
Along with changing personal behaviour and habits, this could include encouraging members of the family to take practical measures in their life to protect the environment, increasing awareness of environmental issues, or establishing initiatives in schools or the wider community.

Ki Teitzei

In a Nutshell

<b><i>IN A NUTSHELL</i></b><br>In this <i>parasha</i> Moshe continues his speech, preparing the Israelites for living an independent life in the land of Israel. He gets into the real details of the covenant between Israel and God. <i>Ki Tetzeh</i> contains seventy-four commands, which is more than any other <i>parasha</i> in the Torah. These include laws about family relations, moral and legal obligations towards neighbours and fellow citizens, moral behaviour in relation to financial matters, and other rules of social responsibility.
The <i>parasha</i> ends with the command to always remember Amalek, Israel’s archenemy and the Torah’s classic example of a group of people who act in hatred and cruelty.
<b>QUESTION TO PONDER</b>
<i>Why do we need mitzvot to tell us how to treat each other well? Isn’t it enough to always act out of love?</i>

I; Does Love Conquer All?

<big><strong>I. Does Love Conquer All?</strong></big><br><b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>Within the seventy-four commands in our <i>parasha</i>, there is one law that deserves much more attention than it has generally received. It concerns the laws of inheritance:
“If a man has two wives, and he loves one but not the other, and both bear him sons but the firstborn is the son of the wife he does not love, when he wills his property to his sons he must not give the rights of the firstborn to the son of the wife he loves in preference to his actual firstborn, the son of the wife he does not love. He must acknowledge the son of his unloved wife as the firstborn by giving him a double share of all he has. That son is the first sign of his father’s strength. The right of the firstborn belongs to him” (Devarim 21:15–17).
On the face of it, this is a straightforward law. It tells us that love must not override justice. The firstborn, in ancient Israel and elsewhere, has special rights, especially in connection with inheritance. In most societies they tended to ultimately hold their father’s position. That was the case in Israel in relation to kingship and priesthood. They did not inherit all the father’s property, but they did inherit twice as much as the other children.
It was important to have rules like this to avoid damaging family splits every time a death occurred or was imminent. The Torah gives us clear examples of the tension and conflict that can occur within families. Yaakov showed a preference for Yosef, who was not his firstborn, and this led to his brothers selling him into slavery to get rid of him. At the end of King David’s life, Avshalom mounted a rebellion against his father, and Adoniya proclaimed himself the new king as the whole court wondered which of David’s many children should be his rightful heir. Eventually it was announced that Shlomo should rule instead. More recently there have been several examples of hasidic dynasties irreparably torn apart because groups disagreed on which individual should inherit the leadership.
There is a tension between individual liberty and the common good. Individual liberty says, “This wealth is mine. I should be able to do with it what I like, including deciding to whom to hand it on.” But there is also the welfare of others, including the other children, other family members, and the community and society that are damaged by family disputes. The Torah therefore draws a line, acknowledging the rights of the biological firstborn and limiting the rights of the father.

<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br><i>One of the most powerful scientific ideas of the twentieth century was Niels Bohr’s complementarity theory, designed to resolve one of the paradoxes of particle physics. Light cannot be both a wave and a particle, yet it behaves like both, sometimes one, sometimes the other.</i>
<i>Bohr was a leading founder of quantum mechanics. He tells the story of how he came to his complementarity theory. It happened after his young son was caught stealing sweets from a local store. Niels experienced mixed emotions towards his son and was torn on how to approach him in the light of this event. First he found himself thinking about this as a judge would. His son was guilty of a crime and justice must be done. But he also felt parental emotions of love and compassion. He realised that he could not hold both thoughts equally in his mind at the same time, and this led to his research on complementarity theory.</i>
<i>As a fair judge of the situation, he had to think impartially. As a father he could not help but have compassion for his son, who had made a mistake. One way of thinking leads to justice, the other to mercy, but these are conflicting perspectives and involve different kinds of relationships. Life is complicated. People are complicated. And when we really think it through, there are often multiple perspectives to consider before reacting.</i>
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. Do you think Niels Bohr should have chosen only one response to his son’s action, and if so, which?</i>
<i>2. Do you think God has the same dilemma? How does He resolve this conflict?</i>
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>The law is straightforward. What makes it remarkable is that <i>it reads as if it were directed against a specific biblical figure, namely Yaakov</i>. One connection is linguistic. The key terms used in our law are an opposition between <i>ahuva</i>, “loved,” and <i>senua</i>, “hated/unloved.” This opposition occurs ten times in the Torah. Three have to do with the relationship between us and God: “Those who hate Me and those who love Me.” That leaves seven other cases. Four are in the paragraph above. <i>The other three are all about Yaakov</i>: two of them about his love for Raḥel in preference to Leah (Bereshit 29:30–31, 32–33), the third about his love for Yosef in preference to the other sons (Bereshit 37:4). Both caused great grief within the family and had devastating consequences in the long run.
This is how the Torah describes Yaakov’s feelings for Raḥel:
“Yaakov <i>loved</i> Raḥel and said, ‘I’ll work for you [Lavan] seven years in return for your younger daughter Raḥel’…. So Yaakov served seven years for Raḥel, but they seemed like only a few days to him because of his <i>love</i> for her…. And Yaakov cohabited with Raḥel also; indeed, he <i>loved</i> Raḥel more than Leah. And he served him [Lavan] another seven years” (Bereshit 29:18–30).
And this is its description of the impact it had on Leah:
“When the Lord saw that Leah was <i>hated</i>, He enabled her to conceive, but Raḥel remained childless. Leah conceived and bore a son, and named him Reuven, for she declared, ‘It means: “The Lord has seen my affliction”; it also means: “Now my husband will <i>love</i> me.”’ She conceived again and bore a son, and declared, ‘This is because the Lord heard that I was <i>hated</i> and has given me this one also,’ so she named him Shimon” (Bereshit 29:31–33).
I have translated the word <i>senua</i> here as “hated” simply to give a sense of the shock of the text as it is in Hebrew. We also understand why this word is used. Leah was, as the text says, loved less than Raḥel. Yaakov did not hate her, but she <i>felt</i> hated, because less loved, thus unloved. This feeling dominated her marriage as we see from the names she gave her eldest children. The rivalry continues and intensifies in the next generation:
“When his brothers saw that their father <i>loved</i> him [Yosef] more than any of his brothers, they <i>hated</i> him and could not speak a peaceful word to him” (Bereshit 37:4).
Less loved, the brothers felt hated, and so they hated the more-loved Yosef. <i>Love generates conflict, even though none of the parties want conflict.</i> Yaakov didn’t hate Leah or her sons or the sons of the handmaids. He did not deliberately decide to love Raḥel and later Yosef. Love doesn’t work like that. It happens to us, usually not of our choosing. Yet those outside the relationship can feel excluded and unloved. The Torah uses the word <i>senua</i> to tell us how serious the feeling is. It is not enough to say “I love you too,” when every act, every word, every look says, “I love someone else more.”
Which brings us to inheritance. Yosef was the eleventh of Yaakov’s twelve sons, but the firstborn of Yaakov’s beloved Raḥel. Yaakov proceeded to do what our <i>parasha</i> tells us not to do. He deprived Reuven, his and Leah’s firstborn, of the birthright, the double portion, and gave it instead to Yosef. To Yosef he said: “Now, your two sons, who were born to you in the land of Egypt before I came to you in Egypt, shall be mine; Efrayim and Menashe shall be mine no less than Reuven and Shimon.”
Later in the same chapter, he says: “I am about to die; but God will be with you and bring you back to the land of your fathers. And now, I assign to you <i>one portion more than to your brothers</i>, which I wrested from the Amorites with my sword and bow” (Bereshit 48:21–22). There are many interpretations of this verse, but according to Rashi, “This refers to the birthright, that Yosef’s children should receive two portions when Canaan would be divided amongst the tribes.” Yaakov’s other children would receive one portion, while Yosef would receive two, one for each of his sons Efrayim and Menashe.
<i>It is against this practice that the law in our parasha is directed</i>. That is what is extraordinary. Yaakov/Yisrael is the father of our people. But specifically in this respect, his conduct must not be taken as a precedent. We are forbidden to act as he did.
The Torah is not telling us that Yaakov did wrong. There are all sorts of explanations that reconcile his behaviour with later law. The Torah had not yet been given to the Jewish people (although Ramban notes that Yaakov did keep the Torah laws when he was in the land of Israel, but his gift of a double portion to Yosef happened in Egypt). Another explanation offered is that we are forbidden to transfer the birthright on grounds of love alone, but we may do so if we believe that the firstborn has significant character deficiencies, which Yaakov believed to be true of Reuven (Bereshit 49:3–4; Abarbanel).
But the law is telling us something very profound indeed. Love is the highest of emotions. We are commanded to love God with all our heart, soul, and might. But it is also, in family contexts, fraught with danger. Love ruined Yaakov’s life and negatively affected his family time and again: in his relationship with Esav (Yitzḥak loved Esav; Rivka loved Yaakov), in the relationship between Leah and Raḥel, and in the relationship between Yosef and his brothers. Love brings joy. It also brings tears. It brings some people close, but makes others feel distanced, rejected.
Therefore, says the Torah, in our command: When love is likely to be the cause of conflict, it must take second place to justice. Love is partial; justice is impartial. Love is for someone specific; justice is for everyone. Love brings personal satisfaction; justice brings social order.
Judaism is the most effective attempt in history to provide the proper balance between the particular and the universal. It is both. It worships the universal God by way of a particular faith. It believes in a universal connection between God and humanity – we are all in God’s image (Bereshit 1:27) – and a particular one – “My child, My firstborn, Israel” (Shemot 4:22). It believes in a universal covenant with Noaḥ, and a particular one, with Avraham and later the Israelites. So it believes in the universality of justice and the particularity of love and the importance of both.
When it comes to the relationship between humans, there is an order of priority. First create justice, then express love. For if we let those priorities be reversed, allowing injustice in the name of love, we will divide and destroy families and groups and suffer the consequences for a long time.
A seemingly minor law about inheritance is in fact a major statement of Jewish values. <b>I believe that Judaism got it right by placing love at the heart of the religious life – love of God, neighbour, and stranger – but at the same time recognising that without justice, love will not save us. It may even destroy us.</b>
<b>QUESTION TO PONDER</b>
<i>Why is love not enough?</i>
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br><i>Tzedaka</i> means both justice and charity, because we believe that they go hand in hand. Justice is impersonal; charity is personal. We call God “<i>Avinu Malkeinu</i>,” “Our Father, our King.” A king dispenses justice; a parent gives a child a gift out of love. That is the meaning of <i>tzedaka</i>, an act that combines both justice and love.
<b>Ten Paths to God<i> – Tzedakah: Love as Justice</i>, 3</b>
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>Why does love sometimes conflict with justice?
Why do you think the Torah (especially the book of Bereshit) is full of complicated family stories of love and hate?
Why is justice more important than love?
<b>EDUCATIONAL COMPANION TO THE QUESTIONS</b>
<b><i>IN A NUTSHELL</i></b><br>Love is an emotion that does not function according to logic, and therefore is not a reliable way to make sure that everyone is treated fairly. It is impossible for most people to love everyone equally and therefore treat them fairly and equally. So the Torah gives us laws to help us always remember how to treat everyone fairly, not just being kind to those who we love instinctively. Loving everyone is the ideal, and the mitzvot help us to fine-tune our behaviour.
<b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>Although we may have worked hard for our wealth, and the Torah allows us to maintain ownership of it, we must remember that ultimately all material things in our lives come from God, and He has the right to determine to some extent how we use our wealth. The Torah guides us to use our wealth for the betterment of humankind and society, and to spend our money wisely and fairly.
In cases where a man has had more than one marriage (either concurrently, in biblical times, or a second marriage after divorce or death) there can be more than one “firstborn” – one from each of the wives. This can cause tension in the family unit and lead to fighting over who will receive the greater inheritance. This law clarifies that the firstborn is defined by the father’s first son, not the mother’s first child. It also takes the decision out of the hands of the father, who may love one of his wives or children more than another and be tempted to show favouritism, which would cause pain and tension in the family.
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br>It would be natural for a father to choose the path of love, but this may not be the morally correct choice, or the best choice for the child. One can argue that it is the role of the parent to try and use both approaches in their parenting to help their child grow up as a balanced, moral adult.
God plays many roles in our lives, including judge and king (dispensing justice) and parent (a relationship based on love). This is the essence of the prayer <i>Avinu Malkeinu</i> (Our Father, our King). Only God can play these two roles at the very same time, relating to us with both justice and love and compassion. We must strive to do the same.
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>Love is particular. This means no one person can love every other person equally. We love some more than others, whether our friends, parents, children, other relatives, or spouses. It is unnatural, and impossible, to love other people outside of these circles in the same way. (Various political and philosophical systems, such as the socialism of the kibbutz movement, have attempted to create societies based on free and total love, but these have largely failed or been adapted to incorporate particular love into them.) If the morality of society is based on love only, this will lead to inequalities. Justice is a universal value and must be given primacy over love in the civil law of a society. Judaism believes in both particular love and universal justice, and its vision of society is based on both of these values.
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>Love is particular, which means that individuals love some people more than others. Sometimes this can lead to injustice. Justice is universal. So Judaism will sometimes apply universal justice even when it conflicts with particular love (such as the case in this <i>parasha</i> where the father may wish to give his inheritance to one child over another).
The Torah tells us the stories of our ancestors who were real people tackling the struggles of real life. It would have been too hard to relate to them and feel inspired by them if they lived perfect lives. So we don’t only read about the miracles of God and the impressive acts of our ancestors. The Torah shows their mistakes, the regular parts of their lives, and their regular challenges, and we learn from the way they, with the help of God, overcame these.
Justice is universal, and gives us a way to ensure equality for all people. Love is particular, and while we must aspire to love all people, and ensure that all people are loved in society, this is not always realistic. But universal justice can be enshrined in law, guaranteeing that all humans have equal rights.

II; Animal Welfare

<big><strong>II. Animal Welfare</strong></big><br><b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br><i>Ki Tetzeh</i> is about relationships: between men and women, parents and children, employers and employees, lenders and borrowers. Interestingly, though, it is also about relationships between humans and animals.
Descartes (a seventeenth-century French philosopher and scientist) thought that animals lacked souls. So he said that you could do with them as you pleased. Judaism does not believe that animals lack souls – “The righteous person cares about the <i>nefesh</i> of their animal,” says the book of Mishlei (12:10). To be sure, <i>nefesh</i> here probably means “life” rather than “soul” (<i>neshama</i> in Hebrew). But Tanakh does regard animals as conscious beings. They may not speak, but they do feel. They are capable of distress. Therefore there is such a thing as animal distress, <i>tzaar baalei ḥayim</i>, and as far as possible it should be avoided.
So we read in <i>Parashat Ki Tetzeh</i>: “Do not plough with an ox and donkey together” (Devarim 22:10). The ox is stronger than a donkey, so expecting the donkey to match the work of an ox is cruel. Each animal species has a unique role in the scheme of creation that we must respect.
Another law is: “<i>Do not muzzle an ox when it is treading grain</i>” (Devarim 25:4). What is striking about this law is that it is parallel to a similar law concerning human beings as well: “<i>When you come [to work] in your neighbour’s vineyard, you may eat as many grapes as you desire to satisfy your hunger.... When you come [to work] in your neighbour’s standing grain, you may take the ears with your hand”</i> (Devarim 23:25–26). The principle is the same in both cases: it is cruel to prevent those working with food from eating some of it. The parallel laws send a clear message. Animals, not just humans, have feelings, and they must be well treated.

<i>Rabbi Yehuda said to the animal: “Go, because this was the reason for which you were created!”</i>
<i>At that moment, the angels in heaven declared: “Since Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi was not compassionate towards the calf, let him suffer himself!” From that day on he suffered terrible pain, until, thirteen years later, another incident occurred. On that day his maidservant was sweeping his house when she discovered a family of weasels taking shelter. She began to sweep them away and out of the house when Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi stopped her, and declared: “Leave them be! It says in Tehillim, ‘The Lord is good to all. He shows mercy to all His creations’” (Tehillim 145:9). The angels in heaven then said: “Since he showed compassion here, we will show him compassion,” and his pain ended that day.</i>

<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>The most fascinating animal legislation in this <i>parasha</i> is the law of sending the mother bird away:
“If you come across a bird’s nest beside the road, either in a tree or on the ground, and the mother is sitting on the young or on the eggs, do not take the mother with the young. You may take the young, but be sure to let the mother go, so that it may go well with you and you may have a long life” (Devarim 22:6–7).
Much has been written on this command. Here we discuss only the analysis given by Rambam, fascinating in its complexity. There is a law that appears twice in the Mishna, stating that if a leader of prayer says, “Your mercies extend even to a bird’s nest,” they are to be silenced. The Talmud offers two possible explanations, of which one is that such a prayer “makes it seem as if the attributes of God are an expression of compassion, whereas in fact they are mere decrees.”
In both his <i>Commentary on the Mishna</i> and his law code, Rambam adopts this view. He adds: If the reason for sending the mother bird away were divine compassion towards animals then, in consistency, God should have forbidden killing animals for food. The law therefore should be understood as a decree we cannot understand rationally (a <i>gezerat hakatuv</i>), and has nothing to do with compassion, human or divine.
In <i>The Guide for the Perplexed</i>, however, Rambam adopts the opposite approach. There he rejects the very notion that there are commands without reason. It is permitted to kill animals, he says, for food, because eating meat is beneficial to human health. <i>Sheḥita</i> (ritual slaughter) has careful laws on the most painless way to kill an animal for kosher meat. He says:
<i>“It is also prohibited to kill an animal with its young on the same day, in order that people should be restrained and prevented from killing the two together in such a manner that the young is killed in the sight of the mother, for the pain of the animals under such circumstances is very great. There is no difference in this case between the pain of human beings and the pain of other living beings, since the love and tenderness of the mother for her young ones is not produced by reasoning but by imagination, and this faculty exists not only in man but also in most living beings…. The same reason applies to the law which enjoins that we should let the mother bird fly away when we take the young.”</i>
So Rambam, contrary to the position he takes in his law code, here states that the law does have compassion as its logic. Moreover, what it seeks to avoid is not physical pain to the animal but psychological distress. Rambam’s view of animals has been confirmed by recent findings in biology that suggest that many species do indeed resemble humans in their ability to form groups, engage in reciprocal altruism, and display a range of emotions. In most animal species, it is the mother that forms an ongoing bond with the young. Among animals, fatherhood is usually far less developed. So Rambam’s explanation in <i>The Guide</i> is empirically well founded.
However, elsewhere in <i>The Guide</i>, Rambam takes yet a third position. Divine providence, he says, extends to individuals only among humans. Amongst animals, it applies solely to a species as a whole. So the reason we must not cause animals pain or distress is not because the Torah is concerned about animals but because it is concerned about humans. We should not be cruel.
There is a rule laid down by our Sages that it is directly prohibited in the Torah to cause pain to an animal. This rule is based on the words (of the angel to Bilam), “Why have you beaten your donkey?” (Bemidbar 22:32). The object of this rule is to refine our behaviour, so that we should not assume cruel habits, and that we should not uselessly cause pain to others – instead, we should be prepared to show pity and mercy to all living creatures except when necessity demands the contrary.
In this view, we are forbidden to cause needless suffering to animals because this will desensitise us and lead us eventually to be cruel to human beings. Rambam thus seems to embrace three sharply conflicting views:
1. The law of the mother bird is a divine decree with no reason.
2. This law is intended to spare the mother bird emotional pain.
3. These rules are intended to have an effect on us, not the animal, by training us not to be cruel.
In fact all three are true, because they answer different questions. The first view explains why we have the laws we have. The Torah forbids certain acts that are cruel to animals but not others. Why these and not those? Because that is the law. Laws will always seem arbitrary. Why, for example, is one permitted to drive at 30 miles an hour in a city, but not 31? Why not set the bar at 29? The reason for the law is obvious: to avoid accidents. But we observe the law because it is the law, even though, under certain circumstances, driving at 40 miles an hour might seem safe, and at other times, driving at 20 would be dangerous. The second view listed above explains the immediate logic of the law. It exists to prevent needless suffering to animals, because they too feel physical pain and sometimes emotional distress as well. The third view sets the law in a larger perspective. Cruelty to animals is wrong, not because animals have <i>rights</i> but because we have <i>duties</i>. The duty not to be cruel is intended to promote virtue, and the primary context of virtue is the relationship between human beings. But virtues are indivisible. Those who are cruel to animals often become cruel to people. Hence we have a duty not to cause needless pain to animals, because of its effect on us. Hence the third proposition of Rambam.
This is a subtle and nuanced approach. Animals are part of God’s creation. They have their own integrity in the scheme of things. We now know that they are far closer to human beings than philosophers like Descartes thought.
This would not have been news to the heroes of the Bible. Avraham, Moshe, and David were all shepherds who lived their formative years watching over and caring for animals. That was their first tutorial in leadership, and they knew that this was one way of understanding God Himself (“The Lord is my shepherd” [Tehillim 23:1]).
As we saw in the last <i>parasha,</i> in the environmental discussion in <i>Shofetim</i>, Bereshit 1 gives us the mandate to “subdue” and “rule” creation, including animals, but Bereshit 2 gives us the responsibility to “serve” and “guard.” Animals may not have rights but they do have feelings, and we must respect them if we are to honour our role as God’s partners in creation.
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>Judaism gives us our moral code of a society, and it cares about social virtues: righteousness (<i>tzedek</i>/<i>tzedaka</i>), justice (<i>mishpat</i>), loving-kindness (<i>ḥesed</i>), and compassion (<i>raḥamim</i>). These structure the template of biblical law, which covers all aspects of the life of society, its economy, its welfare systems, its education, family life, employer-employee relations, the protection of the environment, and so on.
<b><i>Future Tense</i>, 136</b>
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. What role can ethical legislation towards animals (such as the mitzvot in the</i> parasha<i>) play in creating a society of righteousness, justice, loving-kindness, and compassion?</i>
<i>2. Do you think having pets plays a role in this also?</i>
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>What are the three approaches that Rambam presents explaining the rationale of the mitzvot concerned with animal welfare?
Which of Rambam’s three approaches speaks to you the most?
How would you summarise Judaism’s approach to animal welfare?
<b>EDUCATIONAL COMPANION TO THE QUESTIONS</b>
<b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>Each of the mitzvot mentioned here teaches us to show concern for animal welfare, and to do our best to avoid causing both physical and emotional pain. Muzzling an ox, and thereby preventing it from eating while it is being used to tread grain, is cruel. Using an ox and a donkey together to plough a field is physically cruel for the donkey, which is not as strong as the ox. Taking eggs away from a mother bird causes her emotional distress.
These mitzvot encourage us to see animals as sentient beings with physical and emotional feelings. Once we become aware of this, and relate to animals in an I-Thou rather than I-It relationship, it is easy to understand why these mitzvot belong together with other mitzvot that regulate relationships, including relationships between humans.
This open-ended question should encourage deeper thinking and open conversation. In the section <i>Thinking More Deeply</i>, three approaches from Rambam are quoted which you may wish to reference in this discussion. They are:
Torah laws are divine and cannot always be understood rationally – they must be kept without qualification.
We have an ethical duty to all of God’s creatures – these laws are designed to spare animals emotional and physical pain.
These laws refine us as human beings, improving our sensitivity towards humans – they are intended to have an effect on us, not the animal, by training us not to be cruel.
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br>Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi did not commit any sin according to Jewish law. Judaism permits the use of animals for the benefit of humankind, including for food. However, this must always be in as ethical a manner as possible, avoiding cruelty at all costs.
In this case, Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, despite not showing direct cruelty, showed an insensitivity to the emotional feelings of the calf. He transgressed no law, but perhaps he missed an opportunity to show compassion, or at least understanding. Maybe the angels wanted him to learn an important lesson about empathy, to improve him as an ethical person, creating a greater sensitivity to the plight of animals. Indeed, this seems to have been the outcome, as we can see from the way he responded in the second part of the story.
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>The values of righteousness, justice, loving-kindness, and compassion do not only apply to humans. A society based on these values will apply them to animals as well. The mitzvot in the <i>parasha</i> encourage this very point. So a moral society with these values will have legislation that protects animals, and institutions to facilitate this. More than this, a society of people who embody these values will develop a greater sensitivity by keeping laws that protect animals. By being kind to animals, we are more likely to be kind to humans. See Rambam in <i>Thinking More Deeply</i>.
Pets are a great opportunity to cultivate an I-Thou relationship with an animal, fostering a sensitivity to an animal’s needs, which will help to develop one’s ethical and moral character. A pet can increase love and compassion in a family, benefitting all family members.
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>Rambam takes three different approaches to these mitzvot. Rabbi Sacks explains why the different points made by Rambam are not contradictions, but rather, they teach a more complex and nuanced approach to this area of Torah law. Rambam is clearly suggesting that there are aspects of all three approaches in the mitzvot. The approaches are:
Torah laws are divine and cannot always be understood rationally – they must be kept without qualification.
We have an ethical duty to all of God’s creatures – these laws are designed to spare animals emotional and physical pain.
These laws refine us as human beings, improving our sensitivity towards humans – they are intended to have an effect on us, not the animal, by training us not to be cruel.
While each person may be intellectually and spiritually attracted to one of these approaches more than another, it is important to allow room for all three in one’s outlook, just as Rambam does.
In the first chapter of Bereshit, the Torah commands humankind to “subdue” and “conquer” the world and its resources, including animals. This means that humans are allowed to eat animals for nutrition, and use other aspects of them as a resource (such as their fur or skin for clothing). However, in the second chapter of Bereshit, the Torah commands humankind to “serve” and “protect” the world. In the <i>Covenant &amp; Conversation</i> essay on <i>Parashat Shofetim</i>, Rabbi Sacks suggests that this means ecological conservation and protection. A balance between these two approaches leads us to maintaining sustainable development. Our ethical approach to animals is the same. We are permitted to use animals for our own benefit, but only in an ethically responsible way, and this includes avoiding cruelty.

Ki Tavo

In a Nutshell

<b><i>IN A NUTSHELL</i></b><br>In <i>Ki Tavo</i>, Moshe reaches the end of his speech explaining all the details of the covenant. The last set of commands he discusses involve bringing first-fruits to the central Sanctuary, as well as the various agricultural tithes (like taxes), giving ten per cent of all produce to the poor, the Levites, or bringing the produce to Jerusalem to eat. These rules rotate around a seven-year cycle.
Moshe then reminds the Israelites again that a covenant is a two-way promise between the people and God. The people are to give God their total loyalty. God, in turn, will always have a special relationship with the people.
The Torah now turns to the next feature of ancient covenants: the blessings and curses that will result if the people are faithful on the one hand, or disloyal on the other. The <i>parasha</i> ends with Moshe summoning the people, at the end of their forty-year journey and in sight of the Promised Land, to renew the covenant their parents made with God at Mount Sinai.
<b>QUESTION TO PONDER</b>
<i>Why do you think it was important to remind the Israelites about the covenant and to renew their promises before they entered the land?</i>

I; Be Silent and Listen

<big><strong>I. Be Silent and Listen</strong></big><br><b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>In one of his essays in <i>Beit Yaakov</i>, Rabbi Yaakov Leiner, son of the Ishbitzer Rebbe (Rabbi Mordechai Leiner), makes a fascinating comment on a phrase in this <i>parasha</i>, “<i>Hasket ushema Yisrael</i>” (Devarim 27:9), “Be silent and listen, Israel. You have now become the people of the Lord your God.” He says there is a fundamental difference between <i>seeing</i> and <i>listening</i> and what each communicates. Seeing tells us about the surfaces and externalities of things. Listening tells us about internalities, depths, and truths.
Rabbi Leiner’s comments are echoed by one of the great twentieth-century scholars of technologies of communication, Walter J. Ong, who spoke about “the unique relationship of sound to interiority when sound is compared to the rest of the senses.” He added, “This relationship is important because of the interiority of human consciousness and of human communication itself.” In other words, it is through sound, especially through speaking and listening, that we are present to one another as subjects rather than objects. By listening, we encounter the depth-dimension of reality.
When we listen, we are personally engaged far beyond the way we participate when we simply watch. Ong regards this as one of the special features of the Hebrew Bible. God creates the universe through words. He reveals Himself to His people in words. He makes a covenant with them in words. The last and culminating book of the Torah is called <i>Devarim</i>, “words.” Ong notes that the Hebrew for “word,” <i>davar</i>, also means an event, a happening, something that generates momentum in history. If the greatest thing God does is speak, then the greatest thing we can do is listen.
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. Why is listening more powerful than seeing?</i>
<i>2. How can we listen to God today?</i>
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br><i>Under the reign of King Aḥav and his queen Izevel, Baal worship had become the official cult of the land of Israel. God’s prophets were being killed. Those who survived were in hiding. Eliyahu responded by issuing a public challenge to be held at Mount Carmel. Facing four hundred of Baal’s representatives, he was determined to settle the question of religious truth once and for all.</i>
<i>He told the assembled people to choose one way or another: Were they for God or for Baal? They must no longer hedge their bets and worship both. Truth was about to be decided by a fiery test. If it lay with Baal, the fire would consume the offering prepared by its priests. If it lay with God and His Torah, fire would descend to Eliyahu’s offering. First the Baal priests tried to call for fire but after many hours, nothing happened.</i>
<i>Eliyahu poured water over all of his altar and then, before the eyes of the people, fire devoured his offering. There was no doubt that he had proven his point, and the people cried out, “The Lord, He is God.” The priests of Baal were defeated. But the story does not end there. Queen Izevel wanted revenge, and she issued a warrant for his death. Eliyahu escaped to Mount Ḥorev and hid there. After forty days he stood at the mountain and received a strange vision. He witnessed a whirlwind, then an earthquake, then a mighty fire. But he could not find God in these things. Then God spoke to him in a “still, small voice.”</i>
<b><i>A voice you can only hear if you are listening.</i></b>
<b>A retelling of I Melakhim, chapters 18–19</b>
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. What do you think we can learn from the way Eliyahu found God in the still, small voice?</i>
<i>2. Why did Eliyahu need this vision?</i>
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>There is a difference between <i>hearing</i> and <i>listening</i>, often concealed by the fact that the Hebrew verb <i>shema</i> means both. But they are very different. Hearing is passive; listening is active. Hearing needs no special concentration, but listening does. It involves attention, focus, and openness to the other. One of the greatest gifts is finding someone who really listens to us. Sadly, it happens all too rarely. In conversation we are often so focused on what we are going to say next that we don’t really listen properly to what the other person is saying.
And so it is with prayer. Someone once defined prayer as <i>listening to God listening to us</i>.
There are some profound stories about listening in the Torah and Tanakh. Take for instance the fraught episode in which Yaakov takes his father’s blessing, intended for Esav. The story eliminates sight as a dimension, for Yitzḥak is old and cannot see. Yet he has persistent doubts as to whether the son who visits him is indeed Esav. He tries the various senses. He <i>tastes</i> the food his son has brought. He <i>smells</i> his clothes. He <i>touches</i> his hands. He concludes: “The voice is the voice of Yaakov, but the hands are the hands of Esav” (Bereshit 27:22). How much anguish might have been spared had he followed the evidence of his hearing rather than his taste, smell, and touch.
The names of Yaakov’s first three sons were all cries for attention on the part of their mother Leah. She called the first Reuven, saying, “It is because the Lord has seen my misery. Surely my husband will love me now.” The second she called Shimon, saying, “Because the Lord heard that I am not loved, He gave me this one too.” She called the third Levi, saying, “Now at last my husband will become attached to me, because I have borne him three sons.” Was Yaakov listening to her cries? We don’t know. But the plain sense of the text is that he was not. And we know from Yaakov’s deathbed blessings that his relationship with these three sons was fractured.
Then there is the strange choice of Moshe as the man chosen to be the voice of God’s word to Israel for all time. Moshe kept protesting that he was not a man of words, he could not speak, he had “uncircumcised lips.” The Torah is surely telling us several things, but might one of them have been that, finding it hard to speak, Moshe had learned to listen? Certainly Moshe <i>heard</i> God better than anyone in history.
Then there was the drama on Mount Ḥorev where Eliyahu went after his spectacular victory over the prophets of Baal, having called down fire from heaven at Mount Carmel. God showed him a powerful wind, an earthquake, and a fire, but God was in none of these things. Instead He was in the <i>kol demama daka</i>, the “still small voice” that I believe means “a sound you can only hear if you are listening.”
Look at the stunningly beautiful lines of Tehillim 19 that we say on Shabbat mornings, telling us that “the heavens declare the glory of God; the skies proclaim the work of His hands,” despite the fact that “there is no speech; there are no words.” Creation sings a song to its Creator, which we might hear if we listen attentively enough. I was reminded of this throughout the pandemic, when there was little noise from traffic and none from aeroplanes overhead, and we could hear the birdsong and other sounds of nature more vividly than ever I remember.
Listening is a primary theme of Moshe’s speeches in Devarim. The root <i>sh-m-a</i> appears no fewer than ninety-two times in the book, an astonishing number. <i>That is what I hope we gained from this distressing time of isolation: the ability to slow down our prayers and listen to them, letting their poetry penetrate more deeply than at other times.</i>
During our first Coronavirus lockdown, there was one question I was asked more than any other: What about prayer? Just when we needed it the most, we found ourselves unable to participate in <i>tefilla betzibbur</i>, public communal prayer. Our most sacred prayers, <i>devarim shebikedusha</i>, are communal. They require a <i>minyan</i>. There was an argument between Rambam and Ramban as to whether, originally and essentially, the command of prayer was directed to individuals or to the community as a whole. But there was no disagreement between them as to the importance and value of praying as part of a community. That is supremely how we, as Jews, come before God, not primarily as “I” but as “We.” How then were we to find spiritual strength without this communal dimension?
My answer was: This is indeed a terrible privation. There is no point in minimising the loss. As Rabbi Judah Halevi said in <i>The</i> <i>Kuzari</i>, individual prayer is like protecting yourself by building a wall around your house. Collective prayer is like joining with others to maintain the wall around the city. The wall around the city protects everyone, not just me. Besides which, when I pray for myself, I may pray selfishly, asking for something that may directly benefit me but might also be harmful to others. If I sell ice cream, I want the sun to shine, but if I sell umbrellas, I want the rain to fall. Praying together, we seek the common good, not just personal help.
Communal prayer is more than an expression of community. It is also a builder of community. Hence the psychological cost of the pandemic lockdown. We are social, not solitary beings. We long, most of us, for company. And even the wonders of all the social media options (TikTok, Twitter, Zoom, YouTube, WhatsApp, Facetime, Facebook, etc.) cannot compensate for the loss of the real thing: face-to-face encounters.
But there was one gain to our praying in isolation. <i>Tefilla betzibbur</i> involves going at the speed of the congregation. It is hard to slow the pace so as to be able to meditate at length on any of the prayers themselves – their meaning, music, rhythm, and structure. Prayer is essentially a kind of counterpoint between speaking and listening. But communal prayer often involves more speaking than listening. The lockdown meant that we could listen more to the poetry and passion of the prayers themselves. And prayer is about listening, not just speaking.
Rabbi Yaakov Leiner, whose reflections on listening started us on this journey, said that the tragic month of Av is a time when it is hard to <i>see</i> the presence of God. We lost two Temples. It seemed to many that God may have abandoned His people. But precisely when it is hard to <i>see</i> the Divine Presence, we can focus on <i>listening</i>.
<b>I believe that listening is one of the greatest arts. It opens us to God, our fellow humans, and the beauties of nature. For me, one of the gifts of this strange, difficult time has been the ability to slow down the prayers so that I am able to listen to them speaking to me. Praying is as much about listening as speaking. And faith itself is the ability to hear the music beneath the noise.</b>
<b>QUESTION TO PONDER</b>
<i>Why is it important to slow down and listen? What do we need to listen to?</i>
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>Most civilisations have been cultures of the eye. Judaism, with its belief in the invisible God who transcends the universe, and its prohibition against visual representations of God, is supremely a civilisation of the ear. The patriarchs and prophets did not see God; they heard Him. Hence, the key verb in Judaism is <i>shema</i>, “listen.”
<b><i>The Koren Sacks Shalem Siddur,</i> 471</b>
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>What is the difference between hearing and listening and why is listening more important?
How does regular life sometimes get in the way of real “listening”?
How and why is Judaism a “civilisation of the ear”?
<b>EDUCATIONAL COMPANION TO THE QUESTIONS</b>
<b><i>IN A NUTSHELL</i></b><br>Until this point the Israelites had continual communication with God, through Moshe. All their needs and concerns were directly addressed. The  covenant of the Torah represents the relationship they will have once they enter the land of Israel, when they will transition to a new stage of independence and “normalisation.” Now is the time to remind them and renew their commitment to this covenant. The message of this <i>Covenant &amp; Conversation</i> essay adds another dimension to this need, at this moment in history. From now on, the Israelites will have to stop and intentionally listen to feel and hear God. So Moshe was giving them one last reminder of the future relationship that will be established once they enter the land, before their relationship with God would become solely their own responsibility.
<b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>Seeing tells us about the surface only, the externalities of things. Listening tells us about internalities, the depths of the thing. The saying “Don’t judge a book by its cover” captures this idea also. Don’t judge on external appearances. Spend some time actually listening to find the real depths of a person or subject.
Listening to God in an age when there are no prophets directly communicating God’s word is a challenge. It means we need to be more deliberate in listening for Him in nature, history, people, and within ourselves.
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br>Eliyahu performed a great public exhibition to show God’s power and greatness. But God is not only to be found in the dramatic miraculous demonstrations of His will and power, in biblical miracles such as this and like the other miracles found in the Torah (for example, the Ten Plagues and the splitting of the Red Sea). God can also be found in the quiet, natural spaces in our world, if we just take the time to look and listen for Him there.
Eliyahu chose to challenge the prophets of Baal in a dramatic and very public demonstration of God’s power on Mount Carmel. It was important to show the people that religious truth lay with Eliyahu and not the prophets of Baal. The fire descended from heaven and consumed Eliyahu’s offering in a visually impressive and powerful demonstration of God’s power. However, God does not want this to be the only expression of His presence in the world, and He needed to remind Eliyahu (and all future generations) that God can also be found in the still, small voice, wherever that is found, if we only listen for Him.
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>Our lives are hectic and busy and full of “noise.” If we don’t slow down and take a step back to “listen” we will miss the truth and beauty all around us. We need to actively listen to hear these things. They are all around us – in nature, in other people, in ourselves. The voice and spirit of God is present, if we only slow down and focus our attention so that we really listen.
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>Hearing is passive and it often happens when you are focused on something else. Listening is active. It requires careful focus, trying to listen and understand or connect with the source of the noise. Listening for something shows engagement and an interest in a relationship of some sort.
Regular life is busy and full of “noise.” This noise can get in the way of listening – actively looking to engage in what is important in life. The example Rabbi Sacks brings here is <i>tefilla</i>. Sometimes even the format of a <i>minyan</i> can prevent us from “listening” to our <i>tefillot</i>, as we struggle to match the pace of the community. The tragic impact of being prevented from praying with a <i>minyan</i> in <i>shul</i> does have a positive element – the chance for us to take the time to actually listen to the <i>tefillot</i> in a way we may find difficult in <i>minyan</i> in <i>shul</i>.
This is a quote from the commentary in the <i>Koren Sacks Siddur</i> (see <i>From the Thought of Rabbi Sacks</i> on page 331). Rabbi Sacks brings several stories from the Torah to illustrate this, including Yaakov tricking Yitzḥak to acquire Esav’s blessing, the names given to Yaakov’s first three sons, the choice of Moshe for leadership, and the themes of Moshe’s speeches in the book of Devarim. In his siddur, Rabbi Sacks also speaks about the importance of the key verse <i>“Shema Yisrael”</i> (“Listen Israel”) and what it tells us about Jewish faith.

II; A Nation of Storytellers

<big><strong>II. A Nation of Storytellers</strong></big><br><b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>Moshe spends most of the book of Devarim retelling the national story to the new generation, reminding them of what God had done for their parents and also of some of the mistakes their parents had made. Moshe, as well as being the great liberator, is the supreme storyteller. Yet what he does in <i>Parashat Ki Tavo</i> extends far beyond this.
He now tells the people that when they enter, conquer, and settle the land, they must bring the first ripened fruits to the central Sanctuary, the Temple, as a way of giving thanks to God. A mishna in Bikkurim describes the joyous scene as people came together in Jerusalem from across the country, bringing their first-fruits with music and celebration. Merely bringing the fruits, though, was not enough. Each person had to make a declaration. That declaration became one of the best-known passages in the Torah because, although it was originally said on Shavuot, the festival of first-fruits, in post-biblical times it became a central element of the Haggada on Seder night:
<i>“My father was a wandering Aramean, and he went down into Egypt and lived there, few in number, and there became a great nation, powerful and numerous. But the Egyptians ill-treated us and made us suffer, subjecting us to harsh labour. Then we cried out to the Lord, the God of our ancestors, and the Lord heard our voice and saw our misery, toil, and oppression. So the Lord brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm, with great terror and with signs and wonders”</i> (Devarim 26:5–8).
Here for the first time, the retelling of the nation’s history becomes an obligation for every citizen of the nation. In this act, known as <i>Viduy Bikkurim</i>, “the confession made over first-fruits,” Jews were commanded to become a nation of storytellers.
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. Do you like stories? Why?</i>
<i>2. Why do you think stories are so important to the Torah?</i>
<i>3. How does Judaism ensure that every single Jew can and does tell their nation’s story?</i>
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br><i>I grew up in a world very far from the world of Judaism. A world of Communism. I can’t remember when Father began to hold the Passover Seder at home. Perhaps only when he was released from prison, and without Mother. The very fact that the Seder was held in Soviet Russia in the 1960s was something special, even though there were certainly several thousand other Jews throughout the country who also kept the tradition. We didn’t possess a Haggada, so Father conducted the Seder from memory, and his memory didn’t betray him.</i>
<i>But that wasn’t, in my opinion, the most important thing. The uniqueness of my father’s Seder resided in the story of the Exodus from Egypt. Father would begin with the story of Adam and Ḥava, and end with the history of the revival of the people of Israel in the modern era. At the Seder table we learned it all. The Seder performed its function wonderfully, as our Sages foresaw: “And thou shall tell it to your child.” This wasn’t just an empty saying. Things that are said to the child, something of them will remain. I can testify about myself that I grew up as a Jew thanks to the story of our Exodus from Egypt.</i>
<b><i>A Hero of Jewish Freedom: A Modern Joseph’s Journey from Hijacker to Rabbi,</i> Yosef Mendelevich</b>
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. Why did Yosef’s father begin the story with Adam and Ḥava, and end with the modern State of Israel?</i>
<i>2. Why does Yosef believe that his Jewish identity was thanks to the story in the Haggada? Would you say the same about yourself?</i>
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>The great questions – “Who are we?” “Why are we here?” “What is our task?” – are best answered by telling a story. As Barbara Hardy put it: “We dream in narrative, daydream in narrative, remember, anticipate, hope, despair, believe, doubt, plan, revise, criticise, construct, gossip, learn, hate and love by narrative.” This is fundamental to understanding why Torah is the kind of book it is: not a theological treatise or a metaphysical system but a series of interlinked stories extended over time, from Avraham and Sara’s journey from Mesopotamia to Moshe and the Israelites’ wanderings in the desert. Judaism is less about truth as system than about truth as story. And we are part of that story. That is what it is to be a Jew.
The command to tell the national story when bringing the first-fruits is a remarkable development. Yosef Hayim Yerushalmi tells us that “only in Israel and nowhere else is the injunction to remember felt as a <i>religious imperative to an entire people</i>.”
The <i>Viduy Bikkurim</i> gives the entire history of the nation in summary form. In a few short sentences we have here “the patriarchal origins in Mesopotamia, the emergence of the Hebrew nation in the midst of history rather than in mythic prehistory, slavery in Egypt and liberation therefrom, the climactic acquisition of the land of Israel, and throughout – the acknowledgement of God as Lord of history.”
We should note here an important nuance. Jews were the first people to find God in history. They were the first to think in historical terms – seeing time as an arena of change as opposed to cyclical time in which the seasons rotate, people are born and die, again and again, with nothing really changing. Jews were the first people to write history – many centuries before Herodotus and Thucydides, often wrongly described as the first historians. Yet biblical Hebrew has no word that means “history” (the closest equivalent is <i>divrei hayamim</i>, “chronicles”). Instead it uses the root <i>zakhor</i>, meaning “memory.”
There is a fundamental difference between history and memory. History is “his story,” an account of events that happened sometime else to someone else. Memory is “my story.” It is the past internalised and made part of my identity. That is what the Mishna in Pesaḥim means when it says, “Each person must see it as if he or she personally went out of Egypt.”
Throughout Devarim, Moshe warns the people – no less than fourteen times – not to forget. If they forget the past they will lose their identity and sense of direction and disaster will follow. Moreover, not only are the people commanded to remember, they are also commanded to hand that memory on to their children.
This entire phenomenon represents a remarkable cluster of ideas: about identity as a matter of collective memory; about the ritual retelling of the nation’s story; above all, about the fact that <i>every one of us is a guardian of that story and memory.</i> It is not the leader alone, or some elite, who are trained to recall the past, but every one of us. This too is an aspect of the devolution and democratisation of leadership that we find throughout Judaism as a way of life. The great leaders tell the story of the group, but the greatest of leaders, Moshe, taught the group to become a nation of storytellers.
You can still see the power of this idea today. As I mention in my book <i>The Home We Build Together</i>, if you visit the presidential memorials in Washington, you will see that each one carries an inscription taken from their own words: Jefferson’s “We hold these truths to be self-evident...,” Roosevelt’s “The only thing we have to fear is fear itself,” Lincoln’s Gettysburg Address and his second Inaugural, “With malice toward none; with charity for all....” Each memorial tells a story.
London has no equivalent. It contains many memorials and statues, each with a brief inscription stating who it represents, but there are no speeches or quotations. There is no story. Even the memorial to Churchill, whose speeches rivalled Lincoln’s in power, carries only one word: <i>Churchill</i>.
America has a national story because it is a society based on the idea of covenant. Narrative is at the heart of covenantal politics because it locates national identity in a set of historic events. The memory of those events evokes the values for which those who came before us fought and of which we are the guardians.
A covenantal narrative is always inclusive, the property of all its citizens, newcomers as well as the home-born. It says to everyone, regardless of class or creed: This is who we are. It creates a sense of common identity that transcends other identities. That is why, for example, Martin Luther King was able to use it to such effect in some of his greatest speeches. He was telling his fellow African Americans to see themselves as an equal part of the nation. At the same time, he was telling white Americans to honour their commitment to the Declaration of Independence and its statement that “all men are created equal.”
England does not have the same kind of national narrative because it is based not on covenant but on hierarchy and tradition. England, writes Roger Scruton, “was not a nation or a creed or a language or a state but a home. Things at home don’t need an explanation. They are there because they are there.” England, historically, was a class-based society in which there were ruling elites who governed on behalf of the nation as a whole. America, founded by Puritans who saw themselves as a new Israel bound by covenant, was not a society of rulers and ruled, but rather one of collective responsibility. Hence the phrase, central to American politics but never used in English politics: “We, the people.”
By making the Israelites a nation of storytellers, Moshe helped turn them into a people bound by collective responsibility – to one another, to the past and future, and to God. By framing a narrative that successive generations would make their own and teach to their children, Moshe turned Jews into a nation of leaders.
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>Through the Haggada more than a hundred generations of Jews have handed on their story to their children. The word <i>haggada</i> means “relate,” “tell,” “expound.” But it is closely related to another Hebrew root that means “bind,” “join,” “connect.” By reciting the Haggada, Jews give their children a sense of connectedness to Jews throughout the world and to the Jewish people throughout time. The story connects them to a past and future, a history and destiny, and makes them characters in its drama. Every other nation known to humankind has been united because its members lived in the same place, spoke the same language, were part of the same culture. Jews alone, dispersed across continents, speaking different languages and participating in different cultures, have been bound together by a narrative, the Pesaḥ narrative, which they told in the same way on the same night. More than the Haggada is the story of a people, Jews are the people of a story.

<b>EDUCATIONAL COMPANION TO THE QUESTIONS</b>
<b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>Almost everyone likes stories, from very young children to adults. The stories we enjoy include the ones we read in books, papers, and magazines, watch in movies and television shows, and even see in social media. We rely on stories to understand our own identities and the world around us.
Stories are an effective way to transmit meaning and identity. The Torah is not a dry, comprehensive legal code or a purely historical record, but rather a collection of stories through which the Jewish people understand their national past and create a future, an identity, and a moral and spiritual system through which to interpret the world. Stories can also be related to at every developmental stage, from the youngest child to the oldest, most scholarly adult. It is the ultimate pedagogy for transmitting national identity and values.
These verses, a simple telling of the Jewish narrative, became the core story told on Seder night every year at Pesaḥ. All Jews find themselves at a Seder table sometime during their lives, participating in the telling of this story. This is to ensure the national narrative is passed on to every Jewish child. It ensures that every Jewish parent becomes a master educator – a storyteller par excellence.
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br>He saw the Seder night as an opportunity to expand on the Exodus story, and incorporated the whole of Jewish history, ensuring his family received the entire Jewish story (not just the Exodus). For him, that was what Pesaḥ was all about, and in Soviet Russia, when it was dangerous and challenging to be a Jew, it became even more important to make sure that the story of our identity was transmitted to the next generation.
The Haggada is the story of the Jews, and at the core of Seder night is what it means to be a Jew. It is one of the reasons the Jewish people have maintained their sense of identity through thousands of years of exile. Yosef went on to become a refusenik (barred from immigrating to Israel) and spent three years in prison in Russia after he became an observant Jew and was caught celebrating Shabbat. He eventually was allowed to immigrate to Israel and he became a well-known rabbi. A discussion of this could reveal how you and others find Seder night impactful on your own Jewish identity.
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>The word <i>haggada</i> comes from the same root as the word <i>lehagid</i>, “to tell.” But it also means to bind, join, or connect. Other nations achieve this through being in a common location/land, having a common language and culture. The Jewish people have experienced two thousand years of exile, which has led to the loss of these things. The national narrative has replaced them as the core factor protecting Jewish unity and survival.
The Haggada is the minimum, and for many Jews it has managed to keep them feeling connected even when a lot of other aspects of their lifestyle are separate from Judaism. A broader education and strength of family and community are other factors that have also achieved Jewish continuity.
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>It is the responsibility of a nation’s leader to ensure that the nation’s narrative is passed on to future generations. A national narrative protects national identity and values. A good leader gives the people these through retelling the story of the nation.
History is the story that does not belong to us. It may be interesting and valuable to learn from, but it is not part of our own identity. Memory is our own story and our own identity. It is personal, and it is the basis for who we are and for the national identity we transfer to the next generation. Judaism is concerned with this transmission, and therefore places great significance on ritual and education in order to ensure the next generation receives the national memory, and with it, their own identity.
America has a national story because it is a society based on the idea of covenant. Narrative is at the heart of covenantal politics because it locates national identity in a set of historic events. The memory of those events evokes the values for which those who came before us fought and of which we are the guardians. England does not have the same kind of national narrative because it is based not on covenant but on hierarchy and tradition.

Nitzavim

In a Nutshell

<b><i>IN A NUTSHELL</i></b><br>In <i>Nitzavim,</i> Moshe brings the entire people together – leaders, tribes, elders, officials, children, women, and strangers – to renew their commitment to the covenant before they enter the land of Israel. He also warns them that their future depends on whether they keep the covenant. If they break it, they will suffer defeat, destruction, and exile. But even then, Hashem will still keep His promises. Even during exile, if the people find their way back to God, He will return to them and bring them back to their land. The choice will always be ours. Therefore, “Choose life, that you and your children may live” (Devarim 30:19).
<b>QUESTION TO PONDER</b>
<i>Why is it important to note that all the people were present to hear this final speech from Moshe?</i>

I; Why Be Jewish?

<big><strong>I. Why Be Jewish?</strong></big><br><b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>In the last days of his life Moshe renews the covenant between God and Israel. The entire book of Devarim has been an account of the covenant – how it came about, what its terms and conditions are, why it is the core of Israel’s identity as an <i>am kadosh</i>, a holy people, and so on. Now comes the moment of renewal itself, a national rededication to the terms of its existence as a holy people under the sovereignty of God Himself.
Moshe, however, is careful not to limit his words to those who are actually present. About to die, he wants to ensure that no future generation can say, “Moshe made a covenant with our ancestors but not with us. We didn’t give our consent. We are not bound.” To preclude this, he says these words:
“It is <i>not with you alone</i> that I am making this sworn covenant, but with whoever is standing here with us today before the Lord our God, and <i>with whoever is not here</i> with us today” (Devarim 29:13–14).
As the commentators point out, the phrase “whoever is not here” cannot refer to Israelites alive at the time who happened to be somewhere else. That condition would not have been necessary since the entire nation was assembled there. Moshe can only mean “generations not yet born.” The covenant bound all Jews from that day to this. As the Talmud says: We are all <i>mushba ve’omed meHar Sinai</i>, “foresworn from Sinai” (Yoma 73b, Nedarim 8a). By agreeing to be God’s people, subject to God’s laws, our ancestors obligated us all.
Hence one of the most fundamental facts about Judaism. Converts excepted, we do not choose to be Jews. We are born as Jews. We become legal adults, subject to the commands and responsible for our actions, at the age of twelve for girls, thirteen for boys. But we are part of the covenant from birth. A bat or bar mitzva is not a “confirmation.” It involves no voluntary acceptance of Jewish identity. That choice took place more than three thousand years ago when Moshe said, “It is <i>not with you alone</i> that I am making this sworn covenant, but with…<i>whoever is not here</i> with us today,” meaning all future generations, including us.
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. Is it fair that we are born Jews and have no say in whether we want to be part of the Jewish people?</i>
<i>2. What else is decided for us before we are born? What choices do we have in life or is everything predetermined for us from birth?</i>
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br>In May 2016, Rabbi Sacks was awarded the prestigious Templeton Prize. At the award ceremony, Rabbi Sacks’s daughter, Gila Sacks, surprised him by giving a moving and personal speech about what she and her siblings had learned from their parents. This is an excerpt.
<i>I was asked to say a few words about what my father taught us, his children. I thought that would be easy. But it turns out that it is next to impossible to separate what a parent has taught you from the “you” that you are. To know where to start; to find the words. So let me just tell you three things about our dad.</i>
<i>Ben Zoma famously asks in the Mishna (Avot 4:1): “Who is wise? One who learns from everyone.” And that’s the first thing I want to tell you about my father. He learns and learns and learns from everyone. His excitement about discovering new ideas, meeting somebody interesting, and discovering a great book hasn’t lessened with time in any way. The more he knows, the more he wants to learn. He is absolutely committed to learning everything, to seeing all knowledge as important, to taking as seriously a conversation about business as one about ethics or science or art, to taking the search for excellence in any field seriously. When I was younger, no matter what I was studying at school or university, no matter what the essay topic, if I mentioned it to my dad, he would immediately walk over to the bookcase and pick out the exact book I needed. He learns from everyone. And we learned this from him.</i>
<i>Ben Zoma continues: “Who is rich? One who is happy with what he has.” When I thought about my father and what he has taught me, I don’t think I expected happiness to be what came to mind. I’m not sure his happiness is what most immediately stands out about him or what many people see.</i>
<i>And yet, the more I thought about it, the more I realised that he has, in fact, taught me some crucial things about how to be happy. He taught me that happiness is as much something we choose as something we find. That it can be hard work, but it can be worked at. And I learned from the happiness he finds in the world, even when the world is a difficult place to be. His joy at a beautiful view, a great walk, a moving piece of music. His undiminishing joy in spending simple happy times with my mum, and the happiness he gets from each of his grandchildren.</i>
<i>To be happy with what one has, teaches Ben Zoma, does not mean settling for what you have – but rather finding happiness where you are, enjoying the fruits of this world each day. And that is the second thing we learned from my father, and perhaps something he also learns from us.</i>
<i>Thirdly, and most importantly of all, we have learned from his faith; not just in God, but in the ability and responsibility of each of us to make a difference in some way. Not to accept the world as we find it, but to always believe it can be different. And to believe that there is no reason at all that that difference can’t be something to do with us.</i>
<i>This was not for us some grand calling to go out and change the world. It was simply a way of looking at the world, to always see in it the potential for good, the potential for change. And to always see ourselves as having the ability to make a difference, that we must never be passive observers.</i>
<i>My father’s faith – in the ability of things to change and of people to change them – is what I am most grateful for.</i>
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. What do you think is the most important thing for parents to pass on to their children?</i>
<i>2. What are the most important lessons you have learned from your parents?</i>
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>But how can all future generations be bound by the covenant at Sinai? Surely a fundamental principle of Judaism is that <i>there is no obligation without consent</i>. How can we be bound by an agreement to which we were not parties? How can we be subject to a covenant on the basis of a decision taken long ago and far away by our distant ancestors?
The Sages, after all, raised a similar question about the wilderness generation in the days of Moshe who were actually there and did give their assent. The Talmud suggests that they were not entirely free to say no.
The Holy One, blessed be He, suspended the mountain over them like a barrel and said: “If you say yes, all will be well, but if you say no, this will be your burial place” (Shabbat 88b).
On this, R. Aḥa bar Yaakov said: “This constitutes a fundamental challenge to the legitimacy of the covenant.” The Talmud replies that even though the agreement may not have been entirely free at the time, Jews asserted their consent voluntarily in the days of Aḥashverosh, as suggested by the book of Esther.
This is not the place to discuss this particular passage, but the essential point is clear. The Sages believed with great force that an agreement must be made freely in order to be binding. Yet we did not agree to be Jews. We were, most of us, born Jews. We were not there in Moshe’s day when the agreement was made. We did not yet exist. How then can we be bound by the covenant?
This is not a small question. It is the question on which all others turn. How can Jewish identity be passed on from parent to child? If Jewish identity were merely racial or ethnic, we could understand it. We inherit many things from our parents – most obviously our genes. But being Jewish is not a genetic condition, it is a set of religious obligations. There is a halakhic principle: “<i>Zakhin le’adam shelo befanav</i>,” “You can confer a benefit on someone else without their knowledge or consent” (Ketubbot 11a). And though it is doubtless a benefit to be a Jew, it is also in some sense a liability, a restriction on our range of legitimate choices, with grave consequences if we transgress. Had we not been Jewish, we could have worked on Shabbat, eaten non-kosher food, and so on. You can confer a benefit upon someone without their consent, <i>but not a liability.</i>
In short, this is the question of questions of Jewish identity. How can we be bound by Jewish law, without our choice, merely because our ancestors agreed on our behalf?
In my book <i>Radical Then, Radical Now/A Letter in the Scroll</i>, I pointed out how fascinating it is to trace exactly when and where this question was asked. Despite the fact that everything else depends on it, it was not asked often. For the most part, Jews did not ask the question, “Why be Jewish?” The answer was obvious. My parents are Jewish. My grandparents were Jewish. So I am Jewish. Identity is something most people in most ages take for granted.
It did, however, become an issue during the Babylonian exile. The prophet Yeḥezkel says, “What is in your mind shall never happen – the thought, ‘Let us be like the nations, like the tribes of the countries, and worship wood and stone’” (Yeḥezkel 20:32). This is the first reference to Jews actively seeking to abandon their identity.
It happened again in rabbinic times. We know that in the second century BCE there were Jews who Hellenised, seeking to become Greek rather than Jewish. There were others who, under Roman rule, sought to become Roman. Some even underwent an operation known as <i>epispasm</i> to reverse the effects of circumcision (in Hebrew they were known as <i>meshukhim</i>) to hide the fact that they were Jews.
The third time was in Spain in the fifteenth century. That is where we find two Bible commentators, Rabbi Isaac Arama and Rabbi Isaac Abarbanel, raising precisely the question we have raised about how the covenant can bind Jews today. The reason they ask it while earlier commentators did not was that in their time – between 1391 and 1492 – there was immense pressure on Spanish Jews to convert to Christianity, and as many as a third may have done so (they were known in Hebrew as the <i>anusim</i>, in Spanish as the <i>conversos</i>, and derogatively as <i>marranos</i>, “swine”). The question “Why stay Jewish?” was real.
The answers given were different at different times. Yeḥezkel’s answer was blunt: “As I live, declares the Lord God, surely with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm and with wrath poured out I will be King over you” (Yeḥezkel 20:33). In other words, Jews might try to escape their destiny but they would fail. Even if it were against their will, they would always be known as Jews. That, tragically, is what happened during the two great ages of assimilation, fifteenth-century Spain and in Europe in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. In both cases, racial antisemitism persisted, and Jews continued to be persecuted.
The Sages answered the question mystically. They said that even the souls of Jews not yet born were present at Sinai and ratified the covenant (Shemot Rabba 28:6). Every Jew, in other words, <i>did</i> give their consent in the days of Moshe even though they had not yet been born. Demystifying this, perhaps the Sages meant that in their innermost hearts, even the most assimilated Jews knew that they were Jewish. That seems to have been the case with public figures like Heinrich Heine and Benjamin Disraeli, who lived as Christians but often wrote and thought as Jews.
The fifteenth-century Spanish commentators found this answer problematic. As Arama said, we are each of us both body and soul. How then is it sufficient to say that our soul was present at Sinai? How can the soul obligate the body? Of course the <i>soul</i> agrees to the covenant. Spiritually, to be a Jew is a privilege, and you can confer a privilege on someone without their consent. But for the body, the covenant is a burden. It involves all sorts of restrictions on physical pleasures. Therefore, if the souls of future generations were present but not their bodies, this would not constitute consent.
<i>Radical Then, Radical Now/A Letter in the Scroll</i> is my answer to this question. But perhaps there is a simpler one. Not every obligation that binds us is one to which we have freely given our assent. There are obligations that come with birth. The classic example is a crown prince or princess. To be the heir to a throne involves a set of duties and a life of service to others. It is possible to neglect these duties. In extreme circumstances it is even possible for a monarch to abdicate. But no one can choose to be heir to a throne. That is a fate, a destiny, that comes with birth.
The people of whom God Himself said, “My child, My firstborn, Israel” (Shemot 4:22) knows itself to be royalty. That may be a privilege. It may be a burden. It is almost certainly both. It is a peculiar post-Enlightenment delusion to think that the only significant things about us are those we choose. For the truth is that we do not choose some of the most important facts about ourselves. We did not choose to be born. We did not choose our parents. We did not choose the time and place of our birth. Yet each of these affects who we are and what we are called on to do.
We are part of a story that began long before we were born and will continue long after we are no longer here, and the question for all of us is: Will we continue the story? The hopes of a hundred generations of our ancestors rest on our willingness to do so. Deep in our collective memory the words of Moshe continue to resonate. “It <i>is not with you alone</i> that I am making this sworn covenant, but with…<i>whoever is not here</i> with us today.”<b></b> That means us. <b>I believe we are each a key player in this story. We can live it. We can abandon it. But it is a choice we cannot avoid, and it has immense consequences. The future of the covenant rests with us.</b>
<b>QUESTION TO PONDER</b>
<i>How will you continue the story?</i>
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>The fact that any of us is born a Jew is no mere fact. It happened because more than a hundred generations of our ancestors decided to be Jews and hand on that identity to their children, thus writing the most remarkable story of continuity ever known…. Jews knew that theirs was the work of many generations and that therefore they must hand on their ideals to their children so that they too would be part of the journey, letters in the scroll. To be a Jew, now as in the days of Moshe, is to hear the call of those who came before us and know that we are the guardians of their story….
I am a Jew because, knowing the story of my people, I hear their call to write the next chapter. I did not come from nowhere; I have a past, and if any past commands anyone, this past commands me. I am a Jew because only if I remain a Jew will the story of a hundred generations live on in me. I continue their journey because, having come thus far, I may not let it and them fail. I cannot be the missing letter in the scroll.

What are the biggest challenges you face to remain Jewish today?
Do you feel a responsibility to previous generations? Do you feel a responsibility to future generations?
<b>EDUCATIONAL COMPANION TO THE QUESTIONS</b>
<b><i>IN A NUTSHELL</i></b><br>This last speech involved a renewing of the covenant, including Moshe delivering the final two mitzvot of the Torah – <i>Hak’hel</i> and writing a <i>sefer Torah</i> (which are both a way to continue the process of commitment to the covenant). It is critical that we realise that the entire people were present, just as they were present at the original covenant event (the giving of the Torah on Mount Sinai) because the covenant is for all the people. It is a statement of inclusivity.
<b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>We are born with a lot of identities that we have no say about until we become adults (when we can choose to reject or take on new identities). Every parent has the right and responsibility to bring their children up within a specific tradition and to cultivate specific identities. (They also have the right to give their children the space to question these and empower them to build their own identities if they so wish.) The question is what we as children decide to do with these identities when we reach adulthood and can make decisions for ourselves.
We cannot choose which family, nation, or religious identity we are born into. We can however decide what these are going to mean to us, and what we are going to do with these identities. Later in life we can also decide to embrace other identities, including professional and cultural, and even change national and religious identities if we so wish. But when we are young these things are largely decided for us.
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br>As parents we pass on so many important things to our children, including identity, values, and education. (These are in addition to the other needs a child has that it is a parent’s responsibility to provide, including their physical and emotional well-being, and most important of all – love!)
This could be a really interesting discussion to have as a family around your Shabbat table!
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>Rabbi Sacks spoke and wrote often about each and every Jew being a “letter in the scroll” and our responsibility to write a chapter in the book of the Jewish story. He expands on this idea fully in his book <i>A Letter in the Scroll</i>.
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>There are many ways to approach a commitment to Torah and the covenant. For some, it is the word of God and therefore there is no question at all that it should be followed and fully committed to. For others, the Torah represents the highest values a human can live by and they are left with no question as to why they should be committed to it, and they connect to a Jewish national mission that is to improve the world. For yet others, they hear the call to responsibility, to continue the chain of tradition and transmission, to our ancestors, and to our future descendants. What do the people around your Shabbat table feel is the most compelling reason to be Jewish?
There are always challenges to being a Jew. These could be antisemitism and other social forces in society, including the desire to assimilate and fit in. Some people feel there are intellectual challenges to living a Torah lifestyle. And others struggle with their faith. Rabbi Sacks describes specific time periods in history when living as a Jew was difficult. Do you think the current day is another such time period?
Some people feel a responsibility to previous generations, whether more recent (parents and grandparents) or more distant (the unbroken chain of tradition until this point). Some people feel a sense of responsibility to future generations, and to not being a broken link in the chain. It is interesting to hear different perspectives from the different ages present around your Shabbat table.

II; Not Beyond the Sea

<big><strong>II. Not Beyond the Sea</strong></big><br><b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>There have been many times throughout Jewish history when Jews have been tempted by other religions and cultures. In <i>Parashat Nitzavim</i>, Moshe forewarned us:
<i>“Now what I am commanding you today is not too difficult for you or beyond your reach. It is not in heaven, so that you have to ask, ‘Who will ascend into heaven to get it so we can listen to it and obey it?’ Nor is it beyond the sea, so that you have to ask, ‘Who will cross the sea to get it so we can listen to it and obey it?’ No, the word is very near you; it is in your mouth and in your heart so you may obey it”</i> (Devarim 30:11–14).
Moshe sensed prophetically that in the future, Jews would mistakenly imagine that to find inspiration we might need to search far and wide, beyond Judaism.
The beauty of Jewish spirituality is the idea that God is always close. You do not need to climb a mountain or seek a far-off place of solitude to find the Divine Presence. It is right there around the table at a Shabbat meal, in the light of the candles and the simple holiness of the Kiddush wine and the <i>ḥallot</i>, in the praise of the <i>Eishet Ḥayil</i> and the blessing of children, in the peace of mind that comes when you leave the world to look after itself for a day while you celebrate the good things that come not from working but resting, not from buying but enjoying – the gifts you have had all along but did not have time to appreciate.
In Judaism, God is close. He is there in the poetry of our Tehillim, the greatest literature of the soul ever written. He is there listening in to our debates as we study a page of the Talmud or offer new interpretations of ancient texts. He is there in the joy of the festivals, the tears of Tisha B’Av, the echoes of the shofar of Rosh HaShana, and the appeals of Yom Kippur. He is there in the very air of the land of Israel and the stones of Jerusalem, where the oldest of the old and the newest of the new mingle together like close friends.
God is near. Judaism needed no cathedrals, no monasteries, no abstract philosophies – beautiful though all these are – because for us God is the God of everyone and everywhere, who has time for each of us, and who meets us where we are, if we are willing to open our soul to Him.

I asked where is He to be found, not where He is.” The students looked at the rabbi with more confusion and exasperation. “Did we not already say that He is everywhere?” “No, no,” the Kotzker Rebbe smiled at them. “You must understand that God is to be found in the place where you open up your hearts and let Him in!”</i>

<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>For much of Israel’s history, Jews would say that to find inspiration we have to ascend to heaven or cross the sea. It is anywhere but here. So it was for much of Israel’s history during the First and Second Temple periods. First came the era in which the people were tempted by the gods of the people around them: the Canaanite Baal, the Moabite Kemosh, or Merodak and Ashtarot in Babylon. Later, in Second Temple times, they were attracted to Hellenism in its Greek or Roman forms. Jews have long had a tendency to fall in love with people who do not love them and pursue almost any spiritual path so long as it is not their own. But it is very debilitating.
When great minds leave Judaism, Judaism loses great minds. When those in search of spirituality go elsewhere, Jewish spirituality suffers. And this tends to happen in precisely the paradoxical way that Moshe describes several times in Devarim. It occurs in ages of affluence, not poverty, in eras of freedom, not slavery. When we seem to have little to thank God for, we thank God. But when we have much to be grateful for, we forget.
The eras in which Jews worshipped idols or became Hellenised were Temple times when Jews lived in their land, enjoying either sovereignty or autonomy. The age in which, in Europe, they abandoned Judaism was the period of Emancipation, from the late eighteenth to the early twentieth centuries, when for the first time they enjoyed civil rights.
The result was that many talented Jews enriched other cultures more than their own. Part of Mahler’s “Eighth Symphony” is a Catholic mass. Irving Berlin, son of a <i>ḥazan</i>, wrote “White Christmas.” Felix Mendelssohn, grandson of one of the first “enlightened” Jews, Moses Mendelssohn, composed church music and rehabilitated Bach’s long-neglected “St. Matthew Passion.” Simone Weil, one of the deepest Christian thinkers of the twentieth century – described by Albert Camus as “the only great spirit of our times” – was born to Jewish parents. So was Edith Stein, celebrated by the Catholic Church as a saint and martyr, but murdered in Auschwitz because to the Nazis she was a Jew. And so on.
The surrounding culture in most of these cases was hostile to Jews and Judaism. Yet Jews often preferred to adopt the culture that rejected them rather than embrace the one that was theirs by birth and inheritance, where they had the chance of feeling at home. The results were often tragic.
Becoming Baal worshippers did not lead to Israelites being welcomed by the Canaanites. Becoming Hellenised did not endear Jews to either the Greeks or the Romans. Abandoning Judaism in the nineteenth century did not end antisemitism; it inflamed it.
Was it the failure of Europe to accept the Jewishness of Jews and Judaism? Was it Judaism’s failure to confront the challenge? The phenomenon is so complex it defies any simple explanation. But in the process, we lost great art, great intellect, great spirits and minds.
To some extent, the situation has changed both in Israel and in the Diaspora. There has been much new Jewish music and a revival of Jewish mysticism. There have been important Jewish writers and thinkers. But we still spiritually underachieve. Because we look around, and forget to look within. Hence the power of Moshe’s insistence: to find truth, beauty, and spirituality, you do not have to go elsewhere. “The word is very near you; it is in your mouth and in your heart so you may obey it.”
The deepest roots of spirituality come from within: from within a culture, a tradition, a sensibility. They come from the syntax and semantics of the native language of the soul: “The word is very near you; it is in your mouth and in your heart so you may obey it.”
I am a rabbi. For many years I was a chief rabbi. But in the end I think it was we, the rabbis, who did not do enough to help people open their doors, their minds, and their feelings to the Presence-beyond-the-universe-who-created-us-in-love that our ancestors knew so well and loved so much. We were afraid – of the intellectual challenges of an aggressively secular culture, of the social challenges of being in, yet not entirely of, the world, of the emotional challenge of finding Jews or Judaism or the State of Israel criticised and condemned. So we retreated behind a high wall, thinking that made us safe. High walls never make you safe; they only make you fearful. What makes you safe is confronting the challenges without fear and inspiring others to do likewise.
What Moshe meant in those extraordinary words, “It is not in heaven…nor is it beyond the sea,” was: <i>Kinderlach</i>, your parents trembled when they heard the voice of God at Sinai. They were overwhelmed. They said: If we hear any more we will die. So God found ways in which you could meet Him without being overwhelmed. Yes, He is Creator, sovereign, supreme power, first cause, mover of the planets and the stars. But He is also parent, partner, lover, friend. He is <i>Shekhina</i>, from <i>shakhen</i>, meaning the neighbour next door.
So thank Him every morning for the gift of life. Say the <i>Shema</i> twice daily for the gift of love. Join your voice to others in prayer so that His spirit may flow through you, giving you the strength and courage to change the world. When you cannot see Him, it is because you are looking in the wrong direction. When He seems absent, He is there just behind you, but you have to turn to meet Him.
Do not treat Him like a stranger. He loves you. He believes in you. He wants your success. To find Him you do not have to climb to heaven or cross the sea. His is the voice you hear in the silence of the soul. His is the light you see when you open your eyes to wonder. His is the hand you touch in the pit of despair. His is the breath that gives you life.
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>This is how I have sought God: Not through philosophical proofs, scientific demonstrations, or theological arguments; not through miracles or mysteries or inner voices or sudden epiphanies; not by ceasing to question or challenge or doubt; not by blind faith or existential leap; certainly not by an abandonment of reason and an embrace of the irrational. These things have brought many people to God. But they have also brought many people to worship things that are not God, like power, or ideology, or race. Instead I have sought God in people – people who in themselves seemed to point to something or someone beyond themselves…over the years I have learned to find it so much more widely in communities that care, in the kindness of strangers, in people who touch our lives, perhaps only momentarily, doing the deed or saying the word that carries us to safety across the abyss of loneliness or self-doubt.
It’s where I find God in Jewish history…. I find no way of accounting for this in terms of what Jews were, or where they lived, or what happened to them. Somehow they were touched by a sense of destiny, a vision of God and the world, that transfigured them – even at times against their will – into a people that defied the normal rules of the decline and fall of civilisations. Their very existence seemed to testify to something vast and unfathomable that knowingly or otherwise they carried in their midst. They became what Yeshayahu called “God’s witnesses.” Their history, their survival against the odds, their intellectual flights and utopian endeavours, became a signal of transcendence.

<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. Where does Rabbi Sacks see God most clearly? How does this perspective compare to the examples he gave in</i> The Core Idea<i>?</i>
<i>2. Do you struggle to find God sometimes? When is it most difficult?</i>
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>Why do you think people are sometimes tempted by religions that are not their own?
Do you think Judaism has everything a person would need to find spirituality and God?
Which approaches to Judaism do you think have tried to make God the most accessible?
<b>EDUCATIONAL COMPANION TO THE QUESTIONS</b>
<b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>The examples are: Shabbat rituals and meals; in the poetry of Tehillim and the debates on the pages of the Talmud; in the joy of the festivals; in the sadness of Tisha B’Av; and in the land of Israel. These are all intimate moments of Jewish ritual when we focus on finding God in the everyday (or in history). What is most important is that these opportunities are accessible to all, not just the very wise or spiritual or old or people in a specific location.
Take a moment to read the famous story about the Kotzker Rebbe in <i>It Once Happened</i>. God can be found anywhere and everywhere – but only if you look for Him and are open to seeing Him there.
Traditionally, synagogues are simple and practical buildings. While they are often elegant, they are rarely grand and opulent (and where they are built like this, it is possible to argue the design has been influenced by the surrounding non-Jewish religious culture). There may be many socio-historical explanations for this, but a socio-religious explanation is that Judaism encourages Jews to see God all around, not just in grand and majestic places. God can be found, approached, and worshipped in all places.
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br>Philosophically, we say that God is infinite and omnipresent. He cannot be defined or limited to physical terms. Therefore, He is “everywhere.”
The Kotzker Rebbe’s lesson to his students was more spiritual than philosophical. You will only find God in places where you are willing to seek Him, and find Him. He will be anywhere you will allow Him to be – by letting Him in. This means we can find God in the mundane and everyday, if we allow Him to be seen there.
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>Rabbi Sacks wrote that he also found God in people and in Jewish history, and these are places he looked for divine and spiritual inspiration. These are similar to the examples given in <i>The Core Idea</i> in that they are accessible to everyone every day. If you take the Kotzker Rebbe’s advice to heart (see <i>It Once Happened</i>) then you can find God in everything. All people are created in God’s image and have the potential to live their lives in that way, and Jewish history is so remarkable that it is hard to explain it in any other way than divinely ordained.
When we suffer, and we think of the many dark periods of Jewish history, it can be a challenge to find God’s presence. But few of us have encountered truly evil people with no sense of the divine at all. And for some, the dark periods of our lives, and of Jewish history, are what make the triumphs and the miracle of Jewish survival and continuity so obviously of divine design.
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>It is always a temptation to be more like those around us, allowing us to fit in to society more easily. Also, sometimes that which is familiar to us becomes boring and unengaging. So people will sometimes try to find other cultures and religions to provide them with what they feel is missing from their own.
Judaism is not monolithic. There is tremendous room for spiritual creativity and innovation, even within the clear boundaries of traditions and Jewish law. The core spiritual needs of Jews can be provided for by Judaism.
While there have been in Jewish history some schools of thought that have created an elitist approach to the worship of God and to spirituality, such as the priestly cult of the Sadducees in Temple times, and the Lithuanian yeshiva world of the nineteenth century, Judaism has always believed in universal spirituality. Worship of God through halakhic observance (the Pharisees) and Hasidism in more modern times are examples of more accessible approaches to finding God.

In a Nutshell

<b><i>IN A NUTSHELL</i></b><br><i>Vayelekh</i> is the shortest <i>parasha</i> in the Torah, only thirty verses long. Moshe speaks with great emotion, telling the people, “I am now 120 years old, and I can no longer go out and come in” (Devarim 31:2). He cannot lead them across the Jordan and into the Promised Land. He calls his successor, Yehoshua, and, in front of all the people, gives him words of support.
Next, God speaks privately to Moshe and Yehoshua, warning them that the Israelites may eventually break the covenant. He commands them to write down the Torah and teach it to the people, as a permanent record of the covenant itself. God then encourages Yehoshua, reassuring him that He will be with him as he leads the people.

I; How to Renew a Nation

<big><strong>I. How to Renew a Nation</strong></big><br><b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>There are 613 mitzvot in the Torah, but the numerical value of the word Torah is only 611. The Talmud suggests one answer to this difficulty: Moshe gave us 611 commands, while the other two – “I am the Lord your God” and “You shall have no other gods beside Me” (the first two of the Ten Commandments) – the Israelites received not from Moshe but directly from God Himself.
But a possible second answer is that there are 611 commands, and at the very end of the Torah, <i>Parashat Vayelekh</i>, there are two all-encompassing <i>meta</i>-<i>commands,</i> commands <i>about</i> the commands. They are <i>Hak’hel</i>, the command to assemble the people every seven years for a public reading of the Torah, and the command to write, or take part in writing, our own <i>sefer Torah</i>.
These two commands are set apart from all the others. They are inserted into the story in which Moshe hands on leadership to his successor Yehoshua. The connection is that both these two laws and the story are about <i>continuity</i>. The laws are intended to ensure that the Torah will never grow old, will be written afresh in every generation, will never be forgotten by the people, and will never stop being its guiding document as a nation. The nation will never abandon its founding principles, its history and identity, its connection to the past and its responsibility to the future.
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. What similarities and differences are there between these two mitzvot?</i>
<i>2. Do we still have these mitzvot? Are there other traditions we follow to achieve the same goals?</i>
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br><i>On a bright, crisp winter morning on January 20, 2009, Barack Obama was sworn in as the forty-fourth president of the United States of America, the first African American to hold that office. It was a historic moment, and the almost two million people who crowded around the Washington Monument – the largest crowd ever gathered in America for a political event – were intensely aware of this. The nation that had fought a civil war over the abolition of slavery had finally conferred its highest office onto, as Obama put it, “a man whose father, less than sixty years ago, might not have been served at a local restaurant.”</i>
<i>It was a redemptive moment. Obama’s inaugural address touched on the many problems facing America and the world. But at the same time it followed the protocol – the language, imagery, and key ideas – of almost every other Presidential Inaugural Address since Washington’s first in 1789. What Barack Obama was doing was something that sets America’s political culture apart from all others in the world. He was renewing the covenant, a form of politics born in the Torah.</i>
<b><i>Future Tense</i>, 155</b>
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. What covenant was President Obama “renewing” with the American people?</i>
<i>2. How is this story connected to our</i> parasha<i>?</i>
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>There is a beautiful complementarity between these two commands of <i>Hak’hel</i> and of writing a <i>sefer Torah</i>. <i>Hak’hel</i>, the national assembly, is directed at the people as a totality. Writing a <i>sefer Torah</i> is directed at individuals. This is the essence of covenantal politics. We have individual responsibility and we have collective responsibility. In Hillel’s words, “If I am not for myself, who will be, but if I am only for myself, what am I?” In Judaism, the state is not all, as it is in authoritarian regimes. Nor is the individual all, as it is in the radically individualist liberal democracies of today. A covenantal society is made by each accepting responsibility for all, by individuals committing themselves to the common good. Hence the <i>sefer Torah</i> – our written constitution as a nation – must be renewed in the life of the individual (mitzva 613) and of the nation (mitzva 612).
This is how the Torah describes the mitzva of <i>Hak’hel</i>:
<i>“At the end of every seven years, in the year for cancelling debts, during the Festival of Tabernacles, when all of Israel comes to appear before the Lord your God at the place He will choose, you shall read this Torah before them in their hearing. Assemble the people</i> – <i>men, women, and children, and the strangers in your towns</i> – <i>so they can listen and learn to revere the Lord your God and follow carefully all the words of this Torah. Their children, who do not know, shall hear it and learn to fear the Lord your God”</i> (Devarim 31:10–13).
Note the inclusivity of the event. It would be anachronistic to say that the Torah was egalitarian in the contemporary sense. Yet the Torah regarded it as essential that women, children, and strangers should be included in the ceremony of citizenship in the republic of faith.
Who performed the reading? The Torah does not specify, but tradition ascribed the role to the king. That was extremely important. To be sure, the Torah separates religion and politics. The king was not high priest, and the high priest was not king. This was revolutionary. In almost every other ancient society, the head of state was also the head of the religion, as part of the pagan vision of religion as power. But although he was not the spiritual leader, the king of Israel was bound by the Torah. He was commanded to have a special Torah scroll written for him; he was to keep it with him when he sat on the throne and read it “all the days of his life” (Devarim 17:18–20). And by reading the Torah to the assembled people every seven years, he was showing that the nation as a political entity existed under the sacred canopy of the divine word. We are a people, the king was implicitly saying, formed by covenant. If we keep it, we will flourish; if not, we will fail.
This is how Rambam describes the actual ceremony:
“Trumpets were blown throughout Jerusalem to assemble the people, and a high platform, made of wood, was brought and set up in the centre of the Court of Women. The king went up and sat there so that his reading might be heard…. The <i>ḥazan</i> of the synagogue would take a <i>sefer Torah</i> and hand it to the head of the synagogue, and the head of the synagogue would hand it to the deputy high priest, and the deputy high priest to the high priest, and the high priest to the king, to honour him by the service of many persons…. The king would read the sections we have mentioned until he would come to the end. Then he would roll up the <i>sefer Torah</i> and recite a blessing after the reading, the way it is recited in the synagogue…. Converts who did not know Hebrew were required to direct their hearts and listen with utmost awe and reverence, as on the day the Torah was given at Sinai. Even great scholars who knew the entire Torah were required to listen with utmost attention…. Each had to regard himself as if he had been charged with the Torah now for the first time, and as though he had heard it from the mouth of God, for the king was an ambassador proclaiming the words of God.”
Apart from giving us a sense of the grandeur of the occasion, Rambam is making a radical suggestion: that <i>Hak’hel</i> is a re-enactment of the giving of the Torah at Sinai – “as on the day the Torah was given,” “as though he had heard it from the mouth of God” – and thus a covenant renewal ceremony. How did he arrive at such an idea? Almost certainly it was because of Moshe’s description of the giving of the Torah in <i>Vaetḥanan</i>:
“The day you stood before the Lord your God at Ḥorev, when the Lord said to me, ‘<i>Assemble</i> (<i>Hak’hel</i>) the people to Me that I may let them <i>hear My words, in order that they may learn to revere Me</i> as long as they live on earth, and may so <i>teach their children’</i>” (Devarim 4:10).
The italicised words are all echoed in the <i>Hak’hel</i> command, especially the word <i>hak’hel</i> itself, which only appears in one other place in the Torah. Thus was Sinai recreated in the Temple in Jerusalem every seven years, and thus was the nation, men, women, children, and strangers, renewed in its commitment to its founding principles.
Tanakh gives us vivid descriptions of actual covenant renewal ceremonies, in the days of Yehoshua (Yehoshua 24), Yoshiyahu (II Melakhim 23), Asa (II Divrei HaYamim 15), and Ezra and Neḥemya (Neḥemya 8–10). These were historic moments when the nation consciously rededicated itself after a long period of religious relapse. Because of <i>Hak’hel</i> and covenant renewal, Israel was eternally capable of becoming young again, recovering what Yirmeyahu called “the devotion of your youth” (Yirmeya 2:2).
What happened to <i>Hak’hel</i> during the almost two thousand years in which Israel had no king, no country, no Temple, and no Jerusalem? Some scholars have made the intriguing suggestion that the <i>minhag Eretz Yisrael</i>, the custom of Jews in and from Israel, which lasted until about the thirteenth century, of reading the Torah not once every year but every three or three-and-a-half years, was intended to create a seven-year cycle, so that the second reading would end at the same time as <i>Hak’hel</i>, namely on the Sukkot following a Sabbatical year (a kind of septennial Simḥat Torah).
I would suggest a quite different answer. The institution of the reading of the Torah on Shabbat morning, which goes back to antiquity, acquired new significance at times of exile and dispersion. There are customs that remind us of <i>Hak’hel</i>. The Torah is read, as it was by the king on <i>Hak’hel</i> and Ezra at his assembly, standing on a <i>bima</i>, a raised wooden platform. The Torah reader never stands alone: there are usually three people on the <i>bima</i>, the <i>segan</i>, the reader, and the person called to the Torah, representing respectively God, Moshe, and the Israelites. According to most halakhists, the <i>reading</i> of the Torah is <i>ḥovat tzibbur</i>, an obligation of the community, as opposed to the study of Torah which is <i>ḥovat yaḥid</i>, an obligation of the individual. So, I believe, <i>keriat haTorah</i> should be translated not as “the <i>reading</i> of the Torah” but as “the <i>proclaiming</i> of Torah.” It is our equivalent of <i>Hak’hel</i>, transposed from the seventh year to the seventh day.
It is hard for individuals, let alone nations, to stay perennially young. We drift, lose our way, become distracted, lose our sense of purpose and with it our energy and drive. <b>I believe the best way to stay young is never to forget “the devotion of our youth,” the defining experiences that made us who we are, the dreams we had long ago of how we might change the world to make it a better, fairer, more spiritually beautiful place.</b> <i>Hak’hel</i> was Moshe’s parting gift to us, showing us how it might be done.
<b>QUESTION TO PONDER</b>
<i>How does this mitzva help the Jewish people keep the “passion of their youth”?</i>
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>The very institution of the American Presidential Inaugural Address is an adaptation of a biblical command, the 612th, known as <i>Hak’hel</i>. The Hebrew Bible contains historical accounts of such gatherings in the days of Yehoshua, Yeshaya, and Ezra and Neḥemya. In effect, these were national covenant renewal ceremonies, in which leaders recalled the nation’s history, gave thanks to God, and rededicated themselves to the terms of their vocation.
<b><i>Future Tense</i>, 173</b>
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>Why are the mitzvot of <i>Hak’hel</i> and writing a <i>sefer Torah</i> considered “meta-mitzvot”?
What is the message contained in the difference between these two final mitzvot?
What is the goal of these two mitzvot and how do we achieve this goal today?
<b>EDUCATIONAL COMPANION TO THE QUESTIONS</b>
<b><i>IN A NUTSHELL</i></b><br>This conversation was an intimate and private conversation where God was giving Yehoshua the strength and inspiration he would need to lead the people, who may (and did) go astray. God wanted Yehoshua to believe in himself and believe the task was achievable. God did not want this conversation to be public, and show the people that there was any lack of confidence from either God or Yehoshua their leader.
<b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>They are both <i>meta</i>-commandments, commands <i>about</i> the commands. They are ways to maintain the people’s awareness of and loyalty to the covenant. However, they differ in that <i>Hak’hel</i> is a communal mitzva that involves the whole people, whereas writing a <i>sefer Torah</i> is a mitzva for the individual. This is a reflection of what a covenantal society must be – a balance between individual responsibility and collective responsibility.
While we still have a mitzva to be involved in the writing of a <i>sefer Torah</i>, we no longer have the original mitzva of <i>Hak’hel</i> (because we no longer have a king of Israel). However, a more recent equivalent mitzva that tries to achieve the same end, albeit more regularly, is the weekly public Torah reading.
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br>The Inaugural Presidential Address is in effect a renewal of the covenant that is the basis for American society – the American Constitution.
This event takes place every four years when the president is sworn into office following an election. It is the American equivalent of <i>Hak’hel</i>, the renewing of the biblical covenant governing Israelite society – the Torah.
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br><i>Hak’hel</i> gives the people an opportunity, every seven years, to hear and understand the values that their society is based on. This is a re-enactment of <i>matan Torah</i> at Sinai, the original event where these values were inscribed in the hearts of the Israelites as they witnessed God’s revelation. These values are the core values of the Torah, and a renewal of the covenant every seven years provides a reminder of the passion of the original revelation where the covenant was bestowed upon the people.
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>They are commands about the commands. They aim to achieve a continuous familiarity with and commitment to the Torah by commanding each individual to have a role in the writing of a <i>sefer Torah</i> (the experience itself meaningful, and also ensuring copies of the Torah would be widely available) and the communal reading of parts of the Torah every seven years by the king in front of the entire nation.
<i>Hak’hel</i> is directed at the people as a totality. Writing a <i>sefer Torah</i> is directed at individuals. This is the essence of covenantal politics. We have individual responsibility and we have collective responsibility. In Judaism, the state is not all, as it is in authoritarian regimes. Nor is the individual all, as it is in the radically individualist liberal democracies of today. A covenantal society is made by each accepting responsibility for all, by individuals committing themselves to the common good.
These mitzvot aim to give us a deeply personal and powerfully national connection with the covenant/Torah (hence the entire nation must be present at <i>Hak’hel</i> and every individual must be involved in writing a <i>sefer Torah</i>). They also encourage a continued loyalty and commitment to the Torah. Today, we still have the mitzva for each Jew to be involved in the writing of a <i>sefer Torah</i>, but without a Jewish monarchy, we no longer have the original mitzva of <i>Hak’hel</i>. However, we have instead the weekly public Torah reading which achieves the same goal.

II; The Torah as God's Song

<big><strong>II. The Torah as God’s Song</strong></big><br><b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>At the end of his life, having already given the Israelites 612 of God’s commands, Moshe gave them the final mitzva: “Now therefore write down for yourselves this song and teach it to the people of Israel. Put it in their mouths, that this song may be My witness against the people of Israel” (Devarim 31:19).
It may seem like God was speaking to Moshe and Yehoshua and only referring to the song in the following chapter, “Listen, O heavens, and I will speak; hear, O earth, the words of my mouth” (32:1). However, Oral Tradition gave this verse a different and much wider interpretation, understanding it as a command for every Jew to write, or at least take some part in writing, a <i>sefer Torah</i>:
“Said Rabba: ‘Even though our ancestors have left us a scroll of the Torah, it is our religious duty to write one for ourselves, as it is said, “Now therefore write down for yourselves this song and teach it to the people of Israel. Put it in their mouths, that this song may be My witness against the people of Israel”’” (Sanhedrin 21b).
The logic of the interpretation seems to be, first, that the phrase “write down for yourselves” could be understood as referring to every Israelite (Ibn Ezra), not just Moshe and Yehoshua. Second, the passage goes on to say (31:24): “Moshe finished writing in the book the words of this law from beginning to end.” The Talmud offers a third reason. The verse goes on to say: “That this song may be My witness,” implying the Torah as a whole, not just the song in chapter 32 (Nedarim 38a).
Thus understood, Moshe’s final message to the Israelites was: “It is not enough that you have received the Torah from me. You must make it new again in every generation.” The covenant was not to grow old. It had to be frequently renewed.
So it is to this day that Torah scrolls are still written as in ancient times, by hand, on parchment, using a quill – as were the Dead Sea Scrolls two thousand years ago. In a religion that focuses on holy words, and that is almost without holy objects, the Torah scroll is the nearest Judaism comes to a physical object that has sanctity.
Judaism is the story of the love between a people and a book, the Book of Books.

<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br><i>Joachim Joseph celebrated his bar mitzva in the most unlikely of places. He was in Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in 1944, and had been taught in secret, late at night. The only family member with him was a younger brother. He read from a tiny</i> sefer Torah <i>that his teacher, Rabbi Dasberg, had kept hidden throughout the war. It was barely four inches in height. Afterwards, everyone congratulated Joseph, and some even gave him gifts. He received a small piece of chocolate, a tiny pack of playing cards, and a very special gift that would remain with him until he was an old man. The rabbi gave him the tiny</i> sefer Torah<i>, on condition that if he survived, he must tell the story of his bar mitzva. A few months later the rabbi died, but Joseph escaped.</i>
<i>After the war he made his way to Israel and saw the birth of the Jewish state. He later became a professor of physics, and was part of the team that sent Israel’s first astronaut, Ilan Ramon, into space. When he told Ilan the story of the tiny</i> sefer Torah<i>, Ilan was inspired to take it with him aboard the space shuttle, Columbia. In a live telecast from aboard the space shuttle, Ilan held up the</i> sefer Torah <i>and told its story to millions of people. “This was given by a rabbi to a scared, thin young boy in Bergen-Belsen,” said Ilan from the space shuttle. “It represents more than anything the ability of the Jewish people to survive. From horrible periods, black days, to reaching periods of hope and belief in the future.”</i>
<i>Joseph knew then that he had kept his promise to the rabbi.</i>
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. Why was the</i> sefer Torah<i> so important to Joseph? What did it represent to him?</i>
<i>2. Why do you think Ilan Ramon chose to take it to space with him?</i>
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>If we take this command to refer to the whole Torah and not just one chapter, what is the significance of the word “song” (<i>shira</i>): “Now therefore write down for yourselves this song”? The word <i>shira</i> appears five times in this passage. It is clearly a key word. Why? On this, two nineteenth-century scholars offered striking explanations.
The Netziv (Rabbi Naftali Zvi Yehuda Berlin, 1816–1893, one of the great yeshiva heads of the nineteenth century) interprets it to mean that the whole Torah should be read as poetry, not prose; the word <i>shira</i> in Hebrew means both a song and a poem.
To be sure, most of the Torah is written in prose, but the Netziv argued that it has two characteristics of poetry. First, it is allusive rather than explicit. It leaves unsaid more than is said. Secondly, like poetry, it hints at deeper reservoirs of meaning, sometimes by the use of an unusual word or sentence construction. Descriptive prose carries its meaning on the surface. The Torah, like poetry, does not.
In this brilliant insight, the Netziv anticipates one of the great twentieth-century essays on biblical prose, Erich Auerbach’s “Odysseus’s Scar.” Auerbach points out that biblical narrative is spare and understated, not at all like a work of fiction. For example, explains Auerbach, in the story of the binding of Yitzḥak we do not know any of the usual narrative details: what the main characters look like, what they are feeling, what they are wearing, what landscapes they are passing through.
The decisive points of the plot alone are emphasised and what lies between is non-existent; time and place are undefined and call for interpretation; thoughts and feelings remain unexpressed, only suggested by the silence and the fragmentary speeches; the whole, permeated with the most unrelieved suspense and directed towards a single goal, remains mysterious and “fraught with background.”
A completely different aspect is alluded to by Rabbi Yechiel Michel Epstein, author of the halakhic code <i>Arukh HaShulḥan</i>. Epstein points out that the rabbinic literature is full of arguments, about which the Sages said: “These and those are the words of the living God.” This, says Epstein, is one of the reasons the Torah is called “a song” – because a song becomes more beautiful when scored for many voices interwoven in complex harmonies.
I would suggest a third dimension. The 613th command is not simply about the Torah, but about the duty to make the Torah new in each generation. To make the Torah live anew, it is not enough to hand it on cognitively – as mere history and law. It must speak to us affectively, emotionally.
Judaism is a religion of words, and yet whenever the language of Judaism aspires to the spiritual, it breaks into song, as if the words themselves sought escape from the gravitational pull of finite meanings. There is something about melody that intimates a reality beyond our grasp, what William Wordsworth called the “sense sublime. Of something far more deeply interfused. Whose dwelling is the light of setting suns. And the round ocean and the living air.”
Words are the language of the mind. Music is the language of the soul.
The 613th command, to make the Torah new in every generation, symbolises the fact that though the Torah was given once, it must be received many times, as each of us, through our study and practice, strives to recapture the pristine voice heard at Mount Sinai. That requires emotion, not just intellect. It means treating Torah not just as words read, but also as a melody sung. The Torah is God’s libretto, and we, the Jewish people, are His choir, the performers of His choral symphony. And though when Jews speak they often argue, when they sing, they sing in harmony, as the Israelites did at the Red Sea, because music is the language of the soul, and at the level of the soul Jews enter the unity of the divine which transcends the oppositions of lower worlds.
The Torah is God’s song, and we collectively are its singers.
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>The story of the Jewish people, especially after the Second Temple, is about one of the great love affairs of all time, the love of a people for a book, the Torah. Much of the rabbinic literature, especially the tractate Avot<i>, Ethics of the Fathers</i>, reads like an extended poem in praise of Torah and the life of learning. The Torah was, said the Rabbis, the architecture of creation, written in letters of black fire on white fire. It was, said a later mystical tradition, nothing less than a single extended name of God. For Rabbi Akiva it was the very air Jews breathed. It was life itself….
The result was a constant dialogue with revelation. In Talmud study Jews found themselves entering into a conversation not only with the Torah but with successive generations of its commentators, Hillel and Shammai, Rav and Shmuel, Abaye and Rava, Rashi and the Tosafists, Rambam and Ramban. On virtually every subject they had access to a millennial heritage of wisdom. Landless and powerless, they inhabited a mental universe whose horizons in space and time were vast. And as each community, each age, added its <i>ḥiddushim</i>, its new insights into the ancient text, they could feel some of the excitement of Sinai. Judaism is not a religion of continuing revelation, but rather one of continuing interpretation.

<i>2. How can you be a link in the chain of “writing the Torah” and renewing it in our generation?</i>
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>How do the Netziv and the <i>Arukh HaShulḥan</i> explain that the Torah is like a <i>shira</i>?
What is the alternative interpretation given by Rabbi Sacks?
How do we make the Torah new in every generation and what does this have to do with the Torah being likened to a <i>shira</i>?
<b>EDUCATIONAL COMPANION TO THE QUESTIONS</b>
<b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>This verse could either be referring to a mitzva given to Moshe and Yehoshua to write down the song that appears in the following chapter, or a mitzva to all of the people, to write down the entire Torah, which the verse describes as a song.
This is a way for every person to create a connection with the <i>sefer Torah</i>, and to feel an ownership of the Torah in a general sense. We should each play a role in keeping the Torah and passing it on to others. The Torah is not just for the prophets, priests, and scholars. It belongs to each and every one of us, and we must take ownership of and develop a relationship with it.
We renew the Torah in every generation by learning it, teaching it, and adding our own commentary and understanding of it, applying it to our own modern world. We can do this through our understanding of both the narrative and philosophical parts of the Torah, as well as developing halakha from the legal parts of the Torah.
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br>During a period when the Jewish people were facing a very real threat of extinction and annihilation, the <i>sefer Torah</i> represented thousands of years of tradition and survival. This was especially true for Joseph while he was in the camps. It also represented faith that the Jewish people and Judaism will survive for eternity. This is what the <i>sefer Torah</i> represented to him in the years that followed the war, when against all odds, the Jewish people not only survived, but began to thrive once again.
Ramon said he was taking the Torah scroll “from the depths of hell to the heights of space.” And by doing that, he made it “an article of hope.” Ilan Ramon was Israel’s first astronaut. He was a fighter pilot in the Israeli army, and had flown many dangerous and important missions to protect the State of Israel. His mother was also a survivor of Auschwitz. Who better to represent the eternity of the Jewish people and the faith that the Jews would always survive and thrive? He played his own part in continuing the story of the rabbi, of Joseph, and of the Jewish people and their Torah, when he held up the tiny <i>sefer Torah</i> and explained its significance in the live teleconference from aboard the space shuttle <i>Columbia</i>.
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>Answers might include the way they treat the physical <i>sefer Torah</i>, such as the reverence and respect shown to it. Examples of this include standing up when the Torah is removed from the ark, kissing it when it is carried past, not touching the parchment directly, fasting in a case where, God forbid, a <i>sefer Torah</i> is dropped, and dancing with the Torah on Simḥat Torah. However, the passion for the words written in the scroll can also be clearly seen in the dedication Jews have always shown to learning Torah. This is how they have earned their reputation as the People of the Book.
The Torah is renewed in each generation as new interpretations are found and the message and values of the Torah are applied to contemporary times. This can be achieved through continuing and developing interpretations of both the narrative and philosophical parts of the Torah, as well as the legal parts and the halakha in general.
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>The Netziv interprets the verse to mean the Torah should be read as poetry, not prose. The word <i>shira</i> in Hebrew means both a song and a poem. The Torah is similar to poetry in that its meaning is allusive rather than explicit. It leaves more unsaid than said. Also, like poetry, it hints at deeper reservoirs of meaning, sometimes by the use of an unusual word or sentence construction. Descriptive prose carries its meaning on the surface. The Torah, like poetry, does not. The <i>Arukh HaShulḥan</i> draws our attention to the fact that rabbinic literature is full of arguments, about which the Sages said: “These and those are the words of the living God.” This is one of the reasons the Torah is called “a song” – because a song becomes more beautiful when scored for many voices interwoven in complex harmonies.
Rabbi Sacks suggests that the 613th command is not simply about the Torah, but about the duty to make the Torah new in each generation. To make the Torah live anew, it is not enough to hand it on cognitively – as mere history and law. It must speak to us emotionally. While words are the language of the mind, music is the language of the soul. We must treat the Torah not just as words read, but also as a melody sung because music is the language of the soul.
The 613th command, to make the Torah new in every generation, expresses that though the Torah was given only once, it must be received many times. Each of us, through our study and practice, strives to recapture the divine voice heard at Mount Sinai, as well as develop the chain of interpretation, contributing our own voice in our generation. This requires emotion, not just intellect, and therefore means treating the Torah not just as words read, but also as a melody sung. The Torah is God’s song, and we are its singers.

Ha'Azinu

In a Nutshell

<b><i>IN A NUTSHELL</i></b><br>The majority of <i>Haazinu</i> is seventy lines of a song that Moshe sings to the Israelites. He then blesses them and climbs Mount Nevo so that he can view Israel before he dies.
The song of <i>Haazinu</i> is one long, beautiful poem describing the relationship between God, who is always just, and His often-rebellious people. A key idea within the song is that the covenant should be kept by both God and us, but if one side fails to fulfil their covenantal duties, the other party can bring a case against them. This kind of lawsuit (in biblical Hebrew, a <i>riv</i>) is often referred to by the later prophets, usually as an accusation by God against the Israelites but occasionally the opposite.
We see the same idea in the High Holy Days of Rosh HaShana and Yom Kippur. This is the time when God sits on the throne of justice and passes judgement on our behaviour. In our <i>parasha</i>, though, rather than using legal language of the contract, Moshe uses high poetry, speaking not just to the minds of his listeners but also to their emotions and imaginations. Yet the theme remains simple: God is just. It is we humans who are the source of injustice in the world and who must work to heal the fractures.
<b>QUESTION TO PONDER</b>
<i>Why do you think people tend to blame God for whatever goes wrong?</i>

I; The Arc of the Moral Universe

<big><strong>I. The Arc of the Moral Universe</strong></big><br><b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>In poetic language, Moshe breaks into song, putting both power and passion into his final speech to the Israelites. The main message of this final, musical speech is the idea known as<i> tzidduk hadin</i>, defending God’s justice. The way Moshe puts it is this:
<i>He is the Rock, His works are perfect, And all His ways are just. A faithful God who does no wrong, Upright and just is He.</i> (Devarim 32:4)
This belief is fundamental to Judaism and it is key to the way we understand evil and suffering in the world – a difficult but necessary belief. It teaches us that bad things happen, but God is just.
<i>Is He corrupt? No – the defect is in His children, A crooked and stubborn generation.</i> (Devarim 32:5)
God rewards good with good, evil with evil. When bad things happen to us, it is usually because we have been guilty of doing bad things ourselves. The fault lies not in our stars but within ourselves.
This is a very challenging idea to accept, but it leads us to not look for others to blame, but rather work hard to make our lives and the world better.
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. Why is it sometimes hard to defend (our perception of) God and His justice in the world? Can you think of any examples from our times?</i>
<i>2. Why is it important not to look for someone to blame, but rather to look towards ourselves to act?</i>
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br><i>Ariella was five when her one-year-old cousin was diagnosed with cancer. He was a brave little boy who fought the disease and survived. He inspired his whole family to find ways to show their gratitude to the hospital where he was treated, and so they began raising money for and awareness of the hospital. Ariella’s grandmother set up a special charity to fundraise, and her father ran a marathon to raise money for the cause.</i>
<i>As Ariella grew up, she wanted to help other children with cancer. She, too, raised money for the hospital that had treated her cousin by running in a race that was a mile long. But she wanted to do even more for children with cancer. So she grew her beautiful hair long, and then cut it and donated it to a charity that makes wigs for children who had lost their own hair through cancer treatments. Ariella loved her long blonde hair, but she didn’t think twice about donating it to this very important cause.</i>
<i>When Ariella turned ten, she also became ill with cancer, and she became a patient in the very same hospital that had treated her cousin. She also beat the disease and became an inspiration to many. Her experience only made her want to give more and more to the children she saw fighting alongside her, and she continues to do so to this day.</i>
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. What was so inspiring about the way Ariella responded to her cousin’s illness and then her own?</i>
<i>2. How does her response connect to the message from the</i> parasha<i>?</i>
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>After delivering his philosophical message to the Israelites, Moshe moved into the prophetic mode, predicting the pitfalls the people will encounter once they cross the Jordan and enter the land. Throughout the book of Devarim, Moshe has delivered similar warnings, knowing that once the hardships of the desert and the struggles of battle have been forgotten, the people will become comfortable and complacent. They will attribute their achievements to themselves and they will drift from their faith. When this happens, they will bring disaster on themselves:
<i>Yeshurun grew fat and kicked – You became fat, thick, gross – They abandoned the God who made them And scorned the Rock their Saviour… You deserted the Rock, who fathered you; And you forgot the God who gave you life.</i> (Devarim 32:15–18)
This, the first use of the word <i>Yeshurun</i> in the Torah – from the root<i> yashar</i>, upright – is deliberately ironic. Israel once knew what it was to be upright, but it will be led astray by a combination of affluence, security, and assimilation to the ways of its neighbours. It will betray the terms of the covenant, and when that happens it will find that God is no longer with it. It will discover that history is a vicious wolf. Separated from the source of its strength, it will be overpowered by its enemies. All that the nation once enjoyed will be lost. This is a stark and terrifying message.
Yet Moshe is bringing the Torah to a close with a theme that has been present from the beginning. God, Creator of the universe, made a world that is fundamentally good: the word that echoes seven times in the first chapter of Bereshit. It is humans, granted free will as God’s image and likeness, who introduce evil into the world, and then suffer its consequences. Hence Moshe’s insistence that when trouble and tragedy appear, we should search for the cause within ourselves, and not blame God. God is upright and just. The shortcomings are ours, His children’s, shortcomings.
This is perhaps the most difficult idea in the whole of Judaism. It is open to the simplest of objections, one that has sounded in almost every generation. If God is just, why do bad things happen to good people?
This is the question asked not by sceptics, doubters, but by the very heroes of faith. We hear it in Avraham’s plea, “Shall the Judge of all the earth not do justice?” We hear it in Moshe’s challenge, “Why have You done evil to this people?” It sounds again in Yirmeyahu: “Lord, You are always right when I dispute with You. Yet I must plead my case before You: Why are the wicked so prosperous? Why are evil people so happy?” (Yirmeya 12:1).
It is an argument that never ceased. It continued through the rabbinic literature. It was heard again in the <i>kinot</i>, the laments, prompted by the persecution of Jews in the Middle Ages. It sounds in the literature produced in the wake of the Spanish expulsion, and its echoes continue to reverberate in memories of the Holocaust.
The Talmud says that of all the questions Moshe asked God, this was the only one to which God did not give an answer. The simplest, deepest interpretation is given in Psalm 92, “The song of the Sabbath day.” Though “the wicked spring up like grass,” they will eventually be destroyed. The righteous, by contrast, “flourish like a palm tree and grow tall like a cedar in Lebanon.” Evil wins in the short term but never in the long. The wicked are like grass, whereas the righteous are more like trees. Grass grows overnight but it takes years for a tree to reach its full height. In the long run, tyrannies are defeated. Empires decline and fall. Goodness and rightness win the final battle. As Martin Luther King said in the spirit of the Psalm: “The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends towards justice.”
It is a difficult belief, this commitment to seeing justice in history under the sovereignty of God. Yet consider the alternatives. There are three: The first is to say that there is no meaning in history whatsoever. History is a Darwinian struggle to survive, and justice is no more than the name given to the will of the stronger party.
The second, about which I write in <i>Not in God’s Name</i>, is dualism, the idea that evil comes not from God but from an independent force: Satan, the Devil, the Antichrist, Lucifer, the Prince of Darkness, and the many other names given to the force that is not God but is opposed to Him and those who worship Him. This idea, which has surfaced in sectarian forms in each of the Abrahamic monotheisms, as well as in modern, secular totalitarianisms, is one of the most dangerous in all of history. It divides humanity into the unshakeably good and the irredeemably evil, giving rise to a long history of bloodshed and barbarism of the kind we see being enacted today in many parts of the world in the name of holy war against the greater and lesser Satan. This is dualism, not monotheism, and the Sages, who called it<i> shetei reshuyot</i>, two powers or domains, were right to reject it utterly.
The third alternative, debated extensively in the rabbinic literature, is to say that justice ultimately exists in the World to Come, in life after death. Although this is an essential element of Judaism, it is striking how relatively little Judaism had recourse to it, recognising that the central thrust of Tanakh is on this world, and life before death. For it is here that we must work for justice, fairness, compassion, decency, the alleviation of poverty, and the perfection, as far as lies within our power, of society and our individual lives. Tanakh almost never takes this option. God does not say to Yirmeyahu or Iyov that the answer to their question exists in heaven and they will see it as soon as they end their stay on earth. The passion for justice, so characteristic of Judaism, would dissipate entirely were this the only answer.
<b>Difficult though Jewish faith is, it has had the effect through history of leading us to say: If bad things have happened, let us blame no one but ourselves, and let us labour to make them better.</b> I believe it was this that led Jews, time and again, to emerge from tragedy, shaken, scarred, limping like Yaakov after his encounter with the angel, yet resolved to begin again, to rededicate ourselves to our mission and faith, to ascribe our achievements to God and our defeats to ourselves.
<b>I believe that out of such humility, a momentous strength is born.</b>
<b>QUESTION TO PONDER</b>
<i>How does this approach to suffering in the world lead to humility and strength?</i>
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>If you were to ask what our response to the Holocaust should be, I would say this: Marry and have children, bring new Jewish life into the world, build schools, make communities, have faith in God who had faith in man and make sure that His voice is heard wherever evil threatens. Pursue justice, defend the defenceless, have the courage to be different, and fight for the dignity of difference. Recognise the image of God in others and defeat hate with love.

<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>What extra dimension does poetry give this <i>parasha</i>?
What right did the heroes of our faith, such as Moshe, Yirmeyahu, and Iyov, have to ask God why there is injustice in the world? Did they receive answers?
Does this approach to suffering blame the victim? Or are we asking for something else from the victims (and from us all)?
<b>EDUCATIONAL COMPANION TO THE QUESTIONS</b>
<b><i>IN A NUTSHELL</i></b><br>It is a bad habit that many people have to look to place blame rather than take responsibility. It is comforting to believe in a God who does not allow evil and suffering in the world, so it is a natural instinct to blame God (who is in charge of the universe after all) for all our problems and all the problems of the world. But the reality is more complex. We believe God has the power to stop suffering, but that He chooses to give humankind free will, and human actions can often lead to suffering. It takes maturity to take responsibility as a human race, and to try to help remedy the problems rather than looking to place blame.
<b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>Often there are examples of suffering that make us falter in our faith that God is just and powerful and cares for His creations. The philosophical challenges of suffering in the world, especially when good, innocent people are the ones who suffer, have challenged Jewish and non-Jewish philosophers from time immemorial. For example, the Covid pandemic has given us multiple reasons to ask these questions, as many good people lost their lives, health, or financial stability. We must find ways to maintain our faith, and to find meaning in the suffering that faces humanity.
Looking for a “scapegoat,” someone to blame for the suffering and troubles in the world, only causes us to cast ourselves as victims, and as grudge-bearers, rather than proactive agents who can improve the situation for ourselves and the wider world. We must focus on making things better and learn to see our role as people who will step up, to fight the injustices and help those in suffering.
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br>It would have been understandable if Ariella had struggled to come to terms with her cousin’s illness, and then her own. Or if she had found the experience challenging to her faith, or frustrating, or if she had slipped into a state of victimhood. But instead, she focused on how she could best respond. She looked for ways to improve the world for others who were suffering in similar ways.
The <i>parasha</i> encourages us to have faith that God is just and created a just world. When there is suffering, the blame lies not with God but rather in humankind (or even better is not to look for someone to blame but rather a way to respond and improve the situation), and we must turn inwards and look to ourselves to be part of the solution rather than perpetuate the problem. It is important to note that in this case, the source of this suffering was from natural causes, and not directly from humankind. However, it is the responsibility of humankind to find solutions and work hard to alleviate the suffering of their fellows. This was Ariella doing her part.
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>Blaming God for suffering encourages passivity and hubris (I don’t deserve this. I deserve better from God). Understanding that the responsibility lies with humanity encourages humility and the taking of joint responsibility. This leads to growth.
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>Poetry and song are often more powerful media for expressing powerful ideas that touch our hearts and souls. The themes in Moshe’s words are frightening, powerful, and emotional, and sometimes they are difficult to hear. Poetry is a deeply elegant and human way to express real and raw ideas.
The message in the <i>parasha</i> is not that we cannot ask questions, or even challenge God when we feel there is injustice in the world. These biblical characters model for us that we can. And God made space for them to challenge Him. He received their questions. However, there were no easy answers then, and there are no easy answers now. Avraham was not given an answer. The message from the <i>parasha</i> is not to avoid the question, but to have faith that there are answers even if we cannot fathom them. The message is to have faith that God is just, but to focus on the role we must play in redeeming the world.
It is important to state that this is not blaming the victim. Rabbi Sacks is not suggesting that the fault lies in those who suffer themselves. But rather the responsibility to fight suffering in the world lies with humanity and humanity alone. And that is why the Torah asks us to look inwards when there is suffering and not look for someone to blame, including God, but rather step up and respond to fix the suffering in the world.

II; Let My Teaching Drop as Rain

<big><strong>II. Let My Teaching Drop as Rain</strong></big><br><b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>In the glorious song of <i>Haazinu</i>, Moshe invites the people to think of the Torah like the rains that water the world so that it brings forth its produce: “Let My teaching drop as rain, My words descend like dew, like showers on new grass, like abundant rain on tender plants” (Devarim 32:2).
God’s word is like rain in a dry land. It brings life. It makes things grow. There is much we can do ourselves: we can plough the earth and plant the seeds. But in the end our success depends on something beyond our control. If no rain falls, there will be no harvest, whatever preparations we make. So it is with Israel. We must never be tempted into arrogance and say, “My power and the strength of my hands have produced this wealth for me” (Devarim 8:17).
The Sages, however, sensed something more in the comparison of the Torah to rain. This is how <i>Sifrei</i> (a collection of commentaries on Bemidbar and Devarim dating back to the mishnaic period) puts it:
<i>“Let my teaching drop as rain: Just as the rain is one thing, yet it falls on trees, enabling each to produce tasty fruit according to the kind of tree it is – the vine in its way, the olive tree in its way, and the date palm in its way – so the Torah is one, yet its words produce Scripture, Mishna, laws, and traditions. Like showers on new grass: Just as showers fall upon plants and make them grow, some green, some red, some black, some white, so the words of Torah produce teachers, worthy individuals, sages, the righteous, and the pious.”</i>
There is only one Torah, yet it has many effects. It gives rise to different kinds of teachings, different sorts of virtue. Torah is sometimes seen by its critics as too strict and narrow, as if it seeks to make everyone the same. The midrash argues otherwise. The Torah is compared to rain precisely to emphasise that its most important effect is to make each of us grow, to each reach our full potential. We are not all the same, and the Torah does not seek uniformity. As a famous mishna puts it: “When a human being makes many coins from the same mint, they are all the same. God makes everyone in the same image – His image – yet none is the same as another” (Mishna Sanhedrin 4:5).
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. How is the Torah like rain?</i>

<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br><i>XR-27 wasn’t just any robot. Her identification plate read “XR-27: The best, most modern robot.” She was, indeed, very clever, fast, and multi-skilled. Of course, this made her feel very proud. So much so, that when she saw other robots in the street, she would look at them with a certain air of superiority; she reserved her friendly greetings only for other XR-27s.</i>
<i> “All robots should be like us XR-27s,” she thought to herself. She was convinced that the world would be a much better place if only all robots were like herself.</i>
<i>One day, she was walking along, when a big yellow door suddenly appeared, right in front of her piezoelectric optical sensors (that’s eyes to you and me, but XR-27 liked to use highly technical-sounding words for everything). She had no idea where the door had come from, but she was intrigued by the accompanying door sign that read, “XR-27 CITY.” She went through the doorway and looked around in delight. All of the city’s inhabitants were XR-27s – every single one of them. Every type of robot in the city had been upgraded to the XR-27 model.</i>
<i>Excited at having found her perfect city, she set to exploring, stopping from time to time to talk to other robots, telling them what a great thing it was to be an XR-27. Of course, they agreed.</i>
<i>The days passed, but she started to realise that there was something about this new world that she didn’t like. She was bored. All the XR-27 robots were just as brilliant as she was, at everything. But this meant that none of them had any distinct gift, talent, or even personality. They were all the same. She realised that she didn’t feel special any more. On top of that, everyone could do things equally well, which made it impossible for anyone to stand out from the crowd. Whenever she did anything that she thought fantastic, it turned out that the other robots had done exactly the same thing and at the same time. So what was her purpose there?</i>
<i>XR-27 started to really miss those varied little and big robots in her previous world. Each one had had its good and bad points, but that made them different and fun. They each moved differently. They each processed differently. They each had a unique skill that made them special. And together they each contributed differently to make the city function in interesting ways.</i>
<i>She realised that she would much prefer to meet a clumsy-but-fun TP-4, and spend a while chatting with it, than to see yet another XR-27. So she started searching for that big yellow door. It took her several days to find it, but finally she did.</i>
<i>Just like before, it was standing in the middle of a normal street. She put her hand on the door and looked behind her, as if saying farewell to the city that had at first seemed so perfect. Then, she gave the door a joyful push….</i>
<b>Adapted from<i> The Best Robot</i> by Pablo Pedro Sacristan</b>
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. What if we could all be upgraded to the same technological model? What would our world look like if we were all the same?</i>
<i>2. With your own unique personality and abilities, how can you use your talents to make a positive impact on the world?</i>
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>The emphasis on diversity is a recurring theme in Judaism. For example, when Moshe asks God to appoint his successor, he uses an unusual phrase: “May the Lord, <i>God of the spirits of all humankind</i>, appoint a man over the community” (Bemidbar 27:16). On this, Rashi comments:
<i>“Why is this expression (‘God of the spirits of all humankind’) used? [Moshe] said to Him: ‘Lord of the universe, You know each person’s character, and that no two people are alike. Therefore, appoint a leader for them who will bear with each person according to his or her disposition</i>.’”
One of the fundamental requirements of a leader in Judaism is that he or she is able to respect the <i>differences</i> between human beings. This is a point emphasised by Rambam in <i>The Guide for the Perplexed</i>:
<i>“Humans are, as you know, the highest form in creation, and they therefore include the largest number of constituent elements. This is why the human race contains so great a variety of individuals that we cannot discover two persons exactly alike in any moral quality or in external appearance.... This great variety and the necessity of social life are essential elements in human nature. But the well-being of society demands that there should be a leader able to regulate the actions of humans. The leader must complete every shortcoming, remove every excess, and prescribe for the conduct of all, so that the natural variety should be counterbalanced by the uniformity of legislation, so that social order be well established.”</i>
The political problem as Rambam sees it is how to regulate the affairs of human beings in such a way as to respect their individuality while not creating chaos. A similar point emerges from a surprising rabbinic teaching: ‘Our Rabbis taught: If one sees a crowd of Israelites, one says, ‘Blessed be He who discerns secrets’ – because the mind of each is different from that of another, just as the face of each is different from another” (Berakhot 58a).
We would have expected a blessing over a crowd to emphasise its size, its mass: human beings in their collectivity. A crowd is a group large enough for the individuality of the faces to be lost. Yet the blessing stresses the opposite – that each member of a crowd is still an individual with distinctive thoughts, hopes, fears, and aspirations.
The same was true for the relationship between the Sages. A mishna states:
<i>“When R. Meir died, the composers of fables ceased. When Ben Azzai died, diligent students ceased. When Ben Zoma died, the commentators ceased. When R. Akiva died, the glory of the Torah ceased. When R. Ḥanina died, men of deed ceased. When R. Yose Ketanta died, the pious men ceased. When R. Yoḥanan b. Zakkai died, the shine of wisdom ceased.... When Rabbi died, humility and the fear of sin ceased”</i> (Mishna Sota 9:15).
There was no single template of the Sage. Each had his own distinctive merits, his unique contribution to the collective heritage. In this respect, the Sages were merely continuing the tradition of the Torah itself. There is no single role model of the religious hero or heroine in Tanakh. The patriarchs and matriarchs each had their own unmistakable character. Moshe, Aharon, and Miriam each emerge as different personality types. Kings, priests, and prophets had different roles to play in Israelite society. Even among the prophets, “No two prophesy in the same style,” said the Sages (Sanhedrin 89a). Eliyahu was zealous, Elisha gentle. Hoshea spoke of love; Amos spoke of justice. Yeshayahu’s visions were simpler and less opaque than Yeḥezkel’s.
The same applies even to the revelation at Sinai itself. Each individual heard, in the same words, a different inflection:
<i>“‘The voice of the Lord is with power’ (Tehillim 29:4) – that is, according to the power of each individual, the young, the old, and the very small ones, each according to their power [of understanding]. God said to Israel, ‘Do not believe that there are many gods in heaven because you heard many voices. Know that I alone am the Lord your God.’”</i>
According to Maharsha, there are 600,000 interpretations of Torah. Each individual is theoretically capable of a unique insight into its meaning. The French philosopher Emmanuel Levinas commented:
<i>“The Revelation has a particular way of producing meaning, which lies in its calling upon the unique within me. It is as if a multiplicity of persons…were the condition for the plenitude of ‘absolute truth,’ as if each person, by virtue of his own uniqueness, were able to guarantee the revelation of one unique aspect of the truth, so that some of its facets would never have been revealed if certain people had been absent from mankind.”</i>
Judaism, in short, emphasises the other side of the maxim <i>E pluribus unum</i> (“Out of the many, one”). It says: “Out of the One, many.” The miracle of creation is that unity in heaven produces diversity on earth. Torah is the rain that feeds this diversity, allowing each of us to become what only we can be.
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>“God,” wrote Rabbi Abraham Kook, “dealt kindly with His world by not putting all the talents in one place, in any one human, or nation, not in one generation or even one world.”
Each culture has something to contribute to the totality of human wisdom.
The Sages said: “Who is wise? One who learns from all men” (Avot 4:1).
The wisest is not one who knows himself wiser than others: he is one who knows all men have some share of wisdom, and is willing to learn from them, for none of us knows all the truth and each of us knows some of it.
<b><i>The Dignity of Difference</i>, 64–65</b>
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. How are these ideas from Rabbi Sacks, Rav Kook, and the Sages in</i> Pirkei Avot<i> connected to the message of this</i> Covenant &amp; Conversation<i> essay?</i>
<i>2. Why is this message so central to Jewish thought?</i>
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>What Jewish values and ideas are contained in the idea of respecting that everyone is different?
What message can we learn if even the Sages were all different and saw the world differently?
How could it be that every person who heard the same words of Torah on Mount Sinai took away something different? What does that mean for us?
<b>EDUCATIONAL COMPANION TO THE QUESTIONS</b>
<b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>The Torah is like rain in two ways. Just as rain makes things grow, so the Torah makes us grow as people. Secondly, the core message of this <i>Covenant &amp; Conversation</i> essay is that just as rain helps a diverse range of vegetation grow, so the Torah, despite being a finite and specific set of words and wisdom, can resonate for and develop many diverse people. There is only one Torah, yet it has multiple effects. It gives rise to different kinds of teachings and different sorts of virtue.
Each human being is unique, sees and experiences the world in a unique way, and brings a unique contribution to the world. Despite having a lot in common with family and even friends, comparing ourselves to them highlights the small but significant differences between us all. This is what makes the human race diverse and beautiful.
If each person is different, and sees and experiences the world differently, then they will hear the words and the wisdom of the Torah differently. The Torah has so much depth – it has multiple levels of interpretations – and each person will take something else from it in their own unique way. Hence the Midrash and the Maharsha suggest that there are as many interpretations to the Torah as there are Jews.
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br>XR-27 found it boring when everyone was the same. But more than that, she lost her sense of identity and purpose. God made a world full of diversity, full of different species, and even amongst us humans, there are billions of varieties, each human being driven, talented, and gifted in their own way.
See also the story of Zusha that we explored in the <i>Covenant &amp; Conversation</i> essay entitled “Four Dimensions of the Journey” for <i>Lekh Lekha.</i> If you can embrace your differences and hone your talents, you will be on your way to living your own inner truth to become the best you possibly can. And in the words of Rabbi Sacks, “where what you want to do meets what needs to be done, that is where God wants you to be.”
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>God is One, and Infinite, and He created the world. From Him comes a vast variety of creations, including a diversity of human beings. From one come many, each unique, despite all coming from the same single source. The Torah, when compared to rain, is the medium through which God chooses to interact with the world. Through that same single source, the multiplicity of people are impacted.
Central to Rabbi Sacks’s philosophy of Judaism is the “dignity of difference.” He explains that while we are each different, we all come from the same source, and are all created in God’s image. There is dignity in difference, and this is a critical message of Judaism, and the core of the Jewish national mission – to create a model society based on the values of respecting, valuing, and learning from everyone.
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>The Torah states that each human is created in the image of God, and therefore should be respected and treated fairly and with dignity. This is a core value in Judaism. The Jewish national mission is to create a society based on these values, where all people are treated fairly and equally, with respect and love. This society will form a model for the world, and spread the core values of Judaism which are universal.
We all have unique talents and a unique contribution to bring to the world. Even if we see the world differently than those around us, there is room in the world for diversity and difference of opinion. Even the greatest sages of Israel saw the Torah from different perspectives and brought unique approaches to it and to the world.
Just as each person is inherently unique, and sees the world differently, they will hear and approach the Torah differently, and ultimately find their own unique meaning in its words. This is a good thing. This can and should empower us all, not only to not fear being different, but also to bring our own unique approach to the Torah, for the Torah belongs to us all.

V'Zot HaBerachah

In a Nutshell

<b><i>IN A NUTSHELL</i></b><br><i>Vezot Haberakha</i> is Moshe’s blessing to the Israelites, delivered on the last day of his life, tribe by tribe. The <i>parasha</i> ends emotionally with the story of the death and burial of Moshe. Moshe dies in the land of Moav, in an unknown location, so that “to this day no one knows his burial place” (Devarim 34:6). Hashem did not want his grave to become a place of pilgrimage and worship.
The very last verses of the Torah are a tribute to the greatest leader and prophet the Israelites ever had. The ultimate tribute the Torah gives Moshe is both simple and powerful. He was “the man Moshe” (Bemidbar 12:3), “the servant of the Lord” (Devarim 34:5). <i>Vezot Haberakha</i> is not read as an ordinary Shabbat portion, but instead we read it on the festival of Simḥat Torah. It is a powerful statement about mortality and what it means to be a human. The Moshe we encounter in the Torah is simply a human being made great by the task he was set to do and by his humility. He became the ultimate channel through whom the word and power of God flowed.
<b>QUESTION TO PONDER</b>
<i>Does learning about the death of Moshe make him more inspiring or less inspiring as a leader?</i>

I; The Inheritance That Belongs to All

<big><strong>I. The Inheritance That Belongs to All</strong></big><br><b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>The book of Devarim is largely a record of the speeches that Moshe delivered to the Israelites before his death, before they entered the land of Israel. These speeches were the record of a pioneering adult education experience in which the master prophet took the entire people as his disciples, teaching them both the law – the commands, statutes, and judgements – and, no less importantly, the history that lay behind the law. Hence the prologue to the “song” of <i>Haazinu</i>: “Moshe recited the words of this song from beginning to end in the hearing of the whole assembly of Israel” (Devarim 31:30).
Likewise, the prologue to Moshe’s blessing in <i>Vezot Haberakha</i>: “This is the blessing with which Moshe, the man of God, blessed the Israelites before his death.... Moshe commanded us the Torah, an inheritance of the congregation of Yaakov” (Devarim 33:1, 4). This verse tells us that the Torah belongs to everyone. It is the possession not of the learned, the elect, the specially gifted, not of a class or caste. It is the inheritance of the entire congregation of Yaakov.
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. Why do you think Moshe’s final act as the leader of the Jewish people was an act of education – teaching the Israelites everything they needed to know about being Jewish?</i>
<i>2. Is it a radical idea that the Torah belongs to everyone?</i>
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br>This final chapter of <i>Covenant &amp; Conversation Family Edition</i> is the only one written after the death of Rabbi Sacks, <i>zt”l</i>. In most of the <i>Covenant &amp; Conversation</i> essays that Rabbi Sacks wrote for <i>Vezot Haberakha</i>, including this one, he focused in some way on the life of Moshe as the greatest Jewish leader in history. When reading his words, it is uncanny how applicable they sound to himself. Of course this was not his intention, but it is hard for us not to read them in this way, especially now that he is no longer with us. In this last <i>It Once Happened</i>, we will briefly tell the story of Rabbi Sacks’s life, with a focus on his leadership as an educator, and the similarity to his presentation of Moshe as a leader and educator in this <i>Covenant &amp; Conversation</i> essay will be clear.
<i>Jonathan Henry Sacks was born on March 8, 1948, in London, the first of four boys who would be born to Louis and Libby. The Sacks home was one dedicated to Judaism, education, and the bonds of family love. Louis Sacks did not have the same educational opportunities he worked hard to give his sons, and Rabbi Sacks would fondly tell stories from his childhood where he would ask his father Torah questions that he could not answer. His father would instead respond, “One day, Jonathan, you will learn all the answers and then you will teach me!”</i>
<i>A young Jonathan Sacks attended non-Jewish primary and secondary schools close to his home in Finchley. Despite the schools being Christian, as many as half the students were Jewish, and Jonathan found himself taking responsibility for the Jewish assemblies every morning. This was a foretaste of his future leadership roles, as well as his comfort in the company of non-Jews and his exceptional ability to represent Judaism to non-Jewish society.</i>
<i>He proved to be a brilliant student and in 1966 he began his university studies at Cambridge University, reading philosophy. At this time, he deliberated between a career as an economist, an accountant, or an academic. But then, global and personal events took him on a very different journey that would ultimately lead him to a career that was not on his horizon at all, and that would ultimately bring him to impact the lives of many thousands of others. In the summer of 1967, Israel, facing elimination at the hands of her hostile neighbours, miraculously beat back five enemy armies, capturing historical Jewish lands and reuniting Jerusalem. He was deeply impacted by this historical event, and felt a powerful yearning to embark on a journey to discover what his Jewish identity meant to him.</i>
<i>The following summer, he travelled to America to meet with the leading rabbis of the generation. Two great rabbis had a particularly important influence on him, as he would later say: “The Lubavitcher Rebbe challenged me to lead and Rabbi Soloveitchik challenged me to think!” From this moment on, he felt the calling of the rabbinate, and while continuing his academic studies, graduating in 1969 and receiving his PhD from Kings College in 1981, he also pursued rabbinic studies, receiving</i> semikha<i> in 1976, and accepting his first rabbinic position as rabbi of Golders Green Synagogue in 1978.</i>
<i>In 1970, he married Elaine, who was at his side throughout his life and whom he would often describe as his greatest supporter and without whom he could not have achieved all of his success as a Jewish thinker and leader. Together they raised three children, Joshua, Dina, and Gila, and many grandchildren, bringing them deep joy and pride.</i>
<i>In 1991, it was announced that Rabbi Sacks would succeed Rabbi Lord Immanuel Jakobovits as the sixth chief rabbi of the United Hebrew Congregations of the Commonwealth. With this, the scope of Rabbi Sacks as a global Jewish leader increased, and together with the award of a Life Peerage in the House of Lords in 2005, as Baron Sacks of Aldgate in the City of London, Rabbi Lord Sacks became a moral voice with an even greater global reach.</i>
<i>Upon installation as chief rabbi he immediately set out his priorities for Anglo-Jewry, calling for a “Decade of Renewal.” This included establishing Jewish Continuity, an educational foundation focused on maintaining and enriching Jewish identity. Rabbi Sacks believed passionately in the importance of Jewish education for all Jews of all ages, and yet at the same time understood that different people engage in different ways in our ancient and contemporary Jewish wisdom.</i>
<i>He became an erudite and inspiring speaker, mesmerising Jewish and non-Jewish audiences across the world. He wrote one book a year from the time he turned forty, completing over thirty-five books, some intellectual, challenging, and stimulating, read by politicians and global religious leaders, others on the weekly</i> parasha<i> or prayer, read in</i> shuls<i> around the world, and others that simply tell the stories of people he had met who had inspired him in his life. Something for everyone.</i>
<i>But not everyone is interested in listening to a lecture or reading a book. Rabbi Sacks was fascinated by the power of technology and new media, and together with his team, harnessed the technological revolution of our age to bring his message to new markets and audiences. From social media feeds to podcasts, white board animation videos to BBC radio and TV broadcasts, Rabbi Sacks relentlessly and creatively found new avenues to spread his Torah.</i>
<i>In 2013, he stepped down as chief rabbi after twenty-two successful years. With more time on his hands, he increased his efforts in spreading his ideas, working even harder to write, teach, tour, and produce new resources. He kept to a punishing work schedule until</i> 
<i>the very end, seeming never to sleep, writing and teaching people all over the world via his computer from the study in his attic during the months of lockdown due to the Covid pandemic.</i>
<i>Rabbi Sacks was taken from us on the morning of November 7, 2020,</i> Shabbat kodesh<i>, 20 MarḤeshvan 5781. His sudden passing shocked the world and led to a global outpouring of grief.</i>
<i>In recent years, he focused much of his energies on supporting educators to help them teach his Torah to a younger generation. Thus was born the</i> Ten Paths to God <i>curriculum, and the family editions of</i> Covenant &amp; Conversation <i>and</i> Ceremony &amp; Celebration<i>. These resources will be part of his enduring legacy. Together with your support, we will continue to create resources to help spread his teachings further and wider afield, as we know he would wish.</i>
<i>Because, as we learn in</i> Vezot Haberakha<i>, Jewish education should be equally available to all: “Moshe commanded us the Torah, an inheritance of the congregation of Yaakov.”</i>
<b>QUESTIONS TO PONDER</b>
<i>1. What comparisons can you think of between Moshe and Rabbi Sacks?</i>
<i>2. Why do you think so many people were so grief-stricken when Rabbi Sacks passed away? What is the best way to respond to the pain of his loss?</i>
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>The verses “This is the blessing with which Moshe, the man of God, blessed the Israelites before his death.... Moshe commanded us the Torah, an inheritance of the congregation of Yaakov” (Devarim 33:1, 4) are quoted by the character in a powerful story found in the Midrash to prove that Torah belongs to everyone:
<i>“Once R. Yannai was walking along the way when he met a man who was elegantly dressed. R. Yannai said to him, ‘Will the master be my guest tonight?’ He replied, ‘As you please.’</i>
<i>“R. Yannai then took him home and quizzed him on Bible, but he knew nothing; on Talmud, but he knew nothing; on Aggada, but he knew nothing. Finally, he asked him to lead the</i> bentching<i>. The man, however, replied, ‘Let Yannai say grace in his house.’</i>
<i>“R. Yannai then said to him, ‘Can you repeat what I tell you?’ The man answered, ‘Yes.’</i>
<i>“R. Yannai then said: ‘Say, “A dog has eaten Yannai’s bread.”’</i>
<i>“The guest then rose up and seized R. Yannai, demanding, ‘Where is my inheritance that you have and are keeping from me?’</i>
<i> “‘What inheritance of yours do I have?’</i>
<i>“He replied, ‘The children recite, “Moshe commanded us the Torah, an inheritance of the congregation of Yaakov” (Devarim 33:4). It is not written, “congregation of Yannai,” but “congregation of Yaakov.”’”</i>
To explain, R. Yannai saw an elegantly dressed stranger and assumed that he must be well educated. He took him home and discovered the man had had no Jewish education whatsoever. He knew nothing of the rabbinic literature and could not even lead <i>bentching</i>. R. Yannai, a Torah scholar, treated the guest with contempt. But the stranger, with great dignity, said to him in effect: “The Torah is my inheritance as well as yours. Since you have much, and I have none, share a little of what you have with me. Instead of dismissing me, teach me.”
Few ideas in the history of Judaism have greater power than this: the idea that Torah knowledge belongs to everyone; that everyone should have the chance to learn; that education should be universal; that everyone should be, if possible, literate in the laws, the history, and the faith of Judaism; that education is the highest form of dignity and should be accessible to all.
This idea goes so far back and so deep in Judaism that we can easily forget how radical it is. Knowledge – in the phrase commonly attributed to Sir Francis Bacon – is power. Those who have it are usually reluctant to share it with others. Most societies have had literate elites who controlled the administration of government. To this day, many professions use a technical vocabulary intelligible only to insiders, so that their knowledge is impenetrable to outsiders.
Judaism was different, profoundly so. I have speculated that this is connected with the fact that the birth of Judaism happened at roughly the same time as the birth of the alphabet, appearing in the age of the patriarchs, and whose earliest traces have been discovered in the Sinai desert in areas where slaves worked. The alphabet, with its mere twenty-two symbols, for the first time opened up the possibility of a society of universal literacy. Judaism, as we saw earlier, bears the mark of this throughout. Avraham was chosen to be a teacher: “For I have chosen him so that he will instruct his children and his household after him to keep the way of the Lord” (Bereshit 18:19). Moshe repeatedly speaks about education: “Teach them to your children, speaking of them when you sit at home and when you travel on the way, when you lie down and when you rise” (Devarim 11:19).
Above all is the personal example of Moshe himself. At a critical moment, when Eldad and Meidad were prophesying in the camp and Yehoshua felt that Moshe’s authority was being challenged, Moshe replied: “Are you jealous on my behalf? Would that all the Lord’s people were prophets and that the Lord would put His spirit on them!” (Bemidbar 11:29). Moshe wished that everyone shared his access to the Divine.
The distinctive character of the covenant-making ceremony at Mount Sinai lay in the fact that it was, uniquely in the religious history of humankind, a revelation of God not to a prophet or an elite but to <i>the entire people</i>, a point the Torah stresses repeatedly: “The people all responded together” (Shemot 19:8); “Then he took the Book of the Covenant and read it to the people” (Shemot 24:7).
The <i>Hak’hel</i> ceremony, occurring every seven years, was to include everyone: “Assemble the people – men, women, and children, and the strangers living in your towns – so they can listen and learn to fear the Lord your God and follow carefully all the words of this law” (Devarim 31:12). It was not that everyone <i>may</i> have knowledge of the laws and traditions of the people; it was that they <i>must</i>. This was a path-breaking form of fairness: not equality of power or wealth but equality of access to education.
The impact of this radical democratisation of knowledge can be seen in a remarkable detail in the book of Shofetim. The context is this: The judge Gidon (c. 1169 BCE) has been waging war against the Midianites. He asks the people of the town of Sukkot to give his troops food. They are famished and exhausted. The people refuse. First, they say, win the war, and then we will give you food. Gidon is angry, but he goes on to win the war. On his return, we read: “<i>He caught a young man of Sukkot and questioned him, and the young man wrote down for him the names of the seventy-seven officials of Sukkot, the elders of the town</i>” (Shofetim 8:14).
The rest of the story does not concern us here. What is extraordinary is that, more than three thousand years ago, an Israelite leader took it for granted that a young man, chosen at random, could read and write! What is more impressive is that this is a minor detail rather than something to which the narrator wishes to draw our attention.
Nor was the lesson forgotten. In the fifth century BCE, seeking to restore coherence to a nation that had suffered defeat and exile by the Babylonians, Ezra convened the people in Jerusalem, giving them what in essence was an adult education seminar in Jewish literacy:
<i>“So on the first day of the seventh month Ezra the priest brought the Law before the assembly, which was made up of men and women and all who were able to understand. He read it aloud from daybreak till noon as he faced the square before the Water Gate in the presence of the men, women, and others who could understand. And all the people listened attentively to the Book of the Law”</i> (Neḥemya 8:2–3).
Ezra and Neḥemya had positioned Levites throughout the crowd so that they could explain to everyone what was being said and what it meant (Neḥemya 8:8). This went on for many days. Ezra became, as was Moshe, an exemplar of a new kind of leadership, born in biblical Israel: <i>the teacher as hero</i>. Eventually this became the basis of the Judaism that survived the cultural challenge of Greece and the military might of Rome: not the Judaism of kings, priests, palaces, and Temple but the Judaism of the school, the synagogue, and the house of study. By the first century, a complete system of universal, compulsory education was in place, an achievement the Talmud attributes to Yehoshua b. Gamla (Bava Batra 21a), the first of its kind anywhere in the world.
Not until modern times did this idea of universal education spread beyond Judaism. It did not exist even in England, then the premier world power, until the Education Act of 1870. It has taken the internet revolution – Google and the rest – to make it a reality throughout the world. Even today, some fifty million children are still deprived of education, in countries like Somalia, Eritrea, Haiti, Comoros, and Ethiopia.
<b>I believe that one of the most profound ideas in all of history is that education is the key to human dignity and should be equally available to all. It was born in those powerful words of <i>Parashat Vezot</i></b><i> <b>Haberakha</b></i><b>: “Moshe commanded us the Torah, an inheritance of the congregation of Yaakov.”</b>
<b>QUESTION TO PONDER</b>
<i>What lesson did the guest of Rabbi Yannai teach him? Where in the life of Rabbi Sacks can you see this also reflected?</i>
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>And so Moshe, the greatest leader we ever had, became immortal. Not by living forever. Not by building a tomb and temple to his glory. We do not even know where he is buried. The only physical structure he left us was portable because life itself is a journey. He did not even become immortal the way Aharon did, by seeing his children become his successors. He became immortal by making us his disciples. And in one of their first recorded utterances, the Rabbis said likewise: “Raise up many disciples” (Mishna Avot 1:1).
To be a leader, you do not need a crown or robes of office. All you need to do is to write your chapter in the story, do deeds that heal some of the pain of this world, and act so that others become a little better for having known you. Live so that, through you, our ancient covenant with God is renewed in the only way that matters: in life. Moshe’s last testament to us at the very end of his days, when his mind might so easily have turned to death, was: choose life.
<b><i>Lessons in Leadership,</i> 285–286</b>
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>Why is the verse “Moshe commanded us the Torah, an inheritance of the congregation of Yaakov” an appropriate way to start your last speech as leader of the Jewish people?
Why is the uneducated life an undignified life?
What impact has this Jewish value of universal access to Torah learning had on the Jewish people throughout their history?
<b>EDUCATIONAL COMPANION TO THE QUESTIONS</b>
<b><i>IN A NUTSHELL</i></b><br>Moshe is known as the greatest of all Jewish leaders. He is the only human known to have spoken to God face to face. It can be hard to relate to a leader who is on such a high spiritual level. Yet in reading about his mortality, we can connect to him as a human being. In fact, throughout the Torah we are given examples of how Moshe was a human being just like us, including details of his birth and upbringing, and various examples of his trials and tribulations, including his early lack of self-belief, and occasions when he failed. His mortality is like our own (all people die), so this is yet another aspect that allows us to connect to him as a human being. This makes his unparalleled achievements all the more inspiring.
<b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>Moshe was, first and foremost, an educator. Of all the titles he could have had, such as judge, prophet, politician, warrior, we instead call him <i>Moshe Rabbeinu</i> – Moshe our teacher. As his final act of leadership, he chooses to make sure every Jew knew what it means to be a Jew, where they come from, where they are going, and what God expects of them. This is an important message for us all to learn, and Moshe, our teacher, taught it to us.
In other societies, education was not always open and equally accessible to all. Sometimes only the rich could afford education. In other times, only men were educated and not women. The Torah makes it clear that it is the inheritance of every Jew, and this is why Jewish education became compulsory according to Jewish law in talmudic times, some eighteen centuries before the Western world arrived at the same conclusion.
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br>There are many comparisons, and the more we read about Moshe’s leadership (especially through the eyes of Rabbi Sacks, which can be seen in many of his <i>Covenant &amp; Conversation</i> essays, especially from the cycle entitled <i>Lessons in Leadership</i>, also published in book form by Maggid Books) the more we realise that Rabbi Sacks modelled his own leadership on Moshe. He dedicated his life to serving the Jewish people in the same way Moshe did, and he shared the same leadership values as Moshe. The leadership value displayed by Moshe in this <i>parasha</i>, universal education, is a case in point. This was a core value for Rabbi Sacks, who built his leadership career around it.
Rabbi Sacks was an inspiring leader for many thousands of people who looked to him for guidance on how to lead their lives. Many of these people had never even met Rabbi Sacks in person, yet they felt close to him as an ever-present influence in their lives (especially through his regular writings, broadcasts, and videos, as well as his books and other media). When he died, we all felt a terrible chasm in our lives, as we were left bereft of a spiritual and moral guide. This is a natural emotional response to losing a great leader, and in fact the Torah describes the loss of Moshe, Aharon, and Miriam in much the same way. The best response to the pain of losing a teacher and spiritual guide is to continue to live life according to the values they taught, and to continue to learn and spread their Torah. This is how the legacy of Rabbi Sacks will endure and how he will continue to have a deep impact on our lives.
<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>If there are people in the community who lack education, instead of judging (or worse, mocking) them, the leadership must take responsibility for them. People lacking in Jewish education reflect badly not on themselves, but rather on the leadership of the community. Rabbi Sacks worked tirelessly to increase and improve Jewish education in the Jewish community, as well as teach Jews and even non-Jews around the world. He understood this was the most important aspect of his leadership role – to provide education for all people.
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>This is such a core message – that the Torah that Moshe brought from Sinai belongs to every Jew – that this is one of the last messages, perhaps the last enduring message, he wished to leave his followers with, before departing and handing over the leadership to Yehoshua.
Education is the secret to a dignified life because it is the ultimate democratising element in society. It allows for economic and intellectual development, as well as, in the case of Torah education, religious development. As the saying goes, “Knowledge is power.” If everyone has equal access to Torah knowledge, then there is no hierarchy where the power belongs only to the elite, either the priesthood, or the monarchy, or even the religious leadership (in biblical times, the prophets, since then, the rabbinic leadership). All Jews, through their own Torah learning, can have a relationship with God.
The Jewish emphasis on learning and teaching Torah to the next generation has undoubtedly contributed to the miracle of Jewish survival during two thousand years of exile and dispersion. It has created an unbreakable chain of tradition and continuity. It has also enhanced the Jewish contribution to the world in all the fields in which Jews have excelled, furthering the development and achievements of humankind.

II; End Without an Ending

<big><strong>II. End Without an Ending</strong></big><br><b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>What an extraordinary way to end a book: not just <i>a</i> book but <i>the</i> Book of Books – with Moshe seeing the Promised Land from Mount Nevo, tantalisingly near yet so far away that he knows he will never reach it in his lifetime. This is an ending that goes against all the expectations of a classic story. A story about a journey should end at journey’s end, once we arrive at the destination. But the Torah terminates before the terminal. It ends in the middle. It is constructed as an unfinished symphony.
We, the readers and listeners, feel Moshe’s personal sense of incompletion. He has dedicated a lifetime to leading the people out of Egypt to the Promised Land. Yet he was not granted his request to complete the task and reach the place to which he had spent his life as a leader leading the people. When he prayed, “Let me…cross over and see the good land on the other side of the Jordan,” God replied, “Enough! Never speak to Me of this matter again” (Devarim 3:25–26).
The sense of incompleteness is not merely personal, not just a detail in the life of Moshe. It applies to the entire narrative as it has unfolded from the beginning of the book of Shemot. The Israelites are in exile. God charges Moshe with the task of leading the people out of Egypt and bringing them to the land flowing with milk and honey, the country He had promised to Avraham, Yitzḥak, and Yaakov. It seems simple enough. Already in Shemot 13, the people have departed Egypt and begun their journey. Within days, they hit an obstacle. Ahead of them is the Red Sea. Behind them are the rapidly approaching chariots of Pharaoh’s army. A miracle happens. The sea divides. They pass over on dry land. Pharaoh’s troops, their chariot wheels caught in the mud, drown. Now all that stands between them and their destination is the wilderness. Every problem they face – a lack of food, water, direction, protection – is solved by divine intervention mediated by Moshe. What is left to tell, if not their arrival?
Yet <i>it does not happen</i>. Spies are sent to determine the best way of entering and conquering the land, a relatively straightforward task. They come back, unexpectedly, with a demoralising report. The people lose heart and say they want to go back to Egypt. The result is that God decrees that they will have to wait a full generation, forty years, before entering the land. So it is not only Moshe who does not cross the Jordan. The entire people have not done so by the time the Torah ends. That must await a new book, Yehoshua, not itself part of the Torah but rather of the <i>Nevi’im</i>, the later prophetic and historical texts.
This, from a literary point of view, is odd. But it is not accidental. In the Torah, style mirrors substance. The text is telling us something profound. The Jewish story ends without an ending. It closes without closure. There is in Judaism no equivalent of “and they all lived happily ever after.” Jewish time is open time – open to a finale not yet realised, a destination not yet reached. The future can and will be better. The best is yet to come.

<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br>In this last essay of <i>Covenant &amp; Conversation Family Edition</i>, for the <i>It Once Happened</i> section, it is your turn to write the story – the story of you.
When and where were you born? What were your early years like? Where did you live? Who were your friends? What school did you go to? Do you have siblings? What are your memories from this period in your life?
Now write about the chapter you are currently in. What is your life like today? What are your likes and dislikes? Hobbies and pastimes? What do you like about school? What don’t you like about school? What adventures have you had in the last few years that you think will be fond memories in the future?
Now come the interesting questions that need to be asked for this story to develop…
What’s next for you? What does your future hold?
Where will you go? What will you do?
What are your hopes and dreams?
Will you achieve them?
How will you achieve them?

<b><i>THINKING MORE DEEPLY</i></b><br>The biblical story has no ending, not simply because the Torah records history, and history has no end. The Torah is telling us something quite different from history in the way the Greeks, Herodotus and Thucydides, wrote it. Secular history has no meaning. It simply tells us what happened. Biblical history, by contrast, is saturated with meaning. Nothing merely happens <i>bemikreh</i>, by chance.
The Bible is a battle against myth. In myth, time is as it is in nature. It is cyclical. It goes through phases – spring, summer, autumn, winter; birth, growth, decline, death – but it always returns to where it began. The standard plot of myth is that order is threatened by the forces of chaos. In ancient times these were the gods of destruction. In more recent times they are the dark forces found in <i>Star Wars</i> and <i>Lord of the Rings</i>. The heroes battle against them. They may slip, fall, almost die, but ultimately they will succeed. Order is then restored. The world is once again as it was. Hence “they all lived happily ever after.” The future is the restoration of the past. There is a return to order, to the way things were before the threat, but there is often no history, no progress, no development, no unanticipated outcome.
Judaism is a radical break with this way of seeing things. Instead, time becomes the arena of human growth. The future is not like the past. Nor can it be predicted, foreseen, the way the end of any myth can be foreseen. We cannot foretell the future, because <i>it depends on us</i> – how we act, how we choose, how we respond. The future cannot be predicted, because we have free will. Even we ourselves do not know how we will respond to a crisis until it happens. Only in retrospect do we discover ourselves. <i>We face an open future</i>. Only God, who is beyond time, can transcend time. Biblical narrative has no sense of an ending because it constantly seeks to tell us that we have not yet completed the task. That remains to be achieved in a future we believe in but will not live to see. We glimpse it from afar, the way Moshe saw the Holy Land from the far side of the Jordan, but like him, we know we have not yet arrived. Judaism is the supreme expression of <i>faith as the future tense</i>.
Judaism is the only civilisation to have set its golden age not in the past but in the future. We hear this at the beginning of the Moshe story, although not until the end do we realise its significance. Moshe asks God: What is Your name? God replies: “<i>Ehyeh asher ehyeh</i>,” literally, “I will be what I will be” (Shemot 3:14). We assume this means something like “I am what I am – unlimited, indescribable, beyond the reach of a name.” That may be part of the meaning. But the fundamental point is: <i>My name is the future</i>. “I am what will be.” God is in the call from the future to the present, from the destination to we who are still on the journey. What distinguishes Judaism from Christianity is that in answer to the question “Has the Messiah come?” the Jewish answer is always: not yet. Moshe’s death, his unfinished life, his glimpse of the land of the future, is the supreme symbol of the not-yet.
As we see him on Mount Nevo, looking across the Jordan to Israel in the distance, we sense the vast, challenging truth that confronts us all. Each person has a promised land they will not reach, a horizon beyond the limits of their vision. What makes this bearable is our intense existential bond between the generations – between parent and child, teacher and disciple, leader and follower. The task is bigger than us, but it will live on after us, as something of us will live on in those we have influenced.
<i>The greatest mistake we can make is to do nothing because we cannot do everything</i>. Even Moshe discovered that it was not for him to complete the task. That would only be achieved by Yehoshua, and even then the story of the Israelites was only just beginning.
Moshe’s death tells us something fundamental about mortality. Life is not robbed of meaning because one day it will end. For in truth – even in this world, before we turn our thoughts to eternal life in the World to Come – we become part of eternity when we write our chapter in the book of the story of our people and hand it on to those who will come after us.
The task – building a society of justice and compassion, an oasis in a desert of violence and corruption – is greater than any one lifetime. The Jewish people have returned to the land, but the vision is not yet complete. This is still a violent, aggressive world. Peace still eludes us, as does much else. We have not yet reached the destination, though we see it in the distance, as did Moshe.
The Torah ends without an ending to tell us that we too are part of the story; we too are still on the journey. And as we reach the Torah’s closing lines, we know, as did Robert Frost in his famous poem, that “I have promises to keep, and miles to go before I sleep.”
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>Neither Bereshit, nor the Torah as a whole, concludes with an ending. They are God’s unfinished symphony. We are left <i>in medias res</i>, in liminal space midway between departure and arrival, tantalisingly close yet unmistakably distant. We have travelled through several centuries and generations on a journey with a destination that no one has yet reached…after thirty-nine books and more than a thousand years of history – back almost where the story began, in Bavel, not far from Ur of the Chaldees from where Avraham’s family first set out.
There is no other story quite like this. It breaks all the rules of narrative form. It leads us to expectations that are never met in the way we anticipated them. The Hebrew Bible is <i>a story without an ending</i>…. The Bible is one of the meta-narratives of Western civilisation, the Book of Books, the story of stories, yet Bereshit and Devarim and the Hebrew Bible all close with us, the readers, still awaiting the promised, predestined end. It is always just over the horizon, receding like a mirage in the distance. The Torah leaves us, in Harold Fisch’s fine phrase, with “the unappeased memory of a future yet to be fulfilled.” So we arrive at a third proposition: <i>In Judaism we are always in the middle of a story whose ending lies in the future</i>.
We are free because we face an open future: open because it depends on us. We know the beginning of our story, but we do not yet know how it will end.
That is the human condition, and it is why the Jewish story has a beginning but not an end. That is why Jewish time is not cyclical time in which the future is a mere repetition of the past. That is why in Judaism the golden age, the Messianic destination, has not yet been. <i>The language of freedom is the future tense</i>. Judaism, the religion of freedom, is the religion of the future tense.

<b>EDUCATIONAL COMPANION TO THE QUESTIONS</b>
<b><i>THE CORE IDEA</i></b><br>Stories without endings can be frustrating. The reader always wants to know how things wrap up, and most people like to see all the loose ends tied neatly together. Stories that do not have endings leave us in a state of tension and require imagination from the reader who must decide for themselves how things end. It is natural to want the author to write a satisfying ending.
The Torah does not end with a natural conclusion, or a “happy ending,” to teach us that Jewish time is open to a finale not yet realised, a destination not yet reached. The future can and will be better. The best is yet to come. This also places emphasis on the current players in this story (us!) to achieve the fitting end.
The Jewish story is still being written, and the Jewish people, together with God, are the writers. We hope and have faith that the ending will be a world redeemed.
<b><i>IT ONCE HAPPENED…</i></b><br>Our futures have yet to be decided and this can sometimes prove frustrating as we are curious to know our future, but it can also be exciting to know our future chapters are yet to be written. It also gives us hope that things can always improve and we can always put in more effort to achieve our hopes and dreams. Our destiny is not set, and it is in our hands.
Although our lives are impacted by so many factors beyond our control, we are the only ones who ultimately decide how we respond. We write the future chapters of our story, and while we believe that God influences our story and guides us, we also believe every person has free will and is the ultimate decision maker in their life.
<b><i>FROM THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SACKS</i></b><br>Judaism is a religion of free will and freedom. The ultimate book of the Jewish journey has no ending, because the ending has yet to be written. We are still writing the story, and this is what gives us freedom and agency. Rabbi Sacks describes Jewish faith as “written in the future tense” because we believe in a future that is not yet written.
If we have freedom and agency, and the end to our stories has not yet been written, then the future can be better than the present. We have faith that it will be, and we believe that Jews are called on to be “the voice of hope in the conversation of humankind.” This is one explanation as to why Jews are often at the forefront of technological and social initiatives that improve the world.
<b><i>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE</i></b><br>The classic Greek view of history is that it is devoid of meaning and is not a movement towards redemption. In Greek myth, time is cyclical. It goes through phases such as the seasons, or birth, growth, decline, death – but it always returns to where it began. The future is the restoration of the past after a battle against chaos. There is a return to order, to the way things were before the threat, but there is no progress. Judaism sees history as a progression towards a better time, brought about by humanity as an agent of free will.
The Jewish people will decide its ending in partnership with God. This will be a partnership between humankind’s free will and God’s divine providence of the universe. See also <i>The Core Idea</i>, answer 3.
This is the belief that the future will be better than the present and that the world will be redeemed. It means having faith in humankind’s ability to achieve this and in God playing a role to help humankind arrive at this time.Id mo conet, qui dolorer spistrum faccate mpossequi delique doluptam, vendit ressit, cum quam quidero maximint, sequatiosae.
