According to Rav's opinion, [God] made Cain into a sign for the murderers, whereas according to Rabbi Chanin's opinion, He made him into a sign for the penitents. According to their words, Cain did not deserve a sign at all. However, he did deserve to become a sign for all time: One who contemplates murder will remember the endless disgrace of Cain's act, the heavy price that the murderer himself has to pay. And the murderers will remember him as someone who repented. In that way, then, Cain is transformed into a sign for the possibility of climbing out of the depths of abomination and defilement and coming close to God.

With these calculated few words, the Zohar makes a connection between Noah's trauma, his spending more than a year in isolation in one big jail with all the living creatures, and his behavior. With the heavy responsibility placed upon his shoulders of preserving the world as the background, the end of such an experience is Noah's crisis and breakdown through his inebriation and revealing himself. His behavior reveals a loss of stability and a loss of balance and common sense. In the words of the Zohar, "his mind became mixed up." This represents Noah's frustration and the loss of his self-respect and his own human dignity. It is interesting that it is specifically Cham's desecration of Noah's honor that, at the end of the day, arouses the power of life within him and causes him to yell about his lost honor.

According to certain approaches, this principle that one witness is trusted regarding prohibitions is derived specifically from the laws of women. The purity of a woman from the prohibitions of menstruation is put into her hands: When she claims she is impure, she is impure; when she claims she is pure, she is pure. The source of this derivation is from the words, <i>she shall count for herself</i> (Leviticus 15:28). She herself counts, and it is implied that her word is trusted. (Ketuvot 72a; Tosafot there)
In our Torah reading, when Lavan enters Rachel's tent, Rachel seeks to cover up her crime by violating this trust as she informs Lavan that the "way of women" is with her.

<i>He who digs a pit will fall into it</i> (Ecclesiastes 10:8) — that is Dinah, the daughter of Leah.<br>Since her brothers and the house of her father would sit and study in the study hall, she went out to see the daughters of the land, as it is stated: <i>And Dinah the daughter of Leah went out</i> (Genesis 34:1).<br> Who is the snake that bit her? That was Shekhem, the son of Chamor.  (Avot DeRabbi Natan, Recension B 3:8)
This passage from Avot DeRabbi Natan presents a picture of life before the incident. Jacob's whole family sits and studies in the study hall. As a young girl who does not have a place in the study hall and is not supervised by anyone since they are all actually occupied, only Dinah is left out of the picture. Dinah goes out to occupy herself and is bitten by a devious snake; she falls as easy prey into the hands of Shekhem, son of Chamor. Indeed, this teaching is based on [the second part of] the verse: <i>and he who breaches a fence will be bitten by a snake</i>, and hints to Dinah being guilty for breaching the fence. However, it appears that this is not the only possible reading. It is possible to read the verse in this context, not as a laying of blame and a chronicling of sin and its punishment, but rather as a factual description: She breached the fence, went out, and was bitten. If we try hard enough, we can even hear the notes of Prokofiev's Peter and the Wolf sounding in the background. In that story, the guilty one was the one that did not close the gate. According to that, if there is a story of guilt here at all, it should be attributed to Jacob and his sons, who closed themselves up in the study hall without concerning themselves about the vulnerable young girl. They are the ones in the ivory tower, neglecting their sister's protection.

The skill of dream interpretation is in the reading of symbols and signs, and their understanding; it is also in their measured adaptation to reality in the correct proportions. For example, on the simple level, Yosef's dreams indicated ambition and are easy to decipher. Yet the important point is that the dreams don't just reveal the fact that Yosef was a "dreamer," but also that he had hidden abilities in this direction. From that perspective, a dream has the possibility of revealing abilities that will be seen in the future. That is why a dream has the status of prophecy.  Sometimes a prediction is not from the ability to see the possible development of the dreamer's characteristics, but rather from a supernatural grasp of that which will happen in the future. In several places, the Gemara says that sometimes a person does not see [something], but "his constellation sees." The first signs of something the materialization of which is approaching are found in reality and a person catches them. Generally these signs are not sufficiently pronounced to register in his conscious mind, but they pierce into his subconscious and surface in his dreams.

There are no words that can be yelled out in response to an utterly baseless suspicion. Crying is the only possible way to express what is felt in the face of such an injustice. In contrast to this, when one is accused of being a <i>mamzer</i>, [one opinion in] the Talmud says that his silence proves that he is not a <i>mamzer</i>, "since it doesn't concern him since [the accusation alone] does not disqualify him from [marrying within] the congregation" ([see] Rashi, Ketuvot 14b, s.v. veha deshatik).









The hope that we raise with the lighting of the Chanukah lights is the hope to remove the partitions. To realize the ability to spread the internal outwards, the aspect of "The soul of a person is the light of the Lord" [alluding to Proverbs 20:27].

Chapter 7


In the fixed addition to the prayers during Chanukah, we thank God for the miracle of the victory over the Greeks. The victory in the war is intensified and transformed into a miraculous event by way of several motifs mentioned in this <i>al hanissim</i> blessing: The idea that the wicked were delivered into the hands of the righteous and that justice was done in the world. The fact that insolent people and shysters fell captive to innocent ones sitting in the tents [of Torah study] is also amazing. The spiritual significance of the fall of the impure into the hands of the pure, [something otherwise] impossible. As it is generally impurity which conquers purity, and not the other way around. For, as is well known, contact with impurity contaminates the pure. But the sharpest of all is the miracle of "the many in the hands of the few," as this is an open miracle that presumably contradicts all of the laws of nature. In war, quantity is power, and superiority in numbers is decisive.

Yitzchak <b>blesses</b> his children before his death. It appears to me that a blessing is the opposite of a command, it is a type of parting benediction. It is softer than a command, for it is not considered a disclosure or edict. But in other ways, it is a blessing that is actually more of a burden and a demand. Hidden in a blessing is also the faith in the ability of the recipient of the blessing to actualize it and to live up to the expectations of the one blessing. It is understood that what is expected of him and the hopes that he is charged with fulfilling become clear to one being blessed, in accordance with the contents of the blessing.
Yaakov blessed his grandchildren, Ephraim and Menashe. However, he gathers his sons in order <b>to tell</b> them that which will happen at the end of days. This is a different method of presenting goals. It is a telescopic presentation that looks out into the future and assists with the theoretical organization of strategies.








Jacob looks out at his sons and sees that the people that will come out from them/him encompasses many varied strengths, and that each one of his sons represents differing inner tribal pieces, differing communities; an assortment of cultural phenomena, and social classes that will exist within the Jewish people. This observation is his blessing to them, a blessing for the road: You should know that each one of you has an important task within the Jewish people, each one of you is a touchstone for a particular approach and perspective.

Moshe transforms water, the natural and essential source of sustenance, into blood. In this way, he hints that Pharaoh is making cynical use of human life by extracting the essence of their flesh and blood in exchange for their right to live. In this way, Pharaoh translates people into material, into the blood from which people are formed.

According to that which is described in Psalms (136:10 — <i>To Him who struck Egypt through their first-born</i>), and in contrast to the simple understanding of the verses in our section, the revolution began earlier, before the plague of the firstborn. The Egyptian people did not wait for the death of their firstborn. The information about the expected death of the firstborn leaked out, such that the firstborn were fighting for their lives. Their struggle brings about an attempt at suppression and an actual civil war.

The punishment for the sin of the calf was not completely pushed off. It is present each and every day. One who has not paid for what he has done never ceases to feel the fear of punishment floating over his head. He feels it with particular intensity when it draws close to someone who is guilty of the same thing. When Moshe would walk in the tabernacle, there would be a permanent discomfort accompanying him; a feeling that he was in the middle of a quarrel that was not resolved. The matter that 'we don't talk about' was present in every step of his in the tabernacle. This description of Moshe's walking in the tabernacle points to a murkiness that crept over the relations [between him and the people] since the sin of the calf. From [the time of] their sin, the faithfulness of the Jewish people was under constant suspicion; the tag of treason burned upon its forehead. God's slowness to punish was transformed into something too hard to bear.

Chapter 1

<b>Lights and Vessels</b>
The Gemara in Tractate Berakhot 55a deals with the question of the order of the building of the Tabernacle and the preparation of the vessels. The Gemara's midrash compares the sequence of Moshe's orders to Betzalel (in Parshat Ki Tissa) to the sequence of Betzalel's execution of them (in Parshat Veyakhel). According to the midrash, Moshe's command is, "Make an ark, and vessels, and a tabernacle." The ark before the vessels; and the vessels before the Tabernacle itself. However, even though these are Moshe's commands, Betzalel doesn't accept Moshe's instructions and questions them: "The practice throughout the world is that a person builds a house and only afterward places the vessels in the house; yet you say to me, 'Make an ark, and vessels, and a tabernacle?' The vessels that I make, where shall I put them?" From the dialog between Moshe and Betzalel, as presented in the Gemara, it becomes clear that Betzalel had the divine presence's intent in mind. Indeed, the Holy One, blessed be He, commanded Moshe to build the Tabernacle [first] and the vessels afterward. Yet Moshe chose to present the enterprise of setting the Tabernacle in the opposite sequence, from the vessels to the Tabernacle. Moshe is amazed by Betzalel's wisdom, since he sensed the change in the sequence, so he reacts to his words, while admitting the truth, "Perhaps you were in God’s shadow (<i>betzel El</i>) and you knew."
It comes out that Betzalel's logic was different than Moshe's logic, but the same as God's logic: The external component must come before the internal one and the filling.
As opposed to the midrash cited by the Talmud, the Midrash Tanchuma (Vayakhel 18) praises Betzalel for not starting with the building of the Tabernacle, but rather with the building of the ark:
This is that which is stated, "Instruct a wise man, and he will grow wiser; teach a righteous man, and he will gain in learning"  (Proverbs 9:9). This is Betzalel. When Moses said to Betzalel, "Make a tabernacle," Betzalel said, "What is the Tabernacle for?" He said to him, "To have the divine presence dwell within it and teach the Jewish people Torah." Betzalel said, "And where will the Torah be put?" He said to him, "When we make a tabernacle, we shall make an ark." So he began with the ark, as it is stated, "And Betzalel made the ark, etc." (Exodus 37:1).
According to the Tanchuma, Moshe instructed Betzalel to build the Tabernacle in sequence, from the outside to the inside; from the Tabernacle to the ark and the vessels. It was Betzalel who, from his own initiative, started with the building of the ark.
Each midrash is based on a different emphasis in the straightforward meaning [of the Torah]: Moshe's command in Parshat Ki Tissa is in the order, from inside to outside. The order of Moshe's instructions in our parsha  (Vayakhel, Exodus 35:4-20) is from the outside to the inside. But while the order of setting up the tabernacle was actually from the cover and the building to the vessels and garments, note that Betzalel's name as the one doing it only appears next to the ark - "And Bezalel made the ark of acacia wood" (Exodus 37:1). Hence there is a need to deal with the question of the contradictory ideas of the two midrashim.
According to the Tanchuma, Betzalel's flash of insight was that he chose to cut through and build the essence before the tangential. Betzalel stood and questioned Moshe about the essence of things and their purpose. And once he understood the concept of the Tabernacle as a dwelling place for the divine presence and as a source of light and Torah, he knew that to be able to erect the walls, he had to begin with the essence, with the content. It is impossible to realize a vision without understanding it in depth. In order to illustrate a book cover, it is not enough to understand the book's words. There is a need to probe into the question of the literary genre, the style, and the different layers of its language. To move forward with a project, there is a need to map out the target audience, its needs, and the project's goals. And to plan a building, it is necessary to understand who will use it, for what purpose, and what type of atmosphere the building is meant to infuse. The ark is the symbol for the essence and the content. Only when it is in place in front of you can you establish the Tabernacle around it. 
As mentioned, according to the midrash in the Talmud, the sequence is the opposite. First one has to work on the infrastructure and lay down the foundation. Only then is it possible to become creative and fashion the substance of the place with delicate architectural diagrams. One doesn't buy a couch before there is a living room, lest it come out that the couch is bigger than the living room! Likewise, one is raised, educated, and acquires a viable profession before establishing a household and family.
Rabbi Tzakok HaKohen of Lublin (Likutei Maamarim, p. 43) notes that Adam, the first man, was created on the sixth day, so that he would first enter into Shabbat. Only after Shabbat is it possible to understand the meaning of the days of the week. Only after there is content and an outline is it possible to understand what the days of the week are intended for, and to live them properly. Our parashah has the commandment of Shabbat before the description of the building of the Tabernacle. And with that, it has rest come before work; and the spiritual delight before the toil of the shells and the casings. In order to adjust expectations, in order to smoothen the path, it is necessary to be aware of the program. One who knows that he can realize his aspirations and his dreams at the end of the journey will be prepared to follow the entire journey there. The goals serve as the flashlights that light up the path and become a tool to choose the correct road.
Nevertheless, the certainty of success is often not only dependent on going back to the vision and the idea, and its understanding in line with changing circumstances. There is a great and important advantage in tying oneself to conservative constructions, to solid principles, and to clear guidelines. This is how Rabbi Tzadok puts it: "Rather there is a need for constriction, such that one's 'wisdom not be greater than his deeds.' For this causes the shattering of the vessel, as he will then want to do actions beyond the constrictions, and according to his maximal reach" (ibid.). Someone who is overly tied to spiritual conceptions often comes to shattering the vessels and the frameworks. So, for example, he will mistakenly think that to enjoy the Shabbat and to delight in it, it is worthwhile and desirable to light a fire on Shabbat. Hence there is a need to know that there are hard and fast principles, and set frameworks with specific measures. Into these, and according to their measure, can one pour the contents in a measured and responsible fashion. 
According to the Tanchuma, imagination and ingenuity comes before actualization. Whereas according to the Babylonian Talmud, it is precisely a tangible framework that assists one to be precise with the contents. The tension between these two extremes is a tension that exists in the determination of halakha, just as it exists with mundane everyday decisions: How much weight to give to restrictions and how much weight to give to the spirit and the idea; how much to break out and when to fence oneself in and to impose limits. From the balance that is struck by the two midrashim, it is possible to learn that the resolution of this conflict is not a movement to one of the two poles, but precisely the continual dialog between them. In each situation, one's wisdom obligates him to consider which one of the vessels serves him and which he will put first. Were it only that we could, with every step of ours, be 'filled with Divine spirit, with wisdom, with understanding, with knowledge, and with all types of craft.'

The second perspective expresses the purpose that man accomplishes for himself by religious action, which bring a healing promise to himself and gives him hope about righteousness and ethics. The first perspective reflects the idea that the service of God is the place where everything a man does is for the sake of the Heavens, is from a complete renunciation of the pursuit of reward, response, or claim: "God is not employed by us." Yeshayahu Leibowitz tended to see this side of Judaism. He held that a Jew prays because that is what he was commanded, as there is no expectation of reward for these acts or others. This viewpoint is an understanding that the Holy One, blessed be He, demands closeness from us, and yet sometimes even that we detach ourselves from reality.

At certain times, even in the middle of life, there are factors that bring about such situations. Such an experience can also be felt as a personal and non-communal experience. People feel that they are being led towards, "that which is outside of life," during points and experiences of transition. On the one hand, a woman giving birth generally feels  an exalting experience of bringing life into the world. On the other hand - with no less power - she feels mourning for the difficult separation from the life that grew within her. Many women in a situation like this descend into depression and go into themselves.

The expression <i>for is man a tree of the field</i> does not fit into the verse in a simple fashion, and its syntactic function is unclear. Commentators following the straightforward meaning tried to make the words blend into the rest of the verse without great success: Rashi explains that a tree is not like a person, it does not constitute any threat to your life, hence it should not be afflicted. He reads the verse as a question — and is man a tree of the field to come against you in a siege? Ibn Ezra gives a similar explanation in the name of one of the grammarians. According to him, the Torah warns a person about abusing trees since they are not like a person and cannot defend themselves. Rashbam explains that it is permissible to cut down a tree of the field that is partnering with a person in the war by hiding the enemy from you. In that fashion, it does present a danger like a person. The law of a person and the law of trees are being equated — it is permissible to remove a threat, but one should not veer towards unbounded and systematic cruelty. For just like the law towards man, so too is the law towards the tree of the field. In his own explanation, Ibn Ezra suggests that trees are the source of human life, hence they should not be destroyed. "Behold, you should not destroy a fruit tree, for it is life for a person." (And see Sifrei Devarim, Shoftim 203.)

However, were it not for the cultural and historical context, it is not clear why the Holy One, blessed be He, should not be compared to such depictions as these. If the Holy One, blessed be He, is depicted to us as a powerful young man, if the Holy One, blessed be He, has black curls, this is surely just a religious mode of expression for His strength and rulership, His vibrancy and actions. In the language of the Aggadah, the depiction of a mighty young man is no more than the expression of terms that are found in existence that we have identified to connect us to such a depiction. In this fashion, if we say that the Holy One, blessed be He, dwells in the high Heavens or looks down from the Heavens, we are expressing in a religious mode, through this, that there is a supernal Power that cannot be grasped, who looks down upon us from above and observes all of our actions. The Heavens add to the thickness of this conception: The Holy One, blessed be He, is the Light of the world, and He is the One who occasionally covers the world with clouds and darkens it with His darkness. According to this explanation, the difference between the physical wording like that found in [the liturgical poem], Anaiim Zemirot, "His elderliness on the day of judgment and His youth on the day of battle," and Rambam's 13 Principles of Faith which [emphasize] God's uniqueness is stylistic. We are speaking about a linguistic dichotomy.
There is an advantage in the depictive language in the Scriptures and [the writings of] the Sages, may their memory be blessed, over the use of abstract concepts: Abstract concepts make use of our intellectual ability to clarify the actions of the Holy One, blessed be He, and are exact and concrete. But it is specifically the depictive, which leans towards the imagination, that enables attachment to the divine beyond the ethical values that accompany it, such as righteousness, justice, and kindness. It is the artful representations that energize the heartstrings and strengthen the feeling of connection.
