Chapter 12

And the Lord said to Moses and to Aaron, in the land of Egypt, saying:
This month will be for them: the head of months. The first - it will be for them: of the months of the year.
Speak with all the gathered of Israel, to say: In the tenth of this month, also, a man will take up for himself a lamb, for their father's house, a lamb for their own house.











Seven days, that which is unleavened you will eat. Though, on the first day, you will prohibit that which is leavened from your houses; because, all who eat that which is leavened will also be taken down, that person, from Israel, from the first day into the seventh day.
On the first day, from the holy summons, and on the seventh day, from the holy summons, it will be for them: all of their service, they will not serve in them; though, that which is for every being to eat, they alone will serve themselves.
