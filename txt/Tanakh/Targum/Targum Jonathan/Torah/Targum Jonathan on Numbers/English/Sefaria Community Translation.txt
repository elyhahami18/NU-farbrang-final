This is one of four cases that came up before the prophet Moses, in which he decided them based on the opinion of the Supernal One. Some of them were monetary cases, and some of them were capital cases. In the financial cases, Moses was alacritous, and in the capital cases, Moses was deliberate. But in both these and those, Moses said, "I have not heard [this law]," so as to teach the heads of the courts of the Jewish people, who would arise after him in the future, to be alacritous in monetary cases and to be deliberate in capital cases, and not to be afraid to ask about case difficult for them. That is why Moses, who was the teacher of Israel, had to say, "I have not heard." Because of that, Moses brought forth their case before the Lord.
