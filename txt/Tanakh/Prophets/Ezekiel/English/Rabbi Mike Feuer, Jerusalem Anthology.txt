And you, son of man, will you judge, will you judge the city of bloodshed and let her know all her abominations? 
Then you shall say; So said the Lord God: O city that sheds blood in her midst, even now, when her time is approaching, and makes idols over her to defile herself.















Therefore, so said the Lord God: Because you have all become dross, therefore behold, I gather you together into the midst of Jerusalem.
