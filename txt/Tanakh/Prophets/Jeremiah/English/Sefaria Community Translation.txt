Chapter 13
























Therefore I shall scatter them like straw flying (lit.passing) in a desert wind.

Chapter 14





















Don't disgrace us for your namesake, don't dishonour your holy temple (lit.the seat of your glory). Remember -don't annul- your covenant with us.
Are there among the vanities of the nations those that make rain, and is it the heavens that give raindrops, is it not that you are G-d our L-rd whom we hope in, for [it is] you who did all these [things].

Chapter 15











G-d said: I promise [that] I will spare you for good (kesiv: I will fortify you for good), at the time of evil and pain the enemy will encounter you (i.e.he will seek you to look after you).
Can iron (i.e. the assults on Yermiah from the populace) break iron from the North [mixed with] copper (i.e.Yermiah. see 1:18)?
I will hand over your wealth and your storehouses as a spoil, not in exchange for money, rather for your sins [perpetrated] throughout your borders.
I will subjugate you to your enemies in a land you have not known, for an East wind as strong as fire has gone forth from before Me, amid anger, it shall burn against you. (Targum)
You know, O G-d (Remember me, look after me and avenge my pursuers for me, don't take my life due to your patience [for the enemy], know) [about] my bearing disgrace for your sake.
I adhered to your edicts and I fufilled them (lit. Your words were found and I ate them) and your words were to me as a rejoicement and true happiness for [it showed that] Your Name -G-d L-rd of hosts- was proclaimed upon me.
I did not sit among groups of merrymakers and make merry because of your hand (i.e. the prophecy that you showed me). I sat alone, for fury filled me [against the people].
