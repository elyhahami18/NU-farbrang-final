Chapter 53



He was despised and rejected by men--a man of anguish and knowing sickness. As one hiding his face from us, he was despised and we did not value him.
Yet surely our sicknesses he was carrying. Our pains he was bearing. And we thought of him as smitten, stricken by God and humiliated.
And he was pierced for our rebellion; he was crushed for our turning aside. The punishment for our perfection was upon him, and in his wounds there is healing for us.
Each like a sheep, we wandered off--each to his own path turned. And the Lord upon him visited the sin of us all. 
Oppressed, he was humbled, and he did not open his mouth.
