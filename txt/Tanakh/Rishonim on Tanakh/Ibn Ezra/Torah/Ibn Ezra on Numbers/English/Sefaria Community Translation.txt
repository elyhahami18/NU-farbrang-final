And the explanation of "AND HE HEARD": That he alone heard The Voice and it was not heard by anybody else who was in the Tent of Gathering outside of the curtain. This is also correct because Hashem added to his (Moses's) feeling in his ears (ability to hear) just as He had added light to the eyes of the blind Elisha and thus likewise revealed to the eyes of Bilam

<b>And they were in Chatserot:</b> It is connected to "And Miriam spoke" - since they dwelt there on account of her. As so is it written. 

Chapter 12



Verse 1

"And Miriam spoke": She was [the actual] speaker while Aaron agreed or was silent; therefore he was punished [as well].
And the meaning of "And she spoke (Va't'daber)": (With the Hebrew letter beit) - And the meaning of the Hebrew phrase for “and she spoke” with the preposition “of” (the Hebrew letter beit): In a deceitful? manner such as “And the people spoke against God” (Bamidbar 11:5). It is found both as praise and in a prophet’s manner of speaking. There are those who say that Moshes ruled over Ethiopia (the land of Kush) and married the Kushite (woman). Targum Onkelos says that she was beautiful and it was the language of respect just as the Ishmaelites call tar ‘white stuff (ha-lavan)’, so we call the blind person, ‘full of light’ (a euphemism). And thus it isn’t clear whether it is called a word that is meant to be praise that they turned into criticism. Meanwhile, there are those who say that the son of Kish (קיש) the Benjamite was Saul and thus from here on out, [I will translate the word] as the people of Kush (the Kushites). This is already its plain meaning. Thus the correct interpretation in my eyes is that this Kushite was Tzipporah for she was a Midianite and Midianites are Ishmaelites. (These peoples) live in tents (See Habbakuk 3:7: "The tent curtains of the land of Midian were trembling. The earth quaked.) and because of the heat of the sun, they have no whiteness among them. Tzipporah was dark and looked like a Kushite.

Moses never asked for recognition, nor reward. He was a humble man.

Verse 2

Send forth: First God said to the Israelites "Go up and conquer."The Israelites then said to themselves: "Let's send people first." After this, God said: "Send forth men."

Chapter 16



Verse 1

“And Korah took” - This matter that was in the wilderness of Sinai, when the firstborns were replaced and the Levites were separated,<br>For the Israelites thought that Moshe our Leader did it according to his own thought, to give greatness to his brother, and also to the sons of Kehat for they are close to him, and all of the Levites that they are his family.<br>And the Levites conspired against him because they were given to Aaron and his sons.<br>Datan and Aviram conspired because the firstborn privilege was removed from Reuven their father and given to Yosef; perhaps they suspected that [Moshe did that] for the sake of Yehoshua his servant [who was from Yosef].<br>Also Korah was a first born, for thus was written.<br>&gt;And those Heads of the Congregation (edah) were firstborns and they were bringing the olah offerings.<br>And the proof for this explanation is the miracle of the staff (Bamidbar 17:16-26) that all of Israel saw that Hashem chose the tribe of Levi in place of the firstborns, and therefore it is written (Bamidbar 17:25) “their mutterings ceased,” for the mutterings were about this.<br>Also Moshe said that “it is not from my own mind” (Bamidbar 26:28), because they suspected that it was from his own mind that he did it.<br>And further proof is “Hashem did not send me” - for this task - because all the Israelites already believed in him [in general]. Another total proof is “all the congregation are holy” and this is a hint to the firstborns that they are holy, because it is written (shemot 13:2) “sanctify to Me every first born” and they are the priests (Kohanim) that approach Hashem and they are the essence of the whole congregation.

To perform all of these deeds: i.e. transferring the duties of the firstborns unto the Leviim. And be aware that this is a serious matter. And it bothered them that they were no longer trusted to remove the firstborns from the Kohanim and give it all up to Moshe's family alone. All of this occurred during the sin of the Golden Calf for then they were seen as complete when they surpassed the firstborns who were worshiping since they were then the priests. And the Leviim killed the worshipers of the Calf. And there is here a question whose answer is in Parshas Vayeilech.

As in (Isaiah 22:5), "Mekarkar a wall." And its explanation is that he destroys a wall, as in (Isaiah 10:33), "He will hew off the tree-crowns with an ax."...
<b>The Children of Seth (Shet):</b> [This is] like the sons of Adam (all people), since [Seth] was the main [son of Adam], as Noah was from his descendants (such that everyone who lived afterwards was of the Children of Seth). And the Yitzchaki1 said that its understanding is [that it refers to] the Children of Ammon and also [the Children of] Moab, and its meaning is [hence] twofold. He also said that its usage [is like its usage in], "those with revealed shet" (Isaiah 11:3), which is a reference to the daughters of Lot (the mothers of Ammon and Moab). But that is distant [from the correct understanding] in my eyes; as shet is the posterior, which is like a foundation, as in (Psalms 11:3), "When the shatot are destroyed." And many understood, "all the children of shet" as the same usage as "When the shatot." And the explanation is that when he destroys the countries (which are like foundations). And this is not distant.

Verse 2

<b>The heads of the tribes:</b> According to my opinion that this section is after the war with Midian, it is for this reason that [the section about that war] is after it; just as "And Miriam and Aaron spoke about Moses (Numbers 12:1) is after "and they were in Chatserot" (Numbers 11:35) [even though it happened earlier], as I explained.1 And Scripture states that the Children of Gad came to Moses and Elazar and the princes of the congregation and they spoke their words. And afterwards, it is written (Numbers 32:28), "Then Moses gave instructions concerning them to Elazar the priest, Joshua son of Nun, and the family heads of the Israelite tribes" - which are the princes of the congregation [just] mentioned. And since Moses said to the Children of Gad and the Children of Reuben (Numbers 32:24), "you shall do what comes out of your mouth"; it is therefore written (Numbers 30:2), "And Moses spoke to the heads of the tribes," and then (verse 3), "he shall do like everything that comes out of his mouth."
