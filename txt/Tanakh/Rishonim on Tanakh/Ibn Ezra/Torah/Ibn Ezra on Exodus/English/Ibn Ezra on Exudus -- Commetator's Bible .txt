And, of course, as Deut. 5:19 makes clear, "The Lord spokes those words ...to your whole congregation at the mountain." Deut 5:4 says, "Face to face the Lord spoke to you on the mountain out of the fire? does not contradict this; the the Israelites were speaking to Moses of what they themselves had apprehended, the Voice speaking.
