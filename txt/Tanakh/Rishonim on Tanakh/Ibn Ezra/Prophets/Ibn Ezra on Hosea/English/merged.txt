Verse 1



Verse 2



Verse 3

And let us know: That we should pursue knowing God, since it is the secret of all the wisdoms, and it was only for its sake that man was created. However, one is unable to know God until he studies many wisdoms, since they are like a ladder to ascend to this supernal virtue.
