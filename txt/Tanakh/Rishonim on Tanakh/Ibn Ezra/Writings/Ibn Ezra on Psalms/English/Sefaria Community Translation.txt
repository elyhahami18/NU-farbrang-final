Kiss the son - Behold and serve the Lord in contrast to. . .
. . .Kiss the son against his anointed; and behold the interpretation 'How pure and also how pure my insides' (Proverbs 31:2); and it is also written 'you are my son.' It is a custom in the nations of the world to place their hands under the hand of the king as the brother of Solomon or the slave under the thigh of his master or to kiss the king. This is the custom in India to this day.

Verse 1

"To the conductor, listen to this all nations" - this psalm is very important, because it explains the light of the afterlife (lit. World to come) and the undying soul of wisdom.

Verse 2

"Listen" - to the message he gives, that addresses all in whose nostrils G-d (lit. hashem, the name) blew the breath of life. Therefore, "listen all who dwell on Earth".

Verse 3

"Also" - calling the sons of Adam who aren't wealthy, or who are and are well known. That is the reason for also having "sons of man", to include the rich and the poor.

Verse 4

"My mouth" - to teach all the wisdom hidden from them, which those wise of heart explain by riddles.
And "thoughts and insights" - that my heart thought.

Verse 1


And the word "laanot"-- is like the phrase "qol anot" (Ex. 32:18). Said Yeshua b. Yehuda: "This is Heman the son of Samuel and the Bible calls him Ezrahi because he was a native of the bards, for most bards were his children and grandchildren as it is written in Chronicles." And some say that the aleph is prosthetic and he was the son of Zerah and his brother was Ethan. And others say that Heman and Ethan were brothers whose father was called Ezrah.

Verse 16

"Open" - and the "you" that's written in the prior verse (Psalm 145:15) is also here, thus [the verse should read] "and You open Your hand," and thus: because the God of my father is my help. 
And the meaning of "will" -- what is sufficient for them.

Chapter 146



Verse 1

"Praise be to God"- [These are] the words of the poet to Israel, and afterwards he says it to himself.

Verse 2

"I shall praise, I shall sing"- with the tongue, for once a man dies, he is no more, and this [psalm] is the hymn and song for rebuking human beings.

Verse 3

"Do not" - There are those who say [that the psalmist is speaking] about a human being [in the sense that he is one] who does not have a true salvation [by which] to save you. What seems right in my eyes is [that the psalmist is speaking] about a human being [in the sense that] he is unable to save himself.

Verse 4

"[His spirit] shall leave]" - That [spirit] which dwells in his heart.
"He shall return to his earth" - For the bones are, in their structure, of earth, and they are the foundations of the body. The meaning of the word "עשתונותיו" is "his thoughts", like [it says in Yonah 1:6]: "Perhaps God will think (יתעשת) [of us and we will not be lost]." [this being] like saying "God will think, will think of me."

Verse 5

"Fortunate" - The meaning is that [fortunate is one] that leans on none but God, and does not request help from man.
And the meaning of "...the God of Ya'akov as his aid" is [based on that which] he(Ya'akov) said [in Bereshit 28:21]: "and Hashem will be as God for me," as I explained [that verse] in its place.

Verse 6

"He who makes" - the meaning is that God can do all He desires, for He is the Maker of Heaven and Earth, the Seas and All that is in Them. "Heavens" - these are the angels, and the great host are the attendants [of God], and on the earth [there are] the birds, animals, and humans, and in the sea [there are] great creatures.
"He who keeps truth for all time" - These are the categories of all species that are on the earth and in the sea, only [that] in the heavens all those in them in their specificity are kept for all eternity [without God keeping them], therefore you(flying creatures) do not fear man that he might oppress you, and he slaughters for you your apportioned sustenance (i.e. man kills and buzzards feed on the carcasses), and he will release your bonds.

Verse 7



Verse 8

"God" - See here that the meaning is [that] it is not appropriate that a man lean on another man and if a man is to be strengthened from him, [it should be that] he leans on him in his prayer to God(i.e. the man is a conduit for salvation which is requested in prayer to God), and so too if he is hungry or he is imprisoned [he will be saved], and so too if he gets an affliction of the eyes, or he was continually forced to stay in bed [because of sickness], he should not lean on a doctor.
And the meaning of "God loves the righteous" is that he will guard them and they will not be oppressed or hungry or bound or blind or coerced.

Verse 9

"God guards converts" - Who have no aid as they are from another nation.
And the word "יעודד" - I have explained it [already].
And the meaning of "He will twist" is that he will switch causes. He will prepare outcomes to twist their way, that their request not be fulfilled and their desires will not be.

Verse 10

"May he reign" - If God is so, he is fitting to be king and only for Him is the indulgence of kingship, and the poet concludes as he began [with הללויה].

Chapter 147



Verse 1

"Praise be to God" - [These are] the words of the composer by way of prophecy, praising God as he sees his vision, for God will build Jerusalem and gather the dispersed of Israel.
And the word "זמרה" is a verb, like [it says] "... [and I will continue] to discipline you..." (Vayikra 26:18), and the ה is added because it serves for that which is after. "For it is good to sing of God, for it is pleasant and desirable" - [this word נאוה] is from the morphology of the word תאוה (desire), as I have explained, for the word is in the נפעל (passive) conjugation, like [it says] "...and all that is made in a frying pan..." (Vayikra 7:9).

Verse 2

"[He will] build," "He will bring in" - like [it says] "Go, bring in all the Jews..." (Esther 4:16).

Verse 3

"He who heals the broken-hearted" - They are the mourners of Zion.
"And bandages" - [this word is] like that [which it says]: "...they were not sprinkled [with medicinal herbs] and they were not bandaged/wrapped up..." (Isaiah 1:6). And Rabbi Yitzchak the Spaniard says that [this phrase is referring] to [how God "bandages" and fashions] their design, like the expression used by Yishmael and others like him: "Your hands designed me..." (Iyov 10:8). And in my opinion, [the meaning is] that He is like one who touches them, that he touches that which is very saddening for them.
