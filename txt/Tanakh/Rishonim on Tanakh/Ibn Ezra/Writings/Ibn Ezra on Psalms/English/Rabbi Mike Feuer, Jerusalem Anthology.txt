Verse 1

A psalm; a song of dedication of the House – There are those who say that David commanded that the singers play this song at the dedication of the First Temple, and those who say at the dedication of the Second Temple or the Third, because he compared the time of exile to a time of sickness as I will explain. It seems to me that he composed this song at the dedication of his own house, the House of Cedars, because the psalm does not mention the House of God. This usage is similar to “The blind and the lame shall not come into the house,” (Samuel II 5:8) as I explained there. At that time David fell sick and then recovered from his sickness. R’ Moshe said that David mourned when Natan told him that he would not build the house for the Lord. When he told him that Shlomo his son would build the house he was clothed with joy in place of his mourning because his son was like him, and his enemies could not disparage him. And he said that suffering of the soul is similar to physical suffering, and even worse in the sense that “A man's spirit will sustain his illness…” (Proverbs 18:14)

Verse 3

His tabernacle was in Shalem – This is referring to Jerusalem. Perhaps she is called Shalem because she is perfectly positioned opposite the gate of heaven, or that she is fit to be in peace. Or perhaps they called her thus in a prayerful fashion, like “ask for the peace of Jerusalem…” (Tehillim 122:6)

Verse 1

I rejoiced when they said to me – R’ Moshe said that David composed this song that it be said with the songs in the House of God when it will be built. R’ Yeshua said that this song was for the House which David built in Zion. There are those that say it refers to the Third House when every member of Israel will say ‘I rejoiced when they said to me’ as they go up for the pilgrimage festivals:

Verse 3

Jerusalem – On the three festivals it was like a city into which all her children gathered from the surrounding area in a time of fear:

Verse 2

Jerusalem has mountains – because they stand around her, and the Lord surrounds His people within her. Therefore the enemy cannot come lay siege to Jerusalem:

Until I find – We know that all of the land is the Lord’s, only there are honored places which are more honored. Therefore “…and this is the gate of heaven.” (Genesis 28:17)

Verse 6

Behold – R’ Moshe (ben Jikatelia) said: we heard it at the hands of David who was from Ephratha. The correct understanding in my eyes is that in days gone by people would say that we heard from the mouth of the prophets that the chosen place is close to Bet Lechem Ephratha. Only, it was unknown whether the place was to the east of Bet Lechem, the west, north or south. It is known that until today there is only a distance of three parsangs between Jerusalem and Bet Lechem: 
in the fields of the forest – where the threshing floor of Aravna the Jebusite is located.

For – It mentions Zion because it is called the city of David, since he rejoiced when it was revealed to him that the mountain of the House of the Lord is Zion.
