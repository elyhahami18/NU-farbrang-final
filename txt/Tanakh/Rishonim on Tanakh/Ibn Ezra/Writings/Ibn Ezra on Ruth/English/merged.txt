Ibn Ezra on Ruth



Chapter 1



Verse 1

In the name of God, may He strengthen my hand and His memory establish my glory, in the commentary on the Scroll of Ruth by Avraham Sephardi. This is the statement of Avraham. Because David is the root of the kingship of Israel, the lineage of David is recorded in the holy books.
"Now it came to pass in the days when the judges ruled." Some say that God judged the judges, because through them, famine came to the land of Israel. And there are those who meticulously interpret that it is not a verb but a noun, like 'a judging sword'. And it is possible that it is to be understood as its plain meaning, for every past, future, or active verb is always derived from the infinitive because it is the main form.
The letter "מ" (mem) in "מבית לחם יהודה" (from Bethlehem in Judah) serves itself and another with it, because a place name is not connected (i.e., it does not require the construct form).

Verse 2

<b>Machlon and Kilyon</b>: We do not know the circumstances under which they were named, just as with Issachar and Moses. In the Midrash, it is said that they are Joash and Saraph, because they married Moabite women (1 Chronicles 4:22), where it is written "who had dominion in Moab." The Moabite women are permitted to Israelites because the scripture only forbids Ammonites and Moabites from entering the assembly, and from marrying Israelite women. In the Book of Ezra, I will explain this well.
The reason for saying "from Bethlehem" again is to inform that they were citizens. Additionally, because it says "Ephrathites," this word sometimes refers to the place called Ephrath and sometimes to the tribe of Ephraim. Ephrath was the name of Caleb son of Hezron's wife, and the place was named after her, similar to Egypt. It is not possible that Machlon and Kilyon took these women until they converted, and the proof is "to her people and to her gods."

Verse 3

<b>"And the woman was left"</b>: Alone with her two children and without her husband. The scripture mentions it in this way because when mentioning two things, it refers to the latter. Or it mentions them because of the great pain she felt for her sons, who were young men, while her elderly husband had died.

Verse 4



Verse 5



Verse 6

<b>"And she returned from the fields of Moab."</b> In thought. Just as "And Israel fought with Balak."

Verse 7



Verse 8

With the dead. This refers to her sons. [Naomi's sons, Machlon and Kilyon, who died].

Verse 9

May God give to you. [May God give what to you?] A husband.

Verse 10



Verse 11

<b>"Are there yet any more sons in my womb?"</b> Many of our colleagues thought that this response was directed at those who deny (the custom), not realizing that our ancestors transmitted that levirate marriage (yibbum) applies to brothers from the father, not from the mother. She was simply saying to them, if I had sons in my womb, I would give them to you in place of the deceased. This is a manner of affection, not according to the practice of levirate marriage.

Verse 12



Verse 13

"Would you tarry for them?": The final nun (נ) replaces a mem (מ), and it contrasts with "for it grieves me much for your sakes." The phrase "they came to Bethlehem" shows that "tarry for them" is connected to the letter lamed (ל) or the word "el" (אֶל), similar to "the eyes of all wait upon you" (Psalms 145:15).
"Refrain": This verb is in the Nifal form and has no parallel.
"From having husbands": Each one of them having a husband, similar to "and they hanged both of them on a tree" (Esther 9:14).
"No, my daughters": Meaning, do not go with me.
"That the hand of the Lord is gone out against me": A decree from God that has come forth from Him or that was issued and has reached me, making itself seen.
"The hand of the Lord": A metaphor for affliction, using the term "hand" as a way humans speak.
"The one who went up to your brother-in-law's house": From the root of "yabam" (levirate marriage); it has already been explained in the Torah.
"To her people and to her gods": Evidence that they converted.

Verse 14



Verse 15

"Do not urge me": The meaning is to pacify, and it is always connected with the letter "bet" (ב), as in "and entreat Ephron for me" (Genesis 23:8). It is not an unusual word, just that "I will not urge a person" and in its place, I will explain it.
"Your people shall be my people": I will never abandon the Torah of Israel and the unity of God.

Verse 16



Verse 17



Verse 18

"Steadfastly minded": From the reflexive form (hitpa'el).

Verse 19

"And was astir": From the Nifal form of the verbs with doubled roots.
"Is this Naomi?": Because Elimelech and his wife were among the notable people of Israel.

Verse 20

"Call me not Naomi, call me Mara." Even though it is written with an 'aleph', it comes as in the way of the 'heh' that disappears at the end of an 'aleph'. 'Mara' instead of 'ha'. Similar to 'as a young calf' according to Rabbi Judah's opinion. In my view, 'Naomi' means something delightful, and 'Mara' is the opposite of delight, and the delightful thing is the sweet food.

Verse 21

<b>"Full."</b>: with sons and wealth.
<b>"And the Lord has testified against me."</b>: Some say it comes from the root to answer because of me, but in my opinion, it is from the root of 'you shall not testify against your neighbor,' as in 'bring forth your witnesses against me.'
<b>"And the Almighty has afflicted me."</b>: Like a plague. Similar to 'creates evil,' either it afflicted me because of my sins, or the text speaks in the language of humans, and this is correct."
<b>"The 'heh' of the response."</b> The 'heh' of knowledge, as is found here."
<b>"And the reason Naomi returned."</b> Another time, to specify the time they came at the beginning of the barley harvest, for the gleaning of Ruth."

Chapter 2



Verse 1

A known relative, as in "and understanding you shall call a familiar friend."
Of her husband. From her husband, and here the "lamed" is like in "say he is my brother."
Boaz. Our Rabbis of blessed memory said that he is Ivtzan, who was a judge of Israel.

Verse 2

After him in whose sight I shall find favour. Some say that the "vav" refers back to Boaz mentioned earlier, and the meaning is "perhaps it will be." In my opinion, the "vav" refers to the owner of the field, even though he is not mentioned, because of "and her chance happened," and its meaning is "coincidence."
The Lord be with you. To help you because they are laborers.
May the Lord bless you. That He will give a blessing in the harvest.

Verse 3



Verse 4



Verse 5

Whose maiden is this? He thought she might be a married woman. Perhaps he asked the young man because he saw her dressed in a foreign manner, and also because appearances can change due to the climate. And the homiletical interpretation is well known.

Verse 6



Verse 7

So she came and has continued. That she always busies herself with her own needs and not with anything else, so she would not be suspected because of her beauty.
Scarcely spending any time in the hut. For a short time.
Spending time. That she sat.
The meaning of 'hut'. Like a booth (sukkah).

Verse 8

Go away. With a shuruk (וּ) instead of a cholam (וֹ), like "they will judge" (ישפוּטו). And it is an unusual word because it is accented on the last syllable. Perhaps it is like this because it is not commonly used.
The nun in תדבקין (keep close) - is extra.

Verse 9

And when thou art thirsty. It appears among words that have a final "hey" (ה) at the end.

Verse 10



Verse 11

It has been fully related to me. An action where the agent is not specified.
Whom thou knewest not. To dwell among them.

Verse 12

Thy reward. Like "the tally of bricks," it is a noun from the intensive binyan (conjugation) with an additional mem (מ).

Verse 13

And I should not be. I am not worthy to be like one of your maidservants.

Verse 14

In the vinegar. Because of the heat.
And left. Because it is the end of the verse, like in "remember war, do not add."
And he reached. It has no parallel, and its meaning is similar to "giving."

Verse 15

Do not reproach her. Derived from the root שלל (to plunder). Some say it is like an error from [the word] של.

Verse 16



Verse 17

And it was about an ephah of barley. Once a man asked me, what is the significance of 'an ephah of barley'. I told him there is no point to the question because the text simply reports what happened. I appeared foolish in his eyes, and he told me there was indeed a meaning, but I remained silent and did not ask him. Then, one day he came and told me that there are many reasons.
One reason is that Ruth saw prophetically that one of her descendants would establish a pillar in the name of her husband, and the term 'ephah' - alludes to the 166 pomegranates that were on the pillar, which in gematria (numerical value) equals 'ephah', and 'barley' as in 'measures' like 'measure of his life'. Another reason, 'and it was' - these two words, one in Aramaic and one in Hebrew. It signifies when she saw that Absalom, one of her descendants, would be hanged, and the letters 'kaf' and 'aleph' hint at the years of Absalom's life until his death. And then 'an ephah of barley' - in plural form, because it was a heavy burden for him. Another reason is that the initial letters of 'ephah' and 'barley' together make 'Jesse' in gematria, who was a complete righteous man. Then he rejoiced and his heart settled within him.

Verse 18



Verse 19



Verse 20

Blessed is the Lord who has not left off His steadfast love. This is a sign that He initially showed kindness to Elimelech and his sons, for he was a judge.
The living. Naomi and Ruth. He is our redeemer. The redemption here is not levirate marriage; it is another way.

Verse 21



Verse 22

That you go out to glean with his maidens. And not with the young men, as he is in charge of both the male and female reapers.
And that they meet thee not. Referring to men and many others like them.

Verse 23

And dwelt with her mother in law. Like, with her mother-in-law.

Chapter 3



Verse 1

"A home (מנוח)": For a woman does not have rest until she is married.
"The word מודעתנו (our kinsman) is unusual, and the 'tav' (תי"ו) is extra."

Verse 2



Verse 3

וסכת (and anoint thyself): Oil that has a pleasant fragrance, as it is the custom of the prominent people of Israel, both men and women.
ושמת שמלותיך עליך (and put thy raiment upon thee): The good clothes that you did not wear for harvesting.
מרגלותיו (his feet): Means "his feet," as also used in the book of Daniel. Therefore, the interpreter who thought it was a cushion placed under the feet, similar to the meaning of "מראשותיו" (under the head), was mistaken.

Verse 4



Verse 5



Verse 6

"צותה (bade her):" Like "וכעסתה צרתה" (and her rival provoked her).

Verse 7



Verse 8

"וילפת (and turned over):" From the Nifal (passive) verb form, like in 'ילפתו ארחות דרכם' (their paths are twisted). The meaning is twisted or turned. Similarly, 'וילפת שמשון' (Samson turned). It does not mean joy. The idea is that he turned from one side to the other.
"והנה אשה (and behold, a woman):" It is possible that she said to him, 'Do not be afraid,' as a woman's voice is always recognizable; or the moonlight was bright, and he saw that she had no beard. He could also recognize her by her clothing.

Verse 9

"ופרשת (and you shall spread):" A hint to take her as a wife.
"כי גואל אתה (for you are a kinsman-redeemer):" For this is the custom of all Israel, as No῾omi had informed her.


Verse 10

חסדך האחרון מן הראשון (your latter kindness is greater than the first): This phrase highlights that Ruth's recent act of kindness (presumably her loyalty and willingness to stay with No῾omi and follow her instructions) surpasses the kindness she showed to her deceased husband. No῾omi had acknowledged Ruth's kindness, suggesting that it would be unusual for someone to revert to their old ways after converting to a new faith.
אם דל ואם עשיר (whether poor or rich): This phrase indicates that Ruth's beauty and character make her loved and admired by everyone, regardless of their social or economic status.

Verse 11

"אשת חיל (a virtuous woman):" I will explain this in Proverbs.
"מ"ם ואמנם נוסף כמ"ם חנם (The letter 'mem' in 'ואמנם' is added, like the 'mem' in 'חנם')."

Verse 12



Verse 13

"אם יגאלך טוב (if he will perform to thee the part of a kinsman, well):" Some say that "טוב" (Tov) was the name of the kinsman. However, if this were so, why does the text in the scroll later say, "Turn aside, sit down here, Ploni Almoni" (a certain someone)? Rather, its meaning is, if the kinsman will redeem you, it is good for you that he should redeem, because he is an important person.

Verse 14



Verse 15

"וימד שש שעורים (and he measured six measures of barley):" The text narrates what he gave her. And in the Midrash, it is interpreted that six righteous men will descend from her.

Verse 16

"Who are you, my daughter?" It is possible that she didn't see her until she opened the door for her to enter, as is customary. The scripture abbreviates it to say 'I am Ruth, your daughter'. Similar to 'they called him and he ate bread', and it's written 'and Moses agreed'. Rabbi Jonah the grammarian says, 'מי' means 'what', and the meaning is 'what happened to you'. He told me that it is similar to 'What is your name?' (Judges 13:17), because the use of 'מי' in such a context is not found with a human. In my opinion, 'שמך' (your name) is a proper noun, and therefore 'מי' relates to the context.
"What the man did to her. The oath."

Verse 17



Verse 18

"How the matter will fall. Because all decrees come from heaven, therefore it will fall. And if not, not one thing from his words would fall."

Chapter 4



Verse 1

"Went up to the gate. Indeed, it was the custom and law for the community."...
"Such and such a one. Some say that it comes from 'wonderful', and 'almighty' from 'mute', as he has no known name to the speaker."

Verse 2



Verse 3

"The parcel of land." It is possible that the field was large, and a portion of it belonged to Elimelech.

Verse 4

And if he will not redeem. Rabbi Yonah said, it should have been 'and if you will not redeem.' Similarly, 'and let him not deal treacherously with the wife of his youth.' But this is not possible because 'deal treacherously' reverts back to the word 'in your spirit.' That is its interpretation. And if the redeemer does not redeem it, then I will know, for there is no closer redeemer than you.

Verse 5

"You have acquired the wife of the deceased." The reason for this phrase is 'you will acquire,' with a past tense verb used for future action. For the woman has a ketubah (marriage contract), and also, a mother inherits what remains. It is written 'I have acquired,' meaning 'thus I will acquire.'

Verse 6

"Lest I ruin my own inheritance." He had a large estate. And some say it hints at his wife.
"Redeem it for yourself." Here, I have given you the authority, for I cannot do it.

Verse 7

"In former times, in ancient days that have passed, as 'the faces' are the first.
"Concerning redemption." If a person redeems or exchanges one field for another.
"And this is the testimony." Derived from 'witnessing', about this they would testify, and some interpret the word 'testimony' as habit and custom. And the first is correct.

Verse 8

"And he drew off his shoe." Boaz drew off his own shoe and gave it to the kinsman. This action is what our sages of blessed memory referred to as "chalifin" (exchanging). The reason for this is that by accepting the shoe, you transfer your right of redemption. The significance of the shoe is that it is always worn, and it is not possible to remove a sandal or trousers without leaving oneself naked. Some say that the kinsman drew off his shoe and gave it to Boaz, and the reason is that by giving you this shoe, I am conveying to you the right of redemption.

Verse 9



Verse 10



Verse 11

"Like Raḥel and like Leḥa." They mentioned Rachel first because she was Jacob's wife at the beginning of his intention. 
"And be prosperous in Efrata, and be famous in Bet-leĥem." May she do this kindness to me, for you have not taken her for the sake of wealth.

Verse 12



Verse 13



Verse 14

"That he will not leave to you an empty one as a redeemer." The reason being that the name of the deceased would be established upon his inheritance.

Verse 15



Verse 16

"And she nourished." It means to care for and sustain, as in the phrase "And Joseph nourished his father." Some also interpret it as "to provide," as in "And who will provide for the day of his coming."

Verse 17

"A son has been born to Naomi." Similar to "And she had a son."
"Father of David." It's possible that the lineage goes through both Oved and Yishai, akin to "God of my father Abraham and God of my father Isaac," reasoning that Nachshon died in the desert before Israel's entry, for he couldn't have been a youth leading the tribe while Israel journeyed initially. Moreover, the text mentions him entering the land, implying he'd be the tribe's leader. Hence, between his entering the land and David's birth, only six years passed, as it's written, "In the four hundred and eightieth year after the Israelites had come out of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon's reign." David lived for seventy years. Forty years the Israelites journeyed in the desert. If we say Salmon entered the land at one year old, then Salmon, Boaz, Oved, and Yishai each fathered a child at ninety-one years old. If we assume Nachshon was less than twenty when leaving Egypt, he'd be eighteen years old, accounting for the years in the desert. So, the sum would be five, and each would father a child at eighty-four. This seems plausible, as Boaz was already elderly, which Ruth knew, as he told her not to go after the young men. Yishai was also old when he fathered David, as he was the eighth son. Perhaps Oved was named because he was fathered by an elderly man, and the woman only accepted him for the sake of God's honor. Additionally, his mother left her religion and homeland, taking refuge under God's wings. Therefore, the child would be named Oved Hashem (a servant of God), as most children resemble their parents, as they are the roots.
