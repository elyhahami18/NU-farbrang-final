I met someone very trustworthy who was on the island סרדניא, and a non-Jew ran away from his parents, lost his mind, became insane, and lived with the Rams for many years. He walked on all fours and had hands like them. The king of the island went hunting and captured many rams and he also captured this individual whom he thought was a ram. This individual's father happened to be in the palace and recognized his son, so he spoke to him, however, he didn't answer. He gave him bread and wine- however, his "son" refused. So he gave him grass like the rest of the rams and he ate it. And in the middle of the night, he ran away with the rest of the animals in the field.

Those who leave the sacred covenant - they are the men of Jerusalem who conspired against a king and killed his men and desecrated the sanctuary–the stronghold that was Israel’s. Like “the pride of your strength” (Ez 24:21). This wording is similar to: “the ark, the covenant” (Josh 3:14), interpreted: “the ark is the ark of the covenant.” Thus the book called “The wine, the Poison.” By analogy, a book: “Destruction of a Second House.”<br>One is surprised by Sadducee sages who interpreted this as referring to the future. They said that the sanctuary is Mecca, around which the Ishmaelites circle. and they put aside the daily sacrifice the five prayers (the Salat). and they set up the abomination, idolatry. And they are the mistaken. As is it may be that miqdash/sanctuary refers to Jerusalem alone. Thus it is that in the Ishmaelite language its name is “house”(al-ka’aba). And how is it that Mecca is sacred? Didn’t those blind ones open their eyes and see that in Mecca there is an abomination to this day? Is it not Mercury, around which all Ishmaelites, from east and west, circle to throw stones? And these interpreters have desecrated the sanctuary.<br>And the Gaon, z”l, said that the king will do his will (v.36) refers to the Kedari, head of the kingdom of Ishmael. And this is not possible, for it is written and regarding the desire of women… he will not understand, (v.37) and this one was a lover of women. Interpret women as nations? This would be close to drash/homiletics, and not the simple meaning. And further, what does one do with the scripture: a god their fathers did not know? (v.38) And further, if it was a pagan god, the answer is not Mercury, because his fathers knew him and the men of Mecca did not turn to obedience to him till he swore to them that he would not put aside the service to Mercury. And there is no need to expand.<br>And a son of the potter (Abraham ibn al-Fahar/potter) composed a book on the end time and I also smashed his words, with a potter’s tool. Its time has not yet arrived! Though he hopes for a fixed time, it is past and in his words about matters of ending he tells us nothing.<br>Also the words of R Shlomo benGavriel, z”l. In Machberet Hagedolah(Bible lexicon, 12 cent?) he wanted to connect the end to the two upper stars.<br>Also the words of R Avraham Hanasi (mathematician and astronomer) in Sefer Qetsim. And the words of the potter and the words of R Yitschak benLev, and all who calculate words or letters in numerology–“all is vanity and chasing after wind.” (Ec 1:14) Because Daniel did not know the end. Let alone those who came after him. The angel only hinted, as I explain. Only he did not explain when it would be.<br>And now I return to explain.
