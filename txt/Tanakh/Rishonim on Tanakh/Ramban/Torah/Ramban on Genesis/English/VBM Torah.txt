Verse 22

Those things that are referred to in the upper worlds as the Tree of Life and the Tree of Knowledge are profound and awesome secrets.  The human transgressed by consuming the fruit of the upper Tree of Knowledge as well as the lower one, in both deed as well as in thought.  If the fruit of the tree was beneficial for man to eat and desirous for increasing knowledge, then why would He have withheld it from him?  Is not the Lord good and a bestower of good, who will not withhold goodness from those that walk in perfection?  As for the serpent, it does not possess the power of speech at the present time; if in fact the serpent could talk at the outset then it surely would have indicated at the time of the curse that it should henceforth become mute, for that would have constituted the most serious imprecation of all.  But all of these matters have double meanings, the revealed and the hidden are both true!
