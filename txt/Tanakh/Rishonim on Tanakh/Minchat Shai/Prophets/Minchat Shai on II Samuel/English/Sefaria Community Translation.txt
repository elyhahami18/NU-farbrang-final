1 Magdil. Migdol is the keri (the recited version of the Masoretic Text), and, in Psalms, [magdil] is the ketiv (the written version of the Masoretic Text), and the keri is Magdil with a chirik [i.e., short vowel sound producing 'i' as in 'big'], and there is a derash [i.e., rabbinic interpretation] in [Midrash] Shocher Tov, and see further in [the commentary of] Abudirham on Birkat HaMazon.

2 Ad olam. Ad at the end of the line, and olam at the beginning of a line. Otherwise, ad olam is at the end of a line, and the two words are considered as one word on account of the makkef ('hyphen'). The total of all the lines is 70 save the first verse, just like the counting of the song at [the pericope] Ha'azinu.
