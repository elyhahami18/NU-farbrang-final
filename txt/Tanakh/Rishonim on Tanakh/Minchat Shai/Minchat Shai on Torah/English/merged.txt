Verse 16

<b>And he tarried</b> It is written in the Sefer Mikhlol, at the end of the section on verb grammar, that the latter <i>mem</i> has a <i>qamaṣ</i> on account of the <i>shalsheleth</i> cantillation, becuase it follows the rule of pausals. And it is masoretically recorded about this that "there are seven cantillation marks of the Thundering and Pausing" <small>[translator's note: meaning, the cantillation mark <i>shalsheleth</i> appears seven times in the Tanakh, namely here, Genesis 24:12, Genesis 39:8, Leviticus 8:23, Isaiah 13:8, Amos 1:2, and Ezra 5:15]</small> . And thus I saw handwritten in some books. But "If he tarries, wait for him" (Habakkuk 2:3) has a <i>pathaḥ</i> on the second mem.
<b>In the mercy of</b> The <i>beth</i> is plosive.
