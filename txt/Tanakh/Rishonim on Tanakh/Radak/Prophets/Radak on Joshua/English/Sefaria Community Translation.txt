Radak on Joshua



Chapter 1



Chapter 2



Verse 1




<i><b>Zonah:</b></i> Like its literal sense [a prostitute]; or a seller of food, like the Targum Yonatan has it [<i>pundakita</i>], and that is with the [same] inflections as <i>tovah</i>. But the true opinion of Yonatan is that it is an actual prostitute. As such is his way, in some places, to translate <i>zonah</i> as <i>pundakit</i>. And so "two women who were <i>zonot</i>" (I Kings 3:16), [is translated in Targum Jonathan as] <i>pundakan</i> [even though it is obvious that they were prostitutes]. And this is even though he translated some of them as <i>nafkat bara</i> [a woman who goes out]. But his opinion is that [this word is used] because a <i>zonah</i> is like a seller of food, in that she makes herself available to all.

<b>They ate of the produce (meavor) of the country:</b> They ate matza and parched grain from the old grain, since the new grain was forbidden to them until after the bringing of the omer on the sixteenth of Nissan. And even for matza, matza is forbidden from the new grain... And from where did they have old grain? From that which the merchants of the [other] nations sold to them. And the word meavor proves that it was from the old grain. For I say that the grain that is from the year that passed (avrah) is called avor, and [grain from] the next year is called produce (tevuah).
<b>from the morrow of Passover:</b> That is the night of the fifteenth of Nissan and its day. For the Passover sacrifice is offered on the fourteenth, and its morrow is the fifteenth. And likewise, "on the fifteenth day of the first month - on the morrow of Passover - the Children of Israel went out of Egypt" (Numbers 33:3).

Verse 3

So you shall do for six days: Don't ask the reason for the decision of the Creator why there was need for this encircling, and the reason for the 7 priests, the 7 shofars, the 7 circles, and the 7 days. The reason for the circle with the teruah-blast is to separate the people that were in the city and the wall will fall under it, "So that all the nations of the land will know that Hashem is fighting for Israel, not with sword or spear..." The number 7 has great meaning in science - like the 7 altars and the 7 sacrificial cows. And 7 is also the chosen number for counting days and for the natural world.

<b>Joshua left alive (<i>hecheyah</i>):</b> As he commanded to keep the oath that the messengers swore to her, as he said (Josh. 6:17), "Only Rachav the harlot, etc." But one can also explain <i>hecheyah</i> [to mean] that he gave them nourishment (<i>micheyah</i>), money or an inheritance from which they could live. And this is [the meaning of] what it states, "and she dwelt among the Israelites." And this is the correct explanation. And there is a homily (<i>drash</i>) that Yehoshua took Rachav as a wife. And this is [the meaning of] <i>hecheyah</i>, as once they saw that Yehoshua took Rachav as a wife, some of the Jewish notables clung to the house of her father (and gave them assistance). And even though it is written about the seven peoples [of Canaan] (Deut. 7:4), "you shall not intermarry with them," they said that Rachav and the house of her father were foreigners and were not from the seven nations. And there is someone who says that went the spies that Yehoshua had sent entered Jericho, she converted - and the Israelites had not yet entered the Land [of Israel]. And all of this [last suggestion] is according to the [position] that holds that when it is written, "you shall not intermarry with them," it is [only] written about when they are in their state of being of the nations (as opposed to having converted).
