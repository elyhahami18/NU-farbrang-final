Verse 3

<b> To say to the house of the L<small>ORD</small> — </b> meaning, "in the house of the L<small>ORD</small>." And Targum Jonathan translates as "who were serving in the Holy Temple of the L<small>ORD</small>."
<b> And to the prophets — </b> Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi. And Targum Jonathan translates as "and to the scribes."
<b> Shall I weep — </b> because they still did not believe in the construction of the House because of the enemies who had forced the work for many years, and now, even though they heard that they had built it, they were of little faith and did not want to go up from Babylon, because they did not believe that the construction of the House was finished and stood because of the enemies. And they asked if they should fast on the Ninth of Av as they did during the seventy years.
<b> and shall I keep abstinent </b> That is to say, "should I abstain from food and drink and pleasure." And Targum Jonathan translates as "shall I refrain my soul from enjoyable things."

Verse 4



Verse 5

<b> Say — </b> They said "on the fifth and the severth" even though there are four fast days. It mentions the fifth because upon it was the destruction, and the seventh because in it Gedaliah was killed, and it was a second destruction, because already the poorest of the land remained and were not destroyed, since the poorest of the land were kept by Nebuzadaran to be vine dressers and ditch diggers (II Kings 25:12), but Gedaliah was killed on the first day of the seventh month, and since it was a holiday they declared a fast the day after.
<b> Did you fast Me, I? — </b> did you fast Me, meaning did you fast for Me, that is to say, if you fasted on Mu account, on account of your sins the Temple was destroyed and you were exiled. On account of this you fast. If you perform justice and righteousness, you will not need to fast, for the House will be built and you will go up from exile and dwell in the land all days. If you do good in My eyes you will not ever be exiled from it. And what is the purpose that the "I" after "did you fast Me" serves? It is meant to say "Did I command you to fast?" And the Targum Yonatan translates as "On the fast did you fast your fasting before Me?"

<b> And the word of the L<small>ORD</small> — </b> And if you do these things that I command you, says haShem of Hosts, then the fasts about which you asked if you should fast on those days, you will no longer fast, but rejoice on them, from all the good that will be yours.

Verse 19

<b> The fast of the fourth — </b> This is Tammuz, when they fasted in exile on the seventeenth of the month, the day that the city was broken into.
<b> And the fast of the fifth — </b> This is Av, when they fasted on the ninth.
<b> And the fast of the seventh — </b> This is the fast of Gedaliah, as we explained above. <b> And the fast of the tenth — </b> This is the Tenth of Tevet, when the king of Babylon began to besiege Jerusalem.
<b> Will be </b> All of these fasts <i> had been </i> kept for the house of Judah during the Second Temple period, because the Ten Tribes had not returned.
<b> And the truth and peace you will love </b> This will happen provided that you love the truth and peace as I commanded you.

And it shall come to pass on that day - on the day that he mentioned that there would be the sign, this is the matter, that there will not be light of yeqarot nor of qippa'on, and the interpretation by way of analogy is that the light of day will not be bright, which is the light of yeqarot, as in "the moon walks yaqar (in brightness)" (Job 31:26), and neither [will there be] light of qippa'on, which is frozen and thick, which is like darkness.  And the interpretation is that that day will not be neither all like light nor all like darkness, meaning neither comfortable nor troubling, but rather both of them will be in it. And likewise he (Zechariah) says after it (verse 7)"not day and not night."  And Jonathan translated, "there will not be light, but rather passing light and ice/thickness/congealment"

Verse 7



Verse 8



Verse 9


IN THAT DAY י-ה-ו-ה SHALL BE ONE, WITH ONE NAME — That is, all will recognize that God is one, and there is no other divinity; and so God’s name will be one - that is, they will not call by name another divinity throughout the world, only God’s name, God alone will they call. As it says earlier (Zech 13:2), “In that day, too—declares י-ה-ו-ה of Hosts—I will erase the very names of the idols from the land; they shall not be uttered anymore. And I will also make the ‘prophets’ and the impure spirit vanish from the land.” And the sage Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra (of blessed memory) explains our verse as referring particularly to the Explicit, Personal Name - the 4-Letter Name, the Tetragrammaton. Ibn Ezra writes, “WITH ONE NAME - this is The Glorious Name, that which became known through Moses our teacher, peace be upon him, and it will be expressed aloud then, in all mouths, as it is spelled.” (as of now, it is never spoken as written). And so too the great sage Rabbi Moses [ed: he’s likely referring either to Maimonides or Nachmanides, I’m not sure which and I couldn’t find the quote] also explains our verse as referring to the Explicit Personal Name. “Because all names attributed to God, may He be blessed, are names that define; whether they relate God’s actions to Him, or whether they try to point toward God’s wholeness and perfection. And when these many definitional names proliferate, some of the people start to think that God has many (separate) aspects, as many as the behaviors that these names describe. And this phenomenon, this confusion and doubt, the prophecy declares, is destined to be untangled when understanding reaches the people, the understanding that can release them from it. This prophecy says: “In that day י-ה-ו-ה shall be one, with one name.” That is, just as God is One, so too God will be called then by One Name only, the only name that denotes the Divine Essence alone, and not any definition or connotation.” So too, in Targum Yonatan, “There will be a revelation of the sovereignty of י-ה-ו-ה”.
