Radak on Amos



Chapter 1



Chapter 2



Verse 1

"Thus said the LORD... because he burned the bones of the king of Edom into lime." This is what is said in the book of Kings: "He took his firstborn son who was to reign after him and offered him up as a burnt offering on the wall. And there was a great wrath against Israel..." The wrath was from the king of Edom against Israel, from that day forward, since the king of Moab burned the son of the king of Edom...

Verse 2



Verse 3



Verse 4



Verse 5



Verse 6


Thus said the LORD...Because they have sold for silver Those whose cause was just: Even though Israel had transgressed the three worse sins (those being idolatry, sexual immorality, and bloodshed)-- for those, they did not receive the decree of destruction and exile at the hands of the king of Assyria-- rather, because of the חמס/violence, which is the fourth sin (mentioned in Amos), and on the basis of that sin they were punished for all their sins that they did. And this is the same as the generation of the flood. Even though they were guilty of several sins, they were not punished until they were guilty of חמס, as it says "כִּֽי־מָלְאָ֥ה הָאָ֛רֶץ חָמָ֖ס מִפְּנֵיהֶ֑ם for the earth is filled with lawlessness because of them" (Gen 6:13). And even more so because the חמס came at the hands of the judges, who were responsible for upholding justice, but they decided their rulings based on taking bribes, which is what עַל־מִכְרָ֤ם" בַּכֶּ֙סֶף֙ צַדִּ֔יק/Because they have sold for silver
those whose cause was just" means, and the explanation of "צַדִּ֔יק" in that verse is "one whose cause was just."
