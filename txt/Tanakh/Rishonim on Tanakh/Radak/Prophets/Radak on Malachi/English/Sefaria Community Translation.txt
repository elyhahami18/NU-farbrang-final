I will rebuke, against the devourer. Against the locusts which devours the produce.
and will not miscarry for you the vines. The vines will not miscarry its produce. (here we see classic example of Semitic languages have a different syntax that Germanic / Roman / Slavic which have Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) while as Semitic languages have Verb-Subject-Object (VSO), so Radak is reminding us to first find the subject and only then to translate the verb, and he is adding the word ''its fruit'', to helping us to figure out hidden object in the sentence.)
