<b><i>In the land of the living</i>:</b> And he called the world to come, <i>the land of the living</i>, even though the soul does not have a place, all the more so a land. Rather, it is since the good of the world to come is compared to the Garden of Eden, which is a place in the world. In order to make the listeners understand, it is said by way of a metaphor, just like the punishment of the evil is called Gehinnom, which is a place in the world near Jerusalem. And it was a disgusting place, and all the impurities and carcasses were dumped there, and there was a constant fire there to burn the impurities and the bones of the carcasses. That is why the punishment of the wicked is called Gehinnom by way of a metaphor. So the reward of the righteous is called the Garden of Eden, which is the most desirable place in the world. And it is called, <i>the land of the living</i>, because Adam was penalized with death when he was expelled from there. And the words of our rabbis, may their memory be blessed (Berakhot 4a): Why do dots appear over <i>were it not</i>? (So) Said David before the Holy One, Blessed be He: Master of the Universe. I have every confidence in You that You grant an excellent reward to the righteous in the future to come, but I do not know whether or not I have a portion among them; perhaps [my] sin caused [that I should lose it].

Verse 9



To my understanding, these two verses speak about Israel. "He who quieted the raging waters before Israel," who split the sea and brought them through its midst, "He will quiet the multitude of nations" and their raging, and will bring up Israel from their midst. Just as those who live at the ends of the earth saw the signs You made for them at the Parting of the Sea of Reeds -- as it says (Exodus.15.14) "Nations heard, they were frightened" -- so too, at the ingathering of exiles, they will be afraid of You and awed by Your signs once again. And just as You caused their hearts to shout for joy by "bringing out morning and evening" (Exodus.13.22) 'a pillar of cloud each day and a pillar of fire at night,' You will do the same for them at the ingathering of exiles.

Verse 1

<b>Psalm.</b> 
This psalm is spoken about the perplexity of the children of the world regarding the peace of the wicked and the suffering of the righteous in this world. This poet Asaf speaks about his own tongue or the tongue of every fool:
He says, <b>"Surely God is good to Israel."</b>
Even though they are in exile, God is good to them and will continue to preserve their good deeds. It is also good for those with a sincere heart among the other nations, even though they experience evil in this world, they will have goodness in the world to come. And the meaning of "surely" is that I truly know what will happen, for He will still bestow goodness upon them.

Verse 2

<b>"And I, I am leaning."</b> It is written as "netuy" and pronounced as "netivo," which is an action done by a fool in this context.
The word <b>"shafcha"</b> (she poured) is written with a "heh" at the end, which indicates the feminine gender, referring to each foot. However, the pronunciation is "shafchu," with a "vav" added, referring to the two feet that are shackled. The meaning of the verse is that my steps almost slipped from faith when I saw the well-being of the wicked. 
<b>I poured out.</b> I almost relinquished my faith in the land, meaning as if I stood without any support, that I did not stumble. The matter that kept me standing was so slight that it seemed as if it didn't exist. Therefore, he said "as if it were nothing."

Verse 3

<b>Among the fools.</b> They are the wicked because they engage in the pleasures of this world, which are folly and foolishness, and they do not care if they commit any evil to satisfy their desires. And I saw them prospering in peace, and because of this, I was consumed with envy until my feet almost stumbled.

Verse 4

<b>For there are no pains in their death.</b> They enjoy goodness throughout their lives, until the day of their death. Even at the time of their death, they pass away calmly without distress. The meaning of "pains" refers to ties or connections, and someone who dies in pain and difficulty is as if they have ties that bind them to the realm of the living, and those ties do not release easily but with great difficulty. However, they pass away in tranquility as if there are no ties binding them to their death.
<b> And yet they are healthy.</b> They are robust and vigorous.
<b> Body</b>It is said that God's hands are not empty. It means that during their lifetime, they have natural strength that is healthy and strong, and in their death, they die peacefully.

Verse 5

<b>In trouble.</b> The rest of the people, who live in trouble and hardship, are not included in their [the wicked's] category. They attain their livelihood and pleasure without trouble. And when afflictions and illnesses befall the rest of mankind, they are not affected by them.

Verse 6

<b>"Therefore..."</b> They will wear arrogance around their necks, like a necklace, and their pride will cover them like a garment of violence. This is expressed by the phrase <b>"Violence covers them as a garment."</b> They will constantly be enveloped in this garment of violence, just as a person wears their clothing all day long.

Verse 7

<b>"They protrude."</b> Due to excessive fat, their eyes appear as if they are bulging out, as if they have no eyes. Because of the thickness of their facial fat, their eyes are covered.
<b> They have passed the limits of their heart.</b> It is interpreted as a withdrawal from truth, and the heart is called deceitful because it contemplates things. In other words, whatever they contemplate in terms of the good things of the world, thinking that they will have more and more of them, will ultimately pass them by, contrary to what they had imagined.

Verse 8

<b>"Let them melt away."</b> This verse is a prayer or wish for the wicked to be dissolved or destroyed. The commentary states that the term "מנחי העי"ן" (literally "the guidance of the eye") is not found in Scripture, but rather in the words of our sages. Additionally, the term "מק בשרו" (literally "his flesh") refers to the act of multiplying or duplicating, which can be found in his work and others. 
"And they speak wickedly, oppression." They do not hesitate to speak of the injustice they commit, nor do they conceal it. Rather, they openly speak of their wickedness.
<b>"From on high."</b> It means that there is no higher authority that will punish them for this.

Verse 9

<b> They set </b> The emphasis, in place of the implication that they spoke about me and my late father with contempt, is explained as the doubling of the root "שתת" (to set or place), meaning their mouths were set in motion as if speaking in the heavens, indicating that they speak about God without knowledge of Him.
<b> And their tongue walks in the land. </b> In other words, their actions and words, which are carried out on Earth, are observed by Heaven.

Verse 10

<b>Return</b> The letter "י" in the word "ישוב" indicates that God settles and resides in it. The letter "ו" in "ישוב" signifies that God declares with it that He sees the tranquility of the wicked being repeatedly disrupted time after time.
<b> Here </b> This word is used as a warning, meaning "do not approach" or "do not come close." It implies that if one can find an argument against it to justify the judgment, they should present it.
And they will be satisfied with water. Without the specified detail, it means that a person will find a trembling-filled cup for them, indicating that they will find a drink that both satisfies and enlivens them. This refers to them finding refreshing and invigorating water to quench their thirst.

Verse 11

<b>And they will say.</b> This is the deception we have been mistaken about all day, not knowing what it is: 'And they will say, <b>'How does God know? Can the Most High have knowledge?'</b> The ways of human beings are in God's hands, and doesn't God have faithfulness? If God knows the ways of human beings, how can He bring calamity upon His people who walk in His ways? How can He favor those who deny Him and the wicked of the world? And if there is knowledge in the Most High, how will it be?

Verse 12

<b>Behold, these are the wicked</b> They are always at ease and they increase their wealth and honor.

Verse 13

<b>Surely</b> When I served him in vain, I gained nothing in my heart, and in vain did I cleanse myself with cleanliness, meaning my heart is pure and my actions are righteous, yet I am afflicted and not at peace.

Verse 14

<b> וָאֱהִ֣י</b> I am good, yet afflicted by the hand of the wicked.
<b> All day long.</b>  Every day: And also <b> in the mornings.</b>  Continuously, with every morning, I receive rebuke and affliction at their hands.

Verse 15

<b>If I have said it.</b> This is the statement of Asaph or any righteous person in every generation. If I have said it, I will recount this accusation as they say, "Generation of your children, behold, I have been unfaithful to you." The word "behold" is used in both early and later contexts. If I have said it, I will recount it like the generation of your children, "Behold, I have been unfaithful to you," and many others have done so in similar circumstances.

Verse 16

<b>And I considered it.</b> Behold, I refrained from recounting it orally, as they say, "How can God know?" And behold, it is toil in my eyes, meaning in the eyes of my heart, for I have turned and turned in this accusation, and I cannot find anything in my heart to understand what this is. And it is written "hu" (he), with a Yod (י) on the accusation and the response to it, and it is called "hu" (he) with a Vav (ו) on the matter, and the matter and the subject are one.

Verse 17

<b>Until.</b> I have pondered in my heart to understand this with great toil, and I have not found until I delved into the thoughts of my heart, to the sanctuary of God. And that is the world of angels and spirits, for there lies the ultimate reward, for the goodness of this worldly existence does not endure. But in the end, it is the world of souls where the righteous are examined, as our Father Avinu (Abraham) said about their ultimate state.

Verse 18

<b>Surely</b>. What you have assigned to them is only a temporary extension in this world, to bring them down to the world to come, just as one walks on a smooth path that appears to him as a good way, but with a slight stumble, his feet will falter and he will fall down. Likewise, in this world, their goodness does not endure over time, and even in their death, their goodness does not remain for their children after them. This is what is said in the following verse that follows it.

Verse 19

<b>How</b> All who see them will be astonished at them and will say, "How did they come to such ruin in an instant?"

Verse 20

<b>As a dream when one awakes.</b> Behold, they are like the dream you heard in the summer, where nothing from what you see in the dream can be found. Similarly, the wicked ones, now you will see their prosperity, but now they are no more.
<b>You shall despise their image in the city.</b> My late father, may he rest in peace, explained that in the city, just like in the city of the dead, their image, the image of the wicked, you shall despise, as the scripture says: "Some for eternal life, and some for shame and everlasting contempt." Their image can be interpreted, if desired, in relation to the body or the spirit, just as in our image, resembling us, or in both of them. 

Verse 21

<b>When.</b> Before I understood, my heart was filled with sourness in this matter, like the sourness of wine vinegar. In other words, I couldn't find anything sweet and pleasant in my heart to relieve me from the great distress.
<b>and I was pricked in my reins.</b> It is missing the letter "Bet" in the usage. He said, "And in my kidneys as well, which were advising and deliberating on this matter."
<b> Sharpened / pricked.</b> I was with them in a continuous cycle, engaging in dialogue and exchanging words between me and my children.

Verse 22

<b>then I was foolish</b>Before I understood, I was ignorant, and that person is one without knowledge, just as the Creator formed the beast....
<b>I was like a beast before Thee.</b> I served you, for I did not know if there is a reward or not.

Verse 23

<b>But I am continually with Thee:</b> And as I am always with you, devoted to you and engaged in your service, I diligently pursued wisdom, which helped me understand what it is. This is what it says:
<b>Thou holdest my right hand.</b>You have helped me and sustained me.

Verse 24

<b>with Thy counsel.</b> And as you have helped me in this, and guided me with your counsel, so may you always guide me with your counsel and teach me all the days of my life.
<b>and afterwards receive me to honourable state.</b> To part ways with life and let honor remain.
<b>To recieve me.</b> The translation of the phrase is as follows: "In other words, gather my honor to You; and the word 'other' is not attached to honor, and the melody separates between them. Therefore, it should be interpreted separately."
<b>Afterwards.</b> After my death.
<b>To recieve me.</b> Take my honor that illuminates the soul.

Verse 25

<b>Whom.</b> In the possession of false beliefs, there are those who believe in the sun or in one of the stars, but I have no desire except in You alone. I have not placed a partner for You, neither in heaven nor on earth.
<b>upon earth.</b> By the four elements, I mean that there are servants: water, air, and also earth.

Verse 26

<b>Fail.</b> When my remaining portion, which is announced, will come to an end, and my heart will cease, it is the living soul that is in the heart of every living creature.
<b>the strength of my heart</b>He (G-d) will not cease, and it is the existence of the heart, for the actions of the intellect will operate within it, and it is the form of my heart and my parts, which will be the Eternal G-d, for behold, my parts will be eternal because I have cleaved to you, but those who are far from you will perish

Verse 27

<b>Thou hast destroyed all those who go astray from Thee</b> Every wanderer from your paths shall be united with a sign, so that he shall not have a share in you after the death of the body.


Verse 28

<b>But as for me</b> The wicked are far away, and therefore they will perish. But I, who am near to God, have a good reward waiting for me. I will eagerly await your proximity, which brings good reward in this world and in you, my two refuges. Teach me to comprehend all your deeds, meaning all your actions, so that I may know and be able to recount and understand through the wisdom of nature, which is the knowledge of all your lower and higher physical actions. From there, I will ascend to know your deeds, and then I will attain sublime knowledge.

Good [It is good to praise the Name]: The Sabbath Day is better for praising the Name than the other days of the week.  For one is free of the business of the world and one's spirit rests from physical troubles.   The spirit occupies itself in Wisdom and the service of God.  And it is good to say [praise] to your name, O Exalted one.  For the exalted soul finds an opportunity to praise You, who are Exalted.

The mistake of their hearts and their hearts are negative so they didn't believe in Me.
They did not recognize all the miracles that I made for them, and they feared entering the Land. They did not trust in me. Therefore I swore that they would not enter there [Israel] and and die in the desert from 20 years and up.

1 "because [they defied the statements of God, spurned the intent of the Most High]."  [The Psalmist] informed them that they were taken captive on account of their iniquity, for they had "defied the statements/'imrei of God," which refers to the precepts that He had commanded to humanity.  It was not to Israel alone that commandments were issued, but also to all peoples.  He distinguished Israel from the (other) nations by commanding them concerning additional precepts, sanctifying them through the purity of body and food.  However, traditional precepts were granted to the first Man and his progeny (i.e., the Seven Noachide Laws).  These are "the statements of God."

There are manuscripts [of the book of Psalms] in which this verse [115:1] is not the beginning of the psalm. [In other words, those manuscripts join together Psalms 114 and 115.]. [The Psalmist] said that, just as You have performed acts of lovingkindness for our ancestors by taking them out of Egypt, so may you do for us in every generation.  Even though we are not worthy, do not do so 'for us' (115:1) but for your Name's sake.  For they [the generation of the Exodus] likewise would not have been worthy had it not been for the glory of Your name and [Your] covenant with the Fathers.  He says "not for our sake" twice in order to emphasize the point.

Verse 1

<b>Tehillah</b> (A Praise): These six psalms until the end of the book are all praises of the Blessed God and His glory. Therefore, they begin and end with praise, reflecting the greatness of praise. This psalm starts with the word "Tehillah" in the first verse and also concludes with "Tehillah" in the last verse. The other five psalms start and end with "Hallelujah," all highlighting the greatness of praise. When will the praise of God be truly great? It will be during the ingathering of the exiles when all people will witness the wonders that God performs for Israel. Therefore, the psalms mention the ingathering of the exiles and the rebuilding of Jerusalem. This psalm is a praise to the Blessed God. Consequently, it was composed in alphabetical order, but the letter "Nun" was omitted, and we do not know why. Our sages explained that it is because it contains a reference to the downfall of the enemies of Israel, as it is written, "She has fallen and will not rise again, etc." (Amos 5:2).  Anyone who contemplates this psalm will see the wonders of the Creator and His judgments upon His creations. Therefore, our sages said: Anyone who recites "A Praise of David" every day is assured of a place in the World to Come. They did not mean merely reciting it, but reciting it with one's mouth, heart, and tongue.
<b>I will extol Thee</b>: With my heart and my tongue, for You are truly the King. All other kings and rulers, both earthly and heavenly, are under Your dominion, and You are exalted above them. One who recognizes Your exaltedness will say, "My God," but in truth, You are the God of all flesh and the God of gods.
<b>For ever and ever</b>: This can mean that Your name exists forever and ever. Alternatively, it can mean that I will bless it forever and ever, meaning all the days of my life. Another interpretation is: "I will extol Thee" in this world, and "I will bless Thy name" in the World to Come, which is eternal. First, he says, "I will extol Thee," and then he says, "Thy name," to indicate that He and His name are one, and it is the Ineffable Name, while the other names are descriptive titles. The phrase is repeated for emphasis.

Verse 2

<b>Every day I will bless Thee</b>: In this world.
<b>And I will praise Thy name for ever and ever</b>: In the World to Come.

Verse 3

<b>Great is the Lord</b>: Even if one says, "I will magnify and praise Him," He is already great and praised beyond all praises to the extent that:
<b>And his greatness is unsearchable</b>: A person cannot comprehend it through much investigation, for it is unsearchable. Nevertheless, a person should praise Him according to their understanding.

Verse 4

<b>One generation to another</b>: Even if the lives of human beings were long, they would not be able to comprehend all of His greatness in their lifetimes, especially since their lives are short. What should they do given the brevity of their days? Since one generation passes away and another comes, the departing generation should recount to the next generation the wondrous deeds and mighty acts they witnessed during their lifetimes. Thus, the next generation will praise Him for what was told to them about the past and for what they will witness in their own time.

Verse 5

<b>Hadar</b> (Splendour): As I do, I will speak of them to the people of the world.
<b>The glorious splendour of Thy majesty</b>: This means the beauty of the honor of Your strength, for He is honored through His strength and His wonders, as it is said, "I will get me honor upon Pharaoh."
<b>And of Thy wondrous works</b>: That You have done for me, and they too will speak of them whenever they receive the kindness of God. They will recount it to many.

Verse 6

<b>And men shall speak of the might of Thy terrible acts</b>: Just as I will declare Your greatness, so too will they speak of the might of Your awe-inspiring acts. The word <b>greatness</b> is written with a yud, indicating plurality, to show that these acts are numerous to those who receive them. It is read as Your greatness in the singular because all are one to Him, the Blessed One. The names mentioned in this psalm—greatness, might, deeds, majesty, honor, goodness, righteousness, kingdom, wonders, and awe-inspiring acts—are ten in total, which pertains to a specific matter. However, each name does not necessarily correspond exactly to its specific mention. Each can also relate to the context of the others, but their parts are distinguished by different names from one another.

Verse 7

<b>The fame of Thy great goodness</b>: "Great" is a noun, not an adjective, as if it said, "the greatness of Your goodness."
<b>They shall utter</b>: They shall speak, as in "the lips shall speak."
<b>And shall sing of Thy righteousness</b>: They will proclaim it aloud before people.

Verse 8

<b>Gracious and compassionate</b>: These are the attributes by which He expresses His goodness and righteousness. They shall utter and sing of Him, for He is gracious, granting favor to creatures and providing for their needs, and compassionate, showing mercy and pity towards them, protecting them from harm and the world's afflictions.
<b>Slow to anger</b>: He delays His anger towards the wicked and does not punish them immediately.
<b>And of abundant love</b>: The "dalet" with a "kamatz" and a "chet" with a "patach" imply that His love is abundant, enlarging His kindness towards human beings more than they deserve.
[Adonai] is good to all.  He is good and merciful even to wild animals, domesticated animals, and fowl.  And so it is fitting for a person to follow these ways of His.  One should not destroy life other than for a need or to guard oneself from dangers.  So we find that our Holy Master (Rabbi Judah the Prince, editor of the Mishnah) bade his handmaiden not to sweep up mice with household embers.  Rather, she should let them live in the cellar.  He said to her, "It is written, 'His mercy is upon all His works.'"

Verse 9



Verse 10

<b>All Thy works shall praise Thee</b>: Even the various species of living creatures that lack knowledge to recognize the perfection of Your creation and the provision of their sustenance will praise You. Human beings who understand these things will also praise You as if they were all giving You thanks.
<b>And Thy pious ones shall bless Thee</b>: In the script of the "Hei," it is said, "And who are the thankful pious ones, for they are always contemplating Your deeds, and they shall bless You continually. For at all times, upon seeing the innovations that are constantly renewed in the creations and the repairs within life and growth, they shall bless You. So too did the sages establish a blessing for every matter according to its needs, as they said, 'When one sees this and this, they bless in this way.' And [it] said, 'And Your pious ones, for each kindness is of the utmost value, and for those who are always contemplating the work of the deity and they will bless him always at all times of contemplation are the pious.'

Verse 11

<b>Glory (כבוד)</b>: In those blessings they shall mention the glory of Your kingdom and Your power, for You are the king over all and the creator of everything, and with Your power and ability, You sustain all creatures.

Verse 12

<b>To Make Known (להודיע)</b>: And just as they bless and acknowledge among themselves, so they should make known to the sons of men Your mighty acts, which they do not know, and the glorious majesty of Your kingdom.

Verse 13

<b>Thy kingdom (מלכותך)</b>: It is not a kingdom of a human being that has an end either in his life or in his death, but the kingdom of the Almighty, may He be blessed, has no end, for His kingdom is the kingdom of all worlds, all times, and repeated in different words.

Verse 14

<b>The Lord upholds all that fall (סומך ה' לכל הנופלים)</b>: The Lord supports all those who fall, and the bowed down, who are the poor and oppressed, He raises up with His compassion.

Verse 15

<b>The eyes of all wait upon Thee (עיני כל אליך ישברו)</b>: "The eyes of all look expectantly to You." This means that all living beings, whom You have created, depend on You for their sustenance, for there are those that eat herbs, and those that eat seeds, and those that eat living creatures, like death. And all of them look to You, and hope in You, for You give them their food, and this is done through the chain of causation. And it says,  <b>in due season (בעתו)</b>: This is the language of singular, that every kind and type has its known time, when their food is prepared for them, and it says, "To You they shall break," and even though they do not have knowledge, they will eat according to their nature, the law given to them, and we know that to You is the hope, for You give and prepare

Verse 16

<b>Thou openest (פותח)</b>: This means that You give them their food abundantly, so that they are satisfied, each according to its desire.

Verse 17

<b>Righteous (צדיק)</b>: For with righteousness and fairness, He provides food for everyone. Even though He created living creatures to prey upon each other—like the cat for the mouse, the lion, bear, leopard, and other animals that prey on others, and likewise the birds that swoop down on other birds—everything is just from Him. For He also provides food for the predators during their lives. However, when their time comes to die, He has decreed in advance that some will die from being hunted by other animals, and others will die from natural causes.
<b>And gracious in all his works (וחסיד בכל מעשיו)</b>: He provides for them beyond what He is obligated to give, and they are not deserving of receiving it. Rather, His grace prevails over them.

Verse 18

God is close to all who call Him. From whichever people that they may be, provided that they call Him in truth in mouth and heart are equal.

Verse 19

<b>He will fulfil the desire of those who fear him (רצון יראיו) </b>: He will truly call upon Him and fulfill their desires in what they ask of Him. He will hear their cry and save them from distress that may come upon them in the world or that comes to them to atone for their sins.

Verse 20

<b>The Lord preserves all those who love him (שומר ה' את כל אוהביו)</b>: He is good to those who fear Him, for they love Him without expectation of reward or fear of punishment, but purely out of love. He guards them so that no calamity will ever come upon them, and so it will be with all Israel in the future. <b>But all the wicked he will destroy (ואת כל הרשעים ישמיד)</b>: There will not remain a wicked person forever, as it says: "And all the arrogant evildoers will be chaff; the day that is coming will set them ablaze."

Verse 21

<b>My mouth shall speak the praise of the Lord (תהלת ה' ידבר פי)</b>: When I come to life with the dead, then my mouth shall speak the praise of the Lord, and then all flesh will bless His holy name. My intention is to say that all humans alone and not the other lower animals, so she was the mother of all life, speaking.

Chapter 146



Verse 1

<b>אהללה ה' בחיי. "I will praise the Lord while I live."</b>: Seeing in the Holy Spirit the ingathering of exiles, he spoke on behalf of Israel, saying, "Hallelujah," and likewise to his own soul, "Praise the Lord with them and without them."
<b>אהללה ה'. "Praise the lord"</b>: Now, while I am still alive, I will praise Him and sing to Him and proclaim Him in public. And he said to them:

Verse 2



Verse 3

<b>אל תבטחו. "Do not trust"</b>:, as Jeremiah said, "and from them their heart departs" (Jeremiah 17:5). If one trusts in a person, they should place the primary trust in God, who puts it in the heart of the generous person to help. The idea is repeated with different words: "in whom there is no help," meaning that if it is not God's will, a person cannot save his fellow from distress. For salvation belongs to God alone, and He brings it about through people, just as He brought about the salvation from the Babylonian exile through Cyrus. Similarly, in the future, He will bring about the redemption of Israel through the kings of the nations, stirring their spirits to send them, as it is written, "And they shall bring all your brethren out of all the nations for an offering unto the Lord" (Isaiah 66:20). This will happen because Israel trusted in God alone during their exile.

Verse 4

<b>תצא רוחו. "His breath goes forth"</b>: And how can a person have salvation if he does not have control over his spirit to preserve it? For his spirit may depart suddenly, and he returns to his earth. Whatever he plans to do, he will not be able to accomplish, for once his sustaining spirit departs, on the day of his death, his thoughts perish.

Verse 5

<b>אשרי שאל יעקב בעזרו."Happy is he who has the God of Ya῾aqov for his help"</b>: He mentioned Jacob our forefather because he trusted in God, as his brother sought to kill him and he fled from him. Jacob trusted in his heart that God would provide for his needs, even as he went towards him, for God had said to him that He would give him bread to eat and clothes to wear. Similarly, the children of Israel, who trusted in God, were brought out of exile by Him. This repeats the idea using different words.

Verse 6

<b>עושה שמים."who made heaven"</b>: In Him it is fitting to trust, for He makes everything and has the power to elevate and humble, and to do with His creations as He wills. "Earth" refers to the dry land, thus he mentioned the sea as well. The meaning of <b>ואת כל אשר בם. "and all that is in them"</b> is related to the three mentioned elements: in the heavens, the angels and the great hosts, and the seven ministers; on the earth, the animals and birds; and in the sea, the great sea creatures and all living beings that move therein. He fulfills the needs of all of them. He is the one who keeps truth forever, meaning He keeps His promises for a long time, as He did for Israel. He promised to bring them out of exile, and after they had been there for a long time, until all the nations despaired of their redemption, He brought them out. Thus, you see that He alone is worthy of trust.

Verse 7

<b>עושה משפט לעשוקים."Who executes judgment "</b>: In every generation, He executes judgment for the oppressed against their oppressors. Similarly, He will act on behalf of Israel, who are oppressed in Babylon, as it is said, "The children of Israel and the children of Judah are oppressed together," and all their captors hold them fast, refusing to let them go.
<b>נותן לחם לרעבים."who gives bread to the hungry"</b>: In every generation, He gives bread to the hungry. Likewise, He did for Israel in exile and upon their departure from exile through the deserts, as it is said, "They shall neither hunger nor thirst, nor will the desert heat or the sun beat upon them."
<b>ה' מתיר אסורים."The Lord looses the prisoners"</b>: In every generation, the Lord looses the prisoners. Similarly, He did for Israel by releasing them from the bondage of their exile.

Verse 8

<b>ה' פוקח עורים. "The Lord opens the eyes of the blind"</b>: Those who are blind from an eye disease, He will heal them. This ailment is mentioned because blindness, like imprisonment, prevents a person from moving from their place. Alternatively, it can mean those blinded by extreme distress, as suffering is likened to darkness and salvation to light. There are many verses in Scripture that attest to this. Similarly, He did for Israel, who were blinded in exile, as it is said, "We grope for the wall like the blind, and we grope as if we had no eyes; we stumble at noonday as in the night."
<b>ה' זוקף כפופים. "The Lord raises those who are bowed down"</b>:, meaning the poor, as we have explained.
<b>ה' אהב צדיקים."The Lord loves the righteous"</b>:, and similarly, He loved Israel who were righteous among the nations.

Verse 9

<b>ה' שומר את גרים. "The Lord preserves the strangers (or the converts)."</b>: The stranger (or the convert), the orphan, and the widow are weak because they have no helper, and He guards them. Therefore, the Torah warns about them in several places, and the Lord protects them. Similarly, He guards Israel, who were strangers among the nations and weak like an orphan and a widow.
<b>יעודד.</b>: This means He will elevate them.
<b>ודרך רשעים יעות. "but the way of the wicked he makes crooked"</b>: Just as He elevates the weak, He will make the way of the wicked crooked; they will be pushed away and fall on it.

Verse 10

<b>ימלוך. "(He) Reigns"</b>: And when will this be? When the Lord reigns forever, your God, O Zion, from generation to generation, as it is said, <b>"And the Lord shall be king over all the earth,"</b> (Zechariah 14:9) meaning the entire world will recognize His kingship. Zion is mentioned because from there, instruction will go forth to the whole world, and they will acknowledge Him as king over everything after He executes judgment on the wicked, as in the Valley of Jehoshaphat. Or when the Lord reigns, all the people of the world will praise the Lord (Haleluya) and recognize His kingship, and then your song will be good and pleasant, and your praise will be perfect.

<b>The storm wind executing His word:</b> That is the air that blows. And when it blows strongly, it knocks over tall cedars, buildings and ships on the sea. And it states, "executing His word," to make known that it is not by happenstance. Rather He commands it to blow, and it is by His word and His commandment that it blows, to punish those that encounter [it].
