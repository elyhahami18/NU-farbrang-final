Verse 11

(1) MISSIM. It is from the double-letter root, mem-samech-samech. It it like (Lev. 2:6), "Break it into bits" [patot otah pittim], from peh-tav-tav. [and thus the tav in pittim has a dagesh, since it comes from a doubled tav.] 
(2) STOREHOUSES. As in (Isa. 22:15), "to that steward, that Shebna, in charge of the palace."

Verse 12

(1) THE MORE THEY INCREASED [KEN YIRBEH -- a future tense]. Like "the more they increased" [ken hirbah -- past tense] as previously. 
(2)

Verse 13



Verse 14

(1) ALL TASKS IN THE FIELD.  Plowing and harvesting. 
(2) ALL THEIR LABORS [ET KOL AVODATAM]. With [im] all their labors.  
(3) THAT THEY MADE THEM PERFORM in the city WITH RIGOR.

Verse 15

TO THE MIDWIVES OF THE HEBREWS.  To the midwives who were themselves Hebrews.

Verse 16

(1) ...
(2) SHE WILL LIVE [VAHAYAH]. The accent is on the penultimate, as we get "shavah" from "shav." From "Arpachshad had lived" [hai] (Gen. 11:12), for the feminine, "hayah." However, in "even if the other had lived [hayah] 1000 years twice" (Eccl. 6:6), the accent is on the ultimate syllable, and it is masculine, of the form of asah, alah, ra'ah.

Chapter 2



Verse 1



Verse 2


ותרא SHE SAW THAT HE WAS GOOD AND SHE HID HIM: The explanation that she hid him because of [something special] that she saw in him is false. All babies elicit the compassion of their mothers. Rather one must explain [the verb] SHE SAW (ותרא) like in the verse (Gen. 1:31), "God saw (יארע) all that he had made and found it very good." There the phrase means that [God] looked and examined all His works and His actions that He had done to see whether there was something to correct therein; everything was proper and correct. Here also, since Moses was born [prematurely] after [a pregnancy of only] six months--just as we find that Samuel was born [after a six-month pregnancy, as it is written (I Sam. 1:20) לתקופות הימים i.e. after two tequfot and two [more] days. That is why she [Moses' mother] was able to hide him for three months, for the Egyptians used to check the pregnant women [only at the anticipated end of a full term pregnancy] at the end of nine months. Accordingly, [since he was born so prematurely] she examined him when he was born to see whether he was a stillborn that need not be hidden. But she saw that he was fine and good-looking, for his signs of maturity, which are his hair and fingernails--as we learned in Yevamot (80b )--were completed. So she knew that he was capable of surviving 
She hid him for three months--i.e. until the end of [what would have been a pregnancy of nine months, which is the standard length of pregnancy for most women. When they came to check on her either she told them that the child had been a stillborn or that the Egyptians had already thrown him into the river.

Verse 5



Verse 6

(1) SHE OPENED IT AND SAW THE CHILD. The one who explains this as that she saw the child is mistaken. For doesn't everybody know that, if she opened the basket, she would see the child? Rather, this is its explanation: she opened the basket and looked at the child to see whether it was male or female, and she saw that it was a na'ar. In other words, this child is male and not female. And she saw on his maleness [i.e., his penis] that he was circucised, and so he was [intentionally] hidden and was not a foundling [i.e., abandoned]. For if he had been a girl, it would stand to reason that he was a foundling. And in fact we have found that it is written (Jud. 13:8), "What shall we do with the na'ar who is to be born?" -- on the day of his birth, he is [already] called a na'ar.  
(2) HERE THERE WAS A BOY CRYING, AND SHE HAD COMPASSION ON HIM, ETC. It was because he was crying that she had compassion on him. And because she saw a na'ar, male and circumcised, she said, "This must be a Hebrew child." It is similar to the following (I Sam. 1:5), "And to Hannah, he would give an apayim portion [JPS: one portion only]" -- a choice portion. Why? "Because [JPS: although] he loved Hannah," and thus he gave her apayim from the platter that was in front of him. If so, why a single portion? Because Adonai had closed off her womb, but to P'ninah and all her daughters and sons, he gave "portions" -- many -- because she had many children. "And she saw the child, that he was a na'ar, crying."

Verse 7

V'TEINIK. This is an expression of causation [hiph'il]. [And it would be] v'teinak if she herself were nursing.

(1)  DO YOU MEAN TO KILL ME for my beating my fellow 
(2) AS YOU KILLED THE EGYPTIAN for his beating a Hebrew? 
(3) ACHEN. Ach ken [However, so], not as I initially supposed when I buried him in the sand, that it would not become known, rather it has indeed become known. 


Verse 15



Verse 16

THE PRIEST OF MIDIAN ... TO R'U'EL, the father of THEIR FATHER (v. 18).  If so, their father's name is Yitro, and Hovav, the son of R'u'el, who is mentioned below in Parashat B'ha'alot'cha (Num. 10:29) -- "Moses said to Hovav son of R'u'el" -- Hovav and Yitro are the same.  And if R'u'el is Yitro, then he [Hovav] was Yitro's son.  But what is written in the Prophets (Jud. 4:11) -- "descendants of Hovav, father-in-law of Moshe" -- proves that Hovav is Yitro, since all other mentions of "Moshe's father-in-law" mention Yitro.

Verse 21



Verse 22

IN A FOREIGN LAND.  For this is the meaning of Gershom -- stranger [ger] there [sham], in a distant land.

Chapter 3



Verse 1

MOSES, TENDING THE FLOCK ETC.  The Holy One, blessed be He, appeared to him and commanded him to return to Egypt, and Moshe did not want to do so, because he was afraid until the Holy One, blessed be He, told him, "all the men who sought to kill you are dead" -- this is Par'oh, who had died.  That is why it says (Exod. 2:23), "the king of Egypt died," to testify to what the Holy One, blessed be He, said, that "all the men ... are dead."  This is similar to (Gen. 9:18) "Ham being the father of Canaan."

Verse 2



Verse 3



Verse 4



Verse 5

REMOVE.  Cast off.  From the root (Deut. 7:1), "He dislodges many nations."  As one says from "nasa" "s'u."  So one says "sa" as an imperative, and also "shal" -- "remove it."

Verse 6



Verse 7



Verse 8

I HAVE COME DOWN here to speak to you in order TO RESCUE THEM FROM THE EGYPTIANS.

Verse 9



Verse 10

FREE MY PEOPLE, THE ISRAELITES, FROM EGYPT.  Through the words that you will speak to Par'oh from me.

Verse 11

(1) MOSHE SAID, "WHO AM I?"  Anyone who wants to stick to the plain meaning of these passages will gain from my explanation, for those who preceded me did not understand it at all.  Moshe responded to two things that the Holy One, blessed be He, said to him -- to go to Par'oh and to bring the Israelites out at Par'oh's behest.  And Moshe responded first to the first thing:  (2) WHO AM I THAT I SHOULD GO TO PAR'OH?  Even to bring him a tribute and an offering?  And am I fit to enter into the king's palace, a foreigner like me?  (3) AND THAT I SHOULD FREE THE ISRAELITES FROM EGYPT?  In other words, even if I were fit to go in to Par'oh, I am a fool for the other matters -- what word acceptable to Par'oh should I say?  And is Par'oh a fool that he should heed me and send away, free, from his land, a multitude of people who are his slaves?  And what acceptable word can I say to him with which I can free them from Egypt under his authority?  And the Holy One, blessed be He, responded to him first to the first thing, and said:

Verse 12



Verse 13



Verse 14

GOD SAID TO MOSHE.  If you do not know My name, I will tell you, that My name is "Ehyeh l'olam" [I will be forever], and I am capable of fulfilling what I promise you.  And now that I have told you that My name is Ehyeh, this is what you should say to Israel:  "Ehyeh sent me to you."

Verse 15

(1) GOD SAID FURTHER TO MOSHE.  It is not appropriate that they should call Me by My name in all of their discourse, as we call kings by their names, but rather "ADONAI, THE GOD OF YOUR ANCESTORS, ETC.," for that is an expression of lordship and kingship, as people say to kings, "Let the king live" (I Sam. 10:24), or "The king commanded me on a matter" (I Sam. 21:3)  
(2) THIS SHALL BE MY NAME FOREVER.  "Ehyeh," which is mentioned in the first verse.  ...
(3) THIS MY APPELLATION.  "Adonai," which is mentioned in the second verse, which is an expression of kingship, and in this matter, we mention the kings, and not by their name.  And what is written with "Yah," I will explain in AT-BaSH [a substitution code where Alef becomes Tav, Bet becomes Shin, etc.]:  [He calls Himself "Ehyeh," but we call Him "Yihyeh" [[should be "Yahveh"]], "vav" in place of "yod," as in (Eccl. 2:22), "What does a man get [mah hoveh la'adam]?"]  This is the essential deep plain meaning of these texts, and we do not reveal them except to the discreet.

Verse 16



Verse 17



Verse 18

GOD OF THE HEBREWS [HA'IVRIM].  Since they came here from across [me'ever] the river, and it is the god of their kingdom that they must worship.

Verse 19

YET I KNOW ETC.  Do not grow faint-hearted because in the beginning, he does not heed My call to let them go, and his not doing so is because of his great might, for he cannot prevail against Me.  For I will stiffen his mind, in order to exert My power first, so that everyone will know that My power prevails, and they will know through My wonders that I am the LORD, and that prevailing is in my control.


Verse 20



Verse 21



Verse 22

(1) EACH WOMAN SHALL ASK OF HER NEIGHBOR.  As an absolute and final gift, for it is written (v. 21), "I will dispose them favorably toward this people."  Similar to (Ps. 2:8), "Ask it of Me, and I will make the nations your domain."  This is the essential plain meaning, and a refutation to the Apikorsim.  
(2) VESSELS OF SILVER AND VESSELS OF GOLD.  Ornaments for the glory of the festival that you shall celebrate in the wilderness.  
(3) AND YOU WILL PLACE them ON YOUR CHILDREN.

Verse 9

AND THE WATERS WILL BE, ETC.  Doubling [of "will be"] as with (Ps. 93:3), "The ocean sounds, O LORD, the ocean sounds its thunder" [and] (Ps. 94:3), "How long shall the wicked, O LORD, how long shall the wicked exult?"

Verse 10

SLOW OF SPEECH AND SLOW OF TONGUE.  I am not expert in the Egyptian language, in the precision of expression, for I fled from there in my youth, and I am now 80 years old.  And we find this in Ezekiel (3:4-6), that one who is not expert in the kingdom's language is referred to this way, as it is written, "Then [God] said to me, “Mortal, go to the House of Israel and repeat My very words to them.  For you are sent, not to a people of unintelligible speech and difficult language, but to the House of Israel -- not to the many peoples of unintelligible speech and difficult language, whose talk you cannot understand, etc."  And is it possible that a prophet whom Hashem had known face to face, and who had received the Torah from His hand to his own hand would stutter in his language?  And there is no such statement in the words of the Tannaim or the Amoraim, and we need not pay attention to outside literature.

Verse 11



Verse 12



Verse 13

THROUGH WHOMEVER YOU SEND [B'YAD TISHLAH].  Through whomever You choose to send, but not me.

Verse 14

(1) ADONAI BECAME ANGRY WITH MOSHE.  And the anger leaves a mark, according to the plain sense, as it says below (v.24), "Adonai encountered him and sought to kill him," as I have explained in connection with Ya'akov, who was made to limp on his hip.   
(2) BECAUSE HE SPEAKS READILY.  He grew up there and is articulate in the Egyptian language.

Verse 15



Verse 16

(1) HE SHALL SPEAK FOR YOU [LACH; lit., "to you"].  On your behalf [bish'vil'cha].  
(2) YOU PLAYING THE ROLE OF GOD TO HIM [YOU WILL BE AS GOD TO HIM].  As an official and a judge -- whatever you command him, he will do.

Verse 17



Verse 18

RETURNED from the wilderness TO YETER HIS FATHER-IN-LAW.

Verse 19

ADONAI SAID TO MOSHE IN MIDIAN.  Where he had settled when he fled Par'oh and settled in Midian, as it is written (Exod. 2:15), "And [he] fled Par'oh and he settled in ... Midian."  And now He said to him, "Return, for that Par'oh who tried to kill you is dead."  And now He said to him in Midian that that Par'oh and the informers had died, as it is written above (2:23), "the king of Egypt died," after Moshe's flight.

Verse 20



Verse 21



Verse 22



Verse 23



Verse 24

ADONAI -- the angel -- ENCOUNTERED HIM.  Because he was dilatory in his traveling, and he brought his wife and sons with him.

Verse 25

(1) FLINT.  As in (Josh. 5:2), "flint knives," a honed blade, a strong knife.  Similarly (Ps. 89:44), "You have turned back the blade of his sword" -- the point of his sword became blunt and bent and thus did not sustain him in battle.  
(2) AND SHE CUT, ETC.  The mitzva was effective to save Moshe like a sacrifice, as Gidon and Manoah did when angels appeared to them (Jud. 6:21-23, 13:19-23).  
(3) SHE TOUCHED [VATAGA].  This is a hiph'il, but (Job 1:19) "it struck [vayiga] the four corners of the house" is a po'el:  it struck.  HIS LEGS.  Moshe's; the angel was appeased by this.  For I do not want to interpret this as "the angel's legs," for who knows whether she saw the angel's legs?  
(4) YOU ARE TRULY A BRIDEGROOM OF BLOOD TO ME.  He will remain my hatan because of this blood.  
(5) MY HATAN [BRIDEGROOM].  My husband.

Verse 26

(1) HE -- the angel -- LET GO OF HIM.  From (Job 19:9) "the day is waning [rafah] towards evening," comes "he let go [vayiref] of him"; [likewise] from kanah, vayiken.  
(2) THEN SHE SAID, "A BRIDEGROOM OF BLOOD BECAUSE OF THE CIRCUMCISION."  My husband was liable for the death penalty for delaying the circumcision, for the circumcision has saved him now.

Verse 27

GO TO MEET MOSHE. To fulfill what the Holy One, blessed be He, had said to him [Moshe] (v. 14). "Even now he is setting out to meet you, and he will be happy to see you."


Chapter 5



Verse 1



Verse 2

WHO IS ADONAI THAT I SHOULD HEED HIM AND LET ISRAEL GO -- for they are my slaves, from my land -- to worship Him?  What stake does He have in this people that they should serve Him?


Verse 3

THEY ANSWERED, "THE GOD OF THE HEBREWS, ETC."  In other words, the people of Israel came from across the river to reside here, and this is the God of those from across the river, and they are His people and must worship Him, "lest He strike us, etc."

Verse 4



Verse 5



Verse 6

TASKMASTERS [NOG'SIM].  Officials appointed over the overseers [shotrim], as with (Deut. 16:18) "magistrates and officials" [shoftim v'shotrim] -- [the shoftim] are appointed to command the shotrim, and the shotrim have dominion over the people to do what the shoftim command.

Verse 7



Verse 8

(1) THE QUANTITY.  The quota.  
(2) THEY ARE SHIRKERS.  And they can do more.

Verse 9

PAY ATTENTION.  Intendant in the vernacular.  As in (Gen. 4:4), "[Adonai] paid heed to Hevel," and (Isa. 17:8), "They shall not turn to the altars."

Verse 10



Verse 11

THERE SHALL BE NO DECREASE [NIGRA'].   A kamatz [under the resh makes it the equivalent of] garua, a past participle expression [i.e., present tense -- it is not decreased].  But if [the vowel] were a patah, it would be a past tense.  Similarly, "nisgav" (Isa. 12:4) with a kamatz [is present tense], but "nisgav" (Isa. 2:11) with a patah is past tense.  And if the word [in our verse] had been past tense, it should have written "ki lo nigra'" [rather than "ki ein nigra'"], with a patah.

Verse 12



Verse 13



Verse 14



Verse 15



Verse 16

(1) STRAW IS NOT GIVEN.  A kamatz [under the tav makes it the equivalent of the past participle in the present tense] ein natun [it is not given], but "nitan" with a patah is past tense: (Eccl. 10:6) "Folly was placed [nitan, with a patah]."  
(2) FAULT IS WITH YOUR OWN PEOPLE.  If [the letter tet in hatat] has a dagesh and a kamatz, one must explain it thus:  "We are being beaten, but after all, the sin is being done by your people."  But if it were "hatat" with a patah, its meaning would be "the sin of your people."

Verse 17



Verse 18



Verse 19



Verse 20



Verse 21



Verse 22

(1) MOSHE RETURNED TO the place where He had been speaking with him.  
(2) WHY DID YOU BRING HARM.  [The accent in "lamah" is on the mem] because it is juxtaposed to a heh.  
(3) WHY DID YOU BRING HARM ON THIS PEOPLE.  And if You say that they were liable because of their many sins, and they do not deserve to be redeemed, if so, WHY DID YOU SEND ME if they are not fit for redemption and to be saved.

Chapter 6



Verse 1

HE SHALL RELEASE THEM WITH FORCE.  Whether or not the Israelites wish, he will ultimately expel them from their land, as it is written (Ex. 12:33), "The Egyptians urged the people on, impatient to have them leave the country."

Verse 2


My name means that I have the ability to carry out my promise.

Verse 3


One must explain it thus: I appeared to them as El Shaddai, but My basic name is YHVH.  And there is a duplication of language.
I did not reveal Myself to them by My basic name, but rather by El Shaddai.  But to you I have revealed My basic name -- Ehyeh, and what I am called -- YHVH.  And in your days I will carry out My promise to give them the land of C'na'an.  And "sh'mi" is linked to what precedes it, as I have explained.  And if it were written "Lo hoda'ti lahem," then it would refer [below]: "USh'mi YHVH lo hoda'ti."

(1) IT IS THE SAME AARON AND MOSES this Aharon who is mentioned, who was born before Moshe, and this Moshe and Aharon TO WHOM THE LORD SAID.

Verse 27

 (1) IT WAS THEY WHO SPOKE ETC. THESE ARE THE SAME MOSES. For in connection with speaking, he is first and Aharon is after him, while in connection with births, it places Aharon before Moshe, and with respect to speaking, it places Moshe before Aharon.

Chapter 7



Verse 1



Verse 2

AND HE WILL RELEASE.  Aharon will tell him to release THE ISRAELITES FROM HIS LAND.

Verse 3

(1) AND THE EGYPTIANS SHALL KNOW THAT I AM ADONAI. Lord and Ruler, for up until now they said, "I do not know Adonai."

Verse 12



Verse 13



Verse 14

KAVED. Par'oh hardened his mind, as I explained above (v.13). For from intransitive verbs that [in the vav hahipuch past tense] are of the form vayishman, vayichbad, vayishpal, vayizkan, vayeh'kam, and from them in the [regular] past [or perfect] it would be said zaken, kaved, shamen, and shapel rom anashim, all of them past tense expressions.

Verse 15



Verse 16



Verse 17



Verse 18



Verse 19



Verse 20



Verse 21

DIED [MEITAH].  The accent is penultimate, because this is past tense.  But "I shall die" [meitah anochi - Gen. 30:1] is future tense, and the accent is ultimate.  And in "Rahel died on me" [meitah alai Rahel - Gen. 48:7], the accent is penultimate and it is past tense.

Verse 22



Verse 23

EVEN FOR THIS. For Par'oh's mind had already strengthened on its own, and now also it was strengthened automatically. However, in connection with the frogs, where it is written (8:11), "v'hachbed [he hardened] his mind," for he himself intended to harden his mind. Therefore it is written in connection with the Arov (8:28), "Par'oh hardened [vayachbed] his mind this time also," for he had already hardened his mind another time.

Verse 5

(1) YOU MAY HAVE THIS TRIUMPH [HITPA'ER] Exalt yourself OVER ME.  To ask your desires and I will comply, as in (Jud. 7:2), "Israel might claim for themselves the glory due to Me, thinking, ‘Our own hand has brought us victory.’"  
(2) FOR WHAT TIME SHALL I PLEAD IN BEHALF OF YOU.  For what day and what time do you wish that all the frogs withdraw, and I will immediately plead that they die up through the time that you request of me, since it is not ordinary for all of them to die at one time.

Verse 6



Verse 7



Verse 8



Verse 9



Verse 10



Verse 11

HE MADE IT HARD [HACHBED].  Because this plague was great, his mind did not strengthen by itself, rather, he affirmatively acted wrongly to harden his mind.

Verse 12



Verse 13

VERMIN [HAKINAM].  [The mem is] like the mem of "reikam."  (Gen. 31:42).

Verse 14



Verse 15



Verse 16



Verse 17

SWARMS OF INSECTS [HE'AROV].  I say that these are kinds of wolves that are called "arov," because it is their way to hunt at night, as it is written (Jer. 5:6), "The wolf of evenings [aravot -- JPS: the desert] ravages them," and (Zeph 3:3) "wolves of evening [erev - JPS: the steppe], They leave no bone until morning."  And just as from "odem" [redness] one says "adom" [red], similarly one says from "adam" "adom" and from "omek" [depth] "amok" [deep], from "erev" "arov," "nuitrend" in the vernacular.  For the wolf is an arov in that it goes out in the evening.  "Emek" is a noun, and the action is called "amok," and likewise "adom" and "shahor."

Verse 18

I WILL SET APART.  Because the bad animals move quickly from country to country once the plague is sent, it was necessary to say language of differentiation and separation more than with other plagues.  And the same is true with the plague of livestock.  


Verse 19

(1) I WILL MAKE A DISTINCTION.  An expression of differentiation.  And similarly, "salvation," "saving," "extraction," and "deliverance" -- they are all expressions of differentiation and separation between this and that.  (2) IT WILL BE TOMORROW.  So that you will not say that it happened to us by chance.

Verse 20



Verse 21



Verse 22

(1) UNTOUCHABLE TO THE EGYPTIANS. Sheep were a disgusting thing in the land of Egypt. 
(2) WILL THEY NOT STONE US? A rhetorical question. This would in a despising way, as it is written with respect to Shim'i (II Sam. 16:13), "Shim'i walked alongside on the slope of the hill, insulting him as he walked, and throwing stones at him and flinging dirt."

Verse 23



Verse 24



Verse 25

I WILL PLEAD.  Like (Num. 21:2) "I will proscribe" [v'haharamti], (Lev. 25:35) "and you hold" [v'hehezakta], (Ovad. 8) "I will make them vanish sages from Edom" [v'ha'avad'ti],  (Ezek. 26:3) "I will lift up" [v'ha'aleiti], (Zech. 3:4); we have interpreted each of them as future, and [because] they have a patah [under the initial heh].  Similarly, (Jer. 17:4) "I will make you a slave" [v'ha'avad'ticha], for the letters [the initial letter of the root being a guttural] determines this.  However, in the past tense, one says, "I have removed [he'evarti] your sin from you," (Micah 6:4) "I have brought you up" [he'eliticha], and "he'evad'ticha" [see Job 14:19]; all of these are vocalized with "patah katan" [segol].  But with other letters [as the first letter of the root], one says, (Micah 5:12-13) "I will destroy" and "I will tear down" [v'hichrati, v'hishmad'ti], all of them with a hirik, whether past or future.

MY PLAGUES.  Various kinds of injuries and blows -- fire, hail, hailstones, brimstone, snow, and smoke. 

Verse 15

I COULD [HAVE STRETCHED OUT MY HAND].  At the time of the livestock plague, I had it in mind to stretch out my hand against you and your people, to die in the plague, and you would have been eliminated from the land.  

Verse 16

NEVERTHELESS I HAVE SPARED YOU FOR THIS PURPOSE: IN ORDER TO SHOW YOU MY POWER, ETC.  To inform you of your foolishness, in your saying (5:2), "I do not know Adonai.

CAME POURING DOWN.  An expression of pouring out, as in (Ezek. 22:22), "As silver is melted [k'hituch] in a crucible, so shall you be melted [tut'chu] in it":  no rain came pouring out on the earth.

Verse 34

HE ENHANCED HIS SINNING [JPS:  HE REVERTED TO HIS GUILTY WAYS].  Until now, he had not intended to sin deliberately, however, after he confessed regarding the hail -- "I and my people are in the wrong" (v.27) -- it thus now calls him deliberate.

(1) AND WORSHIP ADONAI, SINCE THAT IS WHAT YOU WANT.  It is in order to worship Adonai that you seek me.  And if so, why do you [ask for] the children and women?  He said to them (v.10), "IT SHOULD BE SO THAT ADONAI BE WITH YOU."

VAYAMESH DARKNESS. Similar to (Isa. 13:20), "No Arab shall pitch his tent [yahel] there," like "y'ahel" [to pitch a tent]. In other words, the darkness of night will darken [ya'amish] and become dim for a long time, for the night did not lighten until three days [had passed].

Chapter 11



Verse 1

(1) ADONAI SAID TO MOSHE while he was standing in front of Par'oh, "ONE MORE PLAGUE, ETC." And after that, Moshe responded to Par'oh (v.4), "Thus says the LORD: At midnight, etc."  
(2) ONE AND ALL (KALAH). All -- men, women, children, and livestock.

Verse 2



Verse 3



Verse 4

MOSHE SAID to Par'oh THUS SAYS ADONAI, TOWARD MIDNIGHT.  Kahatzot from hatzah, like ka'asot [upon the doing] from asah, ka'alot [II Kings 3:20 -- "at the time to present the meal offering"] from alah.  In other words, "when the time arrives for the exodus of Israel, when the night splits, I will go forth among the Egyptians."  And at the time of the actual event, it is appropriate to write (Exod. 12:29), "And it was in the middle of the night [bahatzi halailah]" with a bet.  This is the plain sense of it, for when He spoke to Moshe before the time of the plague of the firstborn, then it was appropriate to say "kahatzot" [with a kaf], to say, "when that time arrives, when the night is split."

Verse 5

WHO IS BEHIND THE MILLSTONES.  Below it says (Exod. 12:29), "to the first-born of the captive who was in the dungeon."  The two verses are one, for the first-born of the captive is behind the millstones, for they made them grind, as it is written (Jud. 16:21), "he [Shimshon] became a mill slave in the prison."

Verse 6



Verse 7

NOT A DOG SHALL SNARL.  The angel injures and destroys the Egyptian first-born, but as to the Israelite first-born, not even the barking of injurious animals will bother them.

Verse 8



Verse 9

(9) PAR'OH WILL NOT HEED YOU.  In other words, after each of the plagues, the Holy One, blessed be He, would say to Moshe and Aharon, "He will not heed you," until ultimately (10) ADONAI STIFFENED.  Each time.

Chapter 12



Verse 1

IN THE LAND OF EGYPT, SAYING, "THIS MONTH ETC."  Since this section is about commandment, it was necessary to specify that these mitzvot were commanded in Egypt, but for other mitzvot, some were on Mt. Sinai, some in the Tent of Meeting, and some in the Plains of Moab.  

Verse 2

(1) THE BEGINNING OF THE MONTHS, ETC.  This is according to Rabbi Yehoshua, that the world was created in Nisan.  
(2) [THE FIRST] OF THE MONTHS OF THE YEAR.  Wherever I say to you about months "eighth, ninth," [it refers back] to this month.  And according to Rabbi Eliezer, who says that the world was created in Tishrei, the essence of the plain meaning is as follows:  
(3) "THIS MONTH SHALL MARK FOR YOU."  And even though it is not the first of the months for the other nations, for you it will be the first of the months for counting:  "sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth.  Twelfth month, the month of Adar (Esth. 3:7)."  From it you shall count, to be a reminder that in it you left Egypt, and when it says in the Torah, "in the seventh month," it means from the Exodus from Egypt.  And it is common for verses to make calculations from the Exodus from Egypt, as it is written (Exod. 19:1) "On the third new moon after the Israelites had gone forth, etc."  And similarly in the building of the Temple (I Kings 6:1), "In the 480th year after the Israelites left the land of Egypt."

Verse 3

TO A FAMILY [BEIT AVOT].  The family living in a single house normally eat together in a single house, for the Pesah [sacrifice] is not to be eaten in two houses, as it is written (here) "a lamb to a household" [and] (v.46), "It shall be eaten in one house"

Verse 4

OIF [THE HOUSEHOLD] IS TOO SMALL.  If the cannot eat all of it.  
(2) IN PROPORTION TO [THE NUMBER OF PERSONS].  The number, as it is written (Num. 31:37), "the LORD’s levy from the sheep."  The mem is part of the root, like the mem in "melech."  The word "mich'sat" is like (Exod. 16:14), "the fall of [shich'vat] dew."  However, "tachosu" (in v.4 -- you shall contribute) is from the root kaf-samech-samech, like "tasovu" (Josh. 6:4 -- march around) or [is from] samech-bet-bet, and it [tachosu] is not from (Num. 31:37) "the LORD's levy [meches]" at all.   And even if the mem in michsat were an additional letter and not part of the root, as in mitzva, mikneh, mar'eh, ma'aseh, it would not be from the root "tachosu" but from the root "kisah," "asah," ra'ah" -- from a root where heh, the third letter of the root, is stripped away, for in all of them, the letter after the mem has a hataf [sh'va or hataf-patah]; [like] tik'vah, (Ps. 39:11) "tig'rat yad'cha" [your blows], mitz'vat.  However, from "shav," "kam," "vayagor Mo'av" (Num. 22:3), one would say "tshuvah," "t'kumah," [or] (Isa. 66:4) "To bring on them the very thing they dread" [m'goratam], the hataf is on the first letter.

Verse 14

YOU SHALL CELEBRATE IT.  A hataf-kamatz [kamatz katan] is found [under the het] in the scrolls from other countrries, and that is the correct text, for, from the root "h-g-g," one says "t'hoguhu," as from "s-b-b," one says (Job 40:22) "y'suvuhu [there will surround him] brook-willows."  Howevere, "t'haguhu," with a patah [under the het] is from the root with heh [as the third root letter], as one says from "ch-l-h" "t'chaluhu" or from "tz-v-h" "t'tzavuhu."

Verse 15



Verse 16

ONLY WHAT EVERY PERSON IS TO EAT, ETC.  Thus, it is written for each Yom Tov (e.g., Lev. 23:35), "you shall not work at your occupations," excluding [preparing] food for people, but for Shabbat and Yom Kippur, it is written (Lev. 23:28), "all work."

Verse 17

(1) YOU SHALL KEEP THE MATZOT [JPS: "You shall observe the [Feast of] Unleavened Bread"].  To eat them on this day as a reminder.  
(2) FOR ON THIS VERY DAY I BROUGHT, ETC.   And their dough did not have time to rise, as it is written (v. 39), "And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough that they had taken out of Egypt, for it was not leavened, since they had been driven out, etc."

Verse 18



Verse 19



Verse 20

IN ALL YOUR SETTLEMENTS YOU SHALL EAT UNLEAVENED BREAD.  Even outside Jerusalem, where the Pesah sacrifices are not slaughtered.

Verse 21

BY YOUR FAMILIES.  As it says above (v.3), "[a lamb] to a family."

Verse 22

(1) IN THE BASIN [BASAF].  In the vessel, as it is written (Esth. 2:21) "the guardians of the vessels" [hasaf], (II Kings 12:14) "silver bowls" [sipot].  
(2) DO NOT GO OUTSIDE.  For the signs of blood that are on the doorposts will protect you.

(1) B'TZEIKO [HIS DOUGH].  From "b'tzeik" [as] from "katef" [shoulder] [we get] "k'teifo."
(2) THEIR KNEADING BOWLS [MISH'AROTAM]. This is a vessel into which one places the dough.  This is shown by [Deut. 28:5], "Blessed shall be your basket [tenei] and your kneading bowl [mish'artecha]."  As the tenei is the basket into which one puts the fruit, so "mish'arotam" is the vessel into which one places the dough.  These are blessings of the vessels, that they be full of fruit and dough.

Verse 35



Verse 36

(1) DISPOSED [THE EGYPTIANS] FAVORABLY TOWARDS THE PEOPLE.  To give to them as a gift, as is written in Parashat Sh'mot (Exod. 3:21), "And I will dispose the Egyptians favorably toward this people."  ...
(2) AND THEY LET THEM HAVE THEIR REQUEST.  Egyptian to Israelite -- Israel were the requesters and Egypt the grantors.  They provided everything that was requested, and did so as a gift.  One who requests a thing is called po'el [actor], and one who gives that person what he had requested is called maf'il [causer of the action.] The mash'il gives him what he requests.  
(3) THEY STRIPPED THE EGYPTIANS.  The finery of the best of their [the Egyptians'] clothing they [the Israelites] requested and placed on their sons and their daughters, as it is written (Exod. 33:6), "So the Israelites remained stripped of their finery from Mount Horeb on."

Verse 37



Verse 38



Verse 39

(1) [UNLEAVENED] CAKES [UGOT].  Because "bread" [lehem] is only that which is baked in an oven.  
(2) FOR IT WAS NOT LEAVENED [HAMETZ].  It had not become leavened [heh'mitz -- i.e., hametz is a verb].  Similarly (Exod. 7:14), "Par'oh's mind has become hardened [kaved]" -- a past-tense verb [pa'al].  And similarly (Gen. 27:14), "his father liked [ahev]" and (I Kings 1:1), "King David grew old [zaken]" -- he grew old [hizkin].  
(3) AND ALSO PROVISIONS for the road THEY DID NOT PREPARE.  And thus they were compelled to complain about bread and about water.

Verse 40

THE LENGTH OF TIME THAT THE ISRAELITES LIVED IN EGYPT WAS until the end of FOUR HUNDRED AND THIRTY YEARS from when it was told to Avraham at the Covenant Between the Pieces.  For indeed, Avraham our father was 70 years old when He spoke with him at the Covenant Between the Pieces, and the 400 years of "your offspring shall be strangers" (Gen. 15:13) began with Yitz'hak, as I have explained on the section of Between the Pieces.

Verse 41

(1) IT WAS AT THE END OF THIRTY YEARS from the Pieces Covenant AND FOUR HUNDRED YEARS from the birth of Yitzhak.  
(2) IT WAS ON THAT VERY DAY, ETC.  And nevertheless, they dwelled in Egypt for only the last 210 years of the 430 years.

Verse 42

(1) FOR THE LORD A NIGHT OF VIGIL.  Since the time of Avraham the Holy One, blessed be He, had been looking forward to this night, to bring the Israelites out of Egypt as He had promised them.  And for Israel it is a night of vigil 
(2) THROUGHOUT THE AGES.  For all of their generations, for they will anticipate this night, on which to celebrate the holiday of Pesah in its laws.  
(3) VIGIL.  An expression of waiting, as in (Gen. 37:11), "his father kept the matter in mind."

(1) FIRST ISSUE [PETER].  An expression of opening, as in (Prov. 17:14), "To start a quarrel is to open a sluice." 
(2) HUMANS.  The sacrificial service was, from the beginning, on the first-born.

Verse 3



Verse 4

AVIV. The sprouting and ripening of the produce, as in (Job 8:12), "While still tender (v'ibo), not yet plucked," (Song 6:11), "the budding [ibei] of the vale." The dagesh [in the bet, both in "ibo" and in "ibei"] is in place of the missing bet.

Verse 5



Verse 6



Verse 7



Verse 8

BECAUSE OF THIS that [ADONAI] DID FOR ME. Miracles in Egypt that I perform this worship.  Similarly (Ps. 118:24), "This is the day" that "Adonai created" for me -- when (v. 22) "[I] became the chief cornerstone" -- "let us exult and rejoice on it."  

Verse 9

(1) SIGN ON YOUR HAND.  According to the real plain meaning, it will be for you as a permanent reminder, as if it were written on your hand, in the manner of (Song 8:6), "Place me as a seal on your heart."  
(2) BETWEEN YOUR EYES [JPS: ON YOUR FOREHEAD].  In the manner of an adornment and band of gold that people are accustomed to place on the forehead as a decoration. 

Verse 10

Verse 13

YOU SHALL REDEEM.  After the Levites were sanctified in place of all the first-born, in the second year, after the Tabernacle had been set up.  (Num. 3:47): "You shall take five shekels per head."  And it is written (Num. 18:16), "Take as their redemption price, from the age of one month up, etc.'

Verse 14



Verse 15

AND WHEN [PAR'OH] STUBBORNLY REFUSED.  All of this you shall tell your child.  And this is proven from what is written (v.16), "Adonai freed us from Egypt."  For the Holy One, blessed be He, told Moshe this entire section, that a Jew will say to his child, "Adonai freed us etc."  For Moshe did not say this to Israel on his own, that Moshe would say to Israel, that "it shall be as a sign upon your hand ... that with a mighty hand [Adonai] freed us, etc."  Rather, it is the father who says this to his child.

Verse 16



Verse 17

ויהי בשלח פרעה את העם - and the Holy One, blessed by He, intended to bring them to the land of Canaan, and the Holy One, blessed by He, did not want to lead them 
דרך ארץ פלשתים כי קרוב הוא - [_because_ it was close] a direct route, to enter immediately into the land of Canaan, and when they they would enter the burden of the wars of the land of Canaan, they would appoint a chief and would return to Egypt, as they did several times, as it is written, "It would be better for us to go back to Egypt! ... Let us head back for Egypt.” (Num. 14:3-4); "We remember the fish that we used to eat in Egypt" (Num. 11:5).

Verse 19

(1) THE ANGEL OF GOD - the one who moved the pillar of cloud MOVED (2) IN FRONT OF THE ISRAELITE CAMP, and the angel WENT (3) BEHIND THEM and as a result, (4) THE PILLAR WENT FROM IN FRONT OF THEM AND IT STOOD BEHIND THEM, for the angel moved it, to set it between the Egyptian camp and the Israelite camp, and he placed darkness between them, as it is written in Joshua (24:7), so that they could not approach each other all night. 

Verse 20

(1)THERE WAS THE CLOUD AND THE DARKNESS for the Egyptians (2) AND IT the pillar of fire, for Israel LIT (3) THE NIGHT, SO THAT THE ONE COULD NOT COME NEAR THE OTHER Egypt could not approach Israel ALL THROUGH THE NIGHT.

Verse 21

(1) AN EAST WIND. The Holy One blessed be He acted through natural means, as the wind dries and freezes rivers.

(1) A PILLAR OF FIRE AND CLOUD. With sounds of hail and fire flashing and cloud, as it is written (I Sam. 7:10), "Adonai thundered mightily [and] threw them into confusion."

Verse 1

(1) TRIUMPHED GLORIOUSLY [GA'OH GA'AH]. Victory in battle is called ge'ut in several places. (Ps. 94:2) "Give the arrogant [ge'im] their deserts!"; (Prov. 15:25) "The LORD will tear down the house of the proud [ge'im]" -- the thieves and the extortionists; (Ps. 10:2) "The wicked in his arrogance [b'ga'avat] hounds the lowly." 
(2) HE HAS HURLED INTO THE SEA [RAMAH BAYAM]. This is the Targum of hishlich [he threw, as in Num. 35:22]. Likewise (Ps. 78:9), "romei kashet [bowmen]."

Verse 2



Verse 3



Verse 4

HE HAS CAST INTO THE SEA.  As in (II Sam. 11:24), "the archers shot" -- He aimed and flung.

Verse 5

COVERED THEM [Y'CHAS'YUMU].  It should have said, "y'chas'yumo," with [the second vav] a holam ["o" sound].  But because the first vav is with a shuruk ["oo" sound], the second is that way also.  Similarly (Ezek. 43:11), "motza'av umova'av," should have said "mvo'av," [since] from "ba" [we get] "mavo," or from "kam" [we get] "makom," from "lan" "malon."  However, on account of "motza'av" it says "mova'av."

Verse 6

YOUR RIGHT HAND, ADONAI, for You are 
GLORIOUS IN POWER, it 
SHATTERS THE FOE.  Y'min [right hand] is feminine, as it is written (Ps. 118:16), "The right hand of Adonai is exalted [romeimah]."  And this Scriptural passage is of the same sort as (Ps. 93:3), "The ocean sounds, Adonai, the ocean sounds its thunder";(Ps. 94:3), "How long shall the wicked, Adonai, how long shall the wicked exult?"; [and] (Ps. 92:10), "Surely, Your enemies, Adonai, surely, Your enemies perish."  The first half has not finished its matter before the latter half comes and duplicates it and supplements its matter, but the first half specifies about whom it is speaking.

Verse 7



Verse 8



Verse 9


(2) I WILL BARE [lit.:  EMPTY] MY SWORD.   I will empty my sheath by drawing my sword.  Likewise (Ps. 38:3), "You have stretched your arrows against me" [JPS:  Your arrows have struck me], referring to stretching, aiming, the bow, He shoots the arrows, as it is written (ibid.), "Your hand is stretched against me,"  (Ps. 18:35), "My arms can bend a bow of bronze."  Thus, it calls shooting of arrows "stretching."

Verse 10

THEY SANK LIKE LEAD.  In waters that are majestic -- in the waters of the sea, even though they are majestic.  

Verse 11

WHO IS LIKE YOU, O LORD, AMONG THE CELESTIALS; WHO IS LIKE YOU, MAJESTIC IN HOLINESS.  This also is like those doubled ones that I have explained in connection with (15:6), "Your right hand, O LORD, glorious in power," and this is its meaning:   "Who is like You among the celestials, Adonai, who is as majestic in holiness as are You?" 
(2) AWESOME IN PRAISES [JPS: IN SPLENDOR].  The praises that are said about You; through them You are feared and revered, as it is written (Ex. 14:31), "The people feared Adonai."

Verse 12



Verse 13

YOU GUIDED [JPS: "GUIDE"] THEM IN YOUR STRENGTH.  You guide Israel now in order to bring them into and to give them possession of the Land of Canaan, which is YOUR HOLY ABODE.

Verse 14



Verse 15



Verse 16

(1) TILL THEY CROSS OVER.  Both instances refer to until they cross the Jordan into the Land of Israel; the second instance of the crossing of the Jordan is like (v.6) "Your right hand, Adonai" according to the plain meaning. 
(2) THROUGH THE MIGHT OF YOUR ARM.  This is like "through the arm of Your might."  Similarly, (Ps. 65:5) "the holy of Your temple" is like "the temple of Your holiness."

Verse 17

THE SANCTUARY [MIKDASH].  The kof of "mikdash" has a dagesh, and the dalet is weak.  Similarly is (Exod. 2:3) "hatz'fino," and similarly (Jud. 16:28) "mish'tei" of my two eyes.  The dagesh in the kof of "mikdash" makes the sh'va a sh'va-na.  That is why the dalet after it is weak.  Similarly "hatz'fino," and similarly "mish'tei."

Verse 18

ADONAI WILL REIGN.  After you settle in the Land of Israel, the kingdom of the Holy One, blessed be He, will become known among all the kingdoms.

Verse 19

WHEN THE HORSES WENT and threw him over INTO THE SEA, and ISRAEL had already MARCHED ON DRY GROUND IN THE MIDST OF THE SEA, then MIRIAM THE PROPHETESS TOOK, ETC.  Similarly (Exod. 16:34), "When the LORD had commanded Moses, then Aaron placed it before the Pact, to be kept," and (Jer. 37:16-17), "When Jeremiah came to the pit and the cells, and Jeremiah remained there a long time, then King Zedekiah sent for him." 

Verse 20


(2) THE PROPHETESS.  It [so] calls the originator of words of praise or of rebuke to people.  
(3) AARON'S SISTER.  It calls her "sister" with respect to the first-born, as I have explained in connection with "Nevayot's sister" (Gen. 28:9) and "Lotan's sister" (Gen. 36:22).

Verse 21



Verse 22

HE CAUSED [ISRAEL] TO SET OUT [VAYASA].  This is a hiph'il, but "vayisa" [means] he himself set out.  Similarly (Ps. 78:28), "making them come down [vayapel] inside His camp" and (Lev. 8:14), "He led forward [vayagesh] the bull of sin offering," expressions of maf'il [causing to act], but "vayipol" and "vayigash" are an expression of po'el [acting].

Verse 23



Verse 24



Verse 25

(1) [The Lord] SHOWED HIM.  An expression of (Deut. 33:10) "They shall teach Your laws."  
(2) THERE HE MADE FOR THEM A LAW AND STATUTE, [AND THERE HE PUT THEM TO THE TEST].  There, at Marah, by means of the test that He set up to make them parched for water, and afterward He healed the water for them, He began demonstrating for them that they should accept on themselves the laws and statutes that He would teach them, and that He would supply their needs.  And how did He make for them a law and statute?  He said to them (v.26), "If you will diligently heed the voice of the Lord your God, etc.  and keeping His laws" which He commanded you.

Verse 26

(1) ANY OF THE DISEASES THAT I BROUGHT UPON THE EGYPTIANS.  That I turned their waters into blood (Ps. 105:29), and they did not have water to drink. 
(2) I WILL NOT BRING UPON YOU, FOR I THE LORD AM YOUR HEALER.  In that I have "healed" the waters, as this expression is written with respect to Elisha, who "healed" the water.  (II Kings 2:21)  
(3) ANY OF THE DISEASES.  It refers to [those of] water, as it is written (Ex. 23:25), "He will bless your bread and your water. And I will remove sickness from your midst."

Chapter 16



Verse 1

ON THE FIFTEENTH DAY OF THE SECOND MONTH.  It was at that time that they ran out of the cakes tha the had brought out from Egypt.

Verse 2



Verse 3

(1) BY THE HAND OF ADONAI.  A death of "coming to the grave in ripe old age" (Job 5:26), and not by hunger.  (2) BY THE FLESHPOTS.  As in (Num. 2:20), "next to it the tribe of M'nasheh."

Verse 4

(1) THE PEOPLE SHALL GO OUT AND GATHER EACH DAY THAT DAY’S PORTION.  Even if they intend to gather a lot, they will only find each day's portion, as it is written (v.18), "But when they measured it by the omer, ... each one gathered as much as he needed to eat."  
(2) THAT I MAY TEST THEM.  Since every day, their eyes turn, for their food, to Me, for that reason they will believe in Me and will follow My instructions, as is specified in Parashat Ekev (Deut. 8:3), "He subjected you to hardship and humger."

Verse 5

(1) WHEN THEY PREPARE [JPS:  APPORTION] WHAT THEY HAVE BROUGHT IN.  "Bake what you would bake and boil what you would boil."  (v.23).  
(2) IT WILL BE DOUBLE.  Even though each day, they only found one omer per person, on Friday, they will find double -- a double omer per person.

Verse 6

IT WAS THE LORD WHO BROUGHT YOU OUT.  And not as you said (v.3), "For you (Moshe and Aharon) have brought us out."

THEY TOLD MOSHE. That they had found a double portion, and [they asked] whether they should leave some of it for the next day.  Moshe had not told them until now what the Holy One, blessed be He, had said to him on the first day (v. 5), "But on the sixth day, when they apportion what they have brought in, it shall prove to be double."

Verse 23

(1) HE SAID TO THEM, "THIS IS WHAT GOD SPOKE."  On the first day, and I have not told you.  And Moshe intended that they be astonished when they found the double portion, in order to communicate to them now the glory of Shabbat. 
(2) BAKE (EFU).  It should have said "efu," with a hataf-patah-katan [i.e., a hataf-segol], as "echol" from alef-kaf-lamed and "emor" from alef-mem-resh -- from alef-peh-heh, the imperative [in the singular] "efeh."  However, because it is not connected to what follows it, except by the trop r'vi'a, which is among the trop marks that are "kings," [i.e., it is a pausal form], it is thus vocalized with a tzerei.  I have not found another example, except "hevu" (Hos. 4:18), "They 'love' beyond measure— Disgrace is the 'gift.'"

(1) AND IT TASTED LIKE WAFERS IN HONEY.  Later on (Num. 11:8), it says, "It tasted like rich cream."  Our Rabbis explained, honey to children, oil to old people.  But I say, according to the plain sense, when one eats of it as is, without grinding it, it is like a wafer in honey, as nuts before grinding or pounding are sweet, but below, it says, "grind it between millstones or pound it in a mortar," and therefore, its taste is like oil, like nuts that become oil after pounding, and similarly olives.  And therefore, it is written here "its taste was [v'ta'amo]," and there "its taste became [v'hayah ta'amo]" like the taste of rich cream, for the sweet taste transformed and became the taste of oil.  
(2) LIKE WAFERS.  There is no other instance [in Tanach]; but "tzapahat mayim" (I Sam. 26:11) is a vessel.  ...
(3) CORIANDER [GAD].  It is a kind of legume, round. ...
(4) LIKE CORIANDER SEED, WHITE.  Like the color bdellium, as it is written below (Num. 11:7), "its color was the color of bdellium," but coriander seed is not white.

Verse 11

(1) WHENEVER MOSES HELD UP HIS HAND. And the staff.  
(2) ISRAEL PREVAILED.  This is the manner of those who wage war:  as long as they can see the standard -- confaten [confanon] in the vernacular -- they prevail, and when it is cast down, they generally retreat and are defeated.  

Verse 12

STEADY.  Persisting in their strength.  Similarly (Isa. 22:23), "I will fix him as a peg in a firm place" -- a strong place.  And similarly (Ps. 100:5, with slight error), "His faithfulness is for all generations" -- it will persist from generation to generation.  And similarly (Deut. 28:59), "malignant and chronic diseases" -- long and lasting diseases.

Verse 13

OVERWHELMED [Lit.: Weakened].  He defeated them, as it is written (Exod. 32:18), "the sound of the tune of defeat."

Verse 14

(1) IN YEHOSHUA'S EARS.  That he should rule over them and fulfill My commandment to blot out the name of Amalek.  
(2) THAT I WILL UTTERLY BLOT OUT ETC.  That I want him [Yehoshua] to blot out his [Amalek's] name.

Verse 15

(1) ADONAI NISI.  For the staff of the Holy One, blessed be He, became a banner on the hill, and also, the Holy One, blessed be He, will in the future raise it on the mountains to make war against Amalek, for after all, he said to him now (v.14), "I will utterly blot out the memory of Amalek, and this is what it explains as it goes on:

Verse 16

HE SAID, “IT MEANS, ‘HAND UPON THE THRONE OF THE LORD!’ ETC.  That is why I name the altar "Adonai Nisi," like the name of a person called Eliezer [God is my help] or Imanu'el [God is with us], for God has lifted His hand on His throne that He has a war against Amalek through the generations, in the manner of (Isa. 32:40), "I raise My hand to heaven."  This is the essential plain meaning.  And some interpret it:  "When My hand and strength will be on Yah's throne, which is the throne of the kings of Israel, then there will be a war against Amalek.  But this does not seem to me correct at all, for [if so,] it should have said, "When there will be [ki tihyeh] a hand."  However, this refers above, as I have explained, and its meaning is "Hereby [harei] hand on the throne of Yah."

Chapter 18



Verse 1

(1) אשר עשה אלוקים למשה, that Pharaoh never harmed him, and that God magnified him in the eyes of Pharaoh and his servants, and performed miracles through him.

Verse 2

אחר שלוחיה - After Moshe had returned her and sent her back from Egypt, for we have not seen until now that he had returned her to his father-in-law's home.  But some explain:  Afterwards, he sent her her dowry. as it is written (I Kings 9:16), "as a dowry" to Pharaoh's daughter.  And this seems the plain sense, for we have not found verses on this matter.  Rather, before Yitro sent her, her and her children, into the wilderness, it should have written above, after the passage about "blood of circumcision," that afterwards Moshe went and sent her to be with her father (her and her children), along the lines of "And Ham was the father of Cana'an."
אחר שלוחיה - Like:  "and afterwards she shall become clean"  (Lev. 15:28).  And as I have explained (Gen. 22:13), "Afterwards, it was caught in the thicket."  "First the singers, and afterwards the musicians" (Ps. 68:26).

(1) התלאה אשר מצאתם בדרך, Pharaoh’s pursuit to the sea, the mannah, and the meat that the Holy One, blessed be He, gave them.

Verse 9

(1) ויחד, from the root ח-ד-ה, similar to (I Chron. 16:27) עוז וחדוה, “strength and joy.” According to the rule applicable to all roots of ב,ג,ד,כ,פ,ת group of consonants that are of a root where the last root letter is removed, and the end takes a dagesh chazak. From בכה, [we get] ויבך (vayevk)[e.g., Gen. 27:38]; from פתה [we get] ויפת בסתר לבי (vayift) [Job 31:27]and יפת אלקים ליפת (yaft) [Gen. 9:27]; אל תוסף על דבריו (tosp) [Prov. 30:6]. From שבה, [we get] וישב, (vayishb, “he took captive”).

Verse 13

(1) AS MAGISTRATE AMONG THE PEOPLE. Even if Yitro came before the Giving of the Torah, they [the Israelites] had always had civil laws, for our Sages said that it was at Marah that the civil laws were given to them, as it is written there (Ex. 15:25), "There He made for them statute and judgment." But it seems that it was after the Giving of the Torah that he came -- it is written here (v.5), "where he was encamped at the mountain of God," and below it says (19:1-2), "On the third new moon after the Israelites had gone forth from the land of Egypt, on that very day, they entered the wilderness of Sinai. Having journeyed from Rephidim, they entered the wilderness of Sinai and encamped in the wilderness. Israel encamped there in front of the mountain." We conclude that the R'fidim section and the encampment at the mountain preceded this section, and in order to avoid interrupting the sections about the mitzvot it moved the section about Yitro earlier.
(2) FROM MORNING TO NIGHT.  Because he alone was judging the entire people, without any assistants.

(2) YOU REPRESENT THE PEOPLE BEFORE GOD for those matters for which you must consult God, you will hear what the Holy One blessed be He says to you, and YOU WILL ENJOIN UPON THEM [v.20]. And this is the meaning of [v.22] "The difficult [original: major] matters they would bring to you," but the rest of the matters, which were easily known to the Israelite Sages whom you will place over them [see v. 21], they would decide themselves and make it easier for yourself [see v. 22].

Verse 20



Verse 21



Verse 22

(1) EVERY MAJOR DISPUTE {TO YOU]. To inquire of God.

Verse 23

(1) [IF YOU DO THIS] AND GOD COMMANDS YOU.  When God commands you to judge them, 
(2) YOU WILL BE ABLE TO STAND.  By means of your assistants.  
(3) AND ALL THESE PEOPLE  who are standing over you from morning until evening [see v. 13]  WILL GO quickly each of them to his home UNWEARIED.

Verse 7



Verse 8

AND MOSHE BROUGHT BACK THE PEOPLE’S WORDS TO ADONAI.  On the next day, as it explains (v.9), "And Adonai said to Moshe, 'I will come to you in a thick cloud, etc.'"  
And then (ibid.) "Then Moshe reported the people’s words to Adonai"; 
that is "And Moshe brought back, etc."  It states the general and then goes back and supplies details.  ... This is what Moshe said to the Holy One, blessed be He:  "Already from yesterday, they took it upon themselves to do what You would command them."  Similarly (Lev. 9:24 - 10:2), "Fire came forth from before Adonai and consumed the burnt offering" and meanwhile, "Now Aharon’s sons Nadav and Avihu each took, etc." "And fire came forth from Adonai" and reached Nadav and Avihu before the gold altar, which was in the sanctuary, when they brought alien fire on it, and it burned them, and went outside and consumed the burnt offering on the brass altar, which was in the courtyard outside the sanctuary.  And similarly in in the Book of Judges in the section about Michah (Jud. 17:3-4):  "He returned the eleven hundred shekels of silver to his mother; but his mother said, 'I herewith consecrate the silver to Adonai, etc.'  He gave the silver back to his mother."  In the beginning, the verse says, "He returned the ... silver to his mother," and afterwards it explains how, "but his mother said, etc.  He gave the silver back to his mother."

Verse 9

IN THE THICKNESS OF THE CLOUD.  Thick and dark so that he could not see the Sh'chinah.

Verse 10

V'KIDASHTAM.  An expression of preparation, as in [Num. 11:18] "Prepare yourselves [hit'kad'shu] for tomorrow and you will eat meat."

Verse 11

ADONAI WILL COME DOWN, IN THE SIGHT OF ALL THE PEOPLE.  One can say that "Adonai said" at the beginning of the verse [v.10] means [said] by an angel, and that's why it says "Adonai will come down," and it was not the Holy One, blessed be He, Himself [who said it], since it is not written, "I will come down."  It is as I explained about (Gen. 19:24), "Adonai rained upon ... from Adonai out of heaven."  And also in the midrashim, the first in the verse is Gavri'el and the second is the Holy One, blessed be He.

Verse 12



Verse 13

NO HAND SHALL TOUCH HIM.  ["Him" refers to] the one who touches the mountain, as I have said.  "He shall be put to death" (v. 12) -- they shall kill him from a distance; they shall not approach the mountain to kill him and thereby incur death themselves also.  Therefore, "no hand shall touch him" to kill him, but rather they shall shoot him with arrows from afar, or they shall throw stones on him to stone him.


Verse 14



Verse 15



Verse 16



Verse 17



Verse 18

WAS ALL IN SMOKE [ASHAN KULO]. Half of it [the first vowel] is a kamatz and half of it [the second vowel] is a patah, since it is an expression of a past-tense verb of the binyan kal: "It was all making smoke." But "ashan," which is a noun, has two k'matzim. [K'ESHEN -- LIKE THE SMOKE] "like the smoking" -- fumée in the vernacular; if it were a noun, it should have been "ka'ashan of a kiln" [with a hataf-patah under the ayin and a patah under the shin], as from "davar" we say (Deut. 15:2) "d'var hash'mitah," [and] from "bakar" "b'kar zevah hash'lamim" (Num. 7:88). So from "the house was full of smoke [ashan]," "eshen hakiv'shan" when it is in s'michut.


Verse 19

MOSHE WOULD SPEAK.  To the Holy One, blessed be He, but his voice would not be heard by any person, only by the Holy One, blessed be He.  However, the Holy One, blessed be He, would answer Moshe in a loud voice, on account of the shofar, which gradually became very loud, and the voice of the Holy One, blessed be He, would have to exceed the sound of the shofar in order to cause Moshe to hear.

Verse 20



Verse 21

NOT TO BREAK THROUGH.  From their station, to approach and see.

Verse 22

(1) THE PRIESTS.  The firstborn.  
(2) SHALL READY THEMSELVES (JPS: MUST STAY PURE).  In their positions.

Verse 23

BUT MOSHE SAID TO THE LORD, “THE PEOPLE CANNOT, ETC."  One who explains this as Moshe saying "You already told us this three days ago (v.12): 'You shall set boundaries for the mountain, ... Beware of going up the mountain,' and why do You need to tell me this a second time?" is simply mistaken, for one urges a person at the time of taking action even after urging him before the time of taking action, for one urges a person a second time at the time for taking action, saying, "Now the time has come for doing what I told you."  And also, there is another verse that is a repetition:  He said to him (v.21), "Go down" -- what is new in that?  But rather this is what Moshe said to the Holy One, blessed be He, by way of question, and this is what he asked:  "Yesterday and the day before, You told me that the people were not to go up on Mt. Sinai, when you admonished the people by setting a boundary; You told me 'Refrain from going up on the mountain.'  And now You tell me (v.21), 'not to break through to Adonai.'  Perhaps You are adding that it is prohibited even a little, in order to gaze and see, even distant from the mountain?"  And the Holy One, blessed be He, answered him (v.24), "Go down, and come back together with Aaron; but let not the priests or the people break through to come up to the LORD." And even now, I have not said anything to you about seeing without ascending."

Verse 6

BUT SHOWING KINDNESS TO THE THOUSANDTH [LA'ALAFIM].  To the descendants in the third, fourth, fifth, tenth, hundredth, and thousandth [generations].  Those of the thousandth are called "the thousandth generation" (elef dor, Deut. 7:9).  And these verses do not conflict with each other according to the plain sense.  Here, it speaks of children and children's children; all the "children" are one generation, and the "children's children" are a second generation.  And the children of the very last generation of 1000 are called "children" -- "banim alafim" (1000).  But in Deuteronomy, which mentions neither "children" nor "third" (shileishim) or "fourth" (ribei'im), as it is written there (7:9), "you shall know that Adonai your God is God, etc., of those who love Him and who keep His commandments to a thousand generations."  And that "thousand" (elef) is the children of the "thousandth" (alafim).

Verse 7

DO NOT TAKE, ETC.  All of this is for the sake of the honor of the Holy One, blessed be He, as is observance of Shabbat, which follows.  And likewise honoring father and mother, for their honor is analogized to the honor of the Omnipresent, as it is written (Prov. 3:9), "Honor [kabed] the Lord with your wealth."

Verse 8

REMEMBER THE SABBATH DAY.  Every instance of "remembering" refers to the days that have passed, as in (Deut. 32:7-8), "Remember the days of old ... when the Most High gave nations their homes"; (Exod. 13:3), "Remember this day" forever, for in the past, on this day, "you went free from Egypt"; (Deut. 9:7-8), "Remember, never forget, how you provoked Adonai your God to anger in the wilderness"; and (Ps. 25:6), "Adonai, remember Your compassion and Your kindness, for they are from of old."  Likewise here, "Remember the Sabbath day" of the six days of Creation, as it goes on to explain:  "for in six days, Adonai made, etc.," as it is written here, and that is why it is written "Remember" here, so as to sanctify it by ceasing the doing of work.  

Verse 9



Verse 10



Verse 11

BECAUSE ADONAI BLESSED THE SHABBAT DAY [not "That is why Adonai blessed the Shabbat day"].  As I explained in Genesis (18:5) [regarding] "ki al ken" -- "for [asher] Adonai blessed the Shabbat day."  For when the Shabbat day arrives, the Holy One, blessed be He, had already created all of people's needs and their food, and thus, Shabbat is [already] blessed with respect to all good things.  Therefore one should sanctify it [y'kadshe'hu] -- to cease work on it as testimony, as the Holy One, blessed be He, ceased work, for He created everything first, and then He ceased.

Verse 12



Verse 13

DO NOT MURDER (TIRTZAH).  Every instance of "r'hitzah" is gratuitous killing, in every place:  "The murderer must be put to death" (Num. 35:16); "Would you murder and take possession?" (I Kings 21:19); "Where righteousness dwelt; But now murderers" (Isa. 1:21).  However, in the case of "harigah" and "mitah," some are gratuitous, such as "He killed him" of Kayin (Gen. 4:8), and some are justified, such as "you shall kill the woman" (Lev. 20:16).  And that which is written, "one who unwittingly slew [yirtzah] another" (Deut. 4:42):  Since the context discusses one who kills [rotzeah] intentionally, it says that if, however, this killing [r'tzihah] is unintentional, he is exempt.  This is the answer that I gave to the apikorsim [Christians], and they accepted it.  And even though it says in their scriptures "I deal death and give life" (Deut. 32:39) in Latin of "do not murder," they are inaccurate.

Verse 14



Verse 15

SAW THE THUNDER.  The hail and the stones, as it is written (Ex. 9:28), "God’s thunder and hail."

Chapter 21



Verse 1

All those with intelligence will know and understand that I have not come to explain laws, even though they are fundamental, as I explained in Genesis, because the aggadot and laws are inferred from textual redundancy.  Some are found in the commentary of R' Shlomo, my maternal grandfather, of blessed memory, but for me,  it is to explain the plain sense of scripture that I have come, and I will explain the meaning of the rules and laws according to their natural meaning.  Nevertheless, the laws are fundamental, as our Rabbis said, "Halacha uproots (teaching) [scripture]."  (of six years he shall go free in the Jubilee, and there are some who differentiate between them.)

Verse 2

WHEN YOU ACQUIRE A HEBREW SERVANT.  The text refers to one who is sold by a court, as it is written (Ex. 22:2), "if he lacks the means, he shall b sold for his theft."  But about the one who sells himself, from poverty, it is written in Parashat B'har (Lev. 25:39-40), "If your kinsman is in straits ... and is sold to you, ...."  On that it is written, "until the Jubilee he shall serve you."  But on this, it says, "six years he shall serve," with respect to the one sold by a court.  Some of our Rabbis equate their [the two kinds of Hebrew slaves'] laws, through a g'zeirah shavah, such that if he can, before six years, he goes free in the Jubilee.  And there are those who differentiate between them. 

YEITZEI LAHOFSHI.  An action [i.e., a noun, "to freedom"], for if it were an expression for a person who is free [i.e., an adjective, "free"], it should have been vocalilzed with a hataf [i.e., a sh'va], "l'hofshi."


Verse 3

IF HE CAME SINGLE, HE SHALL LEAVE SINGLE.  It states the general rule and afterward it explains.  IF SINGLE he enters his master's house by himself, as he does not yet have a wife to enter with him, or even if HIS MASTER GAVE HIM A WIFE, nevertheless, HE SHALL LEAVE SINGLE, for the woman that his master gave him SHALL BELONG TO HER MASTER.  And now I will explain how this works:  IF HE HAS A WIFE, then he will not leave single, rather, HIS WIFE shall go out WITH HIM.  But IF HIS MASTER GAVE HIM A WIFE, etc., then as he entered single, so he shall leave single.  And this is talking about a Canaanite slave-woman that his master gave him.

Verse 6



Verse 7



Verse 8

IF SHE IS BAD IN HER MASTER'S EYES, so that he does not want to fulfill "she shall not go out like the going-out of the male slaves" (Ex. 21:7), which implies that he should take her as a wife.  IF SHE IS BAD, ugly, IN HER MASTER'S EYES, such that he does not want TO DESIGNATE HER for himself as a wife.  
IN HIS BREAKING FAITH WITH HER - Since he is breaking faith with her in that he does not designate her, as it is written in Malachi (2:14) regarding the wife of one's youth, "you have broken faith with her, though she is your partner and covenanted spouse." 
HE SHALL LET HER BE REDEEMED.  He reduces her redemption price and she goes out through redemption, according to the number of remaining years.

Verse 9



Verse 10



Verse 11



Verse 12



Verse 13

(1) HE DID NOT DO IT BY DESIGN. As in (I Sam. 24:12), "you are bent on taking my life." He did not lie in wait to kill him. 
(2) [GOD] CAUSED IT TO COME ABOUT. Because he was already subject to death at the hands of Heaven. ...
(3) I WILL ASSIGN YOU A PLACE. When there are cities to dwell in. Since He has already said to them, "Do not murder," and "Honor your father," it states here the punishments for [violating] these. Likewise (v.16), "One who kidnaps a person and sells him," because He has said "Do not steal," and the Sages explained this as stealing a person -- a matter that is inferred from its context, which discusses capital crimes [murder and adultery].

Verse 14



Verse 15



Verse 16



Verse 17



Verse 18

OR WITH AN EGROF.  The plain meaning is like the Targum: a kind of stone or brick, for the Scriptural passage is talking about throwing a stone. And I found [a passage] to this effect in the Sifra, regarding plagues on houses, in connection with (Lev. 14:40), "order the stones pulled out."  Likewise (Isa. 58:4), "to strike with an evil egrof" -- with a large stone capable of killing or injuring.

Verse 19

(1) IF HE GETS UP AND WALKS. But if he dies, even after a long delay, the assailant shall surely be put to death. However, with regard to his [Canaanite] slave, he is liable only if he [the slave] dies "under his hand," but if he survives a day or two, he [the assailant] is not liable. 
(2) SHIVTO. Absence from his work [lost wages].

Verse 20

WITH A ROD.  With an instrument that a person normally uses to beat his slave to discipline him.  But if [he beats him] with a sword, then by the plain sense, if [he dies even] after a day or two, he [the master] is subject to the death penalty, since this is not the way of discipline, but rather the way of killing.  And it refers to a Canaanite slave, but a Hebrew servant is not "his property" (v.21), but rather (Lev. 25:40), "he shall remain with you as a hired or bound laborer," and the law regarding him is as with an Israelite in all matters, except that his master may give him [the Israelite servant] a female Canaanite slave, [to breed].

Verse 28

(1) THE OX SHALL SURELY BE STONED.  According to the plain sense,-- 
(2) ITS FLESH SHALL NOT BE EATEN [means] neither by a non-Jew nor by a dog, after it has been stoned.  And even though, with respect to the animal that dies naturally and the animal that is mortally injured, it is written (Deut. 14:21), "or you may sell it to a foreigner," [and] (Exod. 22:30), "you shall cast it to the dogs," here it is not permitted to derive benefit after it has been stoned.  And our Sages construed this as that, once the trial is over, it is forbidden, even if it is ritually slaughtered after the completion of the trial.  ...
(3) BUT THE OWNER OF THE OX IS NOT TO BE PUNISHED.  Provided that he had not been on notice [of prior goring by this ].

Verse 29



Verse 30



Verse 31



Verse 32

IF IT IS A Canaanite SLAVE THAT THE on-warning OX GORES or an ox that is not on warning, he is exempt.

Verse 33

WHEN A MAN OPENS A PIT.  That is deep, and whose work has already been completed, and he transgresses in not covering it.  Or even if A MAN DIGS A PIT AND DOES NOT COVER IT each day at evening when he leaves his work, since still the next day he must enter it and dig further, since it is a burden to him to cover it each day, nevertheless, he is liable.

Verse 34

(1) THE ONE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PIT.  Either the one who has opened it or the one who is digging it.  
(2) HE SHALL KEEP THE DEAD ANIMAL.  According to the plain sense, since he is paying the full value of the animal, by rights the carcass should belong to the tortfeasor, but the Sages interpreted it "the victim," for any diminution in the value of the carcass [between the incident and the trial] is absorbed by the victim.

Verse 35

AND DIVIDE ITS PRICE.  The Sages explained the entire verse, that everything is summed up so there is payment of "half-damages," and they explained the dividing up of the living one and of the dead one according to the rule of "half-damages."

Verse 36



Verse 37

FIVE OXEN.  The Sages said that the ox, which he has prevented from doing its labor, [is compensated by] quintuple damages.

Chapter 22



Verse 1

WHILE TUNNELING.  And at night time, he comes prepared to either kill or be killed; therefore THERE IS NO BLOODGUILT -- liability for blood [death], but instead, the one who kills him is not liable.  

Verse 2

IF THE SUN HAS RISEN.  That he was stealing in day time.

Verse 3

(1) IF IT IS FOUND IN HIS POSSESSION.  Such that he has not sold it.  
(2) ALIVE.  Such that he has not slaughtered it.  Then HE SHALL PAY DOUBLE.  And not four or five times the value.

Verse 4



Verse 5



Verse 6



Verse 7

IF THE THIEF IS NOT FOUND, [THE OWNER] SHALL APPROACH ETC.  Our Sages explained that, if it is not found to be the case as the bailee said, that "It was stolen from me," but rather that he himself actually stole it, then, if he approaches and takes an oath before the judges, he shall pay double when the judges find against him, and he SHALL PAY DOUBLE TO THE OTHER[the owner].  But I will explain it according to the plain meaning:  IF THE THIEF IS NOT FOUND, THEN THE OWNER OF THE HOUSE -- i.e., the bailee -- SHALL APPROACH [and swear] that HE DID NOT PUT HIS HAND TO THE PROPERTY OF HIS FELLOW, but rather it was stolen from him, then he shall be exempt.

Verse 8

IN ALL CHARGES OF MISAPPROPRIATION.  A missing pledge that was stolen, whether OX or SHEEP or GARMENT or ANY OTHER LOSS, if the owner says that THIS IS IT -- the money that he [the bailee] stole from him [the owner], then the thief or the bailee, the one whom they -- the judges based on [testimony of] witnesses -- find guilty SHALL PAY DOUBLE TO THE OTHER [the owner].

Verse 9

IF IT DIES OR IS INJURED.  A lion or wild beast tears it apart, for, since [when] it speaks of "DIES" or "IS CARRIED OFF," [the meaning is] that the entire animal is lost, the same is true for IS INJURED -- that the entire animal is destroyed, for a lion or wild beast killed it.  We find this with respect to the prophet killed by the lion (I Kings 13:28), "with the ass and the lion standing beside the corpse; the lion had not eaten the corpse nor had it destroyed the ass."  AND NO ONE SEES IT.

Verse 10

(1) THERE SHALL BE AN OATH BEFORE ADONAI. And he [the bailee] shall be exempt in the case of unavoidable loss.  
(2) THE OWNER SHALL TAKE.  [i.e., accept] the [bailee's]  oath.

Verse 11



Verse 12



Verse 13



Verse 14

(1) IF IT WAS HIRED.  He hired his fellow's animal to do his [own] work.  
(2) IT COMES WITH HIS RENTAL [BA BIS'CHARO; JPS:  PAYMENT IS DUE].  In other words, it is a rental fee that he is paying, and this is not like a borrower, and thus he is exempt in the case of unavoidable loss.  However in the event ot theft or loss, he is liable as in the case of a hired watchman [shomer s'char].  But there is an opinion that, even in the case of theft or loss, he is exempt, and he is liable only for misconduct, as in the case of the gratuitous bailee; this is a disagreement between R' Meir and R' Yehudah in Bava Kama.

Verse 15

(1) WHO HAS NOT BEEN BETROTHED [JPS: FOR WHOM THE BRIDE-PRICE HAS NOT BEEN PAID].  For is she has been betrothed, he is subject to stoning, as is written in Deuteronomy [22:24].  
(2) HE MUST PAY A BRIDE-PRICE.  According to the bride-price for virgins, 50 silver pieces for raping a virgin (Deut. 22:29): "he shall pay the girl’s father fifty [shekels of] silver."  And the same rule applies to a seducer.

Verse 16



Verse 17

YOU SHALL NOT CAUSE A SORCERESS TO LIVE [JPS: TOLERATE A SORCERESS].  Since it is the way of women when they are single to do their deeds in secret, in hidden places or in caves, as we find with the 80 women of Ashkelon whom Shimon ben Shetah hung.  Thus it says "do not cause [one] to live" -- do not give up on searching them out.  Do not let them live through sloth; rather, search them out to kill them.

Verse 18



Verse 19

(1) WHOEVER SACRIFICES TO A GOD [LA'ELOHIM].  With a patah [under the lamed].  However, "leilohim" [with a tzerei under the lamed] would mean to the name of the Holy One, blessed be He.  
(2) TO A GOD [LA'ELOHIM]. To one about which I said to you (Exod. 20:2), "You shall have no other god."  
(3) SHALL BE PROSCRIBED.  Shall be killed.

Verse 20

(1) DO NOT WRONG.  With words.  For with respect to monetary matters, it is written (Lev. 25:14), "you shall not wrong one another."  And the rule applies to any Jew, but Scripture addresses the typical case, for one can wrong the convert [ger -- JPS: stranger] in connection with his ancestors' deeds, or with his deeds while [still] a Gentile.  
(2) DO NOT OPPRESS HIM.  To do your work, since he has no redeemer [kinsman], as it is written (Exod. 3:9), "I have seen how the Egyptians oppress them."  
(3) FOR YOU WERE STRANGERS.  As is made explicit below (Exod. 23:9), "you know the feelings of the stranger, having yourselves been strangers," and because his distress is greater, the punishment with respect to him is greater.

Verse 21

DO NOT ILL-TREAT.  As in (Exod. 1:11), "to oppress them with forced labor."  Scripture addresses the typical case.

Verse 22



Verse 23



Verse 24

(1) DO NOT BE LIKE A CREDITOR TOWARDS HIM.  When the time comes to collect on the loan, do not press him, to take a pledge, as it is written (II Kings 4:1), "and now a creditor is coming to seize etc.," or (Isa. 50:1), "And which of My creditors was it to whom I sold you?"  Any creditor, when the time arrives, will come to take a pledge.  
(2) EXACT NO INTEREST FROM THEM.  For expanding the time for payment.

Verse 25



Verse 26

(1) I WILL PAY HEED, FOR I AM COMPASSIONATE.  Even though, by rights, he possesses the pledge and is not obligated to return it, [this goes] beyond the letter of the law, and I would not have to listen to [the borrower's] cries, were it not that I am compassionate and gracious.  But above (v.21), regarding "Do not mistreat a widow or an orphan," it is written (v. 22), "I will surely heed his outcry," since it by rights that the Holy One, blessed be He, hears his outcry; thus, there it does not say, "for I am compassionate."

Verse 27

YOU SHALL NOT REVILE GOD, NOR PUT A CURSE UPON A CHIEFTAIN AMONG YOUR PEOPLE.  Scripture speaks in terms of the common case -- because kings and judges decide monetary and capital criminal matters, people frequently curse them.  Similarly, it says (Eccl. 10:20), "Don’t revile a king even among your intimates."  And it says (Deut. 21:23), "an impaled body is an affront to God" -- when people see the impaled person, they will curse the judges; that is why it says (Deut. 21:23), "do not not let the corpse remain on the stake overnight."

Verse 28

(1) THE FULNESS OF THY HARVEST, AND OF THE OUTFLOW OF THY PRESSES.  This refers to what is written (Deut. 18:4), "the first fruits of your new grain and wine and oil."  THE FULNESS.  The trumah from the grains, as it is written (Deut. 22:9), "the crop from the seed you have sown."  
(2) THE OUTFLOW.  This is the wine [tirosh] and the olive oil [yitzhar], which are clear and resemble tears [dim'ah], and are refined.  And so explained Menahem [ben Seruk]. 
(3) DO NOT PUT OFF.  Rather, [give it] first, at the beginning of all of the tithes.  YOU SHALL GIVE ME THE MALE FIRST-BORN AMONG YOUR CHILDREN. (29) YOU SHALL DO THE SAME WITH YOUR CATTLE, ETC.  All of these are matters of "first" [reishit].

Verse 29



Verse 30

HOLY PEOPLE.  Not to eat impure things, such as "flesh that is torn" [treifah].  And all the more so (Deut. 14:21), "You shall not eat anything that has died a natural death ....  For you are a people consecrated."

Chapter 23



Verse 1

DO NOT CARRY FALSE RUMORS [SHEMA].  As the witness is enjoined (Exod. 20:13), "Do not bear false witness against your neighbor," the judges are enjoined not to accept [such] testimony or to listen [lishmoa] to lies.  Rather (Deut. 18:13), "you shall investigate and inquire."  And even if there are two false witnesses, do not join them to testify as they do, and even if the matter is resolved in accordance with their testimony because no one contradicts them.

Verse 2

(1) DO NOT SIDE WITH A MULTITUDE TO DO EVIL.  If they are, in your opinion, judging not in accordance with the law, even if they believe the multitude rather than you.  
(2) AND DO NOT BEAR WITNESS IN A CAUSE TO TURN ASIDE AFTER A MULTITUDE TO PERVERT. Justice.  And even if they are acquitting an individual and saving him from the death penalty.  

Verse 3

DO NOT SHOW DEFERENCE TO A POOR PERSON.  As it is written (Lev. 19:15), "do not favor the poor or show deference to the rich." Rather, "judge your fellow fairly."

Verse 4



Verse 5

(1) THE ASS OF YOUR ENEMY.  It speaks in terms of the typical scenario.  
(2) YOU MUST NEVERTHELESS RAISE IT.  An expression of aid and reinforcement, as it is written (Neh. 3:8), "they restored [vaya'azvu] Jerusalem as far as the wall"; [and] (Deut. 32:36) "And neither bond nor free [azuv] is left."

Verse 6



Verse 7

KEEP FAR FROM A FALSE CHARGE.  And if it appears to you that the case is deceitful, with deceitful witnesses, and you cannot refute them, keep away from that case and do not adjudicate it at all.  Nevertheless, if he [the criminal defendant] is acquitted, and prevails in the case, such that the final verdict is an acquittal, do not kill him after that, since you have accepted the witnesses and have rendered a verdict and have not paid [adequate] attention to this.  In the end, though you have acquitted him, I will not acquit him, and he deserves death, as it is written (Exod. 21:13), "it came about by an act of God."

Verse 8



Verse 9



Verse 10

GATHER IN ITS YIELD.  Into your house, and do not leave it unclaimed, except that (v.11), IN THE SEVENTH YOU SHALL LET IT REST. and not sow, AND LEAVE IT ALONE, that you should not gather in its yield.

Verse 11

YOUR VINEYARDS AND YOUR OLIVE GROVES.  Just as with the grain harvest.  It is the practice in Scripture to mention "the grain, the wine and the oil" [see, e.g., Deut. 18:4], and the same rule applies to all foods that grow from the ground, as is written in Parashat B'har Sinai.

Verse 12



Verse 13

CONCERNING ALL THAT I HAVE TOLD YOU from the beginning of the [Ten] Commandments until now, BE ON GUARD.  The Torah repeats its prohibitions over and over, but our Sages interpreted this (Shabbat 18a) to add [the requirement] that your implements rest on Shabbat.

Verse 14



Verse 15



Verse 16

(1) THE FEAST OF THE HARVEST.  The sacrifices written in the section "Shor O Kesev" (Lev. 23:16-20) and the two loaves, which are the "offering of new grain" (Lev. 23:16).  
(2) THE FIRST FRUITS OF YOUR WORK.  [The bringing of which is a condition precedent to using] the new grain in the Temple.  
(3) THE FEAST OF INGATHERING. The festival of Sukkot at the time of the ingathering, when the granaries are full of grain, and the vats [full] of wine and oil, and Scripture commands sitting in sukkot as a reminder that in the Wilderness, they sat in tents, and did not have land, or grain or wine or oil.  Thus you have three festivals, each dependent on the fruit of the Land -- Ripening [see Exod. 13:4], Harvest, and Ingathering.

Verse 17

THE SOVEREIGN, ADONAI.  And the land is His, so no one should covet your land when you go up to be seen [to make the pilgrimage], as is explained in Parashat Ki Tisa [Exod. 34:23-24]:  "Three times a year all your males shall appear before the Sovereign Adonai, the God of Israel." and juxtaposed to it:  "I will drive out nations from your path and enlarge your territory; no one will covet your land when you go up to appear, etc."  Similarly in each place, it is according to the nature of the deeds of the Holy One, blessed be He, that the section refers to the Holy One, blessed be He.  Also, our Sages explained, regarding (Isa. 10:33), "Lo! The Sovereign Adonai of Hosts Will hew off the tree-crowns," that in every place where you find [something like] this expression, [it refers to God as] bringing people out of and into dwellings.

Verse 18



Verse 19



Verse 20

SENDING A MESSENGER.  As it says in Joshua (5:14), "I am captain of GOD’s host. Now I have come" to save Israe.

Verse 21

(1) DO NOT DEFY [TAMER] HIM.  This is from the same root as (Lev. 27:22), "if one makes a substitution."  And if it [the mem in our verse] has a dagesh, it is from [the same root as] (Jer. 48:11), "his bouquet is unspoiled" [namer, mem with dagesh].  It is like (Esth. 6:10), "Omit nothing" [tapel, with a dagesh] from the root "nafal."  But it is not from the root for refusal, from (Lam. 1:20) "maroh m'ritem"; if it were [from that root] it would have to say "al tamreh," as in (Josh. 1:18) "anyone who flouts [yamreh] your commands."  (2) ALTHOUGH [JPS: FOR] MY NAME IS IN HIM.  It is in My name that he commands you, but he does not have authority to forgive your sins.

Verse 22



Verse 23



Verse 24

YOU SHALL SURELY TEAR THEM DOWN.  On my own, from my youth, I have emended this to "t'horsem," in the strong conjugation [pi'el], and I have considered the French texts, where it is vocalized "taharsem," in the weak conjugation [kal], as in (Deut. 13:10), "harog tahargenu," to be corrupt.  But since "hores" is vocalized in the strong conjugation, "t'horsem" must also be vocalized in the strong conjugation, as is "shaber t'shaber" [in this verse].  And subsequently, I have found that in all of the Spanish and German texts, it is as I have emended it, in the dagesh conjugation

Verse 25



Verse 26



Verse 27

(1) MY TERROR.  The fear of God on those who wage war against you.  
(2) I WILL THROW INTO PANIC [V'HAMOTI].  V'hamamti [I will cause confusion] confusion with My voice [m'humat koli], as it is written (I Sam. 7:10), "the LORD thundered mightily against [vay'humam] the Philistines," and similarly  (II Sam. 22:15), "lightning and put them to rout [vayahom]."  Just as from s-b-b, [we get, in the past tense] "saboti."  However, the word for causing death is "v'heimatti" [rather than "v'hamoti."

Verse 28



Verse 29



Verse 30



Verse 31

(1) V'SHATTI [I WILL SET].  As if it were "v'shat'ti."  Similarly, "karatti brit" [I made a covenant] is like "karat'ti."
(2) FROM THE SEA OF REEDS.  Which is at the edge of the eastern border of the Land of Israel, as Parashat D'varim shows.
(3) UP TO THE PHILISTINE SEA.  Which is on the west, as it is written (Isa. 9:11), "and the Philistines on the west."
(4) AND FROM THE WILDERNESS.  In which the Israelites walked from the south.  
(5) TO THE RIVER.  The Euphrates on the north, as it is written (Jer. 1:14), "the evil will begin from the north," because Babylonia was to the north.

Chapter 24



Verse 1

(1) THEN HE SAID TO MOSHE.  From "Moses approached the thick cloud where God was. Adonai said to Moses: Thus shall you say to the Israelites:"  (Exod. 20:18-19), all of those passages up to here [were said to the people] on the day when they heard the Ten Sayings, BUT TO MOSHE alone HE SAID, when he came down on that day.  
(2) COME UP TO ADONAI, tomorrow,  
(3) YOU AND AHARON, ETC.  And immediately afterward, Moshe descended, and (v.3) HE REPEATED TO THE PEOPLE ALL THE COMMANDS OF ADONAI, ETC.  And on the next day, he built an altar (v.4) and offered sacrifices (v.5), and on that same day, he went up and the cloud covered him for six days, etc. (vv. 15-16).  ...
(4) AND HE an angel SAID.  
(5) COME UP TO GOD.  Since it did not say "to Me," as it says below:  "Come up to Me on the mountain, etc."

The Book of the Covenant - It is written in Heaven: And Moshe will write, etc.
We will do and We will obey - We will do what is spoken, and also obey what is commanded later to then fulfill.

Verse 8



Verse 9



Verse 10

(1) THEY SAW THE GOD OF ISRAEL. Similarly to (Exod. 33:23), "You will see My back." 
(2)  WHITENESS [JPS:  PAVEMENT].  Whiteness.  
(3) APPEARANCE [JPS: LIKE THE VERY].  Appearance, as in (Lam. 4:7), "Their limbs were ruddier than coral."  
(4) FOR PURITY.  When the sky is clear and cloudless.

Verse 11

(1) AND AGAINST THE LEADERS OF THE ISRAELITES HE DID NOT RAISE HIS HAND.  Even though "they saw the God of Israel" (v.10), the Holy One, blessed be He, did not raise His hand against them, as it is written (Num. 4:20), "when they glimpse the sacred, they will die."  Similarly regarding the residents of Bet Shemesh (I Sam. 6:19):  "because they looked into the Ark of the LORD."  And regarding Moshe Rabbeinu (Exod. 3:6), "because he was afraid to look [at God.]"  And here, the Holy One, blessed be He, accorded them honor, and because he made a covenant with them, he appeared to them, as I have explained regarding the Covenant Between the Pieces, where He passed between those pieces, and there it is written (Gen. 15:18), "On that day, Adonai made a covenant with Avraham, etc."  Similarly below, regarding the making of the covenant in Parashat Ki Tisa, (Exod. 33:23), "You will see My back," and it is written (Exod. 34:6), "Adonai passed before him," and it is written after that (Exod. 34:10), "[God] said: I hereby make a covenant."  
(2) THEY ATE AND DRANK.  They offered the burnt offerings, and they ate the offerings of well-being, as it is written above (v.5), "they sacrificed bulls as well-being sacrifices."

This is explained in [Parashat] Ki Tissa (Ex. 30:23-25).
V'LIK'TORET HASAMIM.  In other words, for purposes of the incense [k'toret], they brought spices, as it is written with regard to the incense (Ex. 30:34), "Take for yourself spices" in [Parashat] Ki Tissa. 

Verse 7



Verse 8

MIKDASH.  An expression of meeting, for He prepares [mitkadesh] and readies Himself for them for some understood purpose [l'davar muvan], as it is written (Ex. 29:43), "there I will meeet with the Israelites [and it will be kadosh through My presence]."

Verse 9

LIKE ALL THAT I SHOW.  Like all of the images of vessels and buildings [that] the Holy One, blessed be He, actually showed to Moshe, as we find with Yehezkel and the Second Temple, fhat He showed him in Babylonia in "divine visions."  He also showed him and explained to him orally, as it is written, and it is demonstrated just below (Ex. 25:40): "that are being shown to you on the mountain."  If it were by speech alone, it would say "that are being shown to you "; why would it be necessary to say "on the mountain"?

Verse 10

THEY SHALL MAKE AN ARK OF ACACIA WOOD.  Because it is in the construct state -- "an ark of acacia wood" -- it is therefor vocalized with a hataf-patah.  And even though in the actual actions of Betzalel we find that he made the mishkan first and then the appurtenances -- ark, lamp, table -- for where would he place the ark and table as long as the mishkan was not made -- nevertheless, in the instructions, it was necessary to explain the making of the ark and table first, since it ws for the sake of the ark, which was the essence of "make for Me a sanctuary," that it was necessary to make the mishkan.

Verse 11

AT ONE END. In the middle of the width edge [i.e., the short -- north and south -- side of the ark, which was situated with its length aligned north-south] of the cover, so that the face of the Divine Presence would be visible to him from the side of the sanctuary [when Moshe entered the Holy of Holies from the east, the Sh'china would be visible between the k'ruvim.]


Verse 20

Verse 29

(1) BOWLS.  A mold like a basket broken open in which to make bread.  
(2) ITS LADLES.  For purposes of the two measures of frankincense, as it is written (Lev. 24:7), "With each row you shall place pure frankincense."  ...
(3) ITS PROPS AND CLEANERS.  (JPS: Its jars and jugs.)  These are explained in Menahot.  Because the bread was placed (Lev. 24:6) "in two [vertical] rows, six to a row," one on top of another, and there were forks on either side of the table, and the kasot were like [lengthwise] split reeds extending from one fork to the other, and the bread on the kasot.  And similarly [there were kasot] between the loaves of bread, six, each above another, and thus they are referred to elsewhere as "k'sot hanasech" -- because they cover [m'sach'chin] the bread, between one loaf and another.  ...
(4) WITH WHICH TO COVER [YASECH]  (JPS: with which to offer libations).  With the kasot, as I have explained.

Verse 30

BREAD OF DISPLAY.  According to the plain sense, bread that is appropriate before [lif'nei] nobles, nice bread, as it is written (Lev. 24:5), "You shall take choice flour and bake of it etc.".  And it is written (Gen. 43:34), "Portions were served them from his table [panav]."  And it is written (I Sam. 1:5), "to Hannah he would give one good [apayim] portion" -- a nice portion from the platter that was before Elkanah, the choice one that is placed before the master of the house -- "because he loved Hannah" -- therefore good and choice -- "and Adonai had closed her womb" -- therefore one portion and not two, and not many portions, as for P'ninah, who had sons and daughters.

(3) THE LAMPS.  Seven on the seven stems.  
(4) SO AS TO GIVE LIGHT ON ITS FRONT SIDE.  He should light the wicks toward the side facing [in the direction across from] the lampstand, which is the side of the table, which is opposite it, as it is written (Exod. 26:35), "and the lampstand opposite the table," and it is likewise written (Num. 8:2), "Towards opposite [JPS:  at the front of] the lampstand shall the seven lamps give light."

2) SO THAT THE TABERNACLE BECOMES ONE.  The ten strips that are called the Tabernacle will become one.

Verse 7



Verse 8



Verse 9

FOLD OVER THE SIXTH CLOTH. In other words, half of it should hang down AT THE FRONT OF THE TENT, and half of the last one will be excess, over the rear of the mishkan, greater than the strips of the mishkan by two cubits. How so? The ten lower ones, when they are joined together, are 40 cubits long and 28 wide. And the mishkan is 30 cubits long, because the 20 planks on the north side, and the 20 on the south side were [each set] 30 cubits long, because the width of a plank was 1.5 cubits. When they would spread [the bottom set of ten strips] their length [i.e., of the set of strips joined together] lengthwise on the mishkan, 30 cubits long, and thus ten cubits were suspended behind the mishkan. And on the north side and on the south side: of the 28 cubits, ten were over the mishkan, and on the sides, it hung down, nine on this side, on the north wall, and nine on the south wall. And when they spread over it the goat's hair curtains, whose length [i.e., the length of the set of strips joined together] was 44 [cubits], one-half of a strip, which was two cubits, was folded [over the front, eastern, edge, and hung] down, and the 30 [cubits] was over the mishkan, even with the lower strips. Of the twelve remaining [cubits, out of the 44], ten hung behind [on the west side of] the mishkan, even with the lower strips, and the remaining one-half strip, which was two cubits, was in excess of the lower strips. And when its width [i.e., the width of the set of strips], which was 30 cubits when they were joined together then, was spread out over the width of the mishkan, ten and ten cubits of that hung to the north side and to the south side, resulting in one cubit on this side and one on that side in excess of the lower strips, which hung down nine cubits on this side and nine on that side, but these [the goat skin strips] were ten [cubits hanging down on each side]. Thus it is written (v.13), "the extra cubit at either end."

Verse 13

ON THE SIDES OF THE MISHKAN ... TO COVER the [lowest] cubit [of the board, which were in] the sockets, down to the ground, for the boards were ten cubits high, including the sockets.

Verse 14

A COVERING OF DOLPHIN SKINS ABOVE.  Above the ram skins; the plain meaning implies this, and some explain it this way in Tractate Shabbat.

Verse 15



Verse 16



Verse 17

(1) TWO TENONS FOR EACH PLANK.  The planks were grooved in their middles [on the bottom surface] so as to leave two tenons remaining.  
(2) PARALLEL.  The tenons, to each other.  And all around the tenons, the [bottom surface of the] plank was grooved on all sides of the tenons, so that the tenons of each plank could fit into the two sockets that were under each plank, and the sockets were also hollowed, to inser the tenons into them.

Verse 22

AND FOR THE REAR OF THE TABERNACLE, TO THE WEST, MAKE SIX PLANKS.  Which extended nine cubits from north to south, leaving one-half cubit in the western corner on the north on this end, and on the south on the other end, of air [vacant space].  And thus the "two planks for the corners" (see v.23), each one-and-a-half cubits [wide], come and fill in, on the north end, the half-cubit [space] and the one-cubit [thickness] of the plank [on the north side], and makes the tabernacle even, and covers the [one-cubit] thickness of the northern plank.  And similarly, a cubit of the [width of the] second plank covers the thickness of the southern plank.  Thus the space within the tabernacle is ten cubits wide, and the defect of the corners is covered, and is even on this side and on that side, and the corners of the tabernacle are entirely square.

(1) CURTAIN.  According to the context, this is an expression of partition and separation between one room and another.  
(2) WORK OF A DESIGNER.  A craftsperson.  Like robes where the designs are the work of a weaver.  However, embroidery (see v.36) is an illustration with yarn with a needle on the outside.

Verse 32



Verse 33

HANG THE CURTAIN UNDER THE CLASPS.  Of gold, which were at the end of 20 cubits of the roof hangings from the beginning of the tabernacle.  For the length of the tabernacle was 30 [cubits], and the clasps were in the middle of the 40 cubits of the ten roof hangings.  As a result, from the curtain to the east entrance was the 20 [cubits] of the hall [heichal -- the portion that was not the Holy of Holies], and from it [the curtain] to the west side was the ten cubits of the Holy of Holies room.


Verse 34



Verse 35



Verse 36

(1) SCREEN FOR THE ENTRANCE OF THE TENT.  Because there were no strips there except for the half strip folded over from above.  
(2) SCREEN.  Like "meisich" [covering], similarly "magen" [a shield -- see Gen. 15:1 -- is like]  "meigin" ["protecting"].  Therefore, even when they [the nouns] are combined [in a s'michut -- a construct case], they are not vocalized with a hataf [a sh'va] under their first letters, because they are expressions of present action, as it is written (Num. 4:25), "the screen for the entrance of the Tent of Meeting" -- protector of the entrance.  Similarly (II Sam. 1:21), "The shield [magen] of Saul, polished with oil no more."  However, "davar" [matter] and "bakar" [cattle], which are nouns, when they are combined [s'michut], they are vocalized with a hataf [a sh'va] -- (Num. 7:88) "the cattle of [b'kar] the peace offering, (Deut. 15:2) "the matter of [d'var] of the remission."

Verse 1

YOU SHALL MAKE THE ALTAR.  The external altar, in the courtyard.

Verse 3

(1) ITS SCRAPERS.  Called vadil in the vernacular, with which to gather the ashes and place them in the pails, in which to take out the ashes, as described in Parashat Tzav (Lev. 6:3-4).  
(2) ITS BASINS.  To collect the blood of the sacrifices, to spatter it on the altar.   
(3) ITS FLESH HOOKS.  With which to take the limbs of the sacrifices to turn them over on the coals of the grate and turn them into smoke.   
(4) AND THEIR FIRE PANS.  With which to rake coals, as it is written (Isa. 30:14), "to scoop coals from a brazier," and (Prov. 6:27), "can a man rake embers into his bosom."

Verse 4



Verse 5

(1) LEDGE.  The access to the altar.  It is narrow at the top, in order [for the priests] to walk along that access around the altar.  And also in the halacha that is what it is called in [Tractate] Hullin:  "to hollow out [y'charkev]."  Protrusions and cavities in vessels, and grooves that one makes in them, are referred to this way.  
(2) TO THE MIDDLE OF THE ALTAR.  To separate the blood at the top from that at the bottom.  The mnemonic is, "The burnt offering of a fowl is above [or: the fowl goes upwards] and the sin offering of the fowl is below; regarding animals, it is the reverse: the sin offering is above, and the burnt offering is below."  All of this is in Tractate Zevahim.

Verse 6

Verse 8

HOLLOW, OF BOARDS [N'VUV LUHOT].  Hollow, and so (Job 11:12), "A hollow man will get understanding."  And when they camp, they will fill it with dirt and then sacrifice on it.

Verse 9

HANGINGS [K'LA'IM].  Menahem explained this is a matter of the hangings of the Tent and a second partition.  He explained that (I Kings 6:32) "he carved [kala] on them reliefs [mikla'ot] of cherubim," and (I Kings 6:18) "carvings [mikla'ot] of gourds" are matters of etching.  And I say that even the hangings [k'la'im] of the Mishkan courtyard were made as the carvings [mikla'ot] and drawings.

Verse 10

FIFTEEN CUBITS OF HANGINGS ON THE FLANK.  On the east side, at the entrance to the courtyard, which was 50 cubits wide, 15 cubits on one [the north] side with hangings, and likewise on the other [south] side, and the curtain of 20 [cubits] in the middle, making 50 cubits of covering.

Verse 18

AND THE WIDTH 50 CUBITS.  How so?  The courtyard was 100 cubits long, east to west, for the northern wall was 100 cubits of hangings, as was the southern one, and from the north to the south, the width of the courtyard was 50 cubits.  And the Tabernacle was 30 [cubits] long and ten wide.  And he set up the Tabernacle on the edge of the 50 of the 100, and there remained a courtyard from the Tabernacle, 50 cubits square, and empty, and on the other three sides [of the Tabernacle] there was courtyard 20 cubits [deep], for it [the Tabernacle] was 30 [cubits] long, so that there remained behind it, to the west, 20 [cubits] out of the 50 of the 100-cubit length [of the courtyard].  And its [the Tabernacle's] width was ten, so that there remained to the north 20 of the 50 [cubits' width of the courtyeard], and likewise to the south.

Verse 19



Verse 20

YOU SHALL COMMAND [t'tzaveh].  Above (Ex. 25:2) it says, "Speak [daber] to the Israelites that they take for Me an offering" -- for temporary purposes, for the needs of the Mishkan.  But here, where He commands, this is for all the generations, to take oil for the lamp for every year.  Thus it says, "you shall command" -- it changes the language, because all expressions of "commanding" are for the generations and for the immediate time.  And so it says in Torat Kohanim [on Lev. 6:2] and in the Sifrei, that all expressions of command are specifically for the immediate and for the generations.

BREASTPIECE. According to the context and the plain sense, it is like a sheath and a pocket, since it is "doubled" (kaful, Ex. 28:16).
EPHOD. A term for a garment with which one adorns oneself, and a person is covered by it over his other clothes.
TASHBETZ.  It is made with many holes/depressions.

Verse 5



Verse 6

THEY SHALL MAKE THE EPHOD.  The ephod and the breastpiece my grandfather [Rashi] explained, but I will explain about them some matters that have not been explained.

Verse 7

Verse 9



Verse 10



Verse 11

(1) THE WORK OF A LAPIDARY [HARASH EVEN]. This is connected [i.e., harash is in the smichut], and thus the resh is [vocalized with] patah -- a harash of stone, a craftsperson to carve stone [l'fateah]. And it is a dagesh form, like ganav, and so the het has a kamatz rather than a hataf. 
(2) פתוחי חותם. Similar to the engravings of signet letters made on rings.

Verse 12



Verse 13

THEN MAKE FRAMES OF GOLD.  Like a gold plate with holes in the middle, in which to insert the ends of the chains -- a single thick piece which is like an edge or end and like a kind of bouton [button] that is made at the ends of silk belts, so that it will enter the frames. 

Verse 14

(1) LIKE CORDED WORK.  Since there are chains of a different sort, with this [link] inserted into the next like hooks, [the Torah] had to explain that these were not made that way but thick throughout like our ropes.  
(2) FASTEN THE CORDED CHAINS TO THE FRAMES.  And it has still not explained where they are attached.  Below [vv. 23-25] it explains that the two ends of the chains are set in the breastplate rings, and the two ends that are set in the frames are set on the shoulder pieces of the ephod toward the front.

Verse 15

BREASTPIECE OF JUDGMENT. Because they placed in it the Urim and Tumim, which made pronouncements for Israel about judgments and about their needs, as it is written (Num. 27:21), "He shall on his behalf seek the decision of the Urim," that is why it is called the breastpiece of judgment.

ON THE BREASTPIECE MAKE BRAIDED CHAINS. These [the shar'shot] are the chains [shar'sh'rot] that are on the frames that are mentioned above (v.14). 

Verse 23

MAKE ON THE BREASTPIECE.  I.e., on the two upper ends you shall place the rings, into which you shall thread the two rope-like chains, and the two ends that are set in the frames you shall set on the shoulder pieces of the ephod.  And the lower edge of the breastpiece would still be able to swing from side to side, except that it is attached to the ephod as explained below:  that one makes two rings on each end of the edge of the breastpiece, inwards, and two rings on the edge of the ephod, at the ends of the shoulder pieces, where they are attached below to the ephod, with the sash above.  Those of the breastpiece will be below, and those of the ephod above, and a blue thread would go from the ephod rings to the breastpiece rings, with the breastpiece above and the ephod below.

(1) ROBE OF THE EPHOD.  Over which he wears the ephod.  
(2) PURE BLUE.  Entirely blue.  And it seems to me that [the reason is] becauseit was visible under the ephod and the hoshen, which come as reminders.  And the blue, which resembles the sky, is also a reminder, as our Sages wrote with respect to the blue of the tzitzit:  the blue resembles the sea, and the sea resembles the sky, aned the sky resembles the Throne of Glory.   Thus it is entirely blue, without purple or red.  

Verse 32

(1) OPENING OF A COAT OF MAIL; OPENING FOR THE HEAD.  An opening in which one inserts one's head when one wears it.  
(2) IN IT.  In the middle at the top.  Not that these are the same, but like the garments of Christian clergy.  
(3) SO THAT IT DOES NOT TEAR.  He should not open the neck hole at the bottom, as with our garments, but at the top, so that at the time of its weaving, one leaves a neck hole in it. 

Verse 33



Verse 34



Verse 35

SO THAT THE SOUND OF IT IS HEARD WHEN HE COMES INTO THE SANCTUARY.  The golden bells will knock and strike each other, despite the protrusion of the pomegranates between them.  And because the Holy One, blessed be He, commanded (Lev. 16:17), "When he goes in to make expiation in the Shrine, nobody else shall be in the Tent of Meeting until he comes out," therefore the Holy One, blessed be He, commanded, "so that the sound of it is heard when he comes in," and those who hear will move away from there.

Verse 36



Verse 37



Verse 38

ונשא אהרן את עון הקדשים, according to the plain meaning of the text the reference is not to sacred things which have been allowed to become ritually impure, but the meaning is as follows: the fact that the High Priest would wear the tzitz would facilitate the atonement needed by the various members of the Jewish people requiring same by means of the sacrificial offerings prescribed by the Torah to expiate their sins.

Verse 39



Verse 40

FOR DIGNITY AND ADORNMENT.  Since the turbans were worn on the head, they needed an additionally beautifying adornment.

Chapter 29



Verse 1



Verse 2

UNLEAVENED BREAD.  An item baked in an oven is called "bread" [lehem], and it also had oil in it.  For it is the "bread" [lehem] that is mentioned with the "loaves" and "crackers" in the consecration ceremony in Parashat Tzav (Lev. 8:26).  Loaves and crackers are specifically mentioned in Tractate M'nahot, and ten of each type were used.

GIRD BOTH AARON AND HIS SONS WITH SASHES.  There is a disagreement about this in Tractate Yoma, because the order of the dressing here is not the same as in Parashat Tzav.  And by the plain meaning of the text, there is no need to be precise in this matter.

These are both expressions of separation; however, the breast is called "t'nufah" [elevation] because it alone is elevated and eaten, but the thigh in this instance is turned into smoke, though for the future, both of them are eaten.

Verse 28



Verse 29

TO BE ANOINTED IN.  To be magnified through them, in the manner of anointing with oil.  Similarly, it everywhere refers to the great ones as "anointed" -- "Do not touch my anointed ones" (Ps. 105:15).

YOU SHALL ORDAIN THEM THROUGH SEVEN DAYS.  The seven days before the eighth day when the worship is to be done by Aharon and his sons.  Moshe would erect the Mishkan each day and offer sacrifices each day, and in the evening, he would disassemble it.  And on the eighth day, which was the first of Nisan, the Mishkan was fully erected, as is written in Parashat P'kudei, and from then on, the worship was performed by Aharon and his sons.

B'SAMIM ROSH.  Esteemed, as it is written (Song of Songs 4:14), "all the chief spices."  What seems right to me is that "b'samim" means spices that derive from trees, as it is written (Song of Songs 4:16), "Blow on my garden, that its perfume may spread."  But "b'samim rosh" refers to kinds of tree resins, or to substances that are produced from the ground.  


Verse 24



Verse 25

COMPOUND OF INGREDIENTS.  According to its plain sense, pounded and placed in oil, and he mixed them well, as in (Job 41:22), "He makes the sea [boil] like an ointment-pot," an expression of mixing.

THIS CALF CAME OUT.  Its work concluded.  As it is written (Prov. 25:4), "A vessel emerged for the smith," (Isa. 54:16), "And produce the tools for his work."

Verse 25

(1) THAT IT WAS OUT OF CONTROL.  Nullified from the commandments, the commandments of its Creator, as it is written (Prov. 1:25), "You spurned all my advice," (Prov. 4:15), "Avoid it; do not pass through it."  
(2) A MATTER OF SCORN (JPS: A MENACE).  As words of (Ps. 44:14) "scorn and derision" of their enemies, as in (Job 4:12) "My ear caught a whisper of it," a sort of word.

Verse 26

(1) DEDICATE YOURSELVES TO THE LORD TODAY.  As in (Num. 32:12), "they remained loyal to the Lord," which is in the past tense.  [Alt.:  YOUR HANDS HAVE REMAINED LOYAL TO THE LORD TODAY.  Like "they remained loyal to the Lord"-- a past tense.]  
(2) TODAY.  Each of you lift up [alt. text:  dedicate] your hand in sacrifice to Adonai, for "each of you has been against son and brother," you have raised your hands to heaven.

Verse 32

LEST I CONSUME [JPS: DESTROY] YOU [ACHEL'CHA].  Like "ochelcha" -- "ochel otcha" [consume you].  "For Adonai your God is a consuming fire" (Deut. 4:24).

Verse 4

FINERY.  Types of adornment, because they were engaged in mourning, as it is written (in this verse), "They went into mourning, and none put on his finery," for the Holy One, blessed be He, had said to them (v.5), "take off your finery."  

Verse 5



Verse 6



Verse 7

(1) WOULD TAKE.  Took.  
(2) AT SOME DISTANCE.  He acted with respect to them as if they were excommunicated, because the Holy One, blessed be He, did not want to speak with Moshe inside the Israelite camp.

Verse 8



Verse 9



Verse 10



Verse 11



Verse 12

(1) SEE, YOU SAY TO ME, "LEAD FORWARD."  As it is written above (32:34), "Go now, lead the people."  
(2) YOU HAVE NOT MADE KNOWN TO ME.  Rather (id.) "See, My messenger shall go before you," while I want only that You go with us Yourself.

Verse 13



Verse 14

(1) MY FACE WILL GO.  I Myself will go, as you requested, as it is written (II Sam. 17:11), " you yourself march into battle."  
(2) I WILL LIGHTEN YOUR BURDEN [vahanihoti lach]. I will go with you to conquer the land until I relieve you of your enemies round about, as it is written (Deut. 3:20), "until Adonai has granted your kin a haven such as you have," (Deut. 25:19) "Therefore, when Adonai your God grants you safety from all your enemies."  And the one who explains vahanihoti lach as "I will create peace of mind [hanahat ruah]," as I will grant your request, this is foolishness -- does the Holy One, blessed be He, tell Moshe "vahanihoti lach" whenever He accedes to his request?  And wouldn't such an expression be superfluous and entirely unnecessary?  And this is unwise.

Verse 15

(1) UNLESS YOU, ETC.   In other words, "For if You do not go with us" -- [see Rashbam on v.16]

Verse 16

[see Rashbam on v.15.]  (1) HOW, THEREFORE, CAN IT BE KNOWN, ETC. ...  I AND YOUR PEOPLE WILL BE DISTINGUISHED  ETC.  This is the beginning of another request -- I also ask of You that I be distinguished and differentiated alone from all of the Jewish People, so that it can be known that I am faithful as a prophet and a reprover, so that they will heed my words.  And also Your people should be distinguished, in that You will go with them, from all nations on the face of the earth.

Verse 17

ALSO THIS THING THAT YOU HAVE SPOKEN.  To be distinguished, and to be seen as a judge and superior to them, in addition to the going -- that I will go with them -- about which I have already assented.  And this is the radiance of face about which it is written below (Exod. 34:10), "Before all your people, I will effect separations," all of which is explained there.

Verse 18

OH, LET ME BEHOLD YOUR PRESENCE!  You should be astonished -- how could Moshe Rabbenu dare to take pleasure in the splendid face of the Divine Presence?  Doesn't Scripture recount, to his praise, that (Ex. 3:6) "Moses hid his face, for he was afraid to look at God"?  God forbid that he would have intended anything except to make a covenant with Him on two matters with respect to which the Holy One, blessed be He, had acceded to him -- on his radiance [of face] (v.16): "that we may be distinguished, Your people and I," and on (v.14): "My face will go" -- to grant you safety from all your enemies [see Deut. 25:19].  Therefore, he said, "Let me behold Your presence" -- making a covenant regarding what You have promised me.  Thus did Avraham when he said (Gen. 15:8), "How shall I know," and there it is written (Gen. 15:17), "there appeared a smoking oven, and a flaming torch which passed between those pieces," and juxtaposed to it (Gen. 15:18), "On that day Adonai made a covenant with Avram, saying, 'To your offspring I have assigned.'"  Likewise here, Moshe asked the Holy One, blessed be He, for a confirming covenant, and the Holy One, blessed be He, acceded, in that He would appear to him in making a covenant, as it is written (Exod. 34:6), "Adonai passed before him and proclaimed, etc.," and as it is written after that (Exod. 34:10), "I hereby make a covenant. Before all your people I will effect distinctions" as you requested (v.16), "that we may be distinguished, I and Your people, etc.," for (Ex. 34:10), "how awesome it is" -- as it is written (Exod. 34:30), "they were afraid to approach him."

Verse 19



Verse 20



Verse 21



Verse 22



Verse 23

YOU WILL SEE MY BACK.  After I have passed in front of your face as the making of a covenant of seeing, like (Jer. 34:18) "the calf which they cut in two so as to pass between the halves" -- it was by means of such passing that they would make covenants.

(1) HE STOOD WITH HIM.  With Moshe, who was standing there, as it is written (Exod. 33:21), "Station yourself on the rock."  
(2) HE CALLED ON GOD BY NAME.  The Holy One, blessed be He, called, as He was passing, by name, as it makes clear below.  For so it is written above (Exod. 33:19), "I will proclaim the name Adonai before you."

Verse 6



Verse 7



Verse 8

MOSHE HASTENED. When he saw the Holy One, blessed be He, passing, and heard His voice, he immediately began to bow down.

Verse 9



Verse 10

I HEREBY MAKE A COVENANT.  That I will go with you, and (Exod. 33:17) "I will also do this thing that you have asked," for you said (Exod. 33:16), "that we may be distinguished, Your people and I," for BEFORE ALL YOUR PEOPLE I will make for you a distinction, and THE WHOLE PEOPLE WILL SEE the greatness THAT I AM PERFORMING FOR YOU, HOW AWESOME IT IS, as it is written (Exod. 34:30), "they shrank from coming near him," and (Exod. 34:35), "the Israelites would see Moshe's face, how radiant etc."

(2) YOU SHALL CEASE FROM LABOR AT PLOWING TIME AND HARVEST TIME.  For it is important and dear to people, and all the more so with other kinds of work.

Verse 22

Verse 27

(1) WRITE DOWN THESE WORDS.  Those mentioned in this section (v.11 ff.):  "I will drive out before you, etc."  
(2) FOR IN ACCORDANCE WITH THESE WORDS.  That you should not follow after other gods, that you should not (v.12) "make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land," that you should not intermarry with them, and that you should go up for the pilgrimage festival.

Verse 28

AND HE WROTE DOWN ON THE TABLETS.  As He said above (v.1), "I will inscribe on the tablets" (Deut. 10:4) "the same text as on the first."

Verse 29

THAT [HIS FACE] WAS RADIANT.  This is an expression of glory (hod); similarly, (Hab. 3:4), "gives off rays on every side."  And one who analogizes this to (Gen. 33:17) "He has horns like the horns of the wild-ox," this is simply foolish, because there are two divisions in most words in the Torah.  Menahem also explains it this way.

Verse 30



Verse 31



Verse 32

EVERYTHING THAT ADONAI HAD IMPARTED TO HIM.  Before the incident of the Golden Calf -- all [of the commandments] written in Parashat T'rumah (Exod. 25:1 ff.) up to (32:1) "[the people saw] that Moshe tarried" -- and all [of the commandments] in this parashah.

Verse 33

VEIL.  A garment called by that name.  And the vav in it is part of the root, like the vav in (Jer. 14:8) "mikveh yisrael" (Hope of Israel).  And also the vav in (Gen. 49:11) "sutoh" (his robe) is part of the root, and these are two [different] garments and two [different] roots.  Dunash explained this way, and he is correct.

Thus, 100 kikar equals 300,000 sh'kalim.
