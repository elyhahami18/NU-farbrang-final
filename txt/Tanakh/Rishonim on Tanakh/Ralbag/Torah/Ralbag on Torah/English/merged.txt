Verse 1

[This section comments on] "And it was after these things..." until the end of the Parshah.
An Explanation of the Events of the Story
[The Torah now] makes mention that "After these things" Hashem, the All-Powerful, tested Avraham if it would be easy in his eyes to do anything that Hashem, the All-Powerful, might command him, and he said to him that he should take "his only son that he loves" (that being Yitzchak) and go to the land of Moriyah, and bring him up there for an Olah[an entirely burnt offering which "rises" to God] on one of the mountains of Moriyah which Hashem would say to him. And here the Hashem, the All-Powerful, was was intending with this statement [to tell him] that he should "bring him up for the purpose of an Olah," by which I mean to say that he should show Yitzchak there the [process of] offering of an Olah for Hashem, so that he might become educated in the service of Hashem, the All-Powerful and [ so that] he might reach his perfection [of character], [this all being] within the method/way [of the destiny of Avraham, which was] that it was fitting that the chosen offspring should be from him[Yitzchak] that Hashem, the All-Powerful, had destined to [have descend] from Avraham. And since that which may [most easily] be understood from this statement would be that which was understood from it according to the conduct [displayed by Avraham] in the story, that he should bring his son Yitzchak up there as an [actual] Olah when he sacrifices him and burns him, we see here that Hashem, the All-Powerful, has perfected a challenge for Avraham in this prophecy, [that being] would it be easy in his eyes to do anything which may become suitable [to be done] for the Hashem's Honor, and this [challenge] is [really] that if this is shown to be easy in his eyes, he shall not later come to understand from this matter [any deeper lesson] aside that which he understood of it at the beginning of the analysis [he made of Hashem's request]; but if it is difficult [to do this] in his eyes he will ask for a different [possible] intention behind the statement, aside from that which he understood at the beginning of the matter. And we see here that Avraham understood this prophecy according to that which may be understood at the beginning of the analysis. And despite all this, Avraham became eager and was greatly motivated to do what He commanded, according to his thought [of what that was]. And due to this he got up early in the morning, saddled his donkey to carry the wood of the Olah, lead two youths along with him and Yitzchak his son, split the wood of the Olah and placed them on the donkey, and got up to go to the place that Hashem, the All-Powerful, had said to him.
The first benefit is in regards to beliefs.
The second benefit is in regards to beliefs [as well].

Chapter 23



Verse 1




And when they arose in the morning, the servant said to them that they should send him away to his master and give him Rebecca, and he would take her to Issac. And behold, Bethuel did not refuse this, but her brother and her mother said - from their imaginary great love that they had for her - that it was fit that the maiden should dwell with them a year or ten months, to fill her eyes with seeing the people of her father's house, and her family and then leave. Indeed, they said this because she was going to a very faraway land, and it would not be likely that she would return to see the household of her father. So the slave besought them that they not delay him from returning to his master... And when they saw this, they said that they would ask the maiden, if she would agree to go with him. And when they asked her, she said that she would already go with him, and that the separation would not be difficult in her eyes.

Exodus



Chapter 1



Verse 1








The third purpose is regarding character traits: That is not fit for a person to do very repulsive acts - even if he is obligated and commanded to do them by his ruler. Rather it is fit that he fear more from God, may He be blessed, who rules over his ruler than he fear from his ruler...
And the fourth purpose is [also] regarding character traits, and it is that it is not fit for a person to rely upon a miracle [to protect him] if he did something out of the fear of God. Rather it is fit that he makes efforts with all of his might to distance the evil that may happen to him because of this act...

The nineteenth purpose is regarding prohibitions. And it is to remember that which we were prohibited that an Israelite apostate not eat from the Passover sacrifice. For we were commanded the Passover sacrifice in order to make us acquire perfect faith in the Lord, may He be blessed. So it is not fitting for one to eat it, who will not have this become perfect. And for this reason, we were prohibited that a resident alien and a hired hand may not eat of it, as they have not entered into our faith. Likewise one uncircumcised, as he has not fully entered into our faith. For [it is] the first commandment that someone who is of our faith will seize upon to be commanded by it. And it is also the commandment that Abraham was commanded in order to come to perfection, in such a way that [his descendants] would receive the Torah and inherit the Land, as we explained in Parshat Lech Lecha. And this is the reason that the Torah is stringent about this here. And for this reason we were also prohibited regarding one upon whom there are [others] that require circumcision - such as his small sons or slaves that are purchased by money or born within his household - that have not been circumcised; he may not eat from or perform the Passover sacrifice. [This is] because they have not fully entered into our faith, as they have already treated this first commandment lightly.

Verse 1



...Whoever ascribes divinity to anything besides Me, I will punish that one who hates Me and practices idolatry with a wondrous punishment - that the children of the sinner will be punished for this iniquity, [as well as] the third and fourth generations. And as a result, it is fitting that people guard themselves from idolatry. However for the one who loves Me and guards My commandments in such a way as to cling to Me, I will do wondrous kindness - the kindness will continue upon his offspring for thousands of generations. But behold, there is a question about this statement. And that is, how is it possible that God, may He be blessed, would punish the children of a sinner; as behold, they have no guilt for the sin of their father?? And we answer this question in this way. And it is that the punishment that God brings upon those that transgress His words - whether it be by providence, whether it be by rebuke or whether it by the secret of providence, such that the proper punishments come upon them through the system [of the constellations] - that when He brings these woes, the woe reaches their children. But it would not have reached them were it not for the sins of their parents. And the [illustration of this is] when our ancestors rebelled, they were liable for the punishment that they would be exiled among the nations, and gentiles would inherit their land. But behold the exile continues to their children after them, because of their being exiled when they gave birth to them. [It is] such that it is not possible for them to escape from this woe unless... they be at the heights of perfection, such that it is possible that God would bring them out by way of a miracle. And it is in this way that the prophet said (Lamentations 5:7), "Our fathers sinned and are no more; and we must bear their guilt." And that is because if our fathers had not sinned, we would be in the Land... But behold, when we are in exile for the sin of our fathers, guarding ourselves from disgusting acts (which caused the exile) is insufficient to have us return [to the Land]. Rather, we are required to attain [greater] perfection, such that we cling to God, may He be elevated, in such a way that He would take us out of the exile by way of wondrous providence. And in this way, there would be no injustice if the punishment would reach the children for the sake of the parents, as this is through happenstance...

Verse 2

The portion of "Rashei Hamatot"
And Moses spoke to the heads of the tribes of the children of Israel, saying, "Take vengeance for the children of Israel against the Midianites; afterward you shall be gathered to your people."
However, the benefits derived from this portion are twofold.
<b>The first benefit</b> is regarding the commandments, which entail that one should not violate their vows or break their oaths. Instead, they should fulfill everything that comes from their mouth. In this, there are two commandments: one is a negative commandment, prohibiting the violation of vows, and the other is a positive commandment, instructing the fulfillment of one's verbal commitments. The benefit of these commandments is evident, as if it were permissible for a person to profane their words, it would lead to a laxity in their faith in the Almighty. This is similar to the rationale behind the prohibition of false oaths, as it prevents the distortion of the ethical principles that guide human interactions. Moreover, there is an additional benefit, as through these commandments, a person is encouraged to exert more effort in performing good deeds. If one were to annul their own vows, the benefit of these actions would be diminished.
The second benefit is related to the commandments and pertains to the legal proceedings concerning the annulment of vows. This applies to cases involving a man and his wife, a father and his daughter during her youth, or the household of her father. The benefit of this commandment is evident, as without it, there would be constant discord and conflict between husbands and wives or fathers and daughters due to the binding nature of vows and oaths. Women, due to their more sensitive nature, are particularly prone to being affected by these vows and oaths. Therefore, the Torah provided a solution to address this potential discord by allowing for the annulment of vows within a certain timeframe. This allows the husband or father to reconsider the matter and, if it is a source of anger or conflict, the annulment can be performed promptly. This gives the opportunity for the anger to subside and for a resolution to be reached within a day, based on the customary practices of most people.

The benefits that stem from it are twelve.
<b>The first benefit</b> is to highlight the great diligence of Moses in performing the commandments of the Almighty, even though he knew that afterwards he would gather his people for war. He did not hesitate to take swift action and exact revenge according to what was possible.
<b>The second benefit</b> is to demonstrate that the righteous are not afraid of death, as they do not greatly value the physical life. Their ultimate goal is to enjoy the intellectual attainments they have acquired, even if it means sacrificing their lives. By constantly pursuing intellectual pursuits, which they have acquired, they can always derive pleasure from the attainment of these intellectual pursuits. Therefore, Moses did not fear death in this situation or in any other situation. Rather, he asked the Almighty to appoint a leader over the congregation who would diligently guide them, as his intention was solely to continue drawing from the good in his lifetime for the benefit of the people.
<b>The third benefit</b> is to make known what happened as a result of Divine Providence in this war. Although the enemies came against the Israelites in small numbers, they were able to infiltrate their camps and fortresses and kill many of them. None of the soldiers from the Israelite army were spared, and the casualties were numerous. Even young boys and women who were still virgins, having no knowledge of intimate relations, were among the thirty-two thousand who were killed. Furthermore, the success in this battle was so great that even Balaam, the son of Beor, was killed in it. If he had survived, he might have attempted to harm the Israelites.
<b>The fourth benefit</b> is to publicize the manifestation of God's great love for the Israelites. By making it known that the Midianites were punished, the Israelites would fully understand the measures they should take to avoid being influenced by their enticing ways. When the Israelites relied on divine providence, they could clearly see how harmful the remaining people of Midian were to them, as evidenced in the book of Judges. Their behavior had a more detrimental impact on the Israelites compared to other nations who ruled over them. Therefore, the commandment was given to kill all the adult males, while sparing the young boys. This was done to prevent any potential stumbling block concerning the inheritance of the land. By uniting with the entire Israelite community, the Israelites would be safeguarded against the sin of those who were naturally inclined toward their harmful practices. Furthermore, this was also the reason why God commanded the obliteration of the memory of Amalek. From the small remnant that was left, such as Haman, the son of Agag, one could see the danger they posed to the Israelites' spiritual well-being. Similarly, the commandment to kill the Midianite women, known for their involvement in immoral behavior, was to prevent the Israelites from being led astray from the path of God.
The fifth benefit is to publicly acknowledge the integrity of the soldiers who fought in the battle. Not a single person among them concealed any of the spoils of war. They brought everything before Moses, the leaders, and the entire congregation, as if they were proclaiming their honesty and sincerity. Their upright hearts demonstrated that they considered the spoils of war as belonging to God, and this immense success in the battle was granted to them due to their righteousness.
The sixth benefit is related to character traits, and it is to make known that the one who initiates a good deed is deserving of completing that deed until its fulfillment. In this regard, it is mentioned that Pinchas was the leader in this battle because he was the one who initiated avenging God's honor against Midian by killing Cozbi, the daughter of Zur, who had come to seduce the Israelites into immorality. This act also served as a cause for stopping the plague from the people of Israel by God. Therefore, God desired that Pinchas should have the privilege of leading this battle, which was intended to exact revenge on behalf of God against Midian and to save Israel from the harm they were destined to endure, as much as possible.
The seventh benefit is to publicize that there is no power in sorcery that can determine what will be required by divine providence in future events. Therefore, it is mentioned that Balak, the son of Beor, was mentioned, as even though he was a sorcerer, he did not have prior knowledge in this matter to take advice to save himself when he left those places that corrupted the Israelites.
The eighth benefit is to publicize that God had already repaid Balak for the wickedness of his heart by giving him advice to cause Israel to stumble in matters of immorality and idolatry, so that the anger of God would be kindled against them and bring them to destruction.
The ninth benefit is to make known that those who have received good from God should recognize Him and express gratitude to Him, for in this lies the benefit of what should not be concealed. Therefore, the officers and the soldiers willingly contributed many golden vessels to the name of God as a token of gratitude for all the goodness He had bestowed upon them. Not a single person among the warriors was exempted. For this reason, Moses brought them to the Tent of Meeting to preserve this wonderful example. Additionally, God commanded that a portion of the spoils be taken as a contribution to the priests and Levites, in order to awaken in them the recognition of the wondrous and extraordinary goodness that had come to them from God, not by their own strength or power.
The tenth benefit is to make known that it is proper for every person to refrain from doing something that might cause others to stumble. Thus, when the tribes of Gad and Reuben requested their portion of the land east of the Jordan, Moses and the people of Israel questioned their intention. They feared that this request might discourage the rest of the Israelites from fully inheriting the land beyond the Jordan. This concern arose because they thought that Gad and Reuben had chosen this land for themselves in order to avoid fighting alongside their brethren. However, when they agreed to go and fight alongside their fellow Israelites, even though they had no personal benefit from their request, it demonstrated that they were willing to prioritize the unity and welfare of the entire nation over their own convenience. This showed their trust in God's promise to subdue the nations before them. Thus, they entered into this battle with the understanding that it was for the greater good and not for their personal gain.
The eleventh benefit is in matters of negotiation, and it is to convey that it is appropriate for every person to clarify the details of a business agreement with others in a way that eliminates any possibility of deceit or trickery. In this regard, Moses, peace be upon him, was meticulous in setting conditions with the tribes of Gad and Reuben and elaborating on the terms to ensure that there would be no room for deception or dishonesty.
The twelfth benefit is in matters of character traits, and it is that it is not fitting for a person to prioritize personal benefits over the collective welfare. One should not choose one matter over another unless there is a comprehensive settlement. For example, it can be observed that due to the extensive cattle holdings of the tribes of Gad and Reuben, they were inclined to choose the land east of the Jordan, which was suitable for grazing. However, they realized the potential negative consequences this might have on their commitment to follow the path of the Lord. Therefore, they had to construct the altar mentioned in the Book of Joshua to demonstrate their loyalty and to dispel any doubts that they might deviate from the worship of the Lord. They were even more willing to face the dangers and fight alongside the other tribes of Israel, despite the fact that they possessed considerable wealth. It can also be seen that the first exiles carried away by the king of Assyria were precisely those tribes, as the Moabites were a constant source of anguish and harm to them due to their close proximity and the territories they had acquired from the Gadites and Reubenites through the defeat of Sihon, as described in the words of Jephthah the Gileadite.

Chapter 33



Verse 1

Parashat Maasei
These are the journeys of the children of Israel and their total number until the end of the portion.
However, the benefits that come from it are fifteen.
<b>The first benefit</b> is to provide additional details to what the Torah has recorded about the journeys of our ancestors in the wilderness for forty years. By recounting their travels, it clarifies how each journey unfolded, as many authentic accounts have already added to the truth of those details.
<b>The second benefit</b> is to demonstrate the power of the wondrous acts of the Almighty and the fulfillment of His promises. Despite the fact that, in every Egyptian household, there was death and they knew that this calamity befell them because of the Israelites, nevertheless, God, in His great favor, granted the Israelites favor in the eyes of the Egyptians. The Egyptians willingly bestowed upon them their most valuable possessions, taking advantage of the Israelites. Yet, despite all this, the Israelites departed from Egypt triumphantly, with the Egyptians burying their firstborn children.
The third benefit is to make known that the Almighty, in His desire to bring the Israelites closer to His service, led them easily to believe in Him. He first brought them to a place where they couldn't find water, so that they would recognize the kindness of the Almighty when He provided them with water. Then He led them to the place of Marah, where the water was bitter, and later brought them to a place with an abundance of water, to demonstrate that His goodness was not only limited, as some of Pharaoh's advisors had assumed. This is why Pharaoh said, "See, evil is before you," as we explained in the portion of Va'eira.
<b>The fourth benefit</b> is what we learned from the juxtaposition of the death of the Canaanite king to the death of Aaron. The death of a righteous person makes an impression, and therefore it is appropriate for people to be concerned about the passing of righteous individuals.
<b>The fifth benefit</b> is related to the commandments. We were commanded to eliminate idolatry and its worship from our land, and to remove from there the worshippers of foreign gods. For if they were allowed to remain, they would become thorns in our eyes and snares in our sides, leading Israel astray and enticing them to worship foreign gods.
The sixth benefit is derived from the mention of the boundaries of the land of Canaan, encompassing all its sides. This serves as a reminder that Israel should not neglect their efforts to fully conquer it.
The seventh benefit is to inform that despite Moses being punished and not being allowed to cross the Jordan, he still provided the specific boundaries for the inheritance of the land. Through his words, the Lord determined who would inherit the land of Israel, which land would be given to them, and which cities would be designated for the Levites. Joshua also followed this guidance in the matter of conquering and possessing the land, as described in the Book of Joshua through a closer examination.
The eighth benefit is related to the commandments, specifically the regulation of the cities of refuge, the cities of the Levites, and the allocation of their surrounding fields. The benefit of the cities of refuge is evident, as they provided a place of escape for someone who unintentionally caused another person's death. Therefore, it was necessary to have a prepared and accessible refuge available at all times. It was important to clearly mark the paths leading to these cities so that anyone passing by would know which way to go in case they needed to reach a city of refuge. Furthermore, the high priest's death marked the end of the period of refuge for the accidental killer, as the avenger of blood would no longer pursue them after the death of the high priest. The benefit of allocating specific cities to the Levites was twofold. Firstly, by providing them with cities, the Levites could dedicate themselves to the service of the Lord and focus on the secrets of the Torah. Secondly, it was important for the Levites to have suitable accommodations that were not deteriorated or damaged, as their role was connected to intellectual pursuits and spiritual guidance.
The ninth benefit is to emphasize the value of upright justice as desired by the Torah. It states that if a resident accidentally kills an Israelite, they will be exempt from the death penalty but must seek refuge in a designated city, similar to the case of intentional murder. This highlights the principle of fair treatment and demonstrates that even in cases of unintentional harm, there are consequences and responsibilities. The concept of seeking refuge in a designated city ensures both the protection of the individual who caused the accidental death and the preservation of justice within the community.
The tenth benefit is related to the commandments, specifically the commandment to execute a murderer based on the testimony of witnesses and the decision of the Israelite court (Sanhedrin). The execution should only be carried out through the authorized judicial process and not through any other means. The rationale behind this is explained in previous discussions.
The eleventh benefit pertains to the commandments. It is about the warning given to witnesses not to testify falsely against a murderer. We have already mentioned the reason for this in our previous discussion. However, in order to give the accused the benefit of the doubt, his defense should be heard, not in terms of his testimony regarding the act itself, but rather as a counterargument to the witnesses' testimony. Furthermore, since it is fitting to ensure that the death penalty is not imposed on him outside the proper jurisdiction, it is appropriate to hear the arguments of all those who advocate for his acquittal, in order to safeguard against the sin of unjustly taking a person's life. From this, it becomes clear that if the murderer himself claims to have a legitimate defense, his arguments should be heard, and if the judges see merit in his words, they should acquit him.
The twelfth benefit pertains to the commandments. It is about the commandment to impose exile on a person who unintentionally kills another. In this, there is a wondrous benefit in causing people to be extremely cautious not to engage in any action that could potentially lead to unintentional manslaughter. The fear of being subject to the lengthy exile, which lasts until the death of the High Priest, serves as a powerful deterrent against the possibility of causing accidental loss of life.
The thirteenth benefit pertains to the commandments. It is about the commandment that warns us not to accept any ransom or monetary compensation to exempt a murderer from punishment, whether it be from capital punishment or exile. Even though the Torah allows for monetary compensation in the case of an ox causing accidental death, this specific commandment serves to emphasize the great benefit of this warning. As we have explained in our commentary on this portion, the Torah explicitly mentions this commandment to highlight its importance.
The fourteenth benefit relates to beliefs and it is to inform us that sins cause the withdrawal of divine providence from those individuals who engage in those sins. We have already explained the reason behind this in our commentary on the portion of Korah.
The fifteenth benefit pertains to principles and it is to inform us that when necessity demands a deduction from a person's rightful portion for the benefit of another, it is proper that everything we can do with integrity to restore that deduction should be done in a way that it will never be deducted from it again. We should do it to the best of our ability without causing harm to the one to whom this statute and rule applies. This is exemplified by the fact that the inheritance of Zelophehad's daughters was deducted from the inheritance of the sons of Hepher, which could have been avoided by arranging it in a way that their inheritance would never be deducted from them, without causing harm to the daughters of Zelophehad. This could be achieved by their marrying within their own tribe, as the Torah desired that they marry their cousins after considering that they would not be harmed by this arrangement.
Here concludes the explanation from this book, which has been completed in a very short time and without the need for additional books. Therefore, it will be necessary for the reader to review it once again. Its completion took place on the 23rd of the month of Tevet in the year 5786, with praise and gratitude to the Almighty who assisted us. May He bless and elevate His name above all blessing and praise. Amen, amen.
And thus, the book of statutes and the banners of the armies is completed. To God, the Lord of hosts, be praise and gratitude. May He, in His mercy, cleanse us from all hidden faults and errors, and may He show us wondrous things from His Torah. May it be His will, amen.

<b>Parashat Vaetchanan</b>
There are nineteen benefits derived from this parashah
The first benefit is to inform us that when a person prays, they should first endeavor to arrange the praises of God, blessed be He, and to comprehend Him to the best of their ability. After doing so, when the person is closely connected to God, it is appropriate for them to pray and request what they desire from Him. You will see that even Moses, our teacher, peace be upon him, despite reaching a level of perfection where he was always with God to the extent that he could prophesy whenever he wished—as it is said, "Stand still, and I will hear what the Lord will command concerning you"—nevertheless, when he wanted to pray to God to ask permission to cross the Jordan and see the land, he first recounted the praises of God, blessed be He, as much as he could, indicating God's providence as far as was possible. Only afterward did he make his request. Because of this, our Sages of blessed memory established that a person should link the redemption (Geulah) to the prayer (Tefillah), so that the prayer would follow after the arrangement of the marvelous praises included in the blessings of the Shema and the Shema itself. This is also what is meant by the verse, "Delight yourself in the Lord, and He will give you the desires of your heart" (Psalms 37:4). For whoever comprehends God, blessed be He, to the extent possible, will delight in Him with a wondrous delight. Consequently, their prayer will then be heard due to the attachment of divine providence to them. This is also what Job said: "If he delights in the Almighty, he can call to God at any time" (Job 27:10).
The second benefit is to inform us that the greatness of God, blessed be He, and His mighty power are such that they can only be comprehended to a very limited extent relative to His true essence. You will see that Moses, our teacher, peace be upon him, despite reaching an extraordinary level of wisdom and prophecy, stated that he only attained a small portion of this understanding. This is why he said that God, blessed be He, had only begun to show him this.
The third benefit is to inform us that the truly righteous and perfected individuals do not choose physical life for its own sake, but rather as a means to further perfect their souls. For this reason, Moses provided the rationale for his request to God, asking to be allowed to cross the Jordan and see the land, explaining that God had already begun to show him His greatness and mighty hand. Therefore, Moses desired to enter the land, which is especially chosen for receiving divine influence, so that he could add perfection upon his existing perfection. He hoped that God, blessed be He, would reveal to him there even more of His greatness and mighty hand than He had shown him up until then, due to the superior spiritual potential of that land. He did not choose this in order to eat from the fruits of the land, as the foolish ones mistakenly believe.
The fourth benefit is to teach that a person should not boast about their wisdom and understanding, claiming that they have already achieved much. Instead, they should consider themselves to be very lacking, for this will motivate them to strive even more for perfection. You will see that even Moses, our teacher, despite the strength of his understanding, regarded himself as very lacking. He said that he was only at the beginning of the path toward attaining perfection, thinking that he could still add perfection upon his existing perfection. This is why he said, "O Lord God, You have begun to show Your servant..." (Deuteronomy 3:24).
The fifth benefit is to inform us that the reason God, blessed be He, chose to give the land to the Israelites was due to the land's superior capacity to facilitate the attainment of human perfection. This is why Moses connected the mention of the goodness of the Land of Israel, in comparison to other lands, and the superiority of the Temple Mount over the rest of the Land of Israel, with the concept of beginning to comprehend the greatness of God, blessed be He, and His mighty hand. This connection highlights that the goodness of this land serves as a means to further enhance one's perfection.
The sixth benefit pertains to beliefs and informs us of the immense difference between God, blessed be He, and the other spiritual beings. None of these beings have the ability to govern the heavens and the earth as a whole, except for God. Although some of them may have partial governance in the heavens and the earth, this authority is limited and ultimately derived from God, blessed be He. Moreover, none of these beings can perform deeds comparable to those of God or possess His might, for their actions are very limited. As I explained in the fifth book of Milchamot Hashem (Wars of the Lord), their deeds do not achieve their purpose except through a combination of many actions. In contrast, the deeds of God are complete and perfect in themselves to the highest degree. Likewise, there is no comparison between the might that arises from these beings and the might of God. Even if extraordinary feats occur through them by way of general providence, such as one nation overcoming another stronger nation, as mentioned concerning the Ammonites and Moabites, this only happens at a specific time according to the arrangement of divine providence concerning that nation at that moment. These acts of theirs, along with their might, are not done through their own means but through what is imparted to them by God, as everything comes from Him. He continually provides them with the influence they require. However, God, blessed be He, can perform mighty acts at any time He finds appropriate, not limited to a specific moment. This is also why it is said, "For what great nation is there that has a god so near to it as the Lord our God is to us whenever we call upon Him?" (Deuteronomy 4:7). Nations under the influence of the stars do not receive help from them except at specific times, according to what has been decreed for them. But God, blessed be He, assists us whenever we call upon Him in the right way—that is, when we align ourselves so that His particular providence can be attached to us. For this reason, it is also stated, "And lest you lift up your eyes to heaven and see the sun and the moon..." (Deuteronomy 4:19), which God has allotted to all the peoples. But as for you, the Lord took you, etc. This explains that the affairs of the other nations are governed by the system of the stars, while Israel is under the particular providence of God, blessed be He.
The seventh benefit pertains to character traits and teaches that when someone is punished by God, blessed be He, for their disobedience, it is appropriate for them to show that they feel the extent of what they have lost. This is beneficial for learning and accepting moral instruction. A person who does not feel that they have been struck for their disobedience will not accept correction, as the prophet says, "Why should you be stricken anymore? You will just continue to rebel" (Isaiah 1:5). For this reason, you will find that Moses demonstrated that he deeply felt the extent of what he had lost when God did not agree to let him cross the Jordan River. By doing so, Moses sought to instill in himself this important trait.
The eighth benefit pertains to beliefs and teaches us that Moses did not attain his highest level of prophecy due to an exceptional natural predisposition that made him uniquely suited to receive the prophetic influence. If that were the case, it would not have been appropriate for God to respond to Moses' request with "Enough for you" (Deuteronomy 3:26). Certainly, if Moses' prophetic perfection were due to his natural preparation, entering the Land of Israel would have further enhanced his prophecy because of the land’s superior suitability for prophecy. This makes it clear that Moses did not achieve this extraordinary level of prophecy because of an innate superiority over all other people. Such a preparation could potentially exist in others, as this is within the realm of possibility for the species, as explained in natural sciences. It will also be clarified later in the Torah that no other prophet would arise with the same status as Moses. This shows that the greatness of Moses' prophecy, through which the divine Torah was given, was granted by God as a miraculous and wondrous act, similar to the miraculous events at Mount Sinai. Because of this, God responded to Moses' request with "Enough for you," meaning that the land's superior qualities would not enhance his prophetic perfection, as this perfection was not due to his natural preparation. Instead, it was because God had granted him a level of perfection far above that of any naturally prepared individual. Therefore, it is important to understand that when we previously stated in Parashat Balak that a prophet like Moses would arise among Israel or other nations, referring to the Messiah we await, this does not mean that he will be a prophet of the Torah like Moses. Such a thing is impossible, as prophecy in itself does not reveal a divine legal code unless it is done miraculously, as was the case with Moses' prophecy. Rather, it means that the Messiah will be comparable to Moses, or even greater, in the aspects mentioned there—namely, in the performance of signs and wonders and other related matters. This is the context for the statement, "Never again did there arise in Israel a prophet like Moses" (Deuteronomy 34:10).
The ninth benefit pertains to character traits and encourages people to strive to observe everything they can in order to recognize the wisdom of God, blessed be He, who created these matters. For this reason, you will find that Moses requested, even if God would not permit him to cross the Jordan, that He at least allow him to see the land in its entirety. This way, Moses could understand the reasons for the land's qualities, both from the perspective of its natural condition and its geographical location within the inhabited world. This is reflected in Moses' words, "Please let me cross over and see the land" (Deuteronomy 3:25), where "cross over" and "see" could be understood as separate requests. This idea is further emphasized by the fact that God later instructed Moses, "Go up to the top of Pisgah and lift up your eyes..." (Deuteronomy 3:27). Additionally, we find that Moses had a strong inclination towards this trait, as seen when he said, "Let me turn aside and see this great sight, why the bush is not burned" (Exodus 3:3), as we explained in Parashat Shemot.
The tenth benefit pertains to character traits and teaches that it is fitting for a leader to strive to bring the greatest possible good to those under their care. From God's response to Moses' request to cross the Jordan, it appears that Moses sought to do so in order to help Israel inherit the land in the most complete and effective manner. Had Moses crossed the Jordan, he would have swiftly secured the land for them, as indicated by the rapid victories he had already achieved in earlier battles. God, however, instructed Moses to command Joshua on how to lead Israel in conquering the land and to strengthen and encourage him, for it would be Joshua who would bring Israel into their inheritance. This teaches us that Moses desired to be the one to lead the people in inheriting the land because he believed that under his leadership, it would be done in the most perfect way. To ensure that Joshua could fulfill this role as effectively as possible, replacing Moses to the extent that was feasible, God wanted Moses to guide Joshua in all that he should do. This would enable Joshua to lead the people in inheriting the land in a complete and successful manner.
The eleventh benefit pertains to beliefs and teaches that the perfect Torah given to us by God through Moses guides us toward the attainment of eternal life, which is the life of the soul. Additionally, the Torah brings about physical benefits as a consequence of its guidance, which ultimately leads to the success of the soul. This is why it is stated, "And now, Israel, listen to the statutes and the judgments that I am teaching you to do, so that you may live and go in and possess the land" (Deuteronomy 4:1). It is evident that when the verse says, "so that you may live," it does not refer to physical life, since it would have sufficed to say, "so that you may enter and possess the land," as it is clear that they cannot inherit the land if they are dead. Rather, the phrase "so that you may live" refers to true, everlasting life—the life of the soul. Moreover, it promises that following the Torah will also lead to inheriting the land, which is a physical success that further supports the success of the soul, as previously mentioned in these benefits. This is also the intention behind the verse in Parashat Acharei Mot, "You shall keep My statutes and My judgments, which if a person does them, they shall live by them" (Leviticus 18:5), meaning the life of the soul, as this is the true human life. As we have explained in our discussion of the benefits of the commandments, the Torah is the ultimate guide toward these eternal lives, which are the life of the soul. Therefore, when it says here, "And you shall keep My statutes and My judgments, which I command you today, that it may go well with you and with your children after you, and that you may prolong your days on the land" (Deuteronomy 4:40), the phrase "that it may go well with you" refers to what is truly good for humans, which is the good of the soul. This is why it distinguishes this from physical good by adding, "that you may prolong your days on the land," indicating that this benefit is secondary to the primary benefit, which is the true good—the good of the soul.
The twelfth benefit pertains to the commandments and concerns the prohibition against adding to or subtracting from the mitzvot (commandments) of the Torah. This prohibition is necessary to prevent any harm that might come to the observance of the Torah and its commandments. This is stated in the verse, "You shall not add to the word which I command you, nor shall you subtract from it, so that you may keep the commandments of the Lord your God" (Deuteronomy 4:2). The benefit of these prohibitions is clear: if the possibility to add to or subtract from the commandments were allowed, it would undermine the overall purpose of the Torah. This idea requires no further explanation, especially given what has already been discussed in this book regarding the significance of maintaining the integrity of the commandments.
The thirteenth benefit is to demonstrate the extent of God's providence over Israel. He notes that none of the Israelites died, except for those who perished due to the sin of Peor. Naturally, in a large population, it would be expected that many would die daily. However, this was not the case because God had promised that this generation would inherit the land. Just as God caused the previous generation to perish in the wilderness because of their sins, He preserved this generation so that they could all inherit the land. This shows that if not for their sin, none of them would have died. The proof of this is that only those who sinned in the matter of Peor died, while the rest remained alive, as the verse states, "But you who cling to the Lord your God are all alive today" (Deuteronomy 4:4).
The fourteenth benefit is to highlight the profound wisdom and understanding inherent in the commandments related to the land, which at first glance might seem to lack apparent utility. These include the commandments concerning sacrifices, ritual purity and impurity, and the offerings for the priests and Levites. This is why it says, "See, I have taught you statutes and judgments, as the Lord my God commanded me, that you should do so in the land where you go to possess it. And you shall keep and do them, for this is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the nations" (Deuteronomy 4:5-6). The point here is that these commandments reflect deep wisdom and understanding, which will be evident to the nations. As we have previously explained, the nature of the wisdom and understanding embedded in these commandments makes our Torah unique compared to the laws and customs of other nations. Our Torah is distinguished by its inherent righteousness and wisdom. In contrast, the laws of other nations are not naturally appealing but are followed out of necessity, often due to fear of punishment or the authority of the ruler, rather than out of an intrinsic understanding of their righteousness.
The fifteenth benefit is that we are commanded to remember the event of the revelation at Mount Sinai and the things we heard there directly from the Almighty, specifically the Ten Commandments. These commandments encompass the essence of all the Torah’s mitzvot. This act of remembrance is intended to be passed down to our children and grandchildren, generation after generation, so that it becomes widely known and that people will adhere to the commandments of the Torah. The purpose of this remembrance is to ensure that the commandments are observed and that people learn to revere the esteemed and awe-inspiring name of God. It is also important to recognize that no image or likeness was seen at Sinai, which is why we should avoid any representation of God and refrain from making images or ascribing divinity to anything other than God, as clarified in the second commandment of the Ten Commandments.
The sixteenth benefit is related to the commandments and teaches that just as a person is obligated to teach their own child, as it is written, "And you shall teach them diligently to your children" (Deuteronomy 6:7), they are also obligated to teach their grandchild, as it is written, "And you shall make them known to your children and your children's children" (Deuteronomy 4:9).
The seventeenth benefit is to explain that the Torah made every effort, as much as possible, to keep Israel from falling into the evil of idolatry. To this end, God informed them about the exiles they would face if they continued with idol worship. Despite these warnings, the Israelites did not completely avoid falling into idolatry and experienced the negative consequences that the Torah had predicted. Nonetheless, the fact that the Torah anticipated and warned about these outcomes demonstrates its thoroughness in addressing potential issues.
The eighteenth benefit is to explain that the outcomes of divine providence are similar whether they arise from general or specific supervision. Just as a person can experience long-term success through general providence, where both he and his descendants are guided over a long period, so too, specific providence can achieve similar results when it is complete. This is illustrated by the fact that, due to God's providence over the patriarchs, their descendants were always under divine care in such a way that they could not fall away from it. Consequently, God watched over Israel while they were in Egypt and brought them out with miraculous signs and wonders, preparing them to serve Him and making them worthy of inheriting the land. Therefore, He gave them the complete Torah in a remarkable manner at Mount Sinai, ensuring that they would follow His perfect law and thereby secure the promise of the land, which God swore to give to their ancestors.
The nineteenth benefit is to clarify the concept that the deity who governs the heavens is the same deity who governs the earth. There is not one god for the heavens and another for the earth, as some who believed in duality might have thought. This understanding was acquired by the Israelites through the remarkable miracles performed by God, which could not be attributed to natural causes or the workings of lower, mundane things. As stated in the verse, "You have been shown to know that the Lord is God; there is no other besides Him" (Deuteronomy 4:35). If someone were to argue that perhaps the God of the earth governs according to natural laws and can change them if needed, Ralbag points out that this is not the case. Moses was not speaking to simple-minded people; the elders of Israel were well aware that the deity governing the heavens cannot be distinct from the deity governing the earth. They observed that the natural order on earth is arranged according to heavenly principles, which implies that there must be a single deity who controls and can alter the entire cosmic order, including the heavens and the earth. Thus, it is evident from the miracles that there is one sovereign deity over all creation.

Verse 1



















The sixteenth benefit is to inform that it is not appropriate to mourn for a person more than is necessary - even if he was of the greatest possible stature. Do you not see that in spite of our teacher Moses' being of great stature in governance and greatness, the Torah only condoned that the days of weeping for him should be thirty days, like the days of the weeping for Aaron.
