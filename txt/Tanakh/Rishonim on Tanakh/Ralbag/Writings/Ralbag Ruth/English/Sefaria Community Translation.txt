Ralbag Ruth





Chapter 1



Verse 1



Verse 2



Verse 3



Verse 4



Verse 5



Verse 6



Verse 7



Verse 8



Verse 9



Verse 10

"Because with you we will return to your people" — meaning, they will not separate from her people, who are Israel, and therefore they will return with her even though she has no sons. It seems that they converted when Mahlon and Chilion married them, which is why we do not find that Ruth needed to convert when Boaz married her. For this reason, they were also returning with her. This is why they said, "Because with you we will return to your people." However, Naomi wanted to test if they had converted out of love for God or if they had converted due to their desire for her sons.

Verse 11



Verse 12

"For I am too old to have a husband" — meaning, therefore, it is not appropriate for you to wait for me to have sons for you to marry.
"For I said I have hope, etc." — meaning that even if I say I have hope of having sons in my womb, and not only that, but also that I was with a man last night and conceived, and not only that, but also that I gave birth to sons last night, is it appropriate for you to wait until they grow up? Would you remain bound all this time?

Verse 13



Verse 14

"And Orpah kissed her mother-in-law" — meaning to part from her, thus showing that she had not converted except due to her desire for Naomi's son. But Ruth clung to her despite this because she chose the religion of Israel and did not want to abandon her faith. Therefore, she said, "Where you go, I will go; your people shall be my people, and your God, my God."

Verse 15

"Return with your sister-in-law to her people and her gods" — this is a sign that she had already separated from her god before this.

Verse 16



Verse 17

"When you die, I will die, and there I will be buried" — meaning, her intention was that even after Naomi's death, she would not return to her people and her gods.

Verse 18

"And she saw that she was determined to go with her, etc." From this we learn that after one has been informed of the obligations and stringencies of the Torah regarding a convert, and despite this, they still wish to proceed, it is appropriate to refrain from dissuading them further.

Verse 19



Verse 20

"Call me Mara, for the Almighty has made my life very bitter. The pleasantness of bitterness is the reversal of bitterness, just as sweetness transforms, for pleasantness can be said about sweetness, as it is stated (Proverbs 9:17): 'Stolen waters are sweet, and bread eaten in secret is pleasant.'"

Verse 21

"And the Lord answered me." This means that He testified against me regarding my sins because of the great punishment that befell me.

Benefits

Here is what we sought to explain in this scroll. However, the benefit derived from it:
The first benefit is to inform that a person should not assimilate among the nations but should distance themselves from it as much as possible. Do you not see what happened to Elimelech when he assimilated among the nations? This led to his sons marrying their daughters, and he and they died within a short time, leaving nothing behind. Even though their daughters converted, it was not enough because they had already been raised with those beliefs and inferior customs. They also continued to stay among their people and were not able to completely abandon all their beliefs. It has been shown that they did not abandon all their beliefs because Naomi told them to return, each to her mother's house. If she had known they were like Israelites, she would not have advised them to go astray. It is indicated that they had converted by what Naomi said to Ruth: "Behold, your sister-in-law has gone back to her people and to her gods."
The second benefit is to inform that when someone comes to take refuge under the wings of the Divine Presence, it is appropriate to scrutinize their intentions to see if they truly desire this with all their heart and soul, and then to accept them. If they persist and strengthen their resolve in this decision, it is not appropriate to further distance them from it. Therefore, you will find that when Naomi saw that Ruth was determined to go with her, she did not try to distance her any further because she recognized that Ruth had genuinely converted with all her heart and soul. From this passage, it is clear that someone who seeks to convert should be presented with both the easier and more challenging aspects of the commandments, so they fully understand what they are accepting upon themselves. After this, it is appropriate to distance them somewhat to test their resolve, and if it is evident that they are steadfast in their decision, it is not suitable to discourage them further from their desire.
The third benefit is to inform that a person should be diligent in securing what they need when the opportunity arises and not be lazy about it. Do you not see what happened to Ruth due to her diligence in gathering food for herself and her mother-in-law when she had the chance? As soon as the barley harvest began, she endeavored to gather ears of grain behind the reapers and was diligent in this, as it is recounted that she rested at home for only a short time, came there in the morning, and gathered until the evening.
The fourth benefit is to inform that one who draws close to God will have their matters succeed. Do you not see how God caused Ruth to succeed until she married a judge of the judges and merited to be an ancestor of the royal lineage of Israel forever? This is because David, who received the eternal covenant of kingship, descended from her.
The fifth benefit is to inform that one should avoid accepting gifts from someone who begrudges them, even if the giver has no rightful claim to the gift, as in the case of gifts for the poor. The Torah obligates owners to leave these gifts for the poor. This is because accepting such gifts may lead to the owners being overly meticulous in keeping everything to prevent any gleanings from falling to the workers, thereby preventing the poor from receiving anything. It may also cause the owners to sin by keeping the gifts themselves, thus preventing the poor from taking them. It is evident that one should avoid acting against the will of others unless absolutely necessary. Therefore, you will find that Ruth said, "I will glean among the ears of grain after someone in whose eyes I find favor."
The sixth benefit is to inform that one should greet every person with peace, even if they are a servant or hired worker. Do you not see that Boaz greeted his reapers first?
The seventh benefit is to inform that it is proper for a person to be meticulous in safeguarding their possessions and property. If one hires workers, they should either stay with them to ensure the work is done correctly or appoint someone to supervise the workers and encourage them to do their work properly. Therefore, you will find that it is mentioned that Boaz had a servant overseeing the reapers. You will also find that when Boaz was winnowing barley, he slept by the threshing floor to guard the pile from theft, as it would be easy for someone to steal without being noticed. For this reason, it is also mentioned that Ruth gleaned until evening and quickly threshed what she had gleaned to bring it to the city so that it would not be stolen.
The eighth benefit is to inform that when a woman needs to go among men, she should have other women with her to avoid any suspicion of impropriety. Therefore, Boaz told Ruth to stay close to his maidservants, indicating that she initially stayed with his maidservants to avoid suspicion.
The ninth benefit is to inform that when someone sees another person showing a strong desire to help them without knowing the reason, it is proper to ask them who they are. This is because the other person might be mistaken and think they are someone else who deserves their kindness, and accepting such kindness under false pretenses is improper. Therefore, it is mentioned that Ruth asked Boaz the reason, saying, "Why have I found favor in your eyes, that you should take notice of me, since I am a foreigner?" She thought Boaz might have mistaken her for someone else he was obligated to help, until he replied that he knew who she was and felt obligated to help her because of the kindness she had shown to Naomi.
The tenth benefit is to inform that it is proper to show kindness to someone who has shown kindness to you or to your relatives. Do you not see that because of the kindness Ruth showed to Naomi, who was the wife of Boaz's relative, Boaz was moved to show Ruth the kindness mentioned in this scroll? He went to great lengths, even providing for her in a way that she would not feel embarrassed, as he instructed his workers to let her glean among the sheaves. He did all this because of the kindness she had shown to Naomi, along with the goodness she displayed in seeking refuge under the wings of the Divine Presence. Therefore, you will find that because of the kindness Ruth constantly showed to Naomi, Naomi was moved to seek rest for Ruth that would be good for her and gave her advice that led to her marrying Boaz.
The eleventh benefit is to inform that vinegar is suitable during hot weather because it has benefits such as quenching thirst, strengthening the stomach, and countering spoilage. Therefore, Boaz said to her, "Dip your morsel in the vinegar," as we have mentioned.
The twelfth benefit is to inform that if one gives a portion to someone who would be embarrassed to ask for more if it is insufficient, it is proper to give an amount that exceeds what they need, so it is clear that they have had enough. Therefore, it is mentioned that Boaz gave Ruth roasted grain, enough for her to eat and be satisfied, with some left over.
The thirteenth benefit is to inform that if it is possible for a person to achieve a significant benefit through an action that involves some boldness, they should not forgo that benefit due to embarrassment but should minimize the boldness as much as possible. Therefore, you will find that Ruth did not refrain from doing what Naomi told her, to go lie down at Boaz's feet, but she did this discreetly so that no one would know. She did this in a way that Boaz would notice her when she lay down there, and even at night, she was careful to protect her modesty. Therefore, you will find that she did not sleep but immediately answered Boaz wisely and sensibly when he asked, "Who are you?" rather than in the manner of someone who had just been awakened from sleep.
The fourteenth benefit is to inform that when someone asks for a favor, it is proper to make the asker feel that they are giving something in return by making the request. This can soothe their heart and alleviate their embarrassment. This becomes even more crucial if circumstances prevent the immediate fulfillment of their request, not due to any reluctance on the giver's part, but because of some other reason. For instance, the giver might suggest that another person is more appropriate to fulfill the request. This could lead the asker to believe that their request is being denied, causing them to feel disheartened and ashamed. Therefore, you will find that since it was not customary for Boaz to fulfill Ruth's request until it was clear that the closer redeemer had no desire to redeem her, Boaz began by praising Ruth's great kindness to his relatives by making this request. It was as if he was saying that he was very indebted to her for this. He assured her that he would fulfill her request but explained that there was a closer redeemer, and if he did not redeem her, Boaz swore that he would. For this reason, Boaz also wanted to show his eagerness to fulfill her desire and to do good for her. Therefore, he rose early in the morning and generously gave her six measures of barley to ease her mind until it could be made clear that he genuinely intended to fulfill her request.
The fifteenth benefit is to inform that the completion of a sale or exchange is finalized when the buyer gives an item to the seller in the presence of witnesses. By acquiring the item, the buyer completes the sale or exchange for the property in question.
The sixteenth benefit is to inform that in matters of marriage, it is proper to have ten men present. Therefore, it is mentioned that Boaz took ten men. This was not because ten were needed for testimony, as the Torah states that the matter is established by the testimony of two witnesses. Instead, ten were needed to complete the marriage ceremony in their presence, ensuring it was publicized and blessed by the elders, as their blessing was considered more likely to be heard by God. Boaz was blessed by their prayers, and from that blessing came the offspring who would build the house of Israel and sustain it in the best of conditions with the help of God, as foretold by the prophets about the Messiah, who would come from David, who descended from Ruth. May God, in His mercy, bring this swiftly and hasten it so we may see it, and may His counsel soon come to free the prisoner and bring those dwelling in darkness out of prison. Amen.
