Verse 65

<b><i>And not one man of them remained</i>:</b> Our rabbis, may their memory be blessed, said, but this is not [the case] with a woman, since the women were not [included] in the decree of [dying in] the desert. And that is why the section of the daughters of  Zelophehad is juxtaposed to the count of the Jewish people. For the men hated the land of Israel and said, <i>Let us appoint a head and we will return to Egypt</i> (Numbers 14:4). Whereas the women held the land dear, as they said, <i>Give us a holding</i> (Numbers 27:4)
