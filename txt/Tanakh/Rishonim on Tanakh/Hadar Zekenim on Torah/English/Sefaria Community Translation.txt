Verse 1

<i>And Joseph was taken down</i>: It does not state, "went down," but rather, "was taken down." That is to say, to fulfill the commandment of the Omnipresent, to put the thing into motion and bring down our forefathers to Egypt. And why was the section about Potiphar juxtaposed with the section about Tamar? To tell you that just as Tamar intended the good, so too did the wife of Potiphar intend the good. As she saw, through astrology, that the offspring of Jacob would emerge from her family, but she did not know if [the prediction was about] her or her daughter.
