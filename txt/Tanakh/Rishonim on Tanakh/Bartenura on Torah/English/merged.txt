Verse 1



Verse 2

<b>"And Moses spoke to the heads of the tribes"</b>: He showed honor to the leaders, etc., until "or perhaps you might think that this section was said only to the leaders." This means that although it is written "to the children of Israel," I might interpret "heads of the tribes of the children of Israel" as meaning the leaders. We find in many places that the prefix "ל" (lamed) at the beginning of a word functions in the place of "על" (al, meaning "upon" or "concerning"). And since the annulment of vows can be performed by a single expert, meaning that it is a mitzvah performed in the best way, I might think that it was said only to the heads of the tribes.
<b>"This is the word"</b>: Moses prophesied with "thus says," etc., until "Moses added to them by prophesying with 'this is the word.'" It is difficult because Isaiah also prophesied with "this is the word," as it is written: "This is the word that the Lord spoke concerning Moab" and "This is the word that the Lord spoke concerning Sennacherib, king of Assyria." One could say that it means this: "This is the word that the Lord spoke concerning Moab" originally through Moses, who prophesied about their punishment, as it is written in the Torah: "Woe to you, Moab." Similarly, concerning Assyria, he prophesied about their punishment, as it is written in the section of Balaam: "Asshur will be subdued." And although it is written in the section of sacrifices offered outside the Temple "this is the word," it seems to Rashi that one should be meticulous here to emphasize the superiority of Moses's prophecy over there because in that context, it is used to teach a law through a verbal analogy, as Rashi explained earlier. However, it is difficult why this was not seen from the verse "This is the thing that you shall do to them to sanctify them," written in the section of Tetzaveh. One could say that since that section is not a prophecy that needs to be communicated to others but a commandment to Moses himself to perform, as the verses demonstrate. It is also difficult what the alternative explanation means by saying "it is rare." One could say that it is because the first interpretation makes it difficult to understand why this commandment was uniquely written in this language more than other commandments in the Torah, and thus it offers an alternative explanation to teach us a specific law in this commandment.

Verse 3



Verse 4

<b>"In her youth"</b>: This excludes a minor, etc., until "And what is considered a minor?" Our Rabbis said, etc. It is difficult to understand why he asked "And what is considered a minor?" and did not explain afterward but rather said "her vows are examined." We still have not understood from his words what constitutes a minor. One could say that it means this: "In her youth" and not "a young woman" as the text usually states in other places. Therefore, it is written afterward, "A girl of eleven years, her vows are examined," etc. This means that the "youth" mentioned here regarding vows is not the same as the "youth" mentioned in other commandments, which starts at twelve years and one day, as Rambam wrote in Chapter 2 of the Laws of Marriage. Here, it does not simply state "a young woman" but rather "in her youth," implying a specific kind of youth according to her intelligence and understanding. Therefore, the criterion is based on examination, as Rashi explained.

Verse 5



Verse 6

<b>"And the Lord will forgive her"</b>: What is the text speaking about? It refers to a woman who vowed to become a Nazirite, and her husband heard and annulled it, etc. It is difficult to understand what relevance her husband has here, as the verse speaks about her father. One could say that since this phrase "the Lord will forgive her" is written both regarding the father and the husband, Rashi interprets it concerning a betrothed woman whose vows are annulled by both her father and her fiancé. It cannot be said that her father annulled it and she did not know because she lives in his house, if the text is speaking about a young woman. Similarly, if it is speaking about a married woman, it cannot be said that her husband annulled it and she did not know because she lives in his house. Therefore, it seems that the text speaks about a betrothed woman who lives in her father's house and vowed to become a Nazirite. Her husband heard and annulled it, and she did not know because she does not live in his house. She knows the law that her father and fiancé must annul her vows, and she is aware of her father's annulment but unaware of her fiancé's annulment. Thus, she transgresses her vow, etc. Therefore, this phrase is written regarding all annulments, whether by the father or the husband, as I have explained.

Chapter 31



Verse 1



Verse 2

<b>"Against the Midianites"</b>: and not against the Moabites, etc. Another explanation: because of two good doves, etc. It is difficult to understand what this second explanation adds. One could say that according to the first explanation, it is difficult because although the Moabites were involved in the matter of Balaam's curse due to fear and thus were spared, nevertheless, they should not have been spared for the matter of Peor, where they caused Israel to sin by making their daughters available for promiscuity. For one who causes another to sin, it is worse for him than if he were killed, as Rashi explained in the section of "Ki Tetzei." Therefore, the second explanation is offered: because of the two good doves, etc. This means that the Moabites were also deserving of punishment, but they were spared because of the two good doves, meaning two righteous women: Ruth the Moabitess and Naamah the Ammonitess. Although Naamah was an Ammonite, the reason is attributed to Moab because from Ruth the Moabitess came David, and thus she merited to marry Solomon. However, earlier in the section of Pinchas, in the verse "Harass the Midianites," Rashi did not write the first explanation because the term "vengeance" is not used there as it is here, and thus the first explanation does not fit there.

Verse 3



Verse 4

<b>"From all the tribes of Israel"</b>: This includes the tribe of Levi. It is difficult because if this is so, there would have been 13,000 (soldiers), yet the text states 12,000. One could say that the 12,000 mentioned refers only to those who were conscripted against their will, as Rashi explained. However, the 1,000 from the tribe of Levi were not conscripted against their will; rather, they went voluntarily. And although they refrained due to Moses' impending death, the tribe of Levi was more zealous in fulfilling the commandment of the Holy One, blessed be He.

Verse 5



Verse 6

"Them and Phinehas": Why did Phinehas go, etc.? Another explanation is that he went to avenge the vengeance of Joseph, etc. Another explanation is that he was the anointed for war. It is difficult to understand why the phrase "another explanation" is used twice. One could say that the second explanation seems more fitting than the first because the text brings back the word "them" close to "and Phinehas," which implies that he also went to avenge his own vengeance in their death, as it is written, "take vengeance for the children of Israel." Then, another explanation is given a second time because the text later brings back the word "to the army," meaning "and Phinehas the priest to the army," indicating that he was appointed over the army, which means he was the anointed for war.
<b>"In his hand, in his possession, etc."</b>: It seems to me that this is why it is explained as "in his possession," because although one might have thought that he took the trumpets literally in his hand, it cannot be explained this way since it is written, "and the sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow the trumpets," and thus it is necessary to have at least two priests for them.

Verse 7



Verse 8



Verse 9



Verse 10

"Their castles": The dwelling places of their watchmen, etc. Another explanation: it means the dwelling places of their nobles, etc. It is difficult to understand why another explanation is given. One could say that according to the first explanation, it should have said "notirotam" with the addition of a "nun" at the beginning of the word, like "notrim" (watchmen). Therefore, another explanation is given: the dwelling places of their nobles, similar to the translation of "seranim" (lords) which is translated as "tornei" (nobles) of the Philistines, and it does not lack the "nun."

Verse 15



Verse 16

"Through the counsel of Balaam": He said to them, etc. It is difficult to understand why Rashi rearranges the verse by explaining "through the counsel of Balaam" before explaining "these are the ones" which precedes it in the verse. One could say that Rashi follows his own reasoning from his earlier explanation that all the misconduct of the generation depends on the leaders. Therefore, he explains "through the counsel of Balaam" right next to it, meaning, "And behold, you see that the sin of Peor is attributed to Balaam because he was a great man in his generation," as Rashi explained earlier in the verse "from Pethor," where all the kings would send him their letters. Therefore, he rearranges the verse.

Verse 17

&lt;p&gt;<b>"Kill"</b>: Why did he repeat and say to interrupt the matter? If I read "kill every male," I would not know if it means to kill the males with the males or to spare the females with the children, etc. It is difficult to understand how I could err regarding sparing the females and children, since initially they were condemned for not distinguishing and were told to spare only the females. Why was the term "kill" necessary to exclude this interpretation?<br>One could say that since Moses did not instruct them to spare the females specifically, but rather said "every female," it implies that he was angry because they did not make the distinction between them, thereby causing the sin through Balaam. Therefore, he required the phrase "kill" again to clarify that the distinction should be made: all women who know men as men (meaning, those who know men sexually) should be killed, while the children (females who do not know sexual relations) should be spared. This clarification was necessary to exclude the possibility of sparing those who had not caused the Israelites to sin through Balaam. Hence, the repetition of "kill" was needed to clarify the matter, as Rashi explained.<br>&lt;/p&gt;

Verse 18



Verse 19

<b>"You and your captives"</b>: Not that the nations, etc., until "when they come into the covenant and become defiled, they need sprinkling." It is difficult to understand why the verse needs to prove this point, since the verses already explicitly state: "The same law shall apply to the native-born and to the stranger who resides among you" (Numbers 15:15). This needs further investigation.

Chapter 32



Verse 1



Verse 2



Verse 3

&lt;p&gt;<b>"Ataroth and Dibon"</b>: From the land of Sihon and Og they were. It appears that Rashi believed that the land of Midian was not divided among the tribes, and therefore he wrote "from the land of Sihon and Og they were." Similarly, in the Book of Joshua, you will not find that the land of Midian was divided at all. Perhaps this was because it was not considered part of the land of Israel, i.e., from the seven nations.<br><b>"And Nebo and Baal-meon"</b>: The names were those of idolatry, etc. It is difficult to know how Rashi knew this. One could say that since it is written elsewhere, "Kiryat Baal, that is, Kiriath-jearim" (Joshua 9:10), and it is mentioned as "Baal" and "Nebo" where idolatry is evident (as the names of the deities), it is clear that Baal and Nebo were idolatrous names. Since it says "Nebo and Baal-meon" in the same context, it implies that they alone were named after idols and not others. Later, it states "and Sibmah," which implies that their names were not changed as mentioned earlier, but rather, it retained its original name.&lt;/p&gt;

<b>"He called it Nobach"</b>: The "hey" is not omitted, etc., until "and I am amazed what [the verse] would mean with the two words 'to Boaz' to build a house for her." It seems that Rashi did not notice what is written in the Midrash regarding these two words "to Boaz." The Midrash interprets that it was not said directly to her but through a messenger, to build a house for her. It is interpreted to mean that she has no house, meaning it has no lasting foundation, as falsehood and flattery have no standing. There, in Zechariah, the verse speaks of flattery.

Chapter 33



Verse 1

&lt;p&gt;<b>"These are the journeys"</b>: This is why they were written, etc., until "even though He decreed to move them and to make them wander in the desert, etc." It is difficult to find where it is mentioned that He decreed this. One could say that since it is written, "And your children will be shepherds in the wilderness for forty years" (Numbers 14:33), and the term "shepherds" implies exile and wandering, as in "And He revealed Himself to me in the tent of the shepherds" (Numbers 22:8). This means that He decreed to move and make them wander.<br>Regarding Rashi’s subsequent explanation, he compares it to a king who took his son to be healed, etc. This means that Israel was in a state of illness in Egypt, deeply immersed in idol worship and numerous sins. Therefore, the Holy One, blessed be He, took them to Mount Sinai and to the desert to heal them from these sins and to teach them the Torah.<br>When they were about to enter the Land of Israel and return to the status of their forefathers—Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob—when the Divine Presence was revealed to them constantly, the text began to list all the journeys. This means that at each place where they camped, it was as if their heads were raised, so to speak. In this section, the Torah recalls significant events at specific locations, such as the incident at Rephidim where there was no water to drink, and at Mount Hor where Aaron died. These are somewhat like hints or allusions.<br>One could also say that this passage addresses even those who commit sins inadvertently, as it concludes with "The land is soaked with blood," which means that there are many who are misled and deceived. The beginning of the passage speaks of those who sin intentionally, as explained.&lt;/p&gt;

Verse 25

<b>"Until the death of the High Priest"</b>: He who brings down the Divine Presence, etc. Another explanation is that he should have prayed, etc. It is difficult to understand the second explanation. One could say that the second explanation is more consistent, because according to the first explanation, it would not have been permissible to stand before the High Priest forever, even if another High Priest succeeded him, since one brings down the Divine Presence and the other removes it, as stated in the verse, "For your sword will be lifted over him," meaning that it is not fitting for the one who shortens (the time) to be in the position of the one who lengthens it. Therefore, the second explanation is that the High Priest was considered deficient in not praying to prevent this mishap, which is why it refers back to his death and to the days of the second High Priest.

<b>"And Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah"</b>: Here, they are counted according to their seniority, etc. And in the entire scripture, they are counted according to their wisdom, indicating that they are considered equal in value. One could say that Rashi addresses here two differing opinions found in Baba Batra: one opinion holds that the Torah lists them elsewhere according to their wisdom, while another opinion states that they are listed according to their seniority. However, in terms of wisdom, they are all considered equal. Rashi includes both opinions in his commentary here, and "the wise one will understand."
