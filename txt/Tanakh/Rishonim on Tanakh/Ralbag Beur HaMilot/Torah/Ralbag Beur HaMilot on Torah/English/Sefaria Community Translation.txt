Verse 1

...And the content of this test, in my opinion, was in the coming of the prophecy to him in unclear wording; and that is that the Lord, may He be blessed, said to him, about Issac, "and bring him up him there for a burnt-sacrifice." And this statement can be logically understood to mean that he should slaughter him and offer him as a burnt-offering, and it can [also] be logically understood that he should bring him up there to offer a burnt-offering, in order that Issac be trained in the service of God, may He be blessed. And the Lord tested him, whether it would be difficult in his eyes to do anything that the Lord would command him about [Issac], to the point that it would become the cause for him to understand this statement other than what is understood from it upon immediate consideration - meaning to say that that which is understood from it is that he should offer up another burnt-offering, not that he should slaughter his son...

<b>And when Pharaoh saw that there was relief, he became stubborn and would not heed them:</b> It is likely that Moses and Aaron came to him after they removed the frogs to request from him that he send away the Israelites as he had promised them; but he did not listen to them. And they then said to him - according to what I think - that if he refused to send away the people, the dirt of the ground would be struck with the rod that was in their hands and it would become lice. And when he refused to send them away, Moses then commanded Aaron that he should strike the dirt of the ground and it become lice in all the Land of Egypt - as was their custom in the previous plagues. For they would only bring the plagues for the purpose of his sending away the Children of Israel from Egypt.

<b>And the Lord drove back the Sea...:</b> It is appropriate that you should know that when God does miracles, He makes efforts to find causes for them such that they will reduce some of [the miracles] divergence from nature - as was [discussed] earlier. And we have already explained this in the sixth [section] of the Wars of the Lord. And for the cause here, God found to put a strong easterly wind in the way of the miracle - which would dry up and displace the water to the western side, in such a way that a [dry] place would newly reveal itself to them. And the waters of the Sea were on its right and on its left, since that [dry] place was higher. And because of that, it became perfectly revealed, while water remained to its right and its left. And this is what was intended about them, when it stated (14:29), "and the waters were a wall for them on their right and on their left" - not that the waters were high to their right and to their left, and that they [no longer] flowed. As if the matter were like that, He would not bring an easterly wind to create this miracle. And nevertheless, the waters were higher on the western side, since the wind displaced them there and would constantly prevent them from flowing. And that is why God brought a strong easterly wind the whole night. And behold, it called the waters, "a wall" - even though they were not high - because they prevented the Egyptians from coming against them from their right or left. And they could only go behind them. And the cloud was [similarly] a wall between them from behind [the Israelites].

Verse 17

This appearance is accompanied by a burnt offering, as it says: "shall not be seen before My face empty-handed". The three times mentioned here are the festivals of Passover, Shavuot and Sukkot. The purpose of this appearance is to see the form of the Temple, which indicates the existence of God, and the great mysteries that exist, as we will explain in due course - if God decrees. It is for this reason that there is a commandment to sacrifice to God at the moment of appearance, and so too is the reason for the Chagigah sacrifice at that point, to show that one should be joyful and celebrate that he has merited to serve God and to comprehend Him according to his ability, because this is the essence of perfection, and the essence of joy, as was explained in its place[...]   Now, the blind man is exempt from the sacrifice, as it says “Be seen before the face of the Lord your God”, and this word here implies [a mutual act], each one seeing the other. The fullness of seeing is with both eyes, and therefore even one who is blind in one eye is exempt from this offering. The text says ‘to be seen’, in the niphal form, rather than [the active] ‘to see’, to imply that as we see Him, so does He see us and notice us. In general, it is well-understood that we are not actually obliged to go to the Temple in order that God see us, for His “eyes range over the entire earth”! Rather, our pilgrimage is in order to see Him, inasmuch as is possible for us, and this in turn will be a cause for Him seeing us.

Verse 1

<b>And if a <i>shelamim</i> offering is his offering.</b> After explaining the law of the <i>mincha</i> (meal offering), it comes to explain the law of performing the <i>shelamim</i> offering, and it has been called <i>shelamim</i>, derived from <i>shalom</i> (peace), meaning that it will come after there is peace between the person and God, and it is for this reason that the owners, the priests, and God all eat from it together at the same table—because the blood and organs go to the altar, the chest and the leg to the priests, and the skin and meat to the owners. And we will soon explain this fully after we complete the heart of the matters of sacrifices.

Verse 10

<b>"And you shall eat and be satisfied, etc."</b> This means that because eating and satisfaction are not according to the usual way, but due to their illness, the intention here is that whoever eats bread until they are satisfied must bless the Almighty. Another proof that it speaks about bread is that it was mentioned earlier in the context, and eating was mentioned solely about it when it was said, "you shall eat bread." Hence, this blessing is to the Almighty to thank Him for the food He has bestowed upon us. For if the intention were solely to thank Him for the good land He has given us, as one might think from this verse, the gratitude would not be complete. Because bread does not come from the land without the grace of the Almighty, therefore, the order is to first bless the Almighty for giving us this bread and then to thank Him for giving us the good land, which is very suitable for producing bread continuously. And because this commandment is not tied to the land, we learn from this that it applies everywhere, as the essence of the matter requires this, since wherever we are, the Almighty gives us the bread we eat. However, due to our sins, now that we do not hold the land, it is appropriate to thank the Almighty for giving it to our ancestors and to us according to our hope. Therefore, we should ask Him to return us there. This is why the Men of the Great Assembly instituted these three blessings. And because it says "for the good land He has given you," and women did not inherit the land except by a rare chance that occurred to the daughters of Zelophehad, the matter is in doubt whether because they are not included in the giving of the land they should be exempt from the blessing of the food, or whether we should say that since they are included in giving thanks for the bread that the Almighty has bestowed upon us, they are obligated in the blessing of the food, especially since women also rejoiced in the good land. Even if they did not inherit it themselves, their husbands or fathers inherited it, and their well-being is beneficial to them.

Verse 18

<b>When they chanced upon you on the way:</b> Meaning to say that they prepared themselves to fight with you on the way, when you were there not [intending] a war, since you were tired and weary, and you also were not fearing God then, in such a way that individual providence should attach itself to you. So behold without the prayer of Moshe, Amalek would have already been victorious, as we explained there. And this was as a sign, that according to the [usual order of things], Amalek would have been victorious.
<b>and they struck down those in your tail—all the feeble ones behind you:</b> Meaning to say that he killed their tail, and those were the weaker ones, who had been walking at the tail of the camp, due to their weakness. And that is why it explains that Amalek gathered all the causes with which they could complete the destruction of the Jewish people: The first is that they engaged in war with Israel on the way, when they were not on guard against it, before they could put on their war gear. And in this way, they killed all of the weak ones who were at the end of the camp, as none of them remained. And the second is that they found them weary and tired from the strain of the journey. And the third is that individual providence had not yet attached itself to the Jewish people, since the Jewish did not yet fear God, as can be seen from the quarrel that they had there and tested God, may He be elevated, as it is mentioned there. And the fourth is from the general providence that Amalek would defeat Israel. And with the joining of all of these causes, such that they did not escape from their hands, so that they not destroy them and that the curses that Esav was cursed on account of the blessing of Yaakov not fall away from them and from the two sons of Esav - that is why God, may He be elevated, after they finish the wars of the seven nations, '[He] will give rest to Israel from all of the their enemies around them, [so that] they shall blot out the remembrance of Amalek,' in estimation of the evil they would try to do to the Jewish people in every generation when they have the ability. And you can already see this in the days of the Judges from Tziklag, the city of David. For this shows that they are always turning to do evil to the Jewish people when they have the ability. [Likewise] what Haman the son of Hamadata the Agagite wanted to do to the Jewish people during the days of Mordekhai and Esther. Were it not for the Lord, he would have finished them off.
