I (Jeremiah) am not worthy of rebuking them (B'nei Yisrael)! Moshe rebuked B'nei Yisrael close to his death while he was already revered in their eyes, with the many miracles that he did for them: took them out of Egypt, split the sea for them, brought down the Manna, brought them the slav (some say this is a quail), gave them the Torah, and brought up the well. And here, I am going to rebuke them at the beginning of my mission?!

You have seen well: This almond tree hastens to blossom before all other trees. I, too, hasten to perform My word. And the Midrash Aggadah (Ecc. Rabbah 12:8) explains: An almond tree takes twenty-one days from its blossoming until it is completely ripe, as the number of days between the seventeenth of Tammuz, when the city was broken into, until the ninth of Ab, when the Temple was burnt

Midrash Agadah says that all of the Avot and Imahot went to Hashem to appease Him during the destruction of the first Beit Hamikdash. None of them were able to appease G-d. Rachel came and said "Do I have more compassion than you, Hashem? Does a person have more compassion than Hashem? Yaakov worked for me for many years and at the end my sister went under the Chuppah and married my husband. And I remained quiet. Do I have more compassion that You?" Hashem said to Rachel, "It is right what you say and because of you and the signs you gave your sister, I will return Am Yisroel to the Holy Land."
