Rashi on Amos



Chapter 1



Verse 1

<b>Who was in (the) Nokdim: </b> And Targum Yonatan translates it as: "Master of Sheep", just as Mesha, the King of Moab, was a "Noked" (Melachim 2, 3).
<b> Two years before the earthquake: </b> Two years before King Uzziah died, on the day that Isaiah (Isaiah 6) prophesied "And the foundations shall be shaken." It is referenced by Zechariah (Zechariah 14) when he says "Just as you had fled from the earthquake."

Verse 5

The valley of Aven: It is a place in Aram [Syria]
The one possessing the scepter [the sovereign]: And is made the sovereign. As it says in Genesis 49:10 "the staff (i.e. sovereignty) shall not depart..." [Sovereignty] is referred to as a staff because the sovereign [can] lash the people with whippings. 
From the [Royal] House of Eden: This is a location
Kirah: This is a location and there [the House of Eden] was exiled by Sennacherib in the days of Ahaz. As it says "And Damascus [the Assyrians] ascended and they seized them [the House of Eden and presumably other peoples] and they exiled them to Aramaen Kirah (Kings 2 16:9) All the punishments that the prophets of Israel prophesied of the destruction to come on the idolatrous nations, all these prophets [lived] before Sennacherib did. For instance, Isaiah and Amos prophesied on the destruction of Sennacherib, and Jeremiah and Ezekiel prophesied on the destruction of Nebuchadnezzar.
