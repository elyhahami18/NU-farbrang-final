Rashi on Zechariah



Chapter 1



Verse 1

Zechariah's prophecy is very obscure, filled with dreamlike  visions meant for interpretation, but we can't establish a reliable one until the 'just teacher'.  I will attempt to thoughtfully give the texts appropriate interpretations, in step with Yonatan's interpretations.

Verse 2

<b>And Beth-El Shar-Etser sent, with Regem-Melekh and his men — </b> Righteous men were they, and they sent from Babylon to their relatives in Beth-el to come to plea for mercy before the face of the L<small>ORD</small> in Jerusalem for their sake, and to ask of the priests to find out if they should weep in the month of Av, since the house was built again.

Verse 3

<b> Shall I abstain </b> to part oneself from pleasure, as I did these seventy years. There is never any abstention anywhere in the Bible without parting.

Verse 4



Verse 5

<b> And on the seventh — </b> That is the fast of Gedaliah.
<b> Did you fast Me, I? </b> The letter <i> hei </i> is vocalized with a <i> ḥaṭaf pataḥ </i> since it is serving the purpose of expressing surprise. If for My honor you fasted, then you will need to fast even now.

Verse 6

<b> And when you eat and when you drink — </b> And also, if you don't fast, what's it to Me? Was it not for your own pleasure that you ate and drank?

Verse 7

<b> Was it not the words — </b> Who made you fast and weep? Was it not the words of rebute that the L<small>ORD</small> called etc, etc, that destroyed you? And that is why you fast, and these are the words that He called: judge justice and truth.

Verse 12

<b> set like a <i> shamir </i>—</b> A worm, stronger than rock. They show it on the rock and it splits.

Verse 13

<b> And it was, when He called and they did not listen — </b> the L<small>ORD</small> of hosts said about them at that time, "Let <i>them</i> call, and <i>I</i> will not listen!"

Verse 14

<b> And I dispersed them — </b> in exile, and thus I did.
<b> And they caused — </b> in their iniquity.
<b> The desired land to desolation — </b> and that was what triggered the fasting and weeping. But now I am jealous for Zion, for Zion's sake I will have vengeance on the Chaldeans.

For I bend Judah for Me – in the end, Antiochus will take the kingship from the hands of the kings of Persia and do evil to you. Then I will draw out Yehudah to be like my war bow and they will fight Antiochus in days of the Hasmoneans:
I filled Ephraim – this is a cut short statement which ought to read ‘like a bow; I filled the hand of Ephraim,’ similar to “…And Jehu put all his strength into his bow…” (Melachim II 9:24), meaning that Ephraim will be to Me as a quiver full of arrows:
And I will arouse your children, O Zion – upon the armies of Antiochus

And the Lord their God shall save them on that day like the flocks of His people, for crown stones are exalted on His land.
