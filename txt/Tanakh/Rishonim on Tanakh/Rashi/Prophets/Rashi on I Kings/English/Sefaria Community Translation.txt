Rashi on I Kings



Chapter 1



Verse 1

"And it did not warm him" -- Our teachers say, "All who disrespect clothes do not benefit from them in the end." [David did not benefit from them] because he tore the corner of Saul's coat. And a narrative homily: "Said R. Samuel b. Nahmani, 'When David saw the angel standing in Jerusalem with sword in hand, his blood froze in fear.'"
