Solomon built up the Millo – Through this building he sealed up the breaches in the city of David because the breaches were behind the Millo. He (Yerovam) said to Shlomo ‘your father broke holes in the walls in order that those coming up for the festivals could come in, and you sealed them up in order to make a labor force for Pharaoh’s daughter to settle her slaves and servants there.
