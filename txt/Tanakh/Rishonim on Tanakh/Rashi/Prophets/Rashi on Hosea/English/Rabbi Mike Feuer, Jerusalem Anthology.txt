In your midst is the Holy One, and I will not enter a city – Into any other city, because I have already promised to cause my Presence to dwell in your midst in Jerusalem and not to bring it to rest anymore in another city. There are those who translate b’ir as a language of hatred, as in “and has become your adversary (arecha)” (Samuel I 28:16)
