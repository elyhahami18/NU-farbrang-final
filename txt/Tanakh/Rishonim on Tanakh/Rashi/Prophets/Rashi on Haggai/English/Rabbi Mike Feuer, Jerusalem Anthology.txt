[for] a little while – Once the kingdom of Persia, which rules over now, expires one more will rise up to rule over and oppress you from the kingdom of Greece, and its rule will be short:
and I will shake up– through the miracles done for the Hasmoneans
the heaven and the earth – they will understand that my Presence dwells in this House and bring gifts of gold and silver as is written in the scroll of Yosef ben Gurion
