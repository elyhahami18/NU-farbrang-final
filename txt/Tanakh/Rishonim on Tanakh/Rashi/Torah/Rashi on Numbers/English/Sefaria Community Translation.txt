Verse 24

Bless thee. That your possessions will be blessed.
And keep thee. That robbers will not descend upon you to take your money, that he who gives a gift to his servant is unable to protect him from all men, and since bandits come upon him and take it from him, what benefit does he receive from this gift? But the Holy One, Praised be He is the one who both gives and protects. And many midrashim explain this in Sifri.

Verse 25

The LORD make His face to shine. He will show you a cordial face, a shining face.
And be gracious unto thee. He will grant you favor.

Verse 26

The LORD lift up His countenance. He will conquer His anger.

Verse 27

So they shall put My Name. They shall bless them with the specific Name.
And I will bless them. To Israel, and will concur with the kohanim. Another point: And I will bless them - the kohanim.

Verse 1



Verse 2

Why is the section dealing with the menorah juxtaposed to the section dealing with the (dedication of) princes (of each tribe)? Because when Aaron saw the dedication of each prince his mind grew weak as he was not among them in the dedication (process/ceremony) not him and not his tribe. So, The Holy One, Blessed be God, smiled (and said) "Your (task) will be grander than theirs, for you will light and tend to the candles (of the menorah).

"Send for yourself men" — (Bamidbar Rabbah) - Why is this section about the spies adjacent to the section about Miriam? She was afflicted because of the rumors she spoke about her brother and these evil doers saw [this incident] and did not take [out of it] self improvement.
(Sotah 34b) For yourself; I am not commanding you, If you want to-send spies. Because the Jews came to Moshe and said (Deuteronomy 1:22): "let us send spies before we enter" as quoted in the verse... Moshe took counsel with G-d. G-d replied "I already told you that the land is good. (Exodus 3:17) By my life, I give you the option to choose incorrectly by following the spies and not inherit the land."

Verse 3

"And Moses called to Hoshua etc." - [Moses] prayed to G-d about [Hoshua] that [he] should be saved from the counsel of the spies (Bamidbar Rabbah).

Verse 17

"Go up there in the Negev" - [The Negev] was the waste of the Land of Israel. That is the way of merchants, who show the waste first and afterwards show the praiseworthy.

Verse 18

"the land, what it is" - (Bamidbar Rabbah) - There is land that raises strong people, there is land that raises weak people, there are those that increase populations and there are those that reduce populations.
"they are strong or weak" - (Badmidbar Rabbah) - [Moses] gave over a sign to [the spies]: if they dwell scattered, they are strong since they rely on their strength. And if they dwell in fortified cities, they are weak.

Verse 22

And he went to Hebron.  Caleb went there alone, and prostrated himself on the graves of the forefathers, (to pray) that he would not be enticed to join his colleagues in their plan.  This is what is stated (Deuteronmy 1:36): "to him will I give the land that he hath trodden upon".  And it is written (Judges 1:20) "And they gave Hebron to Caleb".

Verse 24



Verse 25



Verse 26

What does "And they went" teach us?  It draws a comparison between their going and their coming.  Just like they came in (their approach) with evil intent, so too they are going (leaving Eretz Yisroel) with evil intent.  
...They returned to relate the matter- to Moshe and to Aharon (together).

Verse 27

"It flows with milk and honey." Rashi: Any falsehood that does not begin with a small amount of truth does not survive in the end.

Verse 1

כל העדה [THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL], EVEN THE WHOLE CONGREGATION —עֵדָה הַשְּׁלֵמָה, שֶׁכְּבָר מֵתוּ מֵתֵי מִדְבָּר וְאֵלּוּ פֵרְשׁוּ לַחַיִּים The congregation in its entirety, for those who were to die in the wilderness in consequence of their sin had already died, but these had been expressly mentioned for life (cf. Rashi on v. 22).
ותמת שם מרים AND MIRIAM DIED THERE — לָמָּה נִסְמְכָה פָרָשַׁת מִיתַת מִרְיָם לְפָרָשַׁת פָּרָה אֲדֻמָּה? לוֹמַר לָךְ, מַה קָּרְבָּנוֹת מְכַפְּרִין, אַף מִיתַת צַדִּיקִים מְכַפֶּרֶת (מועד קטן כ"ח):Why is the section narrating the death of Miriam placed immediately after the section treating of the red cow? To suggest to you the following comparison: What is the purpose of the sacrifices? They effect atonement! So, too, does the death of the righteous effect atonement! (Moed Katan. 28a).
ותמת שם מרים AND MIRIAM DIED THERE — אַף הִיא בִנְשִׁיקָה מֵתָה, וּמִפְּנֵי מָה לֹא נֶאֱמַר בָּהּ "עַל פִּי ה'"? שֶׁאֵינוֹ דֶּרֶךְ כָּבוֹד שֶׁל מַעְלָה, וּבְאַהֲרֹן נֶאֱמַר "עַל פִּי ה'" בְּאֵלֶּה מַסְעֵי (במדבר ל"ג):She, too, as Moses and Aaron, died by a Divine Kiss. But why is it not said with reference to her: she died “by the command (lit., mouth) of God”, (this being the Biblical expression from which is derived the Midrashic statement that they died by the Divine Kiss)? Because this would not be a respectful way of speaking about the Most High God, as it would have reference to a woman. But of Aaron it says in the Sedrah אלה מסעי (Numbers 33:38), “By the mouth of the Lord” (Moed Katan. 28a).

Verse 2

"And there was no water for the congregation." From here we learn that for the entire forty years, they had a well of water because of Miriam's merit.

Your brother Israel"  Why did he see fit here to mention brotherhood?  Rather, Moses sent the message we are brothers, sons of Abraham.  As it was said about Abraham "Your descendants will be strangers"   And both of us carry the חוב לפרעו, the obligation to complete obligation.

while they were weeping: The law [that anyone cohabiting with a non-Jewish woman is to be executed by zealots] eluded him. [Therefore,] they all burst out weeping. At the incident of the golden calf Moses [successfully] confronted six hundred thousand as it says, “He ground it until it was powder…” (Exod. 32:20), yet here he appeared so helpless? However, [this happened] so that Phinehas should come and take what was due to him. — [Mid. Tanchuma Balak 20]

Verse 5

The Family of Chanoch -  Since the nations of the world would humiliate them (Bnei Yisrael) and would say "Why do these trace their lineage through their tribes?  Do they think the Mitzriyim did not rule over their mothers?  If they ruled over their bodies, how much more so did they rule over their wives!"  Therefore Hashem put His name on them,  with a letter "hay" on one side and the letter "yud" on the other side.  (As if ) to say "I testify about them that they are the children of their fathers!"  And that is what is explained through the words of Dovid Hamelech in  Tehillim 122:4 "The tribes of Hashem (Kah - the name of Hashem that is spelled with a yud and a hay) are a testimony for Yisrael."  This Name testifies about them regarding their tribes.  Therefore it is written with all of them "HaChanochi, HaPallui".  But with "Yimnah" it didn't need to say "the family of HaYimni", since the name always a yud in the beginning and a hay at the end.

Chapter 27



Verse 1

למשפחת מנשה בן יוסף OF THE FAMILIES OF MANASSEH THE SON OF JOSEPH — Why is this stated? Has it not already been said בן מנשה, and consequently we know that they belonged to the family of Manasseh the son of Joseph?! But it is to suggest the following idea to you: Just as Joseph held the Promised Land dear, as it is said, (Genesis 50:25) “And ye shall bring my bones up (to Israel) from hence”, so, too, his daughters held the Land dear, as it is said, (v. 4) “Give us an inheritance”; and further to teach you that they were righteous all of them (everyone here mentioned in the pedigree), for in every case where a person’s doings and his ancestors’ doings are nowhere plainly described and Scripture somewhere enters into the details of the pedigree in respect to one of them, tracing his genealogy back to someone worthy of praise, it is evident that the person in question is himself a righteous man and a son of a righteous father. But if it gives his genealogy in connection with something deserving of reprobation, — as, for example, (2 Kings 25:25) “Ishmael the son of Nethanian the son of Elishama came … and smote Gedaliah”, then it is quite certain that all who are mentioned in connection with him were wicked people (Sifrei Bamidbar 133:1).

G-d will set [a man] - Since Moshe heard G-d say [that he should] give Tzlophchad's inheritance [land] to his daughters (Bamidbar Rabba), he said: "The time has come that I should demand my own needs, that my sons should inherit my greatness. Said G-d to him: "That is not my thoughts, rather Yehoshua merits this reward as he has not moved from [your] tent." As Shlomo says (Mishlei 27:18): "The protector of a fig tree will eat its fruit, [and the guardian of his master will be honored]."

<b>ye shall have a stoppage:</b> Stopped from doing labor. Alternatively, "stoppage" means "stop from departing," teaching that [the holiday] requires sleeping over. And its Midrashic interpretation in Agada is: Since, on all of the days of the pilgrimage holiday, they brought offerings corresponding to the seventy nations, when they came to depart, the Omnipresent said to them, "Please make Me a small meal, so that I may take enjoy you."

Chapter 33



Verse 1

These are the journeys - these are the stages. Why are each of the these stages listed? To inform the reader about the kindness of God. For even though there had been a decree that they would wander about in the desert, it was never said that they should perpetually wander for forty years and have no rest. For when one looks at the list there are no more than forty two stages. Remove 14 from that number which were all in the first year before the decree, for “the traveled from Ramses” until they came to Ramatah - for it was from there that the spies were sent, as it says (Numbers 12), “And afterwards the nation traveled from Hazterot etc. “Send for yourself men [to spy]...” And hereit says that they left Hatzerot and camped in Ramatah - this teachers that it is in the Wilderness of Paran. And one must remove from the count another eight journeys which were after the death of Aharon from when they were at Hor HaHar until the reached the plains of Moav in the fortieth year. What emerges from this is that in the entire 38 years of wandering, they did not have to make more than twenty journeys. This interpretation is based on the opinion of Rabbi Moshe HaDarshan.  And Rabbi Tanhuma explained it with a different drasha: This can be compared to a king who had a sick child and he brought him someplace very far to be healed. And once they return home, his father recounts all of the journeys and says, “here we slept, here we were cold, here you had a headache.” [Bamidbar Rabbah].
