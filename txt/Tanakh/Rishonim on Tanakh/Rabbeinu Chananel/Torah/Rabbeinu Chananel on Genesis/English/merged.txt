Verse 2

The reason why we have two verses in both of which G’d is reported as speaking (separately) although no mention is made of Avram making any response in between, is that the first verse commencing with ויאמר was not a verbalised version of what G’d “said,” but describes what he thought. Such constructions are not unique, other examples occurring in Genesis 27,41 ויאמר עשו בלבו, “Esau said in his heart, etc.” It is reported as Esau having said something, else how could his mother have heard it? Solomon, in Kohelet 2,1 also uses the word אמרתי when describing something he thought rather than something he had actually said.

Verse 5

ותאמר שרי אל אברם חמסי עליך, the meaning of the words חמסי עליך is revealed when the angel tells Hagar to go back to Sarai her mistress and to submit to her oppression (16,9). The Torah, at this stage, had covered up the change in Sarah's attitude toward Hagar. Sarai had become completely dependent on Hagar as a result of her having become pregnant. Previously, in the mistress-maid relationship it was the maid who had been dependent on her mistress. Avram had accused her of committing a criminal act by oppressing Hagar. By refusing her services as a maid, Hagar was further encouraged to treat her mistress as her inferior. As a result, Sarai now challenged Avram, blaming him for her reduction in status. She therefore demanded that G'd Himself intervene to show that it was really His will that she now be subordinate to Hagar. This is the reason for the dot on the word וביניך. The point is that Sarai did not want such Divine judgment to cause Avram harm. In the event, the angel told Hagar that Sarai had been correct in her treatment of her when he told her to go back and to submit to Sarai's harsh treatment of her.

Verse 1

אני אל שדי. The commandment of circumcision was given using this Divine Name (El Shaddai) because a man's strength and power are diminished through circumcision. As our Sages have taught, יצפון לישרים תושיה (Proverbs 2:7), "He treasures up sound wisdom for the righteous," refers to circumcision, which the Holy One, Blessed be He, concealed for twenty generations, from Adam until Abraham. This name, Shaddai, is associated with power, as it is written, כקול מים רבים כקול שדי (Ezekiel 1:24), "like the voice of many waters, like the voice of Shaddai." G-d did not want Abraham to think that by cutting his flesh he would weaken himself and make himself vulnerable to his enemies. Therefore, G-d said to him, אני אל שדי, “I am El Shaddai.” I will provide you with the strength and power to overcome your enemies, both you and all your circumcised descendants. This echoes Rabbeinu Chananel's commentary, which emphasizes that the name Shaddai, associated with might and strength, was used to reassure Abraham that despite the physical act of circumcision, G-d would ensure his continued strength and ability to overcome adversaries. This reassurance extended to all of Abraham's descendants who would observe this commandment.

ולישמעאל שמעתיך ... ונתתיו לגוי גדולת. We see from our historical records that this prophecy came true after a delay of 2333 years. [Avraham was circumcised in the year 2047 according to Seder hadorot and the Mohammedan faith originated in the year 4384, exactly 2333 years later.] This delay was not due to sins of the original Ishmaelites. They had been looking forward to the fulfillment of this prophecy for all these years. We lost our independence due to our sins, however. G'd set a time of 1305 years (according to Daniel) until our redeemer would come. We must certainly continue to look forward to our glorious destiny and not despair if the Ishmaelites had not despaired after over 2000 years <small>(Rabbeinu Bachya)</small>.

Verse 4

והשענו תחת העץ. This teaches that there was only a single tree at that location. Why did G’d reveal Himself in the shape of a tree? This was because He told him that he would sire a son after having become old, similar to a tree of which it is written that even “an old tree still has hope of producing new branches even if it has been cut down, it will renew itself, its shoots will not cease, if its roots are old in the earth and its stump dies in the ground. At the scent of water it will bud and produce branches like a sapling.”(Job 14,7-9) Furthermore, the righteous have been compared to trees, as we know from Psalms 1,3 והיה כעץ שתול על פלגי מים, “he will be as a tree planted besides streams of water,” <small>(quoted by Rabbeinu Bachya in the name of Rabbeinu Chananel in his commentary on Genesis 18,1)</small>.

למען אשר יצוה את בניו ואת ביתו אחריו, the dictates by the patriarchs to their respective children, all only by word of mouth, without there being a written document claiming to be G’d’s instructions such as the Torah nowadays, were observed by these children of the patriarchs as if the Torah had already been given, and as if they each had said: “I will do and I will hear.” This is further proof that the oral Torah is not subordinate to the written Torah. All of what was written in the written Torah was included in what the people heard at Mount Sinai, as well as all that G’d taught Moses while he was on that mountain. Just as there is no difference between the specific commandment the people had heard, i.e. the Ten Commandments, and the remainder of the written Torah, so there is no difference [in the authenticity and binding nature Ed.] of the commandments not spelled out in the written Torah, but handed down by the sages orally from generation to generation. (Rabbeinu Bachya)

הנה נא לי שתי בנות, Lot most certainly did not mean to “sacrifice” his daughters. His turn of phrase must be understood in the same sense as when someone says to his good friend: “my house is at your disposal. Help yourself to whatever you desire!” Or, the words may be understood as if someone under the threat of being murdered shouts at his would-be murderers: “go ahead and kill me, (if you dare)” He knew full well that these people were not going to do what he had proposed to them.

וישלח אבימלך מלך גרר ויקח את שרה, now that Avraham had come to Gerar he had divorced Sarah seeing that he was afraid the local people would kill him if he would reveal that Sarah was his wife. In spite of this, G’d did not allow that Sarah would become separated from him; He did not allow that a righteous woman should become the wife or concubine of an idolater, a sinner. To indicate that this “divorce” was only due to fear, the Torah describes Sarah’s status as והיא בעולת בעל, “she had a husband.” The divorce bill was therefore not fully effective. It was this status which enabled Avimelech to protest to G’d: הגוי גם צדיק תהרוג, “are You going to kill an innocent person? Conditional divorces were not part of the legislation practiced among gentiles, so why should he have had to consider such a clause? He considered himself a righteous person for not having sexually molested Sarah. In addition, he had every reason to believe that Sarah was unattached, as both Avraham and Sarah had described their relationship as that of brother and sister. Such assurances had been given by both of them repeatedly <small>(compare Rabbeinu Bachya)</small>.
בתם לבבי, did I take her as my wife.
ובנקיון כפי, I have not even touched her as yet.

ויאמר לבן טוב תתי אתה לך מתתי אתה לאיש אחר, even though giving her to another man [presumably someone with liquid assets, and she would not have to wait for seven years to be married, Ed.] would also be good. Man without a woman, a wife, or a woman without a husband are both not considered as טוב as a “good situation.” (based on Jerusalem Talmud Berachot 9, but expressed in negative terms, i.e. that being single is not good, intolerable.) This reflects what G’d said in Genesis 2,18 that it was not a good situation for Adam to be solitary, without a mate, without a wife. The term טוב  is not an absolute, objective term, but is often used to describe a relative situation, i.e. “better than.”  Even when used in such a context, it may not necessarily be relative to one other choice, but could be relative to a variety of choices, some bad, some relatively good when compared to the bad choice but relatively bad when compared to the best alternative. The author quotes from Lamentations 4,9 and Kohelet 4,17 as well as from Proverbs 15,17 as well as from  Kohelet 5,4 and Kohelet 4,2-3 to illustrate how the word טוב is used in different contexts, generally as a comparative to an alternative. <small>(According to Rabbeinu Bachya’s understanding of Rabbeinu Chananel, Lavan meant to say that although a good case could be made for giving Rachel in marriage to someone else, in fact such a choice might be considered superior, he was agreeable to Yaakov’s proposal.)</small>

ותגנב רחל את התרפים אשר לאביה; she stole them in order that he would reconsider his actions, saying to himself that any deity which allows itself to be stolen surely cannot be much good to anyone. The same argument had been used by Yoash who told his father that if his deity, the baal, was really capable of avenging himself, he should do so himself instead of letting his human worshipper become his defender. (Judges 6,31) Similar arguments are reflected in Ezekiel 28,9 where the prophet predicts the downfall of the King of Tzor (Tyre) who had declared himself a god. He ridicules this “god” as saying to his murderer: “I am a god!” (quoted by Rabbeinu Bachya).

הבנות בנותי והבנים בני והצאן צאני, Lavan deliberately bent the truth when he said: “and the sons are mine.” A grandfather cannot say of his grandchildren by his daughters that they belong to him. What our sages meant when they said that “grandchildren are like children (Yevamot 62) referred only to the grandsons who are sons of sons, not to grandsons who are children of one’s daughters. He also twisted the truth when he said that the flocks (of Yaakov) were his (Lavan’s) flocks. He had first given them to Yaakov as compensation for his labour. Lavan was similarly legally wrong when he added: וכל אשר אתה רואה לי הוא, “all that you (Yaakov) see is really mine.” This is what Yaakov had in mind when said to him in verse 37: “when you checked out and rummaged in all of my things, what did you find that belonged to you?” Lavan had not replied to this. The entire situation reminds one of what ben Haddad had said to Achav King of Israel, (Kings I 20,3) “your silver and gold are mine, your wives and children who are good are mine.” Achav had replied (verse 7) that Ben Haddad’s words revealed that he was bent on doing harm and did not have a legal argument to support his claim. Lavan also had no legal claim so that he was forced to reply to Yaakov’s challenge “why did you chase after me?” “I came to see my daughters, who are my daughters.”

Yaakov included all the 13 attributes G’d revealed to Moses in Exodus 34, 6-7 in his prayer here. The words אלקי אברהם ואלוקי יצחק represented the first two of G’d’s attributes, i.e. “mercy and justice.” The words שוב לארצך G’d had said and which Yaakov quotes, refer to the third attribute, the one called רחום in Exodus. The words ואטיבה עמך correspond to the attribute חנון in Exodus, i.e. loving kindness totally unearned by the recipient. The words ארך אפים in the list given to Moses is represented in Yaakov’s prayer by the word קטונתי. Yaakov meant that but for G’d’s long lasting patience, he could not have endured. The word is reminiscent of the line in Amos 7,5 חדל נא מי יקום יעקב כי קטן הוא, “Oh Lord, refrain! How will Yaakov survive, he is so small!”
 The words מכל החסדים ומכל האמת correspond to the words ורב חסד ואמת in the list of G’d’s attributes in Exodus. The words ועתה הייתי לשני מחנות in our verse correspond to the words נוצר חסד לאלפים in the parallel paragraph in Exodus. G’d has preserved the חסד performed by both Avraham and Yitzchok to be credited to the account of their grandson Yaakov. The words אלפים (plural), correspond to שני מחנות, 2 camps.
הצילני נא מיד אחי, these words correspond to the words נושא עון in Exodus, meaning that the sin has not caused Yaakov’s downfall.
מיד עשו, a reference to a sin of a far more serious nature than עון, described as פשע in the list of attributes in Exodus. 
כי ירא אנכי, these words correspond to the word וחטאה in the list of attributes in Exodus. It is a minor type of sin, the one committed inadvertently.
ואתה אמרת, these words and their continuation correspond to the word ונקה in the list of G’d’s attributes revealed to Moses in Exodus 34,7.

Verse 15

ויפן וירד משה מן ההר. We learn from this word ויפן, he turned around, that Moses descended while facing the cloud just as he had done when ascending the mountain. In other words, just as he had ascended facing the cloud, he now descended keeping his face toward the cloud, walking backwards. The High Priest, on the Day of Atonement, emulated this when withdrawing from the Holy of Holies by walking backwards after having offered the incense before the lid of the Holy Ark, the kapporet, as well as some of the blood of the two offerings on behalf of the people as well as sprinkling some on the dividing curtain. We have a similar verse in Chronicles II 1,13 describing Solomon’s approach to the altar that was standing in Givon at that time. Even though one could say that the words ויבא שלמה לבמה אשר בגבעון ירושלים mean: “Solomon returned from the altar in Givon to Jerusalem,” [seeing Givon at that time was certainly not part of Jerusalem Ed.] the correct interpretation is that he withdrew in the same way as he had approached. The point of all this was to conform to the principle of שויתי ה' לנגדי תמיד, “I am keeping Hashem in front of Me at all times.” (Psalms 16,8) One does not turn one’s back on G’d. The Mishnah, Yuma 52 states: “in the manner he had entered he also exited.” This is also the way Leviticus 16,24 describes this, writing: “he exited and completed the ritual of his own burnt offering as well as that of the people.” These words have been interpreted by our sages to mean that the word לבמה “to the altar,” must also be read as מבמה.”from the altar,” when he was headed back to Jerusalem (Yuma 53). There is a precedent for this in Numbers 31,21, where the words הבאים למלחמה, must also mean הבאים מן המלחמה, “the ones who were returning from the war.” How do we know that indeed the Shechinah was on the mountain at the time Moses descended? In Deuteronomy 9,15 where Moses refers to his descent from the mountain, he adds the words: “and the mountain was burning in fire while the two tablets of the covenant were on my hands.” We learn from all of this that the student, when taking leave of his teacher, walks backwards until the face of his teacher is no longer directly visible to him. (Yuma 53)  This is also the reason why, at the end of the principal prayer the amidah, we step three steps backwards, as if to take leave of the G’d Whom we had faced and addressed before. (Shulchan Aruch Orach Chayim section 123).

לא יקרא עוד שמך יעקב כי אם ישראל יהיה שמך. The meaning of G’d adding the name “Israel” to Yaakov’s existing name is hinted at by the word עוד, “more, yet, still.” The verse is not saying that the name "Yaakov" will no longer be used, but rather that it will not be used exclusively. The verse means: “your name will no longer be called Yaakov only, rather Israel will be your name,” meaning both Yaakov and Israel. We find a similar construction in Jeremiah 3:16, לא יאמרו עוד ארון ברית ה', “They shall no more say, ‘The Ark of the Covenant of the Lord,’” meaning they will not refer only to the Ark as the dwelling place of G’d’s presence. Rather, Jerusalem itself will become the locus of His presence. This is alluded to in Isaiah 48:2, בעת ההיא יקראו לירושלים כסא ה', “At that time they shall call Jerusalem ‘the throne of the Lord.’” This is also the meaning of the prophet in the same chapter (Isaiah 48:1), שמע אלי יעקב וישראל מקוראי, “Hearken unto Me, O Jacob and Israel, My called.” Similarly, we find in Jeremiah 46:27 ואתה אל תירא עבדי יעקב ואל תחת ישראל, "But fear not thou, O My servant Jacob, and be not dismayed, O Israel.”

They derive this from the words of Tamar, who said (to herself): “if he will own up to the truth, Ok, if not, I will rather allow myself to be burned at the stake than to shame him in public.” Even though the word מוצאת is spelled with the letter א in the middle, thus not being derived from the root הצת, to cause a conflagration, to set fire, one may explain it along that line here as being phonetically connected to Lamentations 4,11 ויצת אש ציון, “He set fire to Zion.”

ועל השנות החלום פעמים, this teaches that the first dream and the second dream were one. Why then did Pharaoh have to dream the same dream twice? כי נכון הדבר מעם האלוקים, the seven years of plenty would commence immediately.
וממהר האלוקים לעשותו, the famine will start immediately after the seven years of abundance.<small> (as quoted by Rabbeinu Bachya)</small>

Verse 1

למה תתראו this is an admonition by Yaakov to his sons “why are you confrontational with each other?” This is supported from Kings II 14,8 לכה נתראה פנים, “let us confront each other!” Verse 11 in the same chapter of Kings also confirms the meaning of this word as being to confront each other when we read ויתראו פנים הוא ואמציה מלך יהודה, ”he and King Amatziah of Yehudah confronted each other.”

כי לולא התמהמנו, the verse teaches us that in the interval the sons had all severely restricted the amount of food that they had been consuming without raising objections to their father’s ruling not to take Binyamin with them. They waited until their father would himself realise that he had to change his attitude and would agree for Binyamin to accompany his brothers. Once he had become agreeable, he suggested five steps to increase their chances of success. They were: 1) “take a gift along for the ruler of that land.” 2) “take twice the amount of money you had taken the first time.” 3) the amount of money found in their bags they should return as independent of any money taken to pay for purchases. Joseph’s official might have made a mistake. It would be a sanctification of the Lord’s name for people believing in Him being seen as so honest. 4) take along your younger brother. 5). Prayer. He told the brothers that he had prayed to G’d that He should exercise His mercy toward them when they would confront the Egyptian ruler. (as quoted by Rabbeinu Bachya)

הננו עבדים לאדוני גם אנחנו גם אשר נמצא הגביע בידו, “here your servants are ready to be your slaves, both we and the one in whose hand the goblet has been found.” These words of Yehudah to Joseph, (his representative, Ed) are puzzling, as he should have said הננו עבדים אשר נמצא הגביע בידו, גם אנחנו הנקיים, “here we are ready to be your slaves, the one in whose hand the goblet has been found, as well as we who are innocent.” [the guilty one should precede the innocent one in the phrasing of Yehudah’s offer.] How could Yehudah refer to the one in whose bag the goblet had been found as “only” גם, “also,” when it was he who had caused the whole disaster? Anyone reading the words of Yehudah must come to the conclusion that the thief had actually refused to shoulder the blame for his deed, not believing that he should be a slave. Because he was aware of this impression given by Yehudah’s words, Rabbeinu Chananel suggests that Yehudah’s words must be understood in conjunction with the previous words מה נאמר לאדוני, “what are we able to say to my lord, etc.” The word נאמר refers to the money found in their bags the first time, whereas the word נדבר, refers to the second money, the money the brothers had brought to Egypt as compensation for what they had found the last time when they came home. The words ומה נצטדק, refers to the goblet.

Verse 10

ויספדו שם מספד גדול וכבד מאד. There are 9 different kinds of eulogy. They are:מספד, נהי, צעקה,היליל, נידה, מרזח, קינים, הגה, והי. All these expressions are documented in Scripture.   The expression מספד (as here) occurs in Kings I 13,30 ויספדו עליו הוא אחי, “they lamented over it, saying: “alas” my brother.” The word נהי meaning eulogy, appears in Jeremiah 9,18, whereas the expressions צעקה and היליל meaning different types of eulogy occur in Ezekiel 21,14. The expression נידה occurs in Jeremiah 48,17 also meaning eulogy. The word מרזח is used in this sense in Jeremiah 16,5, whereas קינים occurs in that sense Ezekiel 2,6. When the Torah here uses the expression מספד גדול, a great mourning, the meaning is that the various types of eulogies to which we have referred were all used on that occasion.  Basically, the Torah teaches that nine different groups of people all participated in the funeral cortege for Yaakov and each made its particular contribution to eulogising and demonstrating their appreciation of the contribution this man had made to mankind, not only to his family. A eulogy is a register of the positive contributions made by the deceased during his lifetime. An example of such a eulogy are the words spoken about King Sha-ul and his son Yonathan by King David: in Samuel II 1,23: הנאהבים והנעימים בחייהם ובמותם לא נפרדו, “who were beloved and pleasant and even in death refused to be parted from Him.” A properly composed eulogy contains elements describing the personal relationship between the survivor and the deceased such as David saying of Yonathan in that same chapter: צר לי עליך אחי יהונתן, “my brother Yonathan you were most dear to me, your love was more wonderful to me, more than the love of women.” King David also taught us something about a eulogy even for people who not always saw eye to eye with the one eulogising him, i.e Avner, at one time almost David’s arch enemy. Nonetheless, in Samuel II 3,33 David proclaims: “Should Avner have died the death of a churl? Your hands were not bound, your feet were not put in fetters; but you fell as one falls before treacherous men!” These examples teach that when eulogising one has to list the good people did, their contributions to life generally, emphasising that with the death of the deceased the survivors have been deprived of those values the deceased stood for. The prophet Ezekiel was even instructed by G’d to eulogise the city of Tzor (Tyre), (Ezekiel 27,2-3) although the major part of that eulogy bemoaned the abuse made by those people of the gifts and luxuries they had enjoyed thanks to G’d’s largesse. The exploits of these people are extolled in spite of their not finding favour in the eyes of the Lord. In verse 27 of that eulogy the fact that all these people, G’d’s creatures, were swept away in the prime of their lives is bemoaned. [The prophet Ezekiel did not say “good riddance.” Ed.]  In Moed Katan the Talmud elaborates on the eulogy over the passing of Rabbi Pedot, the speaker commencing with describing the very day on which the sage died as a day which is difficult for the entire Jewish people, as difficult as the day when the sun set on the land of Egypt. This was a reference to Amos 8,9 “Shall not the earth shake for this, and all that dwell in it mourn? Shall it not all rise like the Nile, etc., etc.? I will make the sun set at noon, I will darken the earth on a sunny day, I will turn your festivals into mourning, and all your songs into dirges.” The demise of the power of Egypt was, of course, no reason for the Jewish people to mourn, but it was a reason for all the nations who considered Egypt as their patron to do so. There is sort of a formula of how the president of the Sanhedrin has to be eulogised, [to ensure one is not guilty of being remiss in eulogising him sufficiently, a grave sin. Ed.] Part of the formula contains the words: “the finest spices have been buried in the earth (where they cannot give off their fragrance) a man who knew all about the most intricate parts of Torah law such as the various skin eczemas, etc. and ritual impurities connected with oholot, a man able to remove any doubts which bothered Torah scholars of lesser stature. Someone able to explain all manner of hidden depths contained in the Torah.” The mourner continued to liken the deceased to the most outstanding judges in Israel such as Othniel. [The above is an example of a eulogy worthy of the name. Ed.]
