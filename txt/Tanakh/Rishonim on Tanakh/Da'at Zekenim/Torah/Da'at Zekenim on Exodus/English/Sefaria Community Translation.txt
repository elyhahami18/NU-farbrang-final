<b>And the meat in the field that is torn</b>. Since the dog risked its life over the torn prey when the wolf came to tear it, it should not seem like an imposition of good will towards it that when you have torn prey, you should throw it to the dog as reward for having guarded it until now so it would not be torn, and also to continue guarding the other animals, for thus is the way of the world to appoint dogs to guard the flocks from wolves.

<b>And six years you shall sow, etc.</b> It says in the Midrash that even if a person has only one ruin in the midst of his garden, he is obligated to work it every day. And it appears to Rabbi Moshe that this applies specifically in the Land of Israel in order to increase the separation of terumot and maasrot.

Verse 20

<b>Behold, I am sending an angel</b>. By merit of the Ten Commandments that begin with "I am", I am sending an angel before you to guard you. Alternatively, the Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, "Behold I am sending an angel." Moses said to Him, "I am not asking for an angel to go with us, but You in Your glory. And if Your presence does not go with us, we will not move from here." The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, "I am not even sending an angel, just the hornet," as it is written, (Deuteronomy 7:20) "And also the hornet." And specifically in this world He sends the hornet, but in the future world (Malachi 3:23) "Behold I am sending Elijah the prophet to you", as it says, "Behold I am sending an angel before you."

Verse 21

<b>For he will not pardon your transgression</b>. Wherever he is sent, he performs his mission but is unable to show favor, as it is written "May the Lord lift up His countenance", and not an angel. For My name is within him, therefore I warn you not to rebel against him as if you were rebelling against Me, since My name is within him and he will not be able to pardon your transgression, for the rebellion depends on Me. An analogy is one who rebels against the word of the treasurer who does not have the power to pardon, for the rebellion depends on the king. Rashi explains that "My name is within him" refers to Metatron whose name is like his Master's name, for Metatron has the same numerical value as Shaddai. And a reminder of this is a computation in אתב"ש coding. And Rabbi Moshe says the reason I state about him that his name is like his Master's name is that his name is spelled out in the Aleph-Beta of Rabbi Akiva, and there it enumerates the 72 names that belong to him.

<b>He did not lay his hand</b>. He did not stretch out his hand to place it before his face so that they would not see him as with Moses in the cleft of the rock, as it is written (Exodus 33:22) "and I will cover you with My palm" etc. And therefore (Exodus 24:11) "they saw the God."
