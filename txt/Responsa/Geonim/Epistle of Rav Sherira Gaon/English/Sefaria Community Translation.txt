Epistle of Rav Sherira Gaon



Question 1






















































And their main [methods] were a fortiori arguments [<i>kal vechomer</i>], linguistic analogies, and the [various] angles of exegesis. And from those were the thirteen exegetical principles of Rabbi Yishmael. (Also) other things were from them, such as inversion of the text, inclusions and exclusions, expounding the meaning, (expounding) juxtaposition, comparisons, not learning from two verses that are the same, learning what is above from what is below, one can deduce a little but one cannot deduce a lot, expounding the meaning of the verse, subtracting adding and interpreting, significance of the reading and significance of the written text, (colloquial language), it being stated here and stated later, a verse is expounded to what is before it and what is before that, a verse does not depart from its simple understanding, there is [no] chronological order [in the Torah], the Torah spoke in the language of men, hinting, something stated here but not [needed] here is to learn the matter for another law, something that is shown by another law, something that is stated here and there and is not [needed] for there is learned for the other, a section that is stated and repeated [is only repeated for that which is new in it], infer from it but interpret the law according to its place, it is sufficient to apply the law to be no more than what it is learned from. And there are many things like that (those) early ones said in their laws, each one according to those that he learned. These things were their study, to reveal the reasons of the Torah. And it is like Rabbi Abbahu said in the name of Rabbi Yochanan, “Rabbi Meir had a disciple, and his name was Sumakhus, who would state with regard to each and every matter of ritual impurity, forty-eight reasons for impurity; and with regard to each and every matter of ritual purity, forty-eight reasons for purity” (Eruvin 13b:6).
