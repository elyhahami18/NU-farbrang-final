I also asked [in my dream] regarding chametz on Pesach. Does the halacha follow those who say that even a minute amount of it in a mixture can never be annulled?<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">There is an argument here of how to read the Talmud. Rashi on Pesachim 30a:1 reads that it is forbidden even in a minute quantity, Rif Pesachim 7b has a slightly different version of the text (See Baal Hamaor ad loc for his discussion of the textual differences and their ramifications), and Rabbeinu Tam, cited in Tosafot on Pesachim 30a:1 , would himself practice stringently even though he held chametz was essentially annulled in sixty times its volume. Rav Ahai Gaon (Sheiltot, Tzav 80) also permitted mixtures where the chametz was less than one sixtieth of the total. Raavad, in his work known as 'Issur Mashehu', held that eating chametz was forbidden in any amount, while benefit from a mixture was permitted when less than one in sixty.</i> 
They responded: the commandments around chametz were the first given to the children of Israel; they were accepted with love and warmth and joy, and they were guarded strictly down to the most minute details. You can see that the Torah was stringent to the level of prohibiting even seeing and owning it<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 12:19 and Exodus 13:7 .</i>. This is not the case for any other prohibition except for idolatry, where it is written <i>"Do not bring an abhorrent thing into your house" (Deuteronomy 7:26)</i>. All who increase their meticulous observance shall have the days and years of their life increased too.
He also asked [in his dream] regarding the end of days, but upon awakening he did not find an answer written for him.
I have copied all these responsa from a manuscript on parchment.
