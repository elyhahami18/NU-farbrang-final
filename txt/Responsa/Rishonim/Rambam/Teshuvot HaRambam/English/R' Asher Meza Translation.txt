Question: Regarding Rabbi Yohanan's statement (Sanhedrin 59a), "A gentile who studies Torah is liable to death," is this a binding law? And must every Jew refrain from teaching a gentile anything about the commandments derived from the seven Noahide laws, or is this not required?
Answer: This is undoubtedly a binding law. When Jews hold sovereignty (i.e., "the hand of Israel is strong over them"), a gentile should be prevented from studying Torah until they convert. However, if a gentile studies Torah, they are not to be executed, as the statement says "liable to death" and not "he shall be killed," which is explicitly said regarding a Noahide who violates the seven laws. It is permissible to teach non-Jews the commandments and their associated rewards and punishments, as some of them may be inspired to return to the proper path. Non-Jews often acknowledge and affirm that our Torah is divine, given to us by Moses, our teacher (peace be upon him), and they have the Torah in its entirety recorded in their texts. At times, however, they may interpret it incorrectly, deviating from its true meaning. Even so, some of them do return to the proper path, and teaching them does not present any stumbling block for Israel. Moshe
