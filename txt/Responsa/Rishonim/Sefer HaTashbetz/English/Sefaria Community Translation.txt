And I say that it would have been possible to say that [wine that has been in contact with] the touch of those <i>anusim</i> [Jews forced to convert to Christianity] is forbidden to benefit from, and it is not even necessary to say that [so too] is their wine. And there is support for this from that which Rambam, may his memory be blessed, wrote in the Laws of the Foundations of the Torah (5:4): But if he could spare his soul and escape from under the hand of the wicked king and he does not, behold he is like a dog that returns to its vomit. And he is called one who worships idols willingly, and he is expelled from [reaching] the world to come, and he goes down to the lowest level of <i>Geihinnom</i>. To here are his [words].  And is it not something readily visible that the <i>anusim</i> were able to spare their souls and escape, as many of them did? Yet it is difficult to say this for many reasons. Hence, I will seek to advocate for their innocence and say that we most likely may not rely upon our opinion and say that they were already able to spare their souls, such that they are complete idolaters. Rather, we should ascribe their staying there to one of the situations of duress that are known to us: Perhaps it is because they lack the ability to put together the fare [demanded] by the ship owners since it is expensive. Or it is from fear for their lives, lest [their] sin will cause [calamity] and the matter be revealed, such that they will receive a punishment in their bodies and in their reputations. Or perhaps they have tried with all of their ability to escape, but it was a bad time and it did not go as planned, or some other thing prevented them. Whereas the words of Rambam stand when one of these reasons is not present, but rather when it is clearly known that he could have escaped but did not. Moreover, I say that even if it is [ostensibly] known to us that one has no fear of fleeing there, such as if that evil king proclaims in all of his kingdom that whichever one of you in all of my people [chooses to,] he may leave and let his God be with him — nevertheless we should not be concerned about this one who did not go, but stayed there, touching [wine]. And even though we say... (Ketuvot 51b), "Rav Yehuda said, 'Those women stolen by kidnappers are permitted to their husbands, as everything they do for [their kidnappers], they do from fear. But if they release them and they go back to them on their own, they are certainly forbidden.'" ... — we can nevertheless say that the case before us is not similar... Here, we can say that perhaps they are afraid that the permission given them is only to test them [and see] if they are [true apostates]. So if they flee, they will kill them...

Question: One who immigrates to the Land of Israel and enters its border - are all of his sins, whether minor or major, forgiven with repentance? One who was on the way to immigrate to the Land of Israel and died on the way - does his worthy intention make it as if he had resided in the Land of Israel?
Answer: Residing in the Land of Israel is a great mitzvah; the Ramban already listed it among the 613 mitzvot, and in the Sifrei (Devarim 80:5) our sages said settling the Land of Israel is equivalent to all of the commandments, as is written, “… and you shall possess it (the Land), and dwell in it. And you shall observe to do all the statutes and judgments which I set before you this day (Devarim 11:31-32). And our sages (Ketubot 110b) already emphasized this by saying, “Anyone who resides in the Land of Israel is like one who has a Lord, as it is written, ‘I am G-d your Lord, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, to give you the land of Canaan, and to be your Lord’ (Leviticus 25:28).” And (Ketubot 111a): “Anyone who resides in the Land of Israel dwells without transgression, as it is stated: ‘And the inhabitant shall not say: I am sick; the people that dwell there shall be forgiven their iniquity.’ (Isaiah 33:24).” And (Ketubot 111a): Anyone who is buried in the Land of Israel is considered as though he is buried beneath the altar. It is stated here: “An altar of earth [adama] you shall make for Me” (Exodus 20:21), and it is stated there: “For He does avenge the blood of His servants, and renders vengeance to His adversaries, and atones for the land of [admato] His people” (Deuteronomy 32:43). And the sages of Israel (Ketubot 112a) would endanger themselves by crossing rivers in order to enter the Land of Israel saying, “This is a place where Moses and Aaron did not merit entering; who says that I will merit seeing this land?” And they would kiss the rocks of the Land of Israel and roll in its dust, as it is written, “For Your servants take pleasure in her stones, and love her dust.” (Psalms 102:15) And (Ketubot 111b) it is called “beauty in the Land of of the Living” (Ezekiel 26:20) - those who are buried there will not suffer the pain of “rolling tunnels,” but the righteous ones who are buried outside the Land do have this suffering, for the Creator makes them tunnels in the ground and (at the revival of the dead) they will roll from there to the Land of Israel and arise, as it is said, “may they blossom out of the city like the grass of the earth” (Psalms 72:16), and “city” means nothing other than Jerusalem, as it is stated: “For I will defend this city” (II Kings 19:34). And it is not permitted to leave the Land of Israel except to study Torah if one cannot find a teacher (in the Land), or to honor parents. 
From all this (the answer to your question) becomes clear. Someone who repents and regrets his sins and wants to immigrate to the Land of Israel: repentance atones; immigration to the Land of Israel adds merit and saves him from sin all (the rest) of his days. And your question, if circumstances beyond his controlled stopped him, and he did not complete his mitzvah, is it still considered a merit for him, as if he did complete it - our sages have already said in the first chapter of Kiddushin (40a), “The Creator joins a good thought to an action, as it is stated: “Then they that feared the Lord spoke one with the other, and the Lord listened, and heard, and a book of remembrance was written before Him, for them that fear the Lord, and that think upon His name” (Malachi 3:16). What is the meaning of the phrase “and that think upon His name”? Rav Asi said: Even if a person intended to perform a mitzva but due to circumstances beyond his control he did not perform it, the verse ascribes him credit as if he performed the mitzva. And may the Omnipresent One help him with his goal, like the king of the Kuzars said to the rabbi when he left him to immigrate to the Land of Israel. (Kuzari 5:28)
