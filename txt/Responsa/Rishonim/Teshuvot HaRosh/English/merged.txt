In the year 5073 from the creation of the world, the rains were withheld and only a bit of precipitation fell all winter. A fast was called, to beg God to give rain upon the soil.
On the first night of Passover, after the evening prayers, my master and father, R. Asher, sat at the door to his home, and we, some of his confidantes, stood over him to the right and left. He said: “Now is a good time to raise something about which I have always wondered. Why not invoke and petition for rain  until Shavu’ot?” Some of the confidantes responded: “It would be good to notify the elders to do so.” It was right in their eyes, and they sent word to the synagogue cantor to invoke rain the next day. So they did. The thirteen attributes  were invoked in the large synagogue, and there was a great cry during the invocations. And some of the sages protested that this was done without their counsel, and they spread a rumor saying that it should not have been done, for it portends curse. My father and master, R. Asher, held back and said nothing on that day, until the night of hol ha-mo’ed. Then he wrote a treatise to support his words, and this is its content:
Since I have heard that some are astonished at my words, I have come to explain what I have said—that currently it is not proper to cease invoking and petitioning for rain on the first day of Passover. It was not from when it happened; rather, already many years ago in Germany I protested two things that I saw practiced in those days.
The first is that they do not petition for rain properly. Even though it is stated in the first chapter of Ta’anit (10b): “It is taught: Hananyah says: In the Diaspora, [we do not begin petitioning for rain] until the sixtieth day of the [autumn] season; and R. Huna b. Hiya said in the name of Shmuel: The law accords with Hananyah.” We always follow the Babylonian Sages and practice in accord with their opinions whenever the Babylonian Sages and the Eretz Yisrael Sages dispute each other, for we consider the Babylonian Talmud to be primary. This all applies on matters concerning permitting or prohibiting, obligating or exempting, declaring pure or defiled. But when the matter hinges on the temporal needs, and it does not entail an alteration that transgresses the words of the Torah, it is proper to follow the year, the times, and the season. And Babylon sits on a great deal of water, and they did not require rain until the sixtieth day of the season. Alternatively, the planting season was later in Babylon. But in Germany, where the planting season begins in the middle of Tishrei [=the beginning of autumn], it is well known that if the rains do not fall immediately after the seeds are planted, they will be ruined, as the birds and rats will eat them all. So why should we not practice in accordance with the people of Eretz Yisrael, who petition for rain in Marheshvan [=early autumn], like Rabban Gamliel? For in this matter there is no dispute between the people of Babylon and the people of Eretz Yisrael in the sense that these offer a rationale for why it is proper to follow their position, and those offer a rationale for why it is proper to follow their position. Rather, in Babylon they acted on the basis of their needs, and the Mishna (in Ta’anit), which states that we begin petitioning in Marheshvan, was taught in Eretz Yisrael, in accordance with its needs. Do not wonder: Now that I have written that there is no dispute between them, why is it necessary for Shmuel to rule in accordance with Hananyah? For one can say that since the Mishna teaches that Rabban Gamliel says that we begin petitioning for rain on the seventh of Marheshvan, and R. Elazar stated that the law accords with Rabban Gamliel, I might have said that this should not be altered in any place, so as not to violate the words of the Mishna, as R. Elazar ruled. We thus learn from Shmuel that this is not akin to violating the words of the Mishna, for it was taught in the Land of Israel, according to their locale and needs. Now we may reason a fortiori: If the people of Babylon practice in accordance with their locale and needs by deviating from the Mishna, then certainly the people of Germany should act in accordance with their needs by not deviating from the Mishna. Indeed, we find that this entire Mishna was only taught to the people of Eretz Yisrael, and in accordance with their needs. For [the Talmud] challenges the statement of R. Asi in the name of R. Yohanan (Ta’anit 4b) that the law accords with R. Yehuda, who stated that the last person to pass before the ark [=lead the prayers] on the last day of Sukkot invokes [rain] based on R. Elazar’s statement that the law accords with Rabban Gamliel, who said that we petition for rain starting on the seventh of Marheshvan and that there is no gap between [when we begin] petitioning and [when we begin] invoking, as the Talmud concludes. The Talmud answers: “This is for us, and that is for them.” The Babylonians have produce in the field that they must bring into the house after Sukkot but before the rains begin. Therefore, they do not petition for rain until the seventh of Marheshvan. Alternatively [the Talmud answers]: “Both are for Eretz Yisrael. This refers to a time that the Temple stood, and that refers to a time that the Temple no longer stood.” Thus, we see that all of these times [for beginning to petition for rain] are accord with the needs of the locale and time.
The second practice is that they customarily stop invoking and petitioning for rain on the first day of Passover, whereas it is well known that in Germany the sustenance of the produce is primarily from the rains that fall between Passover and Shavuot. The Mishna (Ta’anit 2a), which states that we stop [invoking rain] in the first day of Passover, was taught to the people of Eretz Yisrael, as I have demonstrated, and for them, the barley harvest was on Passover, and the wheat as well was already standing and only needed to dry out and ripen by Shavu’ot. Thus, rain was an omen of curse for them. But in Germany, where the produce cannot survive without the rain between Passover and Shavuot, [rain] portends blessing for them. So why should we not invoke and petition for rain until Shavuot? The laws of repeating [the Amida] for reciting “morid ha-geshem” [=the invocation of rain] will apply to them after Shavuot, just as it applies to residents of Eretz Yisrael from Passover on; as I have demonstrated, each land invokes and petitions for rain according to its needs. For just as Eretz Yisrael and Babylon have different practices for invoking and petitioning for rain, each according to its needs, so too other lands. For what is the difference? Further proof can be adduced from this (Ta’anit 14b): “The people of Nineveh asked of Rabbi [Yehuda the Prince]: Are those like us, who require rain even in the summer season, considered as individuals, who recite [the petition for rain] in “Shome’a Tefila,” or as a public, who recite it in “Birkat Ha-shanim”?  He sent to them: You are like individuals, and [recite it] in “Shome’a Tefila.” They challenged [from a beraita]: “R. Yehuda said: When does this [cycle of fast days] apply? When the years are as ordained and Israel is settled on its soil. But nowadays, all depends on the year, and the locale, and the season.” You are challenging Rabbi based on a beraita? Rabbi is a tanna and disagrees!” Thus, we see that Rabbi only disagrees regarding the residents of a single city. However, regarding the land of Germany, which is very broad, Rabbi would agree that that they continue petitioning as long as they need rain, and since they petition out of need, they certainly invoke, for invoking also serves the petition. As R. Yohanan state: “As long as one petitions, one invokes.”
I discussed all of these matters before my masters in Germany, and no one challenged my words. Rather, they said: “We do not need to change the practice in Germany, because drought is uncommon there, and often the produce is ruined by excessive rain.”
When I left Germany and passed through Provence, I heard that in Provence they would invoke  the rains on the seventh of Marheshvan, and I deemed this to be quite correct. I said to the sages of Montpelier: “You have answered one of my questions; what do you do with regard to stopping [to invoke and petition for rain]?” They said that they practice in accordance with the Mishna: they stop on the first day of Passover. I said to them: “Is it possible that you do not require rain between Passover and Shavuot?” They told me that they require much rain, and that the produce cannot survive without rain. So I presented my words to them, as they are written above, and they found it to be quite correct, but they said: “That we petition [beginning] on the seventh of Marheshvan is because this was the practice instituted by the early sages. But with regard to stopping, we cannot do anything to change the practice unless we gather all the sages of the land.” I left there without knowing what they agreed to do.
And when I came here, I saw that we need rain between Passover and Shavuot even more than other places. Several times I told my colleagues that it would be proper not to stop invoking and petitioning until Shavuot. For now I know that in all the lands with which I am familiar, the main rains are between Passover and Shavuot, and certainly much of them. Yet I did not dare to speak these words to change the practice.
But now that I see that, because of our sins, the rains have stopped, and the plantings have been ruined, and we are fasting for rains, and even on Sabbaths and holidays, when we do not fast, we invoke the thirteen attributes and recite verses pertaining to rain, my heart has said to me: the time has now come to institute what I have wanted to do for many years, for they will certainly heed me during such a time of distress; and if this is prescribed for them during the present year, they will find it sweet, and they will not relent from it. They would certainly do so, but they tilted their hearts and changed back their minds. 
Regarding their protest against petitioning on the grounds that it portends curse—even in their opinion [rain] does not portend curse until the month of Nisan [=early spring] has ended, as the Mishna states (Ta’anit 12b): “If Nisan ended and rains fell, they portend curse.” Moreover, in the source for their words, have they not realized that it is derived from a verse (I Samuel 12:17): “Is it not the wheat harvest today? [I will call out to the Lord, and he will bring thunder and rain, and you will know and see that your wickedness before the Lord, in that you asked for a king, is excessive]”? And so which harvest is set for right now, that would mean that we do not need rain? Moreover, the Talmud  states on this [Mishna]: “R. Yose b. Avin said: this only applies if no rain had yet fallen, but if rain had previously fallen, the present rain portends blessing.”
Maimonides, of blessed memory, accords with me in his Commentary on the Mishna, which states: “Until when do we petition for rain? R. Yehuda says: until the end of Passover.” The tanna who taught this is not the tanna who taught the previous mishna. And we have already ruled above that the law accords with R. Yehoshua and Rabban Gamliel. This all applies only in Eretz Yisrael and lands whose climate is like its climate. And everything you see them saying about the timing of the fast days only applies in Eretz Yisrael and places with similar climes. But in other lands, the petitioning must be during the season that they require rain in that land, and that time shall be treated as though it is the seventh of Marheshvan. And if the rains are delayed beyond that time, the fast days should be practiced accordingly, for there are lands where the rains only begin in Nisan, and there are lands where Marheshvan is summer. Rains are not good during the sunny season—rather, they ruin and kill. So how can the people of that land petition for rain in Marheshvan? It is a complete lie! This reasoning is all true and appealing.” And in his composition [=Mishneh Torah] he wrote (Laws of Prayer 2:16-17): “From the seventh of Marheshvan, we petition for rain in Birkat Ha-shanim for as long as rain is invoked. What is this said about? Eretz Yisrael. But in Mesopotamia, Syria, Egypt, and places nearby and similar to them, we petition for rain from the sixtieth day of the autumn season. Places that require rain during the sunny season, such as distant islands, petition for rain when they need it, in Shome’a Tefila.”
Superficially, it seems that the Commentary on the Mishna contradicts what he wrote in his composition. In his commentary on the Mishna, he wrote: “But in other lands, the petitioning must be during the season that they require rain in that land, and that time shall be treated as though it is the seventh of Marheshvan.” Thus, we petition in Birkat Ha-shanim. But in his composition he wrote that islands petition for rain in Shome’a Tefila. Yet one who scrutinized his words will find them precise. In the commentary on the Mishna he wrote “lands”—since there is a difference between Eretz Yisrael and Babylon with regard to invoking and petitioning for rain, we can derive that they are not considered as a public,  but are one land, and they recite it during the season that they need to petition for rain, in Birkat Ha-shanim. But in his composition he wrote: “Places that require rain during the sunny season, such as distant islands.” These are not considered separate lands. Thus, they are considered individuals, and they recite it in Shome’a Tefila. It has thus been demonstrated and it is well known that in Germany, which is a large land, and France, and all the lands between Germany and this land, including this land, all require rain between Passover and Shavuot. And they are certainly a public and may petition for rain in Birkat Ha-shanim and invoke rains in the winter like residents of Eretz Yisrael.
But when I saw that they had swayed the heart of the community to not accept the words of the living God from me, I too retracted from petitioning and invoking rain in the synagogue I attend, even though I could have petitioned, and even though I am an individual, since it is a public need. Nevertheless, I did not want to create multiple factions. I would not have written on hol ha-mo’ed, as I am unaccustomed to it, but it is the need of the hour, due to the desecration of God’s name, and it is also, in a small sense, a need of the festival.

You have asked: A widow was wealthy, and for that reason, Reuven engaged her for marriage. At the time of the engagement, he promised her 25,000 gold coins in a note and swore that he would not marry another woman in addition to her. The promissory note was deposited with a third party with instructions that if he violates his oath, she would be given the note. He then married her, and committed an additional 25,000 in a note as the dower. The woman was old, and had reached menopause before marrying Reuven. Yet Reuven married her, for her money. After the wedding, she gave him nothing. He remained with her for five years during which she gave him nothing. On the contrary, it was discovered that she gave everything to her son.
Now Reuven wishes to marry someone else, to engage in procreation. He says that he had sisters and had no way to marry them off; he married this woman so he would have money to marry off his sisters. Since she gave him nothing, he no longer wants to neglect procreation.
Response: This man married this woman knowing that she could no longer have children, but was very wealth. He married her for money and swore that he would not marry a second wife. He did not make the oath conditional. Rather, he swore straightforwardly. What wise man would attend to him, releasing him from his oath, when he swore to allay the woman’s thoughts, so she would marry him? No wise man would release him. As it is stated (Nedarim 65b): “You vowed in Midian? Go release your vow in Midian.” 
As to his desire to marry a second wife in order to procreate: He should not violate an oath, which is so severe that the entire world shook at the statement “[the Lord will not] leave him unpunished” (Shemot 20:7; Shevu’ot 39a), for the sake of the mitzva of procreation. Had she given him money like he wanted, he would not have been concerned about the mitzva of procreation. Therefore, I do not think his oath should be released at all. 
The words of the writer, Asher b. R. Yehiel.

Our teacher, may you live long, knows that a terrible event happened here in Cordoba. The ears of anyone who hears of it will ring. That is, that a scoundrel of all scoundrels was imprisoned due to a claim that gentiles brought against him. He reached a compromise with them using his own money, and several of his acquaintances went to comfort him. He came out to the entrance of his yard, and they spoke to his heart about these matters. One of them said: “Blessed is He Who releases the bound”; but with all of this, the man cursed and blasphemed against his king and his God, turning heavenward.
Upon hearing of this, the judges and prominent members of the community gathered together and agreed to visit judgment upon him. They sent forth to arrest him, but he was not to be found. They attempted to collect testimony without him present—for he had fled—but they only found a single witness. The others disappeared or suppressed their testimony. 
Now, here in this city is the honorable and exalted R. Yehuda b. Yitzhak ibn-Wakar,  and he was seized by a great zeal for God, and he made efforts regarding this matter until that nasty man was delivered into his hand. He arrested him by the power of the monarch, and they incarcerated him in jail. His (=ibn-Wakar’s) hand also prevailed upon the delinquent witnesses, and he forced them, made them swear, and properly collected their testimony about this blasphemy.
Although the blasphemy was in Arabic, since this scoundrel is illiterate and does not know the holy language (=Hebrew), the opinion of this notable was in agreement with that of the judges and prominent community members that it should be considered blasphemy by this loathsome individual, since the Arabic noun constitutes blasphemy just as much as the noun in the holy tongue would for those familiar with it, and also in order to create a safeguard on this matter that will not be breached by wicked simpletons casting insults toward the One above.
This man has long been a tough evildoer. There is no one in the city who speaks positively of him, and he has violent horsemen  propping him up. 
About ten of the prominent community members, men of action, together with the honorable R. Yehuda, as well as local scholars and city elders, agreed to punish him. 
When the aforementioned met to reach an agreement, relatives of the wicked man went and paid cash bribes, it seems, and petitioned the great nobleman, Don Juan Manuel, who we have accepted in this locale as the proxy of his majesty the king, to stay his sentence. Thus, he sent word to us with one of his horsemen that the verdict has not been sealed until we ask his opinion.
The honorably R. Yehuda lobbied as best he could, and obtained the nobleman’s concession that he would not remove our way of meting out justice in favor of the gentiles’. This prince agreed that this wicked man should remain incarcerated until we receive your response, instructing us what to do.
Now, praised be God, we place our hope in you, our teacher, to be zealous for God. Send word back quickly, before the prince changes his mind, leaving us to lay in our shame and be enveloped by our humiliation. Send us his verdict with explanations and proofs, instructing us what and how to carry it out. Additionally, kindly praise and support the work of the honorable R. Yehuda, for all of his efforts in this matter and his future efforts. May the Almighty be at your aid, my master, and give you a good, long, and pleasant life.
This is the transcription of the testimonies that were taken in Arabic, before a rabbinical court of three, from those who took the testimony in other rabbinical courts, on Sunday, the sixteenth of Adar, 1358 (sic) according to the count of the gentiles known as al-Safar. 
Rabbi Avraham b. Rabbi Yitzhak b. Natan, known in al-Shams,  that during the first five days of November, enumerated above, this witness went with Rabbi Avraham ibn Alzwami to Rabbi Yaakov b. Rabbi Yosef Safaya, to the courtyard of Avraham b. Yaakov Safaya. This Avraham Safaya came out to the door of the courtyard. They greeted him, and they discussed among themselves the imprisonment of said Avraham Safaya. The said witness said to him: “Blessed is He Who releases the bound.” To this Avraham said: “He should be blessed with his name.” He uttered this “blessing” in the manner that the Sages described blasphemy. The word that Avraham Safaya stated in this blasphemy was, in Arabic: “May Allah bless so-and-so!” The “so-and-so” he uttered was God’s name, which ought not be mentioned in this matter. The said witness responded: “Blessed be the true Judge!  What are you saying?” Avraham Safaya replied: “Had I not prayed to him, this would not have happened to me.” On this day, Rabbi Avraham, son of the late Rabbi Yitzhak ibn Alzwami,  gave the body of the aforementioned testimony, which R. Avraham b, Natan testified, before Rabbi Yaakov b. Rabbi Yosef Safaya; however, it was not verified by them that said Avraham Safaya mentioned His name during his blasphemy.
Response: My you bear much peace, you sweet and innocent, you charming and honorable people! You have astonished me by asking me about capital punishment, for in all lands of which I have heard, except here in Spain, we do not judge capital cases. When I arrived here, I was quite amazed that the courts judge capital cases without a Sanhedrin. I was informed that it is with royal license. Moreover, the assembly [of judges] issues verdicts to save lives, for how much more blood would be spilled if these were judged by the Arabs? I left them to their customary practice, but I never agreed with them about the taking of lives. 
Yet I see that you all consent to eliminating this evil from your midst. He has certainly desecrated God’s name publicly, and it has been heard by the Ishmaelites, who are very harsh against those who speak against their religion and their faith. This desecration will be exacerbated if we do not take lawful action/vengeance  against him, as a safeguard. It is also proper to sanctify God’s name by punishing this wicked man. We find that to sanctify God’s name, they struck at princes for the sake of tagalong proselytes, even hanging their corpses (see 2 Samuel 21:1-9). Similarly, to create a safeguard, they stoned [to death] someone who rode a horse on Shabbat. So too, it is proper to sanctify God’s name by eliminating this wicked man. 
Do to him as you see fit. Had I been present at your meeting, I would have been inclined to the view that his tongue should be pulled from his mouth and most of it, the part necessary for speech, cut off. His lips would thus be muted. In this way, the punishment meted out would fit his deed. This is the well-known sort of justice that we see with our own eyes each day. Yet do with him as you fit per this matter. I know that your intention is for God’s name to be sanctified. May God’s will succeed by your hand.
Asher b. R. Yehiel of blessed memory

Siman 1

A woman that gives her husband the rights to collect after her death half of the inheritance to her children, according to Takanat Toledo is this a valid condition or not? And following is the text of the Takana. If the wife dies before the husband, and she has living children from him, boys or girls. And the meaning of living is that they were alive during their mother's life and after her passing for at least 30 complete days. Then all her what remains of her dowry, clothes or land, the husband splits them evenly with her children. And if there are no living children then half her assets go to the husband, and the other half to her heirs. As if the husband died before her. This applies to both land and chattels. 
Answer. It seems from the text of the Takana, that they intended that assets left by the wife to her family is not diverted towards the husband. That is why they stipulated that half of the inheritance remain for her family. And they removed half the inheritance from the husband, who according to the Torah was to receive all her assets, and gave it to her heirs, after the death of the wife. But while the wife was still living, they did not limit half her assets to give to whomever she wished, for this was not inferred at all from the Takana. Their intent was not to prevent her from spending her money, but only to make sure that the inheritance remains accessible to her inheritors. It is better that her inheritance does not go entirely to the husband. Instead, when the time comes for the husband to inherit the wife, the Takana removes half the inheritance to be given to her heirs. And if the wife had the power to leave it to whomever she wished than there would be no purpose in the Takana. For the husband would always be asking his wife for leaving him her assets. And because “a person does not reside in a basket, i.e., in close quarters, with a snake” she would favour him more than any of her relatives. And this is also apparent from the text in the Takana which refers to diverting from the husband half of the assets which he is entitled to by law, according to the inheritance priorities. The Takana treats the case as if he would have died before her, and so we pretend that for this case the husband died before her and the heirs need to be protected (just as when he dies first the heirs receive at least half the assets, also in our case when the wife dies first the heirs receive at least half the assets). But while the wife is still alive, they did not limit the power of the husband at all, thus she is unable to sell or gifts her assets while the husband is alive. The Takana was very specific, to be applied only in the way they decreed without change for they wrote that if she has children from him, girls or boys, that they should inherit half her assets, but her children from another man have no claim to those assets. Thus, the inheritance does not come from her power at all, to bequeath assets to her heirs, only as stated in the Takana. They removed the inheritance from the husband, who is entitled to inherit his wife’s assets after her death, and gave it to those who they believed needed it more. But while she is alive, they did not enhance her rights at all, for if she wished to distribute half her assets to her children, whether they are the children of her current marriage or an earlier marriage, she could not do so. For if she had the power to do so, she would always give the assets to the children from the earlier marriage, who would remain orphaned from their mother and father (assuming her earlier husband died) which would defeat the purpose of the Takana to divert the inheritance that would have gone to the husband, to his children, and not to her children. She certainly does not have the power to change the Takana in any way, for they have granted the assets to whom they wished to merit. They also diverted assets from her heirs, and gave them to their mother when she has no rights to inherit when the assets cam from her power (associated with the Kethuba). Therefore, all Takanot need to be kept as they were setup without any changes.

All the customs for which the Sages said that one should follow the custom, that is for a custom made to prevent a transgression such as the one in Pesachim 50: a place in which it is customary to do work on the eve of Passover until noon one does work, and if not to do work one does not. For according to the Torah it is forbidden to do work from noon onwards, for it is the beginning of the time to slaughter the Passover sacrifice. And there are places where they distanced and refrained from work the entire day, and the custom should not be changed. And likewise, the Mishnah (Pesachim 53): in places with a custom to sell small animals to non-Jews one sells, places with a custom not to sell one does not; in places with a custom to eat roasted meat on Passover eve one eats, in places with a custom not to eat one does not; in places with a custom to light candles Yom Kippur eve one lights, in places with a custom not to light one does not; in places with a custom (Pesachim 54) to work on the 9th of Av one works, in places with a custom not to work one does not.  And it says in Pesachim 50 As the mishna discusses the requirement to observe local customs, the Gemara relates: The residents of Beit She’an were accustomed not to travel from Tyre to market day in Sidon on Shabbat eve. Their children came before Rabbi Yoḥanan. They said to him: Due to their wealth, it was possible for our fathers however, it is not possible for us to do so. He said to them: Your fathers already accepted this virtuous custom upon themselves, and it remains in effect for you, as it is stated: “My son, hear your father’s rebuke and do not abandon your mother’s teaching” (Proverbs 1:8). All these customs are to distance from Torah transgressions. And the Sages said not to change them. But if there is a custom in a place to transgress, it should be changed even if great rabbis follow the custom, for a court cannot remove a biblical law, even the Sanhedrin in Jerusalem has no such right, except to withhold action but not to perform actions. Even a prophet is not heeded, unless he is established as Elijah on the Carmel, who was obeyed to offer sacrifices outside the temple on a special occasion. And not only should one change a custom to transgress, but also a custom to distance from transgression bit which may result in transgressions should be changed. As it is said in Perek Makom Shenahagu (Pesachim 50b):  The residents of the city of Ḥozai were accustomed to separate hallah from rice dough. They came and told Rav Yosef about this custom. He said to them: Let a non-priest eat this dough in their presence to show them unequivocally that this custom has no legal basis. For we are concerned that they will end up mixing up what is permitted with what is forbidden. For from this custom they will think that rice is a type of grain. This is also in the Yerushalmi: If you become unsure of the Halakha do the customary, meaning that if there is a loosening in the Halakha, you become unsure of what the Halakha is, and you see the customary actions of others, then follow their customs. For you can rely for the great rabbis to lead others to follow the Halakha. But if you are sure of knowing the Halakha you have no right to follow the custom that contradicts the Halakha. This is the ruling for customs related to what is permitted and forbidden. In financial matters the courts have the power to make financial regulations according to the times and needs. Even to transgress a Torah law and to transfer assets from one to another, per the Baraita in the first Perek of Baba Batra 8a:  Similarly, it is permitted for the residents of the city to set the measures, the prices and the wages, and to fine people for violating their specifications. And it is said in Yevamot Perek Ha'Isha Raba (89): As Rabbi Yitzhak said: From where is it derived that property declared ownerless by the court is ownerless? As it is stated: “And whoever does not come within three days, according to the council of the princes and the Elders, all his property should be forfeited...” (Ezra 10:8). Rabbi Elazar says that the proof is from here: “These are the inheritances that Elazar the priest, and Joshua, son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers’ houses of the tribes...” (Joshua 19:51). What do heads have to do with fathers? This comes to tell you: Just as fathers bequeath to their sons anything they want to, so too, the heads bequeath to the people anything they want to. And all this by making regulations that declare one person's assets ownerless and give it to another. But according to a custom I do not know how they take money from one to another. Understandably with transgressions the custom spreads so that everyone in one place considers the same act a transgression. Even if in other places it is permitted, such as a certain fat that is eaten in Israel but not in Babel. Also working on Passover eve and Av 9th and others. But in finance when the early Sages introduced a marital custom for which there is no source nor hint to allow the wife to bequeath her assets to whom she wishes. And later generations continued this custom to allow the wife to bequeath to whom she wishes. And the scribes wrote and the witnesses signed, even though this is certainly a mistake. And even if there was a judge in the generation who permitted what was written, and through this,  the custom is spread and perpetuated. This is not a custom on which one may rely to take assets from one to another.  For one may only transfer assets by a court order. Certainly if the judge based his ruling on the early Sages we would listen. But I have seen that judges rule to begin with that the wife has the right to bequeath to whom she wishes, without relying on the earlier ruling, but believe this is the halakha.  And it is not permitted to transfer assets, it can only be declared ownerless by the court. Also heard of a judge who ruled in agreement to an earlier judge, but was not able to justify his ruling; he just considered it the custom since he followed the earlier judge. And I said this is not appropriate. Even if judges repeated the same judgment generation after generation based on the first ruling, it is a mistaken custom, and it has to be abolished. For it allows a Torah transgression to move assets away from the rightful heir, other than allowing the court to declare assets ownerless. Also when Sages setup a regulation they obligated others to follow it, without additions nor detractions. And if later Sages wish to add to or detract from the regulation they need to first abolish the first regulation and then to institute a new one as they wish. And as long as they did not do so, there is no power in a custom to abolish a regulation. Asher ben HaRav Yechiel.
