In response: The claims that a woman may make to get divorced from her husband are many, and the law is not the same in all of them, but rather each one has its own laws. You also did not clarify in your letter which claim Leah is making to get divorced. And if we were to come to write to you all of the things through which a woman comes to get divorced from her husband and to write the laws of each one, the matter would be very, very long, and we would need to write a book about them. As there are ten or eleven ways, or more, and we do not know with which one of them this Leah was coming. Nevertheless, based on what is most apparent from the question, also because it is the most common of the ways, it is that she is repulsed by him. So she is coming to divorce [him] due to the repulsion. And since that is what we think brought her to this, we are writing to you the law of a rebellious wife and one that says he is repulsive to me. But before anything, we should say that the law of the Talmud is that, even about one who says he is repulsive to me, we do not force the husband to send her out against his will, but rather with his consent: If he wants, he sends her out; but if he doesn't want, he doesn't send her out. It is like that which they said in the beginning of the chapter [entitled] HaNizkin (Gittin 48b) "Just as when a man divorces his wife, the rabbis instituted a marriage contract for her from him, so too, when she leaves him they should similarly institute a marriage contract for him from her." Then we say [in response], "A woman is sent out with her consent or without her consent, but a man sends out [his wife] only with his consent. It is [thereby] possible for the husband to keep her waiting for a <i>get</i> [bill of divorce]." Hence we never force him to send her out. Because if it were [the case], how would he be able to delay? She will say he is repulsive to me, and he will [be forced to] send her out! And if it would be possible for her to [definitively] get divorced in any way, they would have instituted a wedding contract from her. Moreover, there are many proofs of this from the Gemara and from the Yerushalmi. However, this is not the place to write at length. And it is not like the rabbi, Rabbi Moshe (Rambam, Mishneh Torah, Laws of Marriage 14:8) wrote [regarding the husband of] one who says I am repulsed by him, "We force him to send her out, so that she not be like a captive, [to be forced] to engage in relations with one she loathes." Yet his words in this place are not correct at all. Also, that which you will find in the Halakhot of Rabbi Alfasi, may his memory be blessed, that the Geonim, may their memories be a blessing for life in the world to come, decreed to [facilitate a divorce] with a <i>get</i> [for] anyone who makes a claim to get divorced — we have not seen anyone perform such an act in these generations. So their decree did not spread in most places. And even [with] them, perhaps they only decreed [it] for their generation for a temporary need; but now we are not lenient about the matter. And so did Rambam, may his memory be blessed, write and some of the later rabbis. However [only] if the husband wants to divorce, he divorces. And the one who says he is repulsive to me [and is thereby able nevertheless to initiate a divorce process] that is stated in the Gemara, is when she makes a claim to get divorced and says he is repulsive to me when she makes a claim to get divorced and says he is repulsive to me and I don't want him or [the money promised to me in] my wedding contract, but [just] that he should give me my <i>get</i> and I will go away. That is [the case] about which we say she is certainly coming from the claim of repulsion and is under duress, since [her] heart compels [it]. And she did not say it because she put her eyes on someone else. For if she had put her eyes on someone else, she would have made the claim to get divorced and to receive [the money of] her wedding contract. And likewise did Rashi, may his memory be blessed, explain there in Ketuvot (63b) concerning that which they said, "How is [the case] of a rebellious woman? Ameimar said, 'When she says, "I want to be married to him, but I want to cause him anguish." However, if she said, "I am repulsed by him," we do not compel her.'" So Rashi, may his memory be blessed, explained there, "How is [the case] of a rebellious woman, in which we force her and reduce [the value of] her wedding contract? When she says, 'I want to be married to him, but I want to cause him anguish,' that is when we force her and reduce her marriage contract. But if she says, 'He is repulsive to me; I do not want him or his wedding contract,' then we do not need it, and we do not force her." And this is the law when she says this, we do not force her, to embarrass her and make an announcement about her in the synagogues and the study halls. And we do not reduce her marriage contract little by little or after the four weeks of announcements in the way that we do to a rebellious women who says I want to be married to him, but I want to cause him anguish. Rather we delay her twelve months, perhaps she will recant. And it is like we say in the Gemara in the chapter [entitled] Af Al Pi, "And we delay her <i>get</i> twelve months. And if she recants within twelve months, she does not lose her marriage contract at all, as [she] was under duress. And there is no concern here [that] maybe she put her eyes on someone else, as we said, since she wants to go away without the wedding contract. And during these twelve months, she does not receive sustenance from her husband since she does not want him. And it is like it is written in the Yerushalmi, "The rebellious woman and the one who leaves on account of a bad name do not get sustenance nor worn fabric." And even Rabbi Alfasi, may his memory be blessed, wrote in his Halakhot, "And in these twelve months of the year, she does not get sustenance from her husband. But if the husband wants to divorce within these twelve months, she does not lose anything from her wedding contract. For since she is not divorced by the decree of the sages the entire twelve months and this one divorced [her] during this time on his own volition, behold this one is like other men who divorce on their own volition that give the marriage contract [to their wives]." And so did Rabbenu Channanel, may his memory be blessed, write — that if he wants to divorce during this time and to take the wedding contract, we don't listen to him. However, if he waited until after the twelve months and divorced her, she loses the main part of the marriage contract and the addition. But we do not extract the worn fabric of the dowry that she brought in and still exists, if she grabbed them, even if it was in front of witnesses. Yet, a priori, we do not extract them from him and give them to her, since it is a disagreement in the Gemara. And there (Ketuvot 64a:1) we say, "Since it was not stated like this master nor like that master, if she seized it, we do not take it away from her, but if she did not seize it, we do not give it to her." However, she does not lose her fully retained property at all but rather extracts [from him] all that she has of them. And even if they are in the possession of the husband, we extract them from him and give them to her. As behold, even a rebellious woman who says I want him but I want to cause him distress and who is rebelling more from evil-heartedness and not from duress, does not lose her fully retained property, as it is shown in the mishnah in the chapter [entitled] Af Al Pi, like the rabbis [who argue with] Rabbi Yose; all the more so this one, who is under duress, as her heart put under duress. However if the husband wrote down and gave her a separate present from his [property], it appears that she does not lose any of it. For we learned, if he wants to add, he may add even ten thousand [dinars]. And they said about it in the Gemara, "This means that the stipulation of the wedding contract is like the contract — what comes out of it? [The difference involved with a] rebellious woman." But if it were [the case that she must forfeit gifts], what difference is there that it is because a stipulation of the contract is like the contract? It would be no different than property that he gave her after he married her; behold, she loses them even though they are not like stipulations of a wedding contract! Rather it is implied that that she does not lose them, even an intentionally rebellious woman, and all the more so this one who is as if under duress. However, from a responsum of the Geonim, may their memory be blessed, it appears that she loses all that he wrote down and gave to her, since he did not give it to her with the intention [that she would] take [them] and leave. This is is the law of the one who says he is repulsive to me and I do not want him or his marriage contract. But [regarding] one who says he is repulsive to me and I want to be divorced and to take my wedding contract, we are concerned about her, that maybe she put her eyes on someone else. And if she is rebellious in this way from sexual intercourse, we assign her the law of a rebellious woman who says I want to cause him distress. And this is the law: We send [a message] to her from the court and say to her, "Be aware that if you remain rebellious — even if your marriage contract is worth ten thousand [dinars], you will lose it." If she retracts, it is good; but if she does not, we make announcements about her in the synagogues and study halls of the city on Shabbat day at the time when the people are assembled. We say, "Be aware that x is rebellious to her husband," in order to embarrass her. If she retracts, it is good; but if not, he divorces her, and she loses all of her wedding contract and her dowry. And it is as it is written (Ketubot 63b), "The rabbis went back and were counted again and taught, 'We make announcements about her four consecutive Shabbatot, and we send [messengers] from the court: Be aware that even if your marriage contract is worth ten thousand dinars, you will lose it.' Rami bar Ḥama said, 'The court sends people to talk with her twice, once before the announcement and once after the announcement.'" And when she leaves [the marriage], she does not get the main part of the marriage contract, the addition, or the dowry. Nor does she even keep the worn fabric that still exists from conditionally retained property, And this is as it is written (Ketubot 63a:4), "Until when does he reduce her marriage contract? Until the reductions are equivalent to her marriage contract." And everything is included in the marriage contract [regarding this], whether the main part of the wedding agreement or the addition or the dowry, and even if she brought in land. And even if she grabbed it, we extract it from her and, all the more so, if he wrote her [gifts] from that which is his. And even if he wrote down a gift to her after the marriage, he did not give it to her to take and leave. And so did Rabbenu Chai and Rabbi Alfasi, may their memory be blessed, write. However she does not lose any of her fully retained property and she keeps the worn fabric of her fully retained property. And even [regarding] her fully retained property that is in her husband's possession, we extract it from him and give it to her. This is the law that appears [correct] to us concerning one who makes a claim to get divorced and to take the wedding contract because she doesn't want to live with her husband.
