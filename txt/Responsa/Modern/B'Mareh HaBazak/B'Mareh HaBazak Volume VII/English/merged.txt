<b>Question:</b> Can a wheelchair-bound man be a prayer leader for the community? Can he go up to [publicly recite blessings over the reading of] the Torah?
<b>Answer:</b> A wheelchair-bound man may serve as the prayer leader and go up to the Torah. His integration into the life of the community in all of its aspects is the Torah way, not like the decision of one of the latter decisors of our day.

Looking at works the creation of which is connected to a prohibition of idolatry - even though it is forbidden to create certain forms (the form of a person or the four animals of the Chariot in sculpture or relief; and the form of the sun, the moon and the stars even when drawn)<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Shulchan Arukh (Yoreh Deah 141:4). The source for this is in the Gemara (Rosh Hashanah 24b; Avodah Zarah 42b; and Avodah Zarah 43b). This prohibition is from the Torah and is learned out (in the Gemara there) from the verses: "You must not make for yourself any carved image, or picture of anything that is in the heaven above, or on the earth below or in the water below the earth" (Exodus 20:4); and "Do not make with Me, gods of silver or gods of gold" (Exodus 20:20).</i> and it is likewise forbidden to keep such forms at home,<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Shulchan Arukh (ibid.), according to the Gemara in the sections mentioned above. And the reason is because of "suspicion." And see further in Responsa 61 and 62.</i> nevertheless there is no prohibition to look at such forms if they were not made for the sake of idolatry.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Rema (on ibid.): However he finds them, they are permissible. The meaning of "he finds them," in this context is such that it is in a way that there is no concern that these forms were created for the purpose of idolatry. For otherwise it would be forbidden to benefit from them. The Schach (note 24) clarifies: Permissible - the meaning is they are permissible for benefit, so long as he does not hold on to them... and so is it shown in the Tur, that even though it is forbidden to hold on to them, they are permissible for benefit.</i> There are those that ab initio permit the holding of such works in a public space.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Rema (ibid.), according to the Gemara mentioned above in Rosh Hashanah and in Avodah Zarah (43b).</i>
