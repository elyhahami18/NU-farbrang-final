<b>The first question:</b> Behold, we find that before doing any commandment or prayer, they established the saying of, "For the Holy One, blessed be He, etc." But what are we supposed to have in mind in our thoughts when we say, the Holy One, blessed be He, and His divine presence [<i>shekhinah</i>]? Also in the prayer book, we find many supplications that we pray and request from the divine presence. So we want to know the meaning of the divine presence that we mention with our mouths in our supplications. And there are also many statements about the divine presence in the words of our rabbis, may their memory be blessed; and there are especially many in the Zohar and the Tikkunim [Tikkunei Zohar]. And we learn these things, yet we do not know what we are saying.
<b>The second question:</b> Explain to us the matter of the coupling found in the upper realms. Also, what is the notion of the male and female descriptions mentioned about the supernal ones?
<b>The third question:</b> Explain the matter of Tikkun Chatzot [mystical midnight prayers], which are called the Repair of Rachel and the Repair of Leah. Who are we referring to with these names?





























And about the third question regarding the Rectification of Rachel and the Rectification of Leah [groups of supplications known as Tikkun Rachel and Tikkun Leah] — you should know that I have already informed you above about the supernal Kinghood [<i>Malkhut</i>], which is hinted to in the last letter, <i>hey</i>, in [God's] existential name, that it has several appellations and descriptions. And among its names and appellations is also one called by the name, Rachel; and part of it called by the name, Leah. But it is not possible to explain the details of this matter to you. However you should know this, that these names of Rachel and Leah are descriptions and names of the supernal Kinghood, which is also called by the name, Divine Presence [<i>Shekhinah</i>], as mentioned above. And you should know that our mothers, Leah and Rachel, who were the wives of our father, Jacob and Israel, were called by these names based on these supernal names by which the supernal Kinghood is called, because their souls were each a great part of the supernal Kinghood that is called Leah, and the portion called Rachel. And that is why they were also called by these names. And this is enough for one who understands. 
But since the Jewish people sin and cause a defect with their iniquities in the sefirot of the supernal Kinghood, which is called <i>Shekhinah</i> as mentioned above, in its portion called Rachel and its portion called Leah; and they likewise make a rectification and an increase in the light there when they merit through Torah [study] and [fulfillment of] the commandments — hence the arrangement of this Midnight Rectification [Tikkun Chatzot], which is Tikkun Rachel, was established, in order to rectify the portion of Kinghood, which is called by the name, Rachel. And Tikkun Leah is in order to rectify the portion which is called by the name, Leah. And there are profound reasons for this, but it is not appropriate to explain them now. So I will not expand more than this about these things. But you should do [it] according to the opinion of Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai, peace be upon him, and our teacher ARI, may his memory be blessed, who arranged these rectifications based on reasons revealed to them. And you can already understand and know the simple aspect of the matter from the thing that I have written to you, what place you are rectifying. And that is enough for someone like you.

Question: Reuven had a scribe write for him a pair of Tefilin, and he wished to be pious and write with his own hand, the first and last letter of the portion of “Kadesh”, the way those who are pious have the custom of writing the last word with their own hand, however he is not a professional scribe, and he therefore held the quill in his hand, and the scribe held on to his hand, and wrote the first and last letter of the portion of “Kadesh”, however alas, Reuven held the quill in his left hand, while sitting on the right side of the scribe, and the scribe  with his right  hand held on to Reuven’s left hand, which was holding the quill. So we were debating regarding its validity, being that the Shulchan Aruch (Orach Chaim 32:5) rules that if Tefilin is written with one’s left hand, it is considered to be invalid. So in this case, although the scribe held on to Reuven’s hand with his right hand, nevertheless, if we consider Reuven to be the actual writer, then it would be invalid, so would you please inform us of the correct answer?
Answer: I have found it written in the Rambam (Laws of Shabbat 11:14), where he rules that in a case where a child held on to the pen, and an adult held on to the child’s hand, and wrote on Shabbat - the adult would be liable, and if it was vice versa then he would be exempt.
So it comes out from the above mentioned ruling, that the one who moves the hand of the one holding the pen, is considered to be the actual writer, and the same would apply in our case regarding the scribe, who held on to Reuven’s hand with is right hand - he is considered to be the actual writer. And although it is unlikely that Reuven providedany assistance at all, we nevertheless rule that assistance is not considered to be of any significance. And one cannot argue that the Rambam’s ruling regarding Shabbat is not for certain, and he is merely being stringent, in order to be on the safe side, because if that were true, then we would not be able to hold him liable, and punish him out of doubt, and even to require him to bring a sacrifice would not be possible, being that it is forbidden to bring into the Holy Temple an animal that was consecrated based on a doubt.
And I have seen it written in the “Simlah Chadashah”, that in a case where one who is qualified to slaughter holds on to the knife, and someone who is not qualified holds on to his hand, and slaughters with it, it would be considered invalid, and if it was vice versa, then it would appear to me that it would be considered invalid because of uncertainty as to whether it was slaughtered by the one who was not qualified as well, unless it is known for certain that the one who was qualified was not able to prevent the one who was not qualified  from slaughtering, and the one who was not qualified was unable to prevent the one who was qualified,  and even in such a case, one should not be lenient, unless being stringent would bring about a great loss.

 There was a story with the one [person] who was the leader and did not pray the afternoon prayer until close to the end of its time [i.e. the allotted time for the prayer], and he measured in his mind that if he will pray now the afternoon prayer he will not be able to finish it entirely in its time, because certainly when he will reach the middle of his prayer of the Amida its time will be [already be] finished, and he will need to finish the prayer after its time, and the questioner was unsure if it is permitted for him to pray in this situation, even though he knows that he will have to finish the prayer after the time, or maybe since he is not able to pray all of the prayer in its time he should not pray now, but if he was forced [to miss the prayer] he should wait to pray the evening prayer twice after it is certainly dark, and if he was intentional [in missing the prayer]  indeed he would lose the prayer. And this doubt that the questioner asked, behold one time with myself there was an event, that I measured in the middle of the Amida [of the afternoon prayer] that the entire time of bein hashmashot [the time of  which we are unsure whether it is day or night] will certainly pass, and I said to look [in]to this [matter], with the help of Heaven.
Response: I have actually seen this question mentioned in the book “Batei Knesiot”, where he writes that one might wish to bring proof from the fact that it is brought down that if one does not have enough time to pray the entire “Amidah”, that he should pray the shortened version called “Havineinu”, from which it seems that one is not allowed to begin praying, in a case that he will not be able to finish on time. However, in truth, one could not bring proof from that ruling, being that there are times - such as the night following Shabbat, and the winter months - that one cannot pray the shortened version.

Question: One who has one of his hands wrapped in a cast, and is not able to come in contact with water at all, and he can only eat with his other hand, and the questioner wishes to know how to go about the blessing upon washing his hand, whether he should say “who commanded us to wash hands” or perhaps rather “to wash the hand”, being that he is only washing one hand?...
Response: one might think to bring proof from the blessing recited upon kindling the lights of Chanukah, upon which one recites: “to ignite the candle of Chanukah” even when lighting multiple candles. However, in truth one cannot bring proof from there, being that the actual obligation is only to light one candle, and the rest comes in addition to the main commandment.
However, we find in the Shulchan Aruch (Yoreh Dei’ah 120:3), that upon immersing a single utensil, one should recite “to immerse the vessel”, and if he is immersing two utensils or more, then he should say “to immerse the vessels”. Now the Pri Chadash (S”K 11) writes that if one accidentally said “to immerse the  vessel” upon immersing multiple utensils, or if he said “to immerse the vessels” upon immersing a single utensil, he would not need to recite another blessing. Now there are those among the latter commentaries who quote the Pri chadash,  but the “Keneset Hagedolah writes that this is not essential, but rather merely good advice, and it can also be, that the Shulchan Aruch is not saying that one should not say “to immerse the vessels” upon immersing a single vessel, but rather when one immerses multiple vessels, he should not say “to immerse the vessel” in the singular.
Either way, it would come out that according to the “Keneset Hagedolah” one would be allowed to recite “to wash the hand” in the singular, and according to the Pri Chadash, he would seemingly need to say “to wash the hand” - not “the hands” - being that he is only washing one hand, just as they rule with regards to immersing utensils, or so it would appear.
However, after further pondering, it would appear that there is a difference between the two cases, because with regards to the immersion of utensils, the rule applies to each utensil individually, being that one is not obligated to immerse two or more together, and that is why when one recites the blessing, he should say “to immerse the utensil” in the singular,  but with regards to hand-washing, one must say that the rule was made for both hands, being that one cannot suffice with washing only one hand, only in this case he has no choice but to wash only one hand, and must therefore recite “to wash the hands” in the plural, being that the rule was originally established to recite as such, being that the sages established the rule of washing for both hands.

<b>Question:</b> I have been asked by the precious sage, Meir Tzelah, May the Compassionate One guard him and show him grace, in the city of Bombay: We find a carriage that we call a 'Garry,' that has two wheels affixed to it; but they are not drawn by beasts, nor by people - rather it travel by virtue of a person that sits on it and pushes the wheels with his legs. So we wanted to know if it is permissible to ride on this Garry on Shabbat and Yom Tov, or not. May the teacher instruct us and his reward from the heavens will be doubled.
<b>Answer:</b> Our teacher (Rabbi Yosef Karo), of blessed memory, ruled in the Shulkhan Arukh, (Orach Chaim, 522:2) in Hilkhot Yom Tov, "We do not transport [someone] on a chair, whether a man or a woman; but it is permissible for a man who is needed by the many" - see there. And the reason that it is forbidden is because of ‘denigrating the holiday,’ since it looks like weekday activities. And behold, this ruling is mentioned in Beitzah 25 regarding holidays; and the Rif, the Rambam and the Rosh bring it down in the laws of holidays. But the Tur also brought it in the laws of Shabbat (Tur, Orach Chaim 301); and our teacher wrote in Beit Yosef on the Tur: It is implied from his words that it is even permissible to transport him to the public domain, when he is needed by the many. But the Rif, the Rosh and the Rambam did not mention this ruling regarding Shabbat, because they reason it is specifically on holidays - when we only forbid transporting in this way by Rabbinic law, because of 'denigrating the holiday' - that the Rabbis did not decree [regarding a case] when one is needed by the many. But on Shabbat [transporting someone on a chair] to the public domain would certainly be forbidden; and even to a <i>karmelit</i> is it forbidden on account of the public domain, since we have established [the law] to be like Rabbah, etc. And it is possible that it appeared to him that since we we have established [the law] in Shabbat 94 to be that a living being carries itself, it is only forbidden to take a person out [to the public domain] according to Rabbinic law. So in a situation in which he is needed by the many, they did not decree [this Rabbinic prohibition]. To here are his [words] - see there. And we should not ask about these words of our teacher, "Let it be, that because of the reason that a live being carries itself, it is only forbidden to transport a person according to Rabbinic law; nevertheless, are they not also carrying the chair in the public domain?" For this is not a question! As it is well known that a chair is auxiliary to the person, so we are not liable for it. And it is like they said (Mishnah Shabbat 10:5), "A living person in a bed, the bed is auxiliary to thim." And the Savant, the [author of] the Drisha (Rabbi Yehoshuah Falk) answered this observation of our teacher, may his memory be blessed - that the Tur is speaking about when we transport him to an alleyway that has an eruv in it. So there is not prohibition of carrying out; and they only touched upon it because of [the prohibition of] weekday activities. And the Savant, [the author of] the Magen Avraham 301:27 also answered like this - that the Tur is speaking about a place that has an eruv, such that there is no prohibition of transporting, but rather [only one] because of denigrating the Shabbat, since it looks like weekday activities. And that is why he permitted it when the many need him. And in the book Aliyah Rabbah, he brought his words, but concluded, "It needs [further] study" - see there.

It is known that we have received a warning from our master Rabbi Chaim Vital, of blessed memory, in the introduction to his book, Sha'ar HaHakadmot (Gate of Introductions). He stated that these matters cannot be understood by a material, human intellect but only through direct oral tradition, or from Elijah the Prophet, of blessed memory, etc. He further cautions that one should not approach any of the kabbalistic books written after the destruction [of the Second Temple], as from the time of Rabbi Moshe ben Nachman (Nachmanides), of blessed memory, onwards, this wisdom has been hidden from the eyes of all scholars. What remains are just a few branches of introductions lacking their roots, and upon these, the later kabbalists based their words with human intellect, etc. (refer to it there). Our master, Rabbi Shalom Sharabi, of blessed memory, in his Nahar Shalom, wrote the following: 'Heaven is my witness that all my study and occupation is only with the words of the Ari, of blessed memory, and his student, Rabbi Chaim Vital, of blessed memory, alone, and apart from them, I have no business with any book from the earlier or later kabbalists. I have not even studied the words of other students of the Ari. When I encounter their words, I skip them, and therefore, I am not admonishing but reminding, for the sake of the Lord. Do not touch their words, but rather study only Etz Chaim (Tree of Life), Mevo Shearim (Gateway to Gates), and the Eight Gates, all of which are well-known as the words of the Living God.' Likewise, the genius Rabbi Chida, of blessed memory, wrote in Chaim Sha’al, part 2, page 15: 'In my humility, I do not rely on secrets not revealed by our master, the Ari, himself. Even though Rabbi Moshe Zacuto, of blessed memory, is greatly respected, still, I am a fool and do not understand, for what our great master, the Ari, who learned with Elijah the Prophet, did not reveal is like saying not to rely on it.'

However the one asking the question must think the matter out well, lest by drinking the drugs she come to an injury or illness. Don't I know that the custom in the medical schools in all the countries is, after [the physician] studies well and they give him his medical credentials, that they have him swear that he not give anything to a woman to make her abort, nor give anything to a woman to stop her menstruation, such that she no longer experience blood, since there is an assumption about all of the drugs made by physicians for [these] things, that most of them are dangerous for people? And, if so, [that is true] also with this woman. Granted, she already tried these drugs and did not encounter any danger. Nevertheless, it is possible that not all times are the same. And because of that, she should be careful and abstain on account of this concern. So she should not do anything unless she is sure that there be no concern of ailments [from it].
And I will say good advice: On the night of her immersion, she should wipe herself well after intercourse, as written above. And if sometimes, the wiping well was not effective and she got pregnant, then she can [use] these drugs. So the wiping will be effective in minimizing the [use] of the drug, such that it will then [only] be occasional. And at this time, I do not have the leisure to write at more length about this. But God, may He be blessed, should brighten our eyes with the light of His Torah. Amen, so may it be His will!
