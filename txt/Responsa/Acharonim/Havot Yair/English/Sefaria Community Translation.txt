I understand that your main question is a general one, if there is a sin of taking a life in this, to destroy the fetus after [the mother] conceived [it] and to kill and abort it, and here one can make several distinctions: If forty days have already elapsed, for before that, [the fetus] is just water, as is explained in the chapter HaMapelet and in the first chapter of Keritot; or if three months have already elapsed since her conception, which is the time it takes for the pregnancy to become discernible (Sanhedrin 69a) and the time needed to distinguish [the identity of the child's father (Yevamot 35a)]; or if she already felt the fetus's movement in her belly, which [occurs] soon after three months, and especially [if the fetus is] female. However, it is not our aim to judge from deliberation and gut feeling, but by the law of the Torah. We have learned in a mishnah in the chapter Yotze Dofen: "A one-day-old - whoever kills him is guilty [of murder]", and the Gemara [adds]: "but a fetus not", and thus may be inferred from the Mishnah at the end of the seventh chapter of Oholot. And the Gemara there gives a reason: "because the fetus dies first". And Tosafot write there on folio 44 that in both cases there is a chance that the mother might die first, and if so, the fetus inherits and bequeaths, e.g. if the mother is killed or if the child was already detached when the mother died, at any rate, whoever kills it [to save the mother] is exempt [from punishment], as [it is stated] at the end of [the chapter] Ben Sorer that "a woman who has trouble [giving birth], one cuts up the child limb by limb". However, [this] only [applies] if the mother is alive, but if she has already died, whoever kills the fetus is guilty, for it is as if it was placed inside a box [i.e. the womb]. Furthermore, the Tosafot wrote that even if we say that one may kill the fetus even though the mother has died, that is no contradiction to the fact that we desecrate Shabbat for a fetus, even if its mother has died, for we find the same with regards to a moribund person that we desecrate Shabbat and -whoever kills them is exempt. And according to the continuation of Tosafot's words it seems like there are three legal distinctions concerning a fetus, for if the mother has died, whoever kills the fetus is guilty if it was already detached; and if she is still alive, whoever kills it is exempt, but it is prohibited, because [the fetus] has been detached; which is not the case if the fetus has not been detached, [where] we can infer that it is permitted.

Question: There were two fine young men in Russia who fought with each other. In his anger, one of them drew a knife and sunk it into his fellow's heart, and he died. So the killer ran away to another country because of [the state's punishment of] rebellious acts. At first, he was aroused to repent. But when one of the rabbinic greats established the appropriate repentance, he removed the yoke [of the Torah's commandments from upon himself] and became the head of some gangsters and bands of robbers. He was then caught for theft in a large community.
And someone who was friendly with the thief for his own benefit made efforts and vouched for him. But one of the learned townspeople took cause with him and said that it is forbidden to save him from the death penalty due to the blood of his fellow Jew whom he killed. Just the opposite, if one of the relatives of the one killed were there, he could have turned him in to the government, as per the law of the blood redeemer. So how could he make efforts to save him? And even though, since this was from the Lord [alluding to Psalms 118:23], and the one making efforts was not successful, the smelter smelted to no purpose [alluding to Jeremiah 6:29], and he was hung, it nevertheless came to my mind that, had this been a question raised to a sage, what would we say and what would we speak [alluding to Genesis 44:16] about it?
