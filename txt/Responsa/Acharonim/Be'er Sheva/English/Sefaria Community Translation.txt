And we further learn the version there: Rav says, "Fish blood that one collected is prohibited." There is an objection: The blood of fish and the blood of grasshoppers are permitted, even ab initio!  That is referring to a case where he did not collect it. [Yet] with regard to bipeds, in the case where one did not collect it, is it really forbidden? But isn’t it taught [in a baraita], "If some human blood was on a loaf of bread, one scrapes it off, etc.?" Rather, when we learned that baraita, it is where there are scales in it. When Rav said it is prohibited, it was where there are no scales in. 
From this, it appears to me that it is forbidden to eat even chicken meat, and all the more so beef and lamb, with almond milk if he does not leave almonds at the edge of the bowl above, because of the bad impression (<i>maarit ayin</i>), like it is concerning the blood of fish. And so have I seen it practiced.
