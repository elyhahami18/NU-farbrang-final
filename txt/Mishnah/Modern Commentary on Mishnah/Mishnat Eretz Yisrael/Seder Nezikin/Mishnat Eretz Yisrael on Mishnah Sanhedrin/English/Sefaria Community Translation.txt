<b>One who gives of his offspring to Molekh is not liable unless he hands over [his child] to Molekh and passes [the child] through the fire:</b> In the Torah, these are two verses that were united into one negative commandment. The first is in Leviticus 18:21: <i>And you shall not let any of your seed pass through to Molekh, neither shall you profane the name of your God, I am the Lord</i>. The second is from Deuteronomy 18:10: <i>There must not be found among you anyone who makes his son or his daughter pass through the fire, or who uses divination, a soothsayer, or an enchanter, or a witch.</i> These two created a new heading for a single sin, handing over a child to Molekh and passing [him] through fire. Molekh is an ancient Phoenician god. Whether as slander or not, it is told about the people of Carthage, that they would incinerate their children — or more correctly, some of their children — to Molekh or to a different god. In contrast, there are some who think that the Carthaginians only preformed a symbolic act that resembled passing through a fire (Sanhedrin 64b), whereas actual human sacrifice happenned much less frequently. The Carthaginian rite ended with the conquest of Carthage and its destruction at the end of the third century BCE. It appears that this rite was diluted in Phoenecia, so it is not clear what its nature was there. Hence, for example, the Roman writer, Lucianus, who devotes his book, <i>Dea Syria</i>, to the gods of Tyre and Sidon in Lebanon, does not mention this rite at all. Also in this case, however, it is not clear to what extent the case before us is real, as opposed to an exaggeration fit to put down and typecast foreign rites. In any event, the sages, may their memory be blessed, understood that the two negative commandments were one.
