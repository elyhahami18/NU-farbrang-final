<b>if it has in its circumference:</b> Which is to say, what is the round measurement required to render [the beam] proper? Anything that has in its circumference three handbreadths, which requires a string of three handbreadths to encircle it around, it is known that it has a width (diameter) of one handbreadth, if you divide [it]. As so do we find with the basin that Shlomo made (II Chronicles 4:2), "ten ells from its edge to its edge and five ells of height and a line of thirty ells encircling it around." Hence for every ell in width (diameter), there are three ells in circumference.
