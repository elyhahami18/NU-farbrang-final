In our hands lies the main explanation of the verses "And it came to pass when the ark set out, etc." and "And when it rested, etc." (Numbers 10). All these verses are an independent book in themselves. It is said in Proverbs 9:1, "Wisdom has built her house; she has hewn out its seven pillars." These seven pillars are the seven books of the Torah. Indeed, they are seven, as they said that from the beginning of the book until "And it came to pass when the ark set out" is a book in itself, and "And it came to pass when the ark set out" is a book in itself, and from "And it came to pass when the ark set out" until the end of the book is a book in itself. And "And it came to pass in the wilderness" constitutes three books, and the remaining four books of the Torah make a total of seven. And they said that the Megillah (scroll) that is written on it, Rabbi Eliezer said, is considered sacred because once the numerical value of the letters is written on it, it becomes sanctified and belongs to the holy writings. Rabbi Yehuda says it is like Ben Azzai.

<b>We have already explained in the first chapter of <i>Avot</i> the issue of the Sadducees, the Boethusians, and their associates, who reject our Torah and dispute our tradition:</b><br><br>
- <b>‘Kovlim’</b>: They complain or express their grievances.<br><br>
- <b>‘Sifrei Miram (The Books of Homer)’</b>: These are books that oppose our teachings and argue against them. They are called <i>'Sifrei Miram,'</i> which means <i>'books that God will remove and erase from existence,'</i> similar to how the term <i>'tikkalah'</i> is used to describe something that is to be eradicated. This is akin to calling a place where such disputations occur <i>'a place of annihilation'</i> and refers to God's intention to eliminate them. Rabbi Yohanan's response to their scorn and ridicule is explained in the context of their contempt and mockery.<br><br>
- <b>‘Tervodot kapot (tongs of palms)’</b>: We have previously explained that the reason we say that holy writings render the hands impure is to ensure that we protect them and avoid the causes of their contamination, as mentioned at the end of <i>Zavim</i>.
