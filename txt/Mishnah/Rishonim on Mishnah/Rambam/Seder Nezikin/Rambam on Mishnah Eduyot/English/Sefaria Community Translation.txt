Rambam on Mishnah Eduyot



Chapter 1



Mishnah 1



Mishnah 2



Mishnah 3

Shemaya and Avtalion were the masters of Shamai and Hillel, as described in Mishna Avot. They were converts, and the accents of idol-worshippers stayed in their speech, so that they would say <i>'in'</i> rather than <i>'hin'</i>. Hillel would repeat exactly what he heard from them, so that he would also say "a complete <i>'in'</i>", as he was taught. This is what our rabbis taught, that one is obligated to transmit traditions in the language of the master. There are those who have a different explanation, and say that it says <i>'hen'</i> rather than <i>'hin'</i>. But the first explanation is the one I learned from my father, may his memory be a blessing, and he learned it from his teacher, and his teacher from his teacher. And the <i>hin</i> is equivalent to three <i>kab</i>, which is half a <i>se'ah</i>, and a <i>log</i> is quarter of a <i>kab</i>. And we have explained these measurements in the commentary to the tractate of Pe'ah.
