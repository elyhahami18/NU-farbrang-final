Chapter 2



Chapter 3


How do they bring up the first-fruits? All the cities in the region (ma’amad) gather together to the main city of the region and sleep overnight on the streets of the city rather than going into the houses. They rise early in the morning and the appointed supervisor says “Rise! Let us go up to Zion, to the Lord, our God.” (Jeremiah 31:5)
