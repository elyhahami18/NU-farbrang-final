Introduction





























































<b>And the eleventh generation:</b> Its leader [<i>nassi</i>] was Rabban Gamliel II, the son of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, whom Titus had killed, as mentioned. And his sister's husband was Rabbi Eliezer ben Hyrkanos, who was called Rabbi Eliezer the Great. And from among the sages of his generation were Rabbi Yehoshua ben Chananiah, Rabbi Yose the Priest, Rabbi Shimon ben Netanel, Rabbi Elazar ben Arakh, Onkelos the Proselyte, Rabbi Yochanan ben Nuri, Rabbi Yose ben Baroka, Shmuel the Little, Rabbi Elazar ben Chasma, Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah, Rabbi Chalafta, Rabbi Yose ben Kisma, and Rabbi Tarfon. This Rabban Gamliel, the leader, who was the one that disagreed with Rabbi Yehoshua about the testimony for the new month, about the evening prayers, and about the other things mentioned in the Talmud (Berakhot 28a), so that the sages removed him from the leadership and appointed Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah in his place. As [the latter] was wealthy, wise, and the tenth [generation] from Ezra. And afterward, they both held the leadership as mentioned in Tractate Berakhot (28a) [in] the chapter [entitled] Tefillat Hashakhar. And in his days [lived] Rabbi Akiva, who was a student of R. Eliezer and R. Yehoshua and a righteous convert. And his colleagues were Shimon ben Azai, Shimon ben Zoma, Elisha the Other, as well as Rabbi Tarfon. Also, Rabbi Yishmael, Rabbi Yehudah ben Bava, Rabbi Yehudah ben Teima, who was called ben Dama, Rabbi Haninah ben Teradyon, Rabbi Yeshevav the Scribe, Rabbi Simai, and Rabbi Chutzpit the Translator. And Ben Koziba [lived] during the days of R. Akiva. And it was [also] in his days that Beitar was destroyed. It was then that he and the other martyrs of the [Roman] Empire were killed. And it was [also] during his time that Ptolemy composed the book Almagest about astronomy.
