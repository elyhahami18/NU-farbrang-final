And Rabbi Ephraim commented that he saw in the Yerushalmi that it said about Rabbi Yehoshua ben Chananiah, "happy is the one who gave birth to him," because she would bring him to synagogues in order that his ears should be attached to [the sound of] the Torah.

He wanted to lift up the hearts of the people in their service of God, in Torah and in <i>mitzvot</i>, that they not be like the fool, in whose eyes the wisdom is too lofty and grandiose, who would say that the Torah is <i>longer than the measure of the earth</i> (Job 11:9) and so too, the <i>mitzvot</i>, their details and particulars <i>grew as they grew</i> (Zechariah 10:8), and who can possibly keep them all?! Therefore, the <i>tanna</i> expressed to us that God, who sanctified us with Their commandments and commanded us, Their commandments are not like the commandments of a flesh-and-blood king, who gives an order to his servant to do such and such a labor, and if the servant does not finish all of it, they will be punished for not fulfilling the commandment of the king—God is not like that, because when God inreased Torah and commandments for Israel, God's intention was not to tell them to complete it and learn all of the Torah and fulfill all the commandments, and if not, they would be punished even though they fulfilled some or most of them. In that case, the increasing of Torah and <i>mitzvot</i> would be fundamentally a reason to be punished for them. That is not how it is, because "It is not on you to finish the work"(Pirkei Avot 2:16), and one who does more is like one who does less, as long as one directs one's heart to heaven, like the case of the one who their whole life read nothing but tractate Chagigah [see Menorat HaMaor, v; On Fixed Hours of Study, Death of the Righteous 14]. Thus, the increasing is not a reason for punishment, on the contrary, the opposite, because God wanted to give merit to Israel to those who are not able to fulfill all of them, because of the attainments of their learning and the mitzvot they do fulfill, their reward will grow without bound, <i>no eye has seen</i> (Isaiah 64:3), that is why God multiplied Torah and <i>mitzvot</i> for them.
