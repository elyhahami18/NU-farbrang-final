Tosafot Yom Tov on Mishnah Pesachim

Mishnah Pesachim, Introduction







Chapter 1



Mishnah 1

The night of the 14th of Nisan - the Rav Bartenura wrote that the Hebrew word 'ohr' chosen here to begin the Mishna of Pesachim is a pleasant, euphemistic word that means night or darkness. Rambam wrote that this was done so that Pesachim would not begin with an absence, darkness being the absence of light. HaRav Zerachiya haLevi and the Ran wrote that this was done based on the verse in Tehillim 119:39, "The beginning of your word gives light."
